0.0	Some people love coconut water.  After choking down one of these, I knew I was not one of them.  I would describe the flavor as sweet sweat.  Of course, I have never drank a cup of sweat with sugar but imagine the taste would not be too far off from this product.  Kind of salty, kind of sweet yet totally gross.So, so glad I tried a single first!  Gag-o-rama.
0.0	Save your money. Zico Pure Coconut Water is a nasty tasting drink. You don't have to forfeit flavor for nutrition. If you can stomach this stuff my hat is off to you. I would rather drink Gatorade, Vitamin Water, Propel and other sport/replenishing drinks that offer electrolytes AND a palatable flavor.This gross drink does not offer anything more then other healthful drinks.  It smells bad too.
0.0	Ok I agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste.  However if one chills the coconut water and adds FRESH I repeat FRESH lime juice to it the taste is fantastic.I consider this essential to natural hydration without chemicals, colors etc.Update:O.N.E. is definitely better tasting, we switched.
0.0	Earlier I had tried VitaCoco, I thought that was bad, Zico beat it to the bottom. It was worse than vita coco. If it was not for Amazon's great customer service I would have not even tried ordering Zico after my vita coco experience. I grew up drinking coconut water in our country (India) where we drink it out of coconut, I know I cannot expect the same. In fact even there depending on how old the coconut, you can taste the difference in the water but none of the packaged brands.I don't know how come Zico is having better rating than VitaCoco, which is why I ordered in first place. I always rely on Amazon customer reviews, which gives me the confidence to buy that product, in this case it failed.May be people are comparing to sports drink while reviewing rather than coconut water, or they do not have any fresh coconut water experience.I am still waiting for a good one.Five star rating for  Amazon Customer service....thank you Amazon.Ref:Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1- Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)
0.0	I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see "premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors."I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?
0.0	I loved the old Zico water in the square containers and couldn't wait for Amazon to get this in. I got the two cases I ordered today and it tastes terrible! It actually tastes like plastic or some sort of chemical/pesticide. Even after chilling it and pouring into a glass it is still not drinkable. Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead. It was my second favorite until now and I will never buy another bottle of ZICO.Who cares if you can recycle the bottle if the product is not fit to drink? What a waste of $60!
0.0	The new price is very attractive. However, it tastes horrible. Maybe if you haven't had the old Zico, or any other of the coconut water brands you might find it acceptable.
0.0	I was sooo initially excited about pre-ordering on amazon.com before it was available.  Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came, and boy am I ssooooooo DISAPPOINTED.  Smells funny, tastes salty.  Not same formulation.  Zico should have disclosed new formulation.  Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.  That brand was very comparable to the old Zico.I was a ZICO fan, but this new formulation just is grossly disappointing.
0.0	I've spent at least a hundred bucks on the old Zico boxes.  Those were metal lined, the juice was not from concentrate.  I just got a shipment of the new bottles, took a swig and almost spit it out.  Tastes like plastic.  I gave it a few more swigs, and now my stomach hurts.I immediately logged into Amazon so I could warn others not to buy this crap.  I'm closing the bottle, putting it back in the box and sending it all back to Amazon.  I will never buy Zico again.  YUCK!
0.0	I've tried a lot of brands of coconut water, and have found that I like Zico pure coconut water the best. It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long. I would advise anybody who enjoys the 11oz box to stick with that and stay away from this joke of a product. Nasty.
0.0	The Zico coconut juice in the old tetrapak was great the new in the bottle is the worst I ever had.Just poured 12 bottles down the toilet.
0.0	The old Zico was delightful.  This new version is so aweful as to be totally undrinkable.  I am now watering my plants with it.  How did they manage to ruin a parfeclty good product. Is Zico now owned by Pepsico?
0.0	Zico used to be my coconut water of choice. When I first saw the new packaging I was excited that it would be easier to close and store. I was shocked when I tasted it - it is NOT the same product! The taste really turned me off. I've since switched to O.N.E. coconut water.I also determined that the new bottle size is too big of a serving. I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting.
0.0	I used to LOVE the ZICO Coconut Water.I used to buy 2 boxes monthly.Until they decided to change from the Tetra-Pack to the Platic Bottles.For some reason, ZICO thinks its a better product, unfortunatly, the plastic leaches to the Coconut Water and changes the taste. It literally taste like plastic.I stopped buying ZICO and went over to O.N.E., not as tasty as the Tetra-Pack ZICO, but atleast doesnt taste like plastic!!!KEEP AWAY FROM ZICO, until they change it back to Tetra-Pack!Aparently i found out after some dabling online. Its not 100% coconut water, they changed the process where they make the coconut water out of CONCENTRATE.....honestly...concentrate??? No i am pissed off.....
0.0	I liked the idea of an unsweetened drink like this, but the taste is off, and the "texture" is creepy.
0.0	I bought this new Zico water hoping to have the good taste it had before but unfortunately it tastes horrible. I could not bear drinking half bottle. Very funky taste. I am from Brazil and I sure know what young coconut water tastes like...and what they did to the taste of it is nowhere close to real coconut water. Perhaps works for those who like aged coconut water.I wish I could return my order. Never buying it again. Back to O.N.E.
0.0	Although Zico may claim to be natural, I disagree since it is made from concentrate. I prefer to drink Vita Coco, which is a much more flavorful brand of coconut water and is actually 100% NATURAL!
0.0	Heloooo people do you read the ingredients?  Zico is made from concentrate!!! I drink Vitacoco because it has one ingredient NATURAL COCONUT WATER.  Zico is a no-go....
0.0	Was so excited when I saw Zico had 14 oz containers of coconut water. This is not the original formulation. It is disgusting. It is like it has been boiled down into a concentrate and then water added. It tastes terrible & odd and has WAY too much packaging than the original style. Not thirst quenching at all.... makes me nauseous. Buy the brand "One".Stay away from this product. Total waste of money.
0.0	Ick! This stuff is disgusting...why anyone would subject themselves to "Nature's Sports Drink" is beyond me! If you're looking for coconut water at least choose the brand without all the added ingredients!
0.0	Don't get me wrong, I REALLY wanted to love this as I had read so many great things about coconut water.  I was so excited when my order came.  I had some already in the fridge so it was cold.  After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water.  I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was.  I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck!
0.0203567	Coca Cola now partially owns Zico. So, now it's made from concentrate, has added "natural flavors" and is packaged in plastic. How to ruin nature's perfect drink for profit. This was my favorite, now I will not buy this "new formula" again...Looking to find another like Zico used to be. Don't know yet if the Zico tetra pak is still the "old formula"..also..rumor has it that Pepsi is looking to buy Vita Coco..so will be keeping my eye on this, too
0.0203567	Zico is HORRIBLE NOW! COKE DESTROYED IT! From pure coconut water from trusted suppliers to Plastic bottles and from some nasty concentrate.  Buy ONE or Vita coco or any other brand of natural coconut water. Not some dried up goop, packaged, processed and re -constitued with tap water.  DAMN YOU ZIIIIICOOOOOOO!
0.0203567	If you like fresh coconut milk I would highly recommend you do not purchase this product. It is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product.
0.0203567	I really like Zico in the tetra pak. When I tried the bottled formula, I didn't realize that the formula was any different...I just thought it was a new bottle. My reaction to every sip was that it tasted and smelled very plastic-y. It seemed that sitting in the plastic bottle was imparting a plastic flavor to the drink. I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back! I then did a little research and realize that this is the new flavor of this formula using a new variety of coconut and from concentrate. I really don't like this new flavor at all. I will not be buying this product in the bottle again.
0.0203567	Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.Natural coconut water is better than concentrate.
0.0203567	I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container.  Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled.  This will be my last box of ever of Zico.  I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco.
0.0203567	I was quite excited to try the 14 ounce bottle of Zico coconut water and much to my dismay when it finally came and I got a chance to try it I was royally disappointed. The coconut water has a plastic bottle aftertaste and it is quite unpleasant. I had one and will never drink another... too bad I bought 2 twelve packs. Get your water in those aseptic containers, NOT PLASTIC!!!
0.0203567	This product was great in the TetraPak.  Now it is absolutely horrible.  The worst tasting coconut water compared One, Naked, and VitaCoco.  It tastes like plastic and nothing like coconut water.  This product in the plastic container is from concentrate.
0.0203567	I have a bout of gastritis and learned that coconut water is the natural way to help relieve those issues while fasting. I tried it and it worked great but I tried two different brands, Zico and Vita Coco. I loved Vita Coco and hated Zico -  the more I drank it the more I hated it...will not buy again!
0.0203567	How do you kill a good product ?Well, bring Coke and they know how to take nature's pure coconut water, add a bunch of flavors, destroy the taste and package them in genuine plastic.Sorry, I will go for another product..
0.0203567	This doesn't taste anything like the old Tetra pack ZICO. It's now made from concentrate, which is not displayed prominently in Amazon description. DON'T BUY THIS NEW ZECO.
0.0203567	I was excited to find ZICO on auto delivery, but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe.  I ordered 2 boxes and they had a plastic after taste.  I thought maybe it was just this batch...so I waited for my next order. Same thing taste like plastic and made from concentrate.  It use to be so good!Cancelled my subscription today!
0.0203567	frankly i don't care about the packaging, (some folks are up in arms about the new plastic bottles rather than the old tetra packs) but zico--which used to be my favorite coco water--no longer tastes as good as it once did. then i read that it's now FROM CONCENTRATE rather than being what it once was, and i don't see any reason to purchase it any longer. very disappointed.
0.0203567	Okay, this is an update because I just got 2 more boxes in a few days ago...As you can see it went from 5 stars to 1! If I can give it 0 stars I would...Your wondering why such a dramatic change, Well let me tell you. The box I got from Amazon was sitting under the sun way to long or something, because the date said it's good until July 2011. But the whole box was spoiled!!! I drank the first one, and it tasted a little funny, a little sour in my honest opinion. I thought maybe it's just this one. So I threw it away, and drank another. It tasted ok, a bit better, but still something was off.So the next day, I tried a few more, (as I tend to drink about 4 a day) And ONE of them... I swear to god, I almost threw up right then and there... I tried puking it out because it was SOOO RANCID and bad... So end result. I AM throwing away the whole box. I will never order Zico coconut water again. In fact I just canceled my subscription right now. Go with Vita Coco instead please.Bad news is that Amazon will not take Grocery items back for return... So gross...I just got my box of Zico and Naked coconut waters today. Mind you, I never tried out Zico before, but I did try out Naked and Vita coco as well.I was very happy with the taste of Zico coconut water compared to Naked's version. I love coconut water, and drink it fresh right out of the shell from tropical islands when I travel. Zico comes the closest to the taste of fresh coconuts. While Naked's had a strange aftertaste to it.If you are a first time buyer for any kinds of coconut water because of the recent health hype about them, I must remind you that the taste of coconut water is an acquired taste... My sister tasted it for the first time and hated it just now.But let me tell you, If I was rich enough to just drink Zico coconut water instead of regular mineral water everyday, I would. But it would cost me around $2,500 a year for the luxury LoL :) (Just did the math of drinking 5 a day)
0.0203567	I was at the corporate challenge in NYC and they gave this "coconut water" away for free. It came in a plastic bottle and was easy to carry so I took a bunch. I drank one and had to throw all the rest out. This stuff is really disgusting. It ruins the rep for coconut water.
0.0203567	I used to order the original Zico sold in Tetrapaks, before they introduced the plastic bottle version.  It was great... very refreshing and not too sweet.  The new re-introduced Zico in the Tetrapaks tastes nothing like the previous version.  It has a somewhat strong syrupy sweet/sour taste that leaves a weird residue on your tongue. I came back to this product thinking that it would be the same as before they messed with it, but I think I'm done with Zico.  I was getting shipments of O.N.E. (which is wonderful), but sadly they have been out of stock.  I guess I will have to wait for them to restock again...
0.0203567	This came in rotten. I was very exited to try it out. Before I opened the package, it looked like something contaminated was inside, I could tell from the grey part where you drink from. I opened about 3 of them, all of them looked rotten. Now I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the company and say that it might have spoiled during transit due to heat or something but if there is a slight chance that could happen, I'm not personally sure it can happen, then they ought to put labels on it and advise the tracker to ship differently. If I were to drink it instead of inspect it, I would not be very happy!
0.0203567	Plug your nose and chug.  This stuff is disgusting.  Had to pour it into a glass and drink it all at once because once you taste this stuff, you won't be able to take another gulp until you forget about it the next day.  Get the coconut water by Naked Juice.  Way better.
0.0203567	I had thought my experience was my poor luck, but it matches the last group of reviewers. 1 box was trashed, with 1 of the 12 containers exploded. It stunk like rotten bananas. I tasted a couple so far, and they taste a bit sour. I tried the 2nd box, and the first one was "RANCID" like the previous reviewer said. I've tried zico before in the stores, and they do not taste like this.I've O.N.E. coco water, and it's like night and day in terms of taste and quality.
0.0203567	My first order arrived in a box that smelled somewhat like mold. The containers inside did not but the odor of the box - from Brazil, packed in Brazil - did remind me of humid tropical locations where it is difficul to keep things from mold ... I will NOT buy it again. I would not even give it a "one star" if possible. If bought in a local store I would have taken it back - but it is a hassle by mail.  The flavor of the juice is bland and does not encourage me to buy more. I may try another brand though. And probably NOT packed in the tropics.  VM
0.009934281	This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.First off, this is "from concentrate". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.Second, they add "natural flavors". There is nothing "natural" about a "natural flavor". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it "natural".
0.009934281	I loved zico coconut water before it was bought out. I wanted to stick with the natural products and didn't want to buy the items in the plastic containers. So when Zico started to sell the water in the cardboard boxes again, I thought "all right, back in business". I agree with the most recent reviews that this product was awful. A couple were rancid and had to be dumped down the drain. The outer shipping box was damp. I hated the taste of the rest because even though drinkable, they tasted spoiled. I'm looking for another coconut water and I'm not sure what to do because the ONE is no longer being sold and Vita is almost as bad as the last box of ZIco I ordered.
0.009934281	I've been looking for an all-natural coconut water without additives and have tried several brands. I grew up drinking the products from Thailand and liked it, but was told that sugar had been added. I've also had coconut water from the fruit itself on the beaches of Thailand and those are wonderful.This product doesn't taste like anything I've tried, it's awful. I hope it has some type of nutritional value, cause I'm going to have a hard time drinking it otherwise.
0.009934281	I haven't had a lot of experience with zico, but I have seen lot of reviews saying that they switched to concentrate. With little research, I found that the one in the 11.2 ounce carton thing is not from concentrate. Sure, I can agree based on sheer numbers that this coconut water sucks, but the other one does exist in case some of you still care.
0.009934281	I love the convenience of a bottle but the content tastes like plastic.  It might do more harm than good if the bottle has BPA in it.
0.009934281	I am from Jamaica, and I had coconuts straight from the trees and this does not taste natural at all, as a matter of fact this is the worst tasting coconut water I have ever tasted.  I was very disappointed, Zico does not come close. I have to give VITA COCO FIVE STAR and this None.
0.009934281	The first time I had Zico was in a plastic container it was FANTASTIC!!! When I saw that Amazon was offering the same drink in a TetraPak I had to get it. I received the package and tried one and was TOTALLY SHOCKED!!! This was AWFUL!!! It did not taste like anything I had the first time. At first I thought maybe the product expired but the date printed was JUL 2011. I tried another box and it was the SAME THING!!! The drink in the box tasted SOUR!!! MADE ME UPSET!!!Maybe I got a bad batch but that's NO EXCUSE. STAY WITH THE Plastic Container 5 Stars all the way.
0.009934281	This stuff is terrible. It has that concentrated and plasticky taste as if it's not fresh.
0.009934281	I don't like Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water. It tasted very bland and has a little sour taste to it. It tasted nothing like young sweet green coconut juice. I want to return it to Amazon for a refund.
0.009934281	This is the most disgusting drink I have ever tried!  Don't buy unless you know what it is!
0.009934281	I somehow managed to drink one bottle (it was hot, I was  desperate).  It really tastes bad.  I have all the rest sitting in my cabinet, never to be sipped by me.  When I am dead, I'm sure they will be thrown away.  I know, what do I mean by "bad."  Well, I almost felt like I would get sick if I drank a whole bottle straight.  Maybe it is good for you, but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it.
0.009934281	I couldn't take two sips of this. Tastes like chewing on a plastic bag. I used to LOVE Zico in Tetrapak - what happened?? Now I have a case of this and don't know what to do with it!
0.009934281	I was fooled into getting this as BJ's because it was cheaper then the boxes, and there is a reason! It's not pure and it tastes like crap. It has a lot less Potassium in the 14 ounce bottom (569) compared to 700+ in the boxes that are 3 ounces smaller! Stick with the boxes, trust me!
0.009934281	My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via "subscribe and save" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the "from concentrate" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying "top dollar" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the "liquid" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our "subscribe and save" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will "subscribe and save" to another brand that uses the real stuff!
0.009934281	I had heard so much about this drink.  I really wanted to like it.  I was imagining it would be like the coconut waters I had tried from Thailand and the Philippines.It's like drinking cold vomit, there is no other way to describe it.  Really gross stuff, stay far far away.
0.009934281	While the plastic packaging seemed oh-so-convenient for me, when I opened the first bottle and took a sip- YUCK. Plastic is all I taste. Then I noticed that it was also from concentrate!? What!? Way to ruin your product Zico. Wish I'd read these reviews first.
0.009934281	this stuff is from concentrate and tastes awful. labeling it "pure" or "natural" is misleading. i dont think they should be able to sell this stuff. or at least should have to make it clear what it really is.
0.009934281	I am shocked that anyone would pay a whopping 2.50 a bottle for this stuff.  It tastes horrible and I cannot imagine ever reaching for it to rehydrate myself for any reason.  I know the benefits of coconut water but there must be one that tastes better than this!
0.009934281	I've ordered Zico Mango Coconut Water three times from Amazon. The first two times, the dozen I received were fine. This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a "slightly imperfect" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution.
0.009934281	I bought this item loving the way it tasted in the 11.2 ounce packages but opting for more drink for your buck I went ahead and order a case of the 14 ounce plastic bottle zico. Bad Idea after my first taste I was unhappy the coconut water tasted like the plastic bottle. If you buy this product definately opt for the tetra packed 11.2 ounce product.
0.005047239	I didn't order this.  Last time I did order Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water was in Oct. 2010.  Kind of heavy to return.  How can I prevent this happen again?
0.005047239	Bought this item at Safeway store in Santa Clara, CA 1 week ago and has been sitting in the refrigerator since then. Opened the container today and found black rotting algae coming out of the container in form of lumps along with the liquid which was bad tasting and unusually brown. Wish I could take it back to the store but I guess it wont help! Please stay away from this trash!!
0.005047239	I've been buying ZICO with mango in 11.2 oz. tetra-paks almost since they started offering them here on Amazon.  However, just as another reviewer explained, the most recent batch I received was horrible, it went from being the best coconut water to the worst I've ever had.  The packaging was slightly different and most alarming, the individual box no longer says anything about being from Brazil.  If this continues I will never buy this product again.  If you are having the same experience, please speak up on here so maybe we can get this fixed......
0.005047239	I have been buying Zico's mango flavored coconut water for several months now but last 2 packs I received did not taste the same. It tasted as if it had gone bad/expired/etc. Normally this is a great product but after receiving two bad batches, I won't be buying Zico anymore.
0.005047239	I love the Zico coconut water in the little Tetra Pak boxes. It's my favorite drink. I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth.
0.005047239	Zico has changed this product so that it no longer tastes like coconut water.  When the company used Brazilian coconuts it was an entirely different tasty product from what it is now with coconuts from Thailand.
0.005047239	I grew up with fresh coconuts.  I also grew up with canned coconut juice (sweetened), frozen coconut juice, and recently bought some Naked coconut water from the supermarket, so I'm familiar with how coconut water should taste.It's hard to get fresh coconut where I am now so I thought I'd give Zico a try since it was the cheapest available on Amazon.  Big mistake!  I should've listened to the recent negative reviews posted here.The first pack of Zico was sour.  I took a sip and made a face.  Crap, I thought, I got a bad one.  I then opened another pack and that too was sour.  I have never tried Zico before and I hope that this isn't what it's SUPPOSED to taste like because it tastes nothing like coconut water.  If I had been blindfolded and somebody handed me this drink, I would never be able to guess it was supposed to be coconut water.  Packaged coconut water is supposed to taste similar to the juice you get in fresh coconut, right?I understand that it's not going to taste just like fresh coconuts but there should be a marked resemblance, as there was with the Naked brand I tried.  But the Zico I tried tasted NOTHING like coconut.  It MIGHT taste like the water that comes from a totally unripe coconut (never having had an unripe coconut, I can't say), or it could be the taste of coconut water gone rancid.  Whatever the reason, the taste is totally wrong and I am pissed because I've now got a 12-pack that's too disgusting to drink and isn't eligible for a refund through Amazon.UPDATE: Grocery items are not returnable, per Amazon policies (NOW they tell me).  However, I contacted Amazon to explain the situation to them and they generously offered to issue me a full refund.  Excellent customer service by Amazon--though the Zico still stinks!
0.005047239	We purchased a case of this so-called "natural" coconut water, took one sip, poured the remainder of that first bottle down the drain and returned the case for a refund. It tasted that bad.This stuff is not legitimate coconut water ... it's made from concentrate and has added flavors.Definately not recommended.
0.005047239	for some reason, Zico seems to be the worst of the lot when it comes to coconut waters.  Having come from a real coconut water drinking country (I mean coconuts off the trees), I know the difference in taste and Zico most definitely tastes like it is made of concentrate/extracts as opposed to being the real water!  The only thing they have going for them are the number of celebrities they've managed to get hooked onto them!
0.005047239	It's my first tme purchasing this brand of coconut water, but I have to give it a buyer beware rating.  Myself and another family member both tried this water on multipule (ie. more than 3 occasions) and have had stomach pains immediately after drinking it.  I suspect that this bactch may have been tainted or bad.  I plan on throwing the rest out.
0.005047239	I got hooked on coconut water while traveling in the Philippines. Since then I've been trying to find a packaged product that tastes like the real deal. There are a few decent brands out there. This particular product, however, is made from concentrate and tastes just like the plastic it is packed in. I didn't even finish the bottle.
0.005047239	I love coconut water. To be more specific, I love GOOD coconut water. My preferred brand after trying just about every one on the market is the Taste Nirvana which is smooth, only slightly sweet and very refreshing. The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50% sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh. Goya runs a close second. I am not sure if it's the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me. Coconut water should not taste sour. Despite the rave reviews, I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya. Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first.
0.005047239	I have tried four different brnads of pure coconut water(not from concentrate or flavored). Out of the four I tried I think VitaCoco has the best fresh tasting flavour. After VitaCoco I liked the 'REAL' coconut water. I found Zico to be the worst tasting coconut water(it has a metallic after taste to it even when you drink it cold with ice). I will never buy Zico again. Going back to VitaCoco brand now. I see a lot of good reviews on Zico so I believe that it must be something wrong with the packing ? now that its soo hot in the North-east maybe something happened but I havent had this experience with other brands. All the best to anyone who is willing to try this brand.
0.005047239	I usually don't write reviews, but this coconut water was nowhere near the quality of their normal product.  I would not drink these if they were free.  Very disappointing.
0.005047239	This thing tastes like it has fermented and it was left a little bit longer it would turn into a local wine. I am surprised people who already used this product recommended this product with good things to say about the taste. Believe me if I were to choose between this one and a bitter Melon, I would go for the later one. We had guests over the day we received this product and offered it to them. They were like what the hell is this. One sip and one of them was ready to vomit. I am just wondering now if I should even look at amazon reviews because this is a second instance where i was disappointed by trusting the reviews. I would guess it was the problem with the batch i received or something had changed in this product to not to match the review I read here.
0.005047239	So I love coconut water and I've tried this brand before. I bought it from safeway and was very satisfied with the flavor. Well I ordered this online and I gatta say I was VERY disappointed! 7 of the 12 boxes were rancid! I immediately canceled my subscription and sent a very angry email to the Zico company! it's too bad I cant send these spoiled ones back.. I mean really 7/12?? One or two I understand but this is unacceptable!
0.005047239	This drink taste nothing like coconut water. This disgusting and i don't know how anybody can drink this crap. I wasted $2.50 on this drink that tasted like boiled water with a hint of nasty coconut.
0.005047239	I never write reviews. This is my first out of 900+ unique products bought from Amazon. I average about 1 to 2 packages a day of various products bought from amazon.  THIS PRODUCT IS A COMPLETE FAILURE! I bought 3 cases and all 3 were RANCID/SPOILED!  It literally tastes like VOMIT!  Avoid this product, Quality Assurance is a major issue. VITACOCO is better in terms of quality (VITACOCO also adds a little extra vitamin C to avoid some spoliage while shipping).  I will NEVER BUY ZICO again, that is for certain!  I hope this helps others avoid the poorest excuse for any type of quality coconut water.
0.005047239	I agree with the other most recent reviews. It has a distinct rancid flavor which doesn't appeal to the taste buds at all! Not in line with what my wife and I expect from coconut water. Needs to taste much better. We called Amazon tonight and were told that the manufacturer has stated the products aren't rancid. Probably not, but clearly there's a taste issue they need to address if so many people are complaining.
0.005047239	Bought the 12 pack thinking it is a great deal. The taste is VERY VERY BAD and BITTER. I don't know what to do with the remaining 11. There is no easy method to return such grocery items on Amazon. Bought other brand from Whole Foods and tasted delicious.
0.0230739	Bought a 12 pack recently, once I open the pack it reeks of plastic, can't even take it near my mouth to drink.Had used Vitacoco from local grocery stores and they taste like fresh coconut water. Definitely this stuff is not natural.
0.0230739	This was the worst coconut water I have ever tasted. I unfortunately bought a 12 pack, which I couldn't get through the first two sips of, because of the lower price. Tasted heavy and rancid with a terrible after taste. Buy Vita instead, it's so much better.
0.0230739	This tastes like plastic. And coconut water from "concentrate" and "natural flavors" is not coconut water. I'll just go back to buying mine at the grocery store that has pulp in it, and comes in a glass bottle.
0.0230739	This is the worst coconut water that we have ever tried. It tastes like the  coconut tree root and stem soaked water. I will newer recommend this not even once.
0.0230739	After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.
0.0230739	I luv Coconut water and have been drinking coconut water real fresh. My definition of FRESH here is within 60 seconds after the coconut is plucked from the tree.I do not expect anything close with any of the packaged 'FRESH' coconut water..But, this one from Zico is real crap..Its just like sweetened water with a drizzle of vinegar. Vita Coco is much much better.
0.0230739	This is my third case of Zico in the last 6 months or so and it tastes completely different then the other two I've purchased.  The water has a strange smell and an awful taste.  The previous two cases I ordered (before the plastic bottles came out) tasted great.  I thought that just one of the drinks may have been bad but the entire case is the same; straight up nasty.  I won't be ordering any more of this.
0.0230739	I bought the 12 pack from amazon and the pack I received was spoiled and rancid. In Zico's defense though, I have purchased Zico from local stores and it is actually good, sweet and tasty. I probably got a bad batch or the case could have been spoiled during delivery. (I do live in TX, so maybe the heat played a factor) Amazon gave me a refund.
0.0230739	I ordered this about a month or so ago, and out of the 12 packs, two of them were spoiled.  I even accidentally swallowed a sip, yuck!  They smelled pretty bad with a fairly dark color (compare to the normal ones).The other 10 packs were fine, except some of them were sour.
0.0230739	I grew up in the Caribbeans and I love drinking coconut water.  I missed it after moving to the states. But one day a year ago I saw a box of  Vita Coco for sale at Costco and I bought it and enjoyed it, but I had to stop buying it because they got expensive.  Today at Costco I saw Zico coconut water and I bought it because I was craving coconut water.  Got home and took a taste and all I can say is WTF.  I am not kidding, this drink taste like dish water.  There is zero taste of coconut water in this product. It doesn't taste like coconut water from any continent I am familiar with.  To give you an idea of how bad this is, I gave it to my 2 year old son who will drink anything and he took on sip and pushed my hand away.  I gave some to my 6 year old daughter and she (no joke) went straight to the trash and spit it out and asked me what in the world I just gave her.Someone who has never had coconut water may think this is the greatest thing ever, but trust me this product is not fit for dogs.  Zico should be ashamed of themselves.  If you taste this product and thinks it's a great taste, I don't know what to say other than your taste buds have magic power to turn crap into gold. You should be studied to find out your tongue's secret.In other word, DON'T BUY THIS, unless you like throwing money out.  I am grateful I got mine from Costco because I am returning this abomination back ASAP.
0.0230739	I've been ordering Zico for over 3 years.  I participate in the Subscribe and Save so I receive 1-2 boxes every month.  I am so disappointed in my last 4 shipments.  Every time Zico tastes spoiled.  What is going on?  I keep thinking it may just be that particular shipment, but I feel like it is the product.  I'm going to have to find a new coconut water because I can barely tolerate the taste anymore.
0.0230739	I'm not entirely sure whether to blame Zico or the store where I bought it -- a Trader Joe's in Westfield, NJ -- but this tastes foul! It tastes like funky dishwater. I'm having trouble getting the taste out of my mouth and enjoying the rest of my lunch. I've had coconut water before and taking a sip of this was a really, really awful surprise. I wish I had bought one of the "good" cartons.
0.0230739	It really tasted good and I subscribed for it (pack of 12 per month). I then upgraded the subscription to 2 units per month recently. Both the units that arrived after I made changes to the subscription were completely spoiled and left a bitter taste in the mouth. I am cancelling the subscription with immediate effect.
0.0230739	I decided to order these instead of my normal Vita Coco or O.N.E. because of a S&S;  special.  It was nothing short of disgusting with a horrible after taste.  Beware.  I contacted at Amazon regarding my sincere displeasure after ordering 2 cases and they would not take it back, but nicely offered a refund.Stay away from this and go with Vita Coco or O.N.E.
0.0230739	The contents just taste like plastic. Not even a little bit of coconut taste. Just plastic. Luckily for me, unlike some reviewers, I only bought 3 bottles. I got through the first one by chugging it, because I hate being wasteful. I left the second and third in the refrigerator at work until someone stole them. I'm sure they regret it.
0.0230739	I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is "supposedly" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.
0.0230739	First, I agree with the other reviewers about the "off" flavor and I am confused about why they decided to add "natural flavors" to coconut water that already tastes great by itself.  We are big fans of coconut water and have replaced all other drinks with it at family and other social gatherings.  But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type 
0.0230739	We bought two packs of Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water Natural, 11.2 Ounce Tetra Paks, when significantly discounted, and found both packs to have a weird taste completely unlike the sweet normal coconut water taste. Be wary of this product.
0.0230739	I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water, having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst.
0.0230739	Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting "it" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on "coconut water laxative" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you "run", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p
0.01385815	Hello friends.SO in frustration I tried a new-for-me brand, Zico PURE PREMIUM (haha) i guess it's called, could not however determine the source of the drink, unlike the Vita brand these particular containers made no mention of the actual source of the water.Hum.In the local description the claim is "Brazilian coconuts" but they dont stand behind it as others do and print "Produced in xxxxxx" on the tetra pak.Of course you know what I think-- where *I* think this sewer water came from.Let me give you a hint: probably not mainland Asia, nor South or Central America.Darn it, dont they grow coconut trees in southern USA or Mexico?Where do they send that water, north to Canada and west to Japan!!!(along with nearly all the best sushi)WTF
0.01385815	After reading all of the reviews on this product I decided to give it a chance and I was so disappointed.  Everyone said that the taste is the best out of any other brand that they have tried, and I'm scared to know what those taste like because this product tastes HORRIBLE.  It honestly tastes like spoiled milk and chalk.  I'm am extremely disappointed.  Don't waster your money, unless you plan on plugging you nose to drink this stuff.
0.01385815	I have purchased Zico and Vita-Coco multiple times from Amazon. I love Coconut Water and specially this 100% pure ones. But lately I have realized quality of Zico brand is not as good as it was before. I have had at least 100-110 individual packs so far but now I am feeling like watery taste (Am I saying they add water? ;) ) than coconut water.The only change I noticed, it was made it Brazil before and now its somewhere else ..My suggestion, stay away from Zico brand for now.
0.01385815	Must admit the taste of O.N.E. coconut water is better.  Took a long time to get through the supply of coconut water.
0.01385815	I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle, though the best before date was way in the future. But my god. This is honestly the worst drink I have ever tasted, hands down. Tastes absolutely nothing like coconut. Or water. It tastes more like Satan's salty butt hole. Ok, I'm trying to be funny with the last comment, but I'm mostly serious. Saltiness was the only thing I could taste. It literally made me gag.
0.01385815	This case was spoiled. It tasted so bad. I tried to drink one and it made my stomach soooo sick. I opened the rest of the ones in the case and they all even SMELLED bad. Threw them all out. This is the second case I had to throw out. I usually drink vita-coco. Switching back to that. I have been drinking coconut water for about three years. Zico is the worst brand. I hope this review helps others!
0.01385815	Coconut water is delicious but this is by far the worst tasting coconut water I've ever had. I tried it as it was less expensive then the other brands on the shelf (Naked, Blue Monkey, Amy & Brian, etc.). Similar to other reviewers it tastes as if it has gone bad, not even sure if coconut water can go bad. The expiration date was for next year. I ended up dumping the remaining content as it just did not taste good at all.I have had other brands and by far my favorite is c20, it's amazing. Blue Monkey is also really good. Never tried any others but c20 is always out at the store, I'm guessing because it's so good. It's naturally sweet, tastes fresh and hard to drink just one especially if it is really cold. Tried it on a whim and now I'm hooked. Tried Blue Monkey when c2o was out and it was really good.This is a long review for coconut water but the bad taste of this brand made me want to write about the good brands that are out there.  Next time you are at the store try c20 or if they don't have that then Blue Monkey and you will notice a huge difference between those and this brand. It's worth it. Blue Monkey and c20 are also well priced compared to the expensive Amy & Brian and other brands.
0.01385815	This product is really good for you healthy wise. But if you cant swallow it, its a waste of fricken money!! it tastes like a tangy spoiled milk to me. I bought this for my sister. She and I have heard its really good for you and did the research to follow it up. I know not everything good for you tastes/smells pleasant, so you just put it down the hatch because you know its what your body needs to run at a optimal level. But I cant do it with this. And Ive drank all sorts of nasty smelling health stuff. I just cant get over the connection to spoiling milk. My sister is drinking the rest of our package. But Ive noticed that shes been drinking hers with lots of ice and she doesnt do it every day because its so awful. We will not be buying this again. I hope this helps some of the customers looking at this product (even if my opinion is of the miniority).
0.01385815	I recently purchased a pack of Zico (so call) premium coconut water. In the past I purchased it at a local health food store and because of the price for a 6 oz container I decided to buy it bulk through Amazon. I was so disappointed.  The taste was awful.  I check the expiration date just to make sure that it was not expired but it was not (apr 2012).  The water tasted spoiled and the color was a dark gold (i don't know if that had anything to do with it.
0.01385815	This is so gross.  Zico should be ashamed!My reflex pulled the bottle back before too much got in my mouth after it hit my tongue.We gave the rest to my sister to put in her work fridge with a sign that said, "Healthy but gross"
0.01385815	i am a huge fan of coconut juice. Living in florida for almost 20 years. i tasted the best source of coconut juice which is directly from the tree. But it's hard to climb the freaking trees. I love Vitacoco, because the taste is the closest to the real taste of coconut. Not recommend zico at all because they have bad quality control, taste horrible.
0.01385815	Wow, this batch taste awful!  I had one pack left over that I bought from amazon during June, and it tasted fine.  This new batch tastes totally different.  It's tastes awful, like something went bad.  The expiration date says apr 2012, so I don't know what's going on.  Wonder if I can get a refund for this, just don't think I can bring myself to drinking the rest of the packs.  It's just that bad!
0.01385815	Received my package today and then tried drinking and the first one was bad.. tried second and third they were bad too.. it literally stinks very bad and cant even drink a single drop.. I felt cheated by Zico.. Never should have bought this and should have bought the brand that i always buy. I wasted 16$ on this and i am not going to get it back am i?? since Amazon doesnt let me return this item as per their return policy.
0.01385815	The coconut water smelled and tasted pretty bad. Amazon folks were gracious enough to issue a refund. I ended up throwing away all the 12 packets. Would not buy this brand again....
0.01385815	Received the order from Amazon yesterday. I tried it this morning but could not get beyond the awful smell and taste. This must be a bad quality control because I had tried Zico at a local grocery store and the taste was pretty good to me, although I have to admit it was not as good as fresh coconut juice. Just tried the second bottle - same disgusting taste. Gave one to friends to try,they all agreed the taste was really bad. Glad I ordered only one pack (of 12); will not buy this brand again.
0.01385815	Maybe it's the fact that Amazon's stock is (apparently) bad, or maybe I don't like Coconut as much as I thought I did (and I like Coconut, so I assume it's the former) but this stuff tastes terrible... I took one sip and poured the rest down the sink.Amazon was kind enough to issue a refund on this order, but until Zico fixes their shipments I'd stay away from this product!
0.01385815	This tastes like its been watered down a lot. Way more watery then any other brands I have tried. Stay away.
0.01385815	I've recently started consuming Coconut water daily.  We live in Bahrain, and I was buying Taste Nirvana brand on the military base, but they sell out as soon as they come in. I'm also spending close to $9 sometimes on the fresh young coconuts from the grocery, but realized that was quickly adding up! So, I thought I'd save money, and keep my supply filled with an automated monthly shipment.BAD IDEA.Since, my shipment of 24 came, I am disgusted everytime I try and drink one.  Thinking that maybe they were just "bad" sour coconuts, I've kept trying.  After 6, from different packages... I've come to the conclusion, it is NOT just a fluke, and Zico's coconut water is horrible!  It tastes SOUR and filthy! I wondered why Zico and other companies sell the coconut waters flavored with other so called "juices", because coconut water in and of itself, is refreshing, & simply delish! Taste Nirvana is comparable to fresh!  (Sidenote: I bought the plain "Pure Premium Coconut Water")So, with that said, I wanted to make sure I put a review out there for everyone to read.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It tastes as if it could be dangerous, or toxic if consumed.AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! I think the coconut water was expired prior to bottling.  YUCK!!!!P.S. The positive reviews obviously came from either people who don't have tastebuds, or DO NOT know what FRESH COCONUT WATER should taste like.  THIS IS NOT COCONUT WATER!!!!Danielle H.
0.01385815	I have been drinking Zico coconut water for sometime. One day I saw Zico Chocolate Coconut water. So gave it a try. well, to me it was chocolate drink but my expectation of a coconut water was not there.I threw rest of the bottle and kept my distance from this drink.Agreed that Zico coconut water is not the best coconut water but it is close enough to enjoy without any other ingredient in it and definitely not chocolate.
0.01385815	this product WAS good enough that i had a 'subscribe and save' order set up to receive regular shipments...but the flavor has been getting progressively worse, and i've finally given up. no idea what happened, but the latest order tasted like bad dishwater (perhaps slightly coconut flavored) and there's really no point in drinking it. i cancelled my recurring order and got a refund for the last batch--kudos to amazon.used to recommend it highly and drink it daily, but no longer. bummer.
0.1101455	HATE it, it tastes like dirt, and it is not returnable. Would anyone like to buy an unopened case from me?
0.1101455	This is made from concentrate with added coconut flavor.not nearly as good as fresh cocounut juice, or coconout water that is not reconstituted.
0.1101455	I would never buy this again. Tastes like a bad medicine. The chocolate does not help. I suggest to buy the coconut water without the chocolate flavor.
0.1101455	The product description says that 11OZ contains Brazil coconut water. The one I received says "Product of Thailand". Be aware of the false information.The taste was ok. I ordered 34OZ before and I didn't liked the taste. I ordered these to see if Brazil coconut water makes any difference. No use. It has same taste as 34OZ one.
0.1101455	Product arrived this morning. Put it in fridge all day. Just took a couple sips. This stuff is absolutely gross. They have done something to ruin this product.Someone has been stealing food from the fridge at work, so I'm going to put the remaining ones there.If you get a batch with an APR 21, 2012 expiration, spare yourself and throw it out. (Or poison your enemy.)
0.1101455	This is a terrible product. It just tastes like cocoa and water, no coconut water flavor/taste. Plus at the bottom of the bottle there are chunks of undissolved cocoa. Beware chocolate lovers you will be disappointed.
0.1101455	I hate to say this but I've been enjoying automatic shipments of zico since the beginning, and yesterday when I received my 5 box order I noticed the packaging is a bit different. Well, I chilled the water as per usual and this morning it tasted disgusting!!! Unfortunately I dont think its a bad case, I think zico adjusted their recipe and it is sooooooo bad. Has a sourish taste to it now where before you could tell it was just plain coconut water. This is very disappointing to me being that I am a runner and drink 2 cartons a day, I will have to check out other coconut waters now...I always preferred zico over vita coco and ONE but not anymore. My expiration on all 5 cases is april 2012 and its a shame they adjusted their recipe!! I couldn't even choke it down!! Well zico, I think you are going to lose some customers because of this...very unfortunate!!
0.1101455	I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as "Pure Premium Coconut Water" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is "Plastic".I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for "Vita Coco".I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is "vent it out" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me.
0.1101455	I bought two cases of ZICO in the plastic bottles, they were SO gross. =[ Every sip tasted like plastic. I tried one from each case, same result. I've had a couple ZICOs in a plastic bottle before and they were fine but these two cases I got were really bad. The one in the tetras taste a lot better.
0.1101455	I've tried Zico, O.N.E.  and Vita Coco. They are all mass marketed and have long shelf lives.Zico has really sold out by filling shelves with chocolate, pineapple and whatever else artificial flavors to make their drinks taste better. Personally, I think they all taste like crap compared to Harmless Harvest' Raw Coconut Water. It is the real stuff and hasn't been in a warehouse for months. They use a heatless, high pressure system to pasteurize which is the way the market is trending.Guess Zico made a ton of money while on top so this stuff will still sell by sheer volume. Harmless Harvest is available in whole foods in the tri-state area and then nationally whenever this winter. Hopefully Amazon will get it!
0.1101455	Been using ONE for almost two months.. I really like it.. It has subtle sweetness like coconut water does and tastes fresh and natural.. Always makes me feel fresh..Saw that Costco start selling Zico. Compared to 17$ that I have been paying for ONE through amazon, 14$ from Costco for Zico sounded a deal as I will use two 12-packs per month and bought a 12-pack.First impression: Does not taste natural. It has distinct made-from-concentrate taste..  Not sure why when it says it is natural.. No sweetness like ONE does... infact no taste at all.. Does not leave that refreshing feel... Even my 5 year old daughter said the same thing after taking a sip. Not impressed..I will stick with 17$ ONE.
0.1101455	After having had Zico in bottled form, we were excited to find this product on Amazon for a great price.  We even chose the option that reships you automatically at our chosen interval and ordered 4 cases.  I was looking forward to a refreshing coconut water upon my return home, but instead I got a rancid disappointment.  Every single case had gone bad.  All yellow in color, not clear, and rancid tasting.  Talk about being bummed-out.The one positive experience regarding this purchase was the Amazon customer service agent who assisted us when we called to notify them.  She was very professional and understanding, and resolved the situation without difficulty for us.
0.1101455	I have bought Zico Coconut Water from this buyer twice. The first shipment was fast and tasted great! On the second shipment, all of the tetra paks I've opened were bad. The water was not clear or sweet but a yellow and sour. I feel very mixed on this product from this seller since I've had mixed results in product. I'm not sure if there is anything they can do to ensure the quality of the product (maybe the 2nd shipment quality was due to lack of proper storing conditions?).
0.1101455	I have eight of these bottles sitting in my cupbard and unfortunately I cannot get myself to drink them. Awful after taste in the plastic bottle. Will not buy this product again. The boxed version tastes much better.
0.1101455	I purchased several of these the other day after all of the hype I've heard surrounding them.Long story short, they taste awful. I can't quite place the taste, but it just reminds me of something that's very stale and expired tasting. Very unpleasant, to the point where I threw out the bottle after a few sips.
0.1101455	It's not at all what I expected. I was hoping for a real coconut flavor but what I got was a washed out very bland tasting flavor! I will keep looking for another product!
0.1101455	The Onion News Network skit on Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water is right on the money!This product tastes like rancid ball-sweat.  How anyone could enjoy it is completely beyond me.
0.1101455	This is the first time I have tried this product.  I have never had the original formula so I can't compare it to what was a highly rated product.  At first the taste is somewhat pleasant but not very natural tasting and then there is a lingering aftertaste.  I will not buy this again and do not recommend it.  I want to try other brands. I think I will enjoy it because coconut water is not very sweet, low calorie and high in potassium.
0.1101455	I love coconut water, but I was gagging when I drank this. It just tasted yucky.  I wouldn't buy it again.
0.1101455	With regular coconut water I feel calm when drinking it. This doesn't have it. Plus the taste is weird. Stay away!
0.03098316	Each pak is sealed well. But the liquid is cloudy yellow and very bitter, with no coconut flavor or odor at all, so I don't know if it tastes the way it's supposed to. Please let me know if this is normal for this brand or not. I'm tempted to throw them all out.
0.03098316	This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut.  The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and it's not bad but it's better than this Zico.  Zico does not taste fresh at all.  If you don't breath, you can drink it down.  I'm going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom; I hope she likes it!  Ewww!
0.03098316	I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of "natural flavors", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons:ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12).These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks.
0.03098316	worst coconut water ever, period.I saw them in my local BJs and thought of trying it, the taste was horrible, had an artificial flavor to it which remains in ur breath for some time. I thought of trying after my 6 mile run, and even then I couldnt drink it. had to return it and then bought some good coconut water from a local asian store (realcocowater) and it tastes much better and doesnt have any artificial flavor like this.I would not even give it a one star if possible.Dont buy this, its a waste of money
0.03098316	Maybe I just got unlucky, but the water I got is yellow (is it supposed to be?), smells a bit funny and tastes bitter.  Took one sip and spat it out.  Maybe it got spoiled.  Sucks that I cant return it, $25 wasted.  I'd suggest you try Nirvana or other brands instead, so far every shipment I got from Nirvana coconut water was good, and its actually cheaper per oz (also Thai coconuts)
0.03098316	I am new to the coconut water scene, so trying a bunch of brands. I just tried this brand and found it way too salty...obnoxiously.  I don't get it.  We are drinking coconut water for the health benefits and I potassium, great for lowering blood pressure, and they go ahead and add 160mg of salt into the drink.  It's gross.
0.03098316	I usually buyVita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12), and was going to buy Zico (the name of a famous brazilian soccer player).The information on the product reads "from Brazilian coconuts", but if you take a look at the label (in the pictures) it clearly states "imported from Thailand".They are clearly trying to position themselves againstVita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12), by pretending to be from Brasil (using the soccer players name, and stating they use Brazilian coconuts) but in reality they are a Thay product.Nothing wrong with that, but they should not mislead people...
0.03098316	I don't know if it's the plastic bottle or the fact that it's made from concerntrate, but something doesn't taste right about Zico.  I ordered many different brands and most, if not all of them were not made from concentrate.  This tastes diluted, re-constituted and plastic-y.  There are many other brands, I recommend any one of them over Zico.
0.03098316	So, what happens when Coca-Cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste? It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying "I told you so" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure...
0.03098316	I grew up drinking real coconut water.  This product doesn't even come close.  I will not buy it ever again.  Read the product description - it's "produced domestically from concentrate."  IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE LIKE REAL COCOCNUT WATER.
0.03098316	I used to buy ZICO by the case. It was just like sticking a straw into a fresh coconut on a Caribbean island. Then the company sold to a conglomerate. First decision was to switch from fresh to from concentrate. The result was a disaster. Undrinkable funky tasting and horrible. Then the scandalous self promotion. Despite that every consumer was trashing it a string of 5 star reviews appear, every single one from a 'reviewer' with no history of any prior reviews on Amazon. One reviewer accidentally outed himself by posting a comment as a ZICO rep using the same username as his glowing review. Now fast forward they bring back the tetra packs not from concentrate. Thank goodness, right? WRONG! Stuff tastes artificial and basically only useful for making a smoothie. Old ZICO was miles above any other coconut water on the market and this stuff is miles below the worst of the bunch. And lo and behold, another slew of glowing 5 star reviews for the tetra packs and almost every single one of these from someone with no history on Amazon or only prior review was their bogus review of the from concentrate product. Shame on you for ruining a once fantastic product and shame on you for fraudulent self promoting reviews!
0.03098316	They source from many locations, partly owned by PepsiCo, from concentrate.  The result is a bland drink that tastes like a bit like grass and dirt.
0.03098316	I've bought Zico many times before from Whole Foods, and I don't remember it being yellow! I started a subscription of this as well as the larger bottles of Zico. The larger bottles came with clear water as I'm used to; however, every single one of these 11.2oz ones poured out yellow water. NOT NORMAL. I know they had a recall of many of shipments, but that is long over and this is not a recall item. It should be! I would say, stay away from Zico, or if you must drink, buy individually from the store instead of these cases! I am cancelling immediately...and would return this order too if I could!!! (Now I just get jokes in my office about how they'd rather not be 'healthy' like me if this is what it entails!!!)
0.03098316	I am from Malaysia and I have lived in Texas for 11 of my 15 years.  Back in Malaysia I drank and ate coconut on a weekly basis.  I rode my bike to CVS yesterday and bought this drink.  After I took one sip, I was like, WTF?! It tastes aweful!There is little to no coconut in there.  Notice consumers, that it is only "100% natural coconut WATER FROM CONCENTRATE" and includes natural flavors.  It tastes in my opinion more like barley water that coconut.  The drink is very diluted and just fake overall.  Now dont get me wrong, the average American may buy this product to make get a tropical feel or something, but they would only be wasting their money.
0.03098316	Skewing reviews by having reps put out a string of 5 star ratings is a great way to guarantee I will never buy your product again.
0.03098316	I just received a box with the Zico Coconut water in it from Amazon.I chilled a pakdrank 1/2 of itand it made me sick.I drink coconut water all the time.This is horrible tasting.Contacted Amazon and they areissueing a refundI thank them....
0.03098316	Coconut is my favorite anything. So i was excited to finally try for the first time cocnut water. To my dismay and utter disappointment. It was truly disgusting. I thought it was actually taste like cocnut, but alas it does not. It taste like sour milk mixed with tap water. Take it from a cocnut lover...find a different product!
0.03098316	Tried the Tetra pack for the first time.  Nasty bitter tasting...I had to mask it with a dash of MIO just to get it down.(Perhaps if I use it in cooking I will find a way to finish the case.)
0.03098316	My taste buds must be very different because believe me this does not taste like a yahoo......What a waste of money....
0.03098316	Didn't taste anything like Pineapple to me, you could taste the plastic from the bottle! I'd stick to other coconut water brands like Vita Coco and One Natural Experience for a product that tastes like what the fresh ones on vacation taste like.
0.2220265	Very bad taste, like rotten/stale drink. I had read pretty good reviews about ZICO coconut water, but on trying it totally disapointed. VITA COCO is way better than this.
0.2220265	Very bad taste, like rotten/stale drink. I had read pretty good reviews about ZICO coconut water, but on trying it totally disapointed. VITA COCO is way better than this.
0.2220265	I bought a case of this at Costco. I read about all the sugar in Vitamin Water and have been thinking on replacing my workout replenishing drink with coconut water. After trying it today, I couldn't even force myself to finish the bottle. One more sip and felt so disgusted. I had plenty of fresh coconut water, and this taste nothing like it. I have never returned anything to Costco, but I will return this one.
0.2220265	LOVE this coconut water.  After a workout (or a night out a bit too late) this stuff is like magic.  Rehydrates you immediately, even stops the headache you can get from being dried out.  My first shipment was Subscribe and Save for $18.28.  They apparently cancelled that program and are now asking $54.40.  INCREDIBLY diappointed, loved the product but that kind of a price jump is ridiculous.  Over 200%.
0.2220265	I sooo wish Zico would read this and take back their company. It was such a good product why zico why did you change it??? Now I have to find anouther coconut drink. Oh well that is what you get when you sell your company to people who just want money and not care about a good product.
0.2220265	The one star I have given to Zico coconut water is actually a negative star. This stuff tastes absolutely awful. Plain and simple. Wouldn't take it home again if they were giving it away.
0.2220265	I was expecting this to taste as good as some of the other coconut waters and what an unpleasant surprise!!!!  I cannot even finish one bottle  UGH!
0.2220265	This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified "natural flavor" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.
0.2220265	I like the product but it is too much trouble to open it now. I sent this email to Zico but, strangely, they didn't replyHi Folks,I like the product and I buy a couple cases per month of the 11oz units. I do have a complaint though: Why do you bother to put that silver tab on the top? I thought it was to open the box, but I guess it must just be there to protect the plastic membrane underneath. At any rate, I always have to have a knife around to cut the plastic out. You can't just punch a hole in it because the plastic then prevents the liquid from coming out smoothly. It has to be cut out. And that is almost impossible to do without spilling some. And it's a pain in the ass.Come on, guys. It's 2012 and I know there are some companies manufacturing containers that are easy to open. For what you are charging, shouldn't it be a little easier to enjoy your product?
0.2220265	I love the product itself, but I do not like the container at all.I have a garage with a large refridgerator in it, I fill it withcoconut water, so while working  around the yard, I get refreshedwith a cold drink . I opened the last case and the top looked funny,but i poured a drink and took a drink , it tasted funny , not like theothers.later that day got real sick. Looking at the other tops, i sawthey were not in tack. and poured out the products in that case, asthey were all alike, (I have the 6 containers still and if I could sendthem back I would for a refund.  I would not purchase this type of containeragain.
0.2220265	I purchased this coconut water expecting it to at least be passable.  What I got was a 12-pack that was 2 months away from expiration and tasted terrible.  With so many other solid brands out there, I'm moving away from ZICO.
0.2220265	I found the taste to be really awful compared to what I have had out of REAL coconuts straight from the tree. It tastes like frosted flake milk: artificially sweet. Would not recommend if you like natural tastes.
0.2220265	There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water.  There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking.  Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in.  I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.
0.2220265	Overall decent taste, but not what I expected.  Also did not expect this to be coconut water from CONCENTRATE. I will read the fine print better next time.  100% pure coconut water is always better IMHO.The added sugar would not really be necessary if it's pure coconut water, not from concentrate.
0.2220265	I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me.
0.2220265	Absolutely terrible and I tried 2 flavors. I had a plastic screw top container and all I could taste was PLASTIC. My son's flavor was the same flavor. ick ick ick I love ONE
0.2220265	Have purchased this product in different cities from different stores.  The consistent thing?  It tastes like plastic.  Nasty.  I will not be buying this product ever again.
0.2220265	I've been drinking ZICO brand coconut water after yoga for a few years.  My favorite flavor disappeared after ZICO sold out to Big Business, and my next favorite flavor since the sell out never seems to be available.  So I tried pineapple because it was available and I like another brand of coconut water with pineapple, but ZICO definitely did not nail this flavor!  I will choke down the rest of the nasty pineapple case and switch to something else...have lost faith in ZICO since they sold out.
0.2220265	I have been drinking vita coco for the last few years and after reading several 5 star reviews on this zico product, I decided to give this brand a try..)I grew up in the Dominic Republic, and have lived in the Philippines, so I know what good coconut water tastes like. I am also a fan of south east Asian coconut water, which has a subtly different more mature taste - not as sweet as Brazilian or Dominican republic nuts coconuts, which I actually like (I prefer less beverages that are less sweet)).I took one sip of the zico and that was all i could take (actually I had to spit out that one sip!) I found that it was watered down, sour, and had an off color. And produced in Thailand where all the other sugary coconut waters are produced. I investigated and found out that coca cola owns zico (and when was the last time coca cola produced a high quality natural fruit juice?) I also found that half of zico's products are from concentrate, so perhaps this one is too, but just not correctly labeled?Now, back to the "5 star reviews" I had read on this product. When I click on all those 5 star reviews, the positive zico review is usually the ONLY review of the reviewer! This leads me to believe that they are all totally bogus and shameless ploys of zico to promote their product. If it's a poor product, consumers should know. And only consumers should vote on products. Take a look and see for yourselves. If you deduct all those 5 star reviews, you are left with a 1 star review, which is what I am giving this product.
0.2220265	I don't particularly like the taste of coconut water, but I use it in my protein shakes for extra hydration and minerals instead of water.  If you want to take these individual servings with you, beware...  There were NO STRAWS attached to the drinks, nor were they in the box.  Not sure how you are expected to drink from it.  Heads up!
0.03710587	When I received the 6 pack the stem of the bottles were broken and leaked all over the box and made it smell like rotten fruit.
0.03710587	Zico is made from concentrate & you can taste it.  It's like comparing fresh squeezed orange juice and oj from concentrate....there's no comparison.  There are other coconut waters on the market that are 100% natural not from concentrate and they taste so much better.  Do yourself a favor and pass on Zico.
0.03710587	I guess I should have tried a bottle locally before buying a case. The consistency and flavor were awful. Not sure if this is what they all taste like but I will stick to my drink packets...
0.03710587	I ordered this 6 pack a few weeks ago and received it 2 weeks ago. The expiration date is may 2013 so i thought it would be fine but once we opened up the first bottle it had an odd taste and smell. We passed it off as nothing but my boyfriend and I have had the runs since  then because he's been drinking it thinking it was nothing....I went to my friend's house and tried her bottle from Trader's Joes and it had an expiration date September 2013 but didn't have the same taste or smell. I wish I can get a refund, I'm telling my boyfriend not to drink anymore and tossing the rest. I hope the other packages aren't similar to what I got and to think I was going to purchase monthly. Sad....
0.03710587	This stuff is just plain nasty and disgusting. I dont know what else to say about it. It's not coconut water... It tastes like liquified corn tortillas mixed with plastic.
0.03710587	I don't write many product reviews, but this one struck a nerve.  I love coconut water.  And I've lived in Thailand for many years where it's a common drink so I'm pretty familiar with it.I was fooled by the fancy packaging of 'Zico'.  This product is horrible.  It has a distinctive plastic taste.  I am not kidding.  Further, it uses plastic 
0.03710587	Regular Zico coconut water usually tastes great, but this Latte flavor simply has a horrible taste and this is honestly the worst purchase I've made on Amazon in a while, even with a discount coupon. I don't even know how to describe the taste past that it's not something that I feel anyone would enjoy. I'm never buying this stuff again and I don't recommend it to anyone.
0.03710587	i would not recommend this product to anyone. i thought the taste was horrible. my question is does all coconut water taste like this or is it this brand?
0.03710587	I HATE THE TASTE OF ZICO COCONUT WATER. ITS VERY NASTY TASTE . I DONT  LIKE TO ORDER THAT  ANYMORE !!
0.03710587	WOW - this stuff tastes really bad, almost to the point of being undrinkable.For anyone thinking would have the flavor of coconut juice, but not as thick - WRONG!  It has an unpleasant odor when you open the bottle, tastes bad and leaves an unwanted aftertaste.  Drink it ice cold and it's marginally better, but still nasty.
0.03710587	this was busted and showed up to my door in a soaking wet box and busted open, no option to return
0.03710587	4 of the 6 bottles were ruptured.  How do you get a refund for a problem like this?  Apparently the caps on top of the bottles rip off quite easily.  Might be a good product, just not safe for shipping.
0.03710587	i bought a case of these thinking that it was 100% FRESH coconut water, as i had known it to be, but once i received it and tried it, i noticed it tasted different.  i looked on the ingredients and what do i see?  it reads &
0.03710587	I've tried vita coco and o.n.e. and zico is by far the least tasty of the 3; it has an odd after taste that had me dumping out the rest.  I was quite dissapointedOf the 3... Vita Coco and O.N.E. are the best and pretty comparable... no weird after taste and very refreshing!
0.03710587	I REALLY disliked this coconut water.  The pineapple flavor was sweet and dull and amplified the effect that I still am trying to get used to about coconut water: that it tastes warm even when it's cold.  Plus, for some reason, I felt like it all tasted like the bottle it came in.  I will never order this brand again.
0.03710587	You're lying down on a beach staring at the fluffy clouds in the bright blue sky.  You can feel the sand form around you a little, like a comfortable warm bed.  You can hear the ocean as it splashes the shore and smell the fresh sea air while the sounds of sea gull flying overhead help soothe and calm you...THEN OUTTA FREAKING NOWHERE SOME JACKASS WITH A MOUTH FULL OF PINEAPPLE STANDS OVER YOU AND STARTS DROOLING IN YOUR FREAKING MOUTH!!That's what this Pineapple Zico is like.
0.03710587	This is the most disgusting coconut water I've ever had. It is brown, and tastes rotted. I buy the &
0.03710587	I couldn't even chug this down. To be completely honest, it tastes like urine. Not anywhere near any coconut flavor. I bought these to hydrate with when drinking alcohol, but I don't even think I could drink it while being highly intoxicated!
0.03710587	I only received 5 out of 6 containers! To say the least I am very disappointed with this purchase! I will never order this product again on here!
0.03710587	tasted like dog feces, is the best way to describe it and could not feel my tongue afterward.. it felt missing
0.0963916	1 star for terrible taste, misleading photos of nutrition facts and of item.Probably the worst tasting coconut water I have ever had. All pictures show cartons but the actual products are bottles, which are apparently of inferior quality compared to the carton. Should have listened to the reviews!
0.0963916	I ordered the Zico natural pack of 12 and liked just the packing of the bottles and nothing else. It has a very bad plastic taste, is made from concentrate and is no way near natural coconut water.
0.0963916	The advertised &
0.0963916	I hardly ever write reviews but feel the need to this time. I've been buying Zico coconut water in the 33.8 ounce containers at Costco whenever they have them and they tasted great. I figured the 14 ounce bottles would be the same so I ordered 3 cases from Amazon.  Unfortunately I was wrong and these seem totally different and taste terrible. On top of that, they are from concentrate and have a an additional ingredient named &
0.0963916	If you like Zico but have only purchased it in the cardboard cartons, don't expect these to taste the same.  Very plastic tasting.  Wonder if the packaging of these bottles resulted in plastic melting into the water.  I bought the pack of 12, but won't be drinking the rest.
0.0963916	I am thinking... &
0.0963916	there is something terribly wrong with this, it is super cloudy and it makes me naseated. I had finished a store bought tetra pack of coco libre a day before this came so I know i am not allergic to coconut water- there is something off with this Zico .
0.0963916	I originally bought a case of this at a local warehouse store and was very pleased.I bought 2 more cases through Amazon and was NOT happy.1) The product was OLD. The case I had purchased several months previous at a local warehouse store had an expiration date of 10/2013. The stuff just shipped from Amazon has an expiration of 8/2013, two months earlier. I probably cannot use it all before then.2) One of the containers is not sealed properly and leaked. I cannot use the product from that container. Into the garbage.
0.0963916	Don't be fooled.  Zico is nothing like the coconut water its founder drank as a Peace Corp volunteer.  Zico is bottled cheap and dirty, reconstituted undoubtedly with local tap water - probably floridated, at that - and pumped full of  neurotoxins euphemistically cloaked as 'natural flavor.'  It's anything but 'natural.' If you haven't searched out the latest news on this dangerous, brain-damaging additive, brace yourself for some really bad news.  There's one simple reason why the FDA allows manufacturers to hide such poisins - duping the public makes money! Personally, I am looking for a quality CW product, at my doctor's urging.  One thing for sure, Zico is not it.
0.0963916	I'm from the islands so I love coconut water fresh the coconut tree. Why ruin a natural taste by making it choc. flavored. What's next Bacon flavored coconut water?! lmao!!!
0.0963916	taste is most inferior compared to other products I've tried such as Vita , ONE and then this. Knowing taste can differ lot-lot notwithstanding, this one was the WORST. Tasted like medicine-water. I would not buy again. Sticking with ONE or VITA (depending on the sale price , watch out for good deals through the S&S option)
0.0963916	I bought Vita through Lightning deal and love it. Regular price for Vita is a bit high. I was delighted to find a Zico coupon in Amazon.Then I bought a 6 large Zico. What a mistake I made. Its taste is super bad: overwhelmingly  plastic.  I almost spilled it out. The people who created the taste should be fired. Now, I am  stuck with 6 undrinkable coconut water.
0.0963916	This is a sad representation of what coconut water really tastes like and what it can do for your health.  It may be a bit more expensive but drinking fresh coconut water straight out of a coconut is a delicious and wonderfully healthful experience.  This stuff is just processed, pasteurized, wanna-be coconut water.
0.0963916	Terrible taste. Pales in comparison to other brands. Someone said it tasted like feet. Not too far off. But arrived in time and as promised.
0.0963916	Maybe it's just me, but I hated this. Then again, I am not exactly a huge coconut fan, but... I thought this was awful. As did my husband, who loves coconut, and even my kid, who really wanted to try this. Just not for us at all. According to my husband, it does not even remotely taste of coconut, and has the worst aftertaste ever.This had the taste and consistency of, well; I don't even know how to describe this.  Kind of salty.  The only thing I could compare it to might be mucus.  I don't even understand how this could be considered a "superfood."I actually came back to edit this, after seeing someone else's review that they used this to make oatmeal, I tried that. (Amazingly, we hadn't chucked the whole bottle yet, not sure why not.) While it didn't destroy the whole bowl of oatmeal, it didn't add anything either. So, I guess in theory if you HAD to drink/use coconut water because you bought into the whole fad thing, you might be able to get away with using this stuff as an ingredient in other things...Even still, this is not a replacement for milk. In fact, it is not a replacement for water either, as it manages to have the texture of neither, and taste unbelievably worse than both. Ugh, shudder, blech.Off to dispose of the remains now...
0.0963916	I bought 14 ounce bottles pack of 12, natural flavor. I expect it tastes like regular coconut water but it is not. I must say it is horrible. I cannot explain it but it tastes like expired water, no coconut taste, no sweetness. My wife and my son have the same taste. I don't know what to do with the rest of 11 bottles. I will never try it again.
0.0963916	I purchased a bottle of the pineapple flavor yesterday and it was horrible!  The consistency was odd - it was like drinking a thick water - and I actually felt sick after tasting it.  I, stupidly, drank the entire bottle (even though I found it to be quite disgusting) with the idea that coconut water is full of electrolytes and I would feel better after consuming it.  In reality I felt ill for the next 1-2 hours and at one point thought that I might vomit.  Thankfully it passed but I will not be making the same mistake again.  And unless it is medicine I won't be drinking something that tastes horrible in the hopes that I will feel better after.
0.0963916	Blindly, I haven't been checking containers of Zico... they now are made from concentrate and add 'enhanced flavoring'. Yuck.And I bought 6 cases of 12 ...of those juice box containers ...at Whole Foods. No wonder they were on sale. From concentrate??? Please. You use to be Zico. Now you're just another disappointment.
0.0963916	I bought a case of this stuff after Amazon offered a 20% discount. I love coconut water, a few weeks back, Amazon offered a similar deal on Amy & Brian's brand, which I bought and was delighted with. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this name brand. I was WRONG! This stuff is made from concentrate, and has added &
0.0963916	really from concentrate.  You've got ot be kidding me.  If it's 100% coconut water then why does it list natural flavors.  If it's a 100% coconut water then there shouldn't be other natural flavor except coconut water.....question is, what's the natural flavors?There are plenty of brands that are not from concentrate.  My money will now go to them
0.02761754	I drink coconut water on the regular, especially before and after the gym. I saw this product on sale at my local store and decided to try it. It was horrendous. More specifically it did not taste like fresh coconut water. The flavor was strange, and the after taste was sour. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water and can recognize the taste. If i was blindfolded, i'm confident i would not have been able to recognize the flavor of this beverage.
0.02761754	Not as disgusting as Vita Coco, but a very close second. Don't let the shiny packaging fool you. Tastes like a corn flour tortilla. Just add beef and cheese.  Gross.
0.02761754	Wow, ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Mango has a horrible taste. I love the plain ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water.I love Mango and thought this would be a nice combo. Boy was I wrong. Either the product received was bad, or I was just wrong about the combo flavor of Coconut water and Mango together.  Either way I would not recommend this combo flavor.
0.02761754	Ordered this after seeing all the hype. I cant even drink it. Try one before you order a case. It seems very diluted.
0.02761754	This is perhaps the most disgusting thing I've ever had to drink. It is really really bad. I can't emphasize that enough. IT IS BAD.I bought the 6 pack, my friend and I each had one, and neither of us could finish them, no matter how slowly we tried or what painful faces we made as we did so.I'm throwing away the remaining 4 bottles.
0.02761754	this is not 100% coconut water. this is from concentrate and added natural flavors and tastes really bad. i would not recommend this
0.02761754	It comes in a very lovely box and attractive packaging, but is totally funky tasting, like sour milk mixed with stagnant water. I am a big coconut water fan and would barely recognize this as coconut water when compared to other things I have tasted.
0.02761754	It tastes horrible! Taste like pool water! It's just gross! I love coconut water and tried this one... I couldn't return the package so I ended up dumping half of the pack. I tried to consume them cuz I hate to wast anything but It was giving me headache! I stopped drinking it my headaches stopped too. Awful taste, poor quality!!!!
0.02761754	Fresh coconut water is the most refreshing drink in the world. It has a trace of sweetness and light fragrance to it that it is so refreshing. This stuff is no where near that taste. It tastes somewhat like coconut water but stale and old. The color is more yellowish than the real thing as if it is more concentrated.Even though on the package it says the stuff is not from concentrate, I highly doubt it. If you have ever tasted the real coconut water from a green coconut freshly cut up, you would know what I am talking about.
0.02761754	Absolutely horrid.  I love Zico in the tetra paks.  It's the best packaged coconut water I've tasted.  However this product in the bottle had the worst plastic taste imaginable.  I can't believe Zico would put out a product that tastes this bad.  Maybe it was stored under poor conditions, but I will never buy Zico in this format ever again.
0.02761754	As a fan of Vita Coco's tetra paks, I am thoroughly and utterly disgusted with this ZICO variety. I decided to try it after hearing how much &
0.02761754	Saw Zico recommended in &
0.02761754	I'm usually happy with the product but this time the seal was broken on one of the containers and coconut water leaked out into the entire package. I was disappointed and am not happy. Feel like my money was wasted with this shipment since I had to throw it out.
0.02761754	I used to love Zico - in the cardboard tetra-pak. The coconut water out of the plastic bottles tastes just like, well...plastic. Their customer service team (3 different people) refused to listen to me and told me &
0.02761754	Ordered 2 cases 1 expires in 2 1/2 months the other in 10 months. Need to rotate stock!!!! Very dissatisfied.
0.02761754	I find this ZICO to be quite tasty, but thats because pepsi took over, concentrated it, added sugar and sodium to make it taste better. If you drink this often you will feel the negative effects within days.
0.02761754	The ingredient is just coconut water. But there is a strong artificial pineapple favor. The coconut refreshing taste that you are familiar when drinking the water from a fresh coconut is only a light aftertaste. In half hour, I only drunk half bottle. Very hard ...
0.02761754	I have been drinking vita coco and thought I would try zico. Well, I received it a few days ago and the smell that came from the liquid was like chemicals. I took a sip to see if maybe it was only the smell but the taste was just the same! It was disgusting like rotten coconut water or plastic-like aroma. The expiration date was in April of this year (2 mo before expiring) so this must have been on shelf for a GOOD time. I dont know whether it was due to that or if ZICO just had a poor batch. Either way I am staying AWAY from this brand because of how nauseating the smell and taste was.
0.02761754	Zico is now made from concentrate and the taste is terrible compared to what it used to be. this is just a warning
0.02761754	This is the most artificial tasting coconut water that I ever had.  And its not that cheap&
0.0915036	I have always been intriqued by coconut water distributers who think they can make a better tasting coconut water. Um...really people the best is straight from the coconut! But, because I didn't have a coconut to break open I decided to go against my belief on this matter and try a company's version. DISAPPOINTED. ZICO have great marketing people on their side and know how to make the product look great but they by all means DO NOT KNOW WHAT REAL COCONUTS TASTE LIKE. I realize this sounds harsh, but truthfully, marketing and the taste of the product should be equal. There goes three bucks!The taste was really horrible. Hey, if you like fake, plastic-y kind of coconut water then you'll love it. I tasted more of the plastic bottle then I ever want to taste again. Worries me a little, thinking about the reason this flavor is in it. Hmm....wonder when people will care enough about natural ingrediants like this take in consideration of the people that drink this stuff, to think about what kind of container they are putting their product into.Zico was not a home run. I will now stick with the real thing. Guess I'll have to buy a bigger lunch bag since I'll be bring coconuts and a hammer along with me to work!
0.0915036	Most reviews gave this a decent score, but in reality you should probably stay away from Zico. I've had Vita Coco prior to this.So, what does Zico taste like? Coconut water... and plastic. It's &
0.0915036	I have been buying Zico coconut water from my local costco for a long time...This was the first time (and most definitely last time from Amazon) I bought the item on Amazon.The contents tasted Stale...with rotten tinge...We tried the 2nd one and the 3rd one...the same problem.I called Zico customer support...the guy took my details, promised someone will call me back...they never did....I am not sure if the Coconut water became stale while being shipped from Amazon to my home or the whole batch was bad....we will never know.Thanks to this experience, I will never be able to buy nor recommend Zico from Amazon nor get over the stale taste when I see the Zico brand...luckily for us, Costco has been carrying a non-Zico brand (Vita Coco)
0.0915036	Ok so I read some mix reviews and decided let me try it. If I can give Zico a negative 1 I would. This is worse then ONE Brand
0.0915036	My daughter has been in and out of the hospital for the last few years, 2 life threatening comas in the last 6 years. Part of her recovery she decided to get off soda except special ocassions. So she had to find things BESIDES SOda that she liked, and she was really dedicated to healthy liquids.So, while we were in the hospital i found Vita coco in the cafeteria with pineapple in it. She went nuts, and despite its steep price tag, she drank that, iced tea, and other juices. We had trouble finding Vita Coco when we got home from the hospital at first, and a family friend purchased ZICO for her instead. They were told it was a comparable productIT is NOT comparable, not even remotely. This product tasted like chemicals, it burned my daughters throat, she couldnt/wouldnt even finish one bottle of the stuff.Zico,no matter what the company says, is no where near comparable to some of the other coconut waters on the market. the cheap ones at asian markets in cans are better then this stuff. Steer clear, try Vita Coco instead (which FYI, has lots and lots of other flavor choices ranging from plain coconut water to coco water withL pineapple, mango and peach, tropical, acai berry, orange, as well as kids lunch box sizes that have apple, berries, etc. WAY Better product, and while you may not like all of the flavor choices, there is no question the quality of their product far surpasses ZICO.Hope this helps some folks. Stay healthy and hydrated!!
0.0915036	Love Zico in the tetrapak, but I would pick almost any other brand over this product in the plastic bottles. The plastic taste combined with the "from concentrate" formula is a lose lose. Seek another brand or go with the tetrapak and you'll be much happier in my opinion.
0.0915036	Containers came damaged. Pour spout and cap not completely attached to body of carton. Food contamination is questionable. Very disappointed. No stars is not an option so I was forced to give one.
0.0915036	I purchase a case of Zicos and they were bad product.  Ive always bought Zico's but this time when they came in they taste old and not like it should. Some of the Zico's had small leak and maybe that cased it to smell bad and taste awful. Look at the expiration date as well. Im surprise it tasted that bad and it had expiration date until nov 2014.
0.0915036	This water is disgusting and tastes like another brand also sold at Costco. The after taste is stale bread, I ordered 2 cases of http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BN6BX9M/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 when I got this with a coupon and subscribe & save discount and now I'm choking this down.Move on to something else if you want a clean crisp coconut water, this definitely isn't it!
0.0915036	I love the coconut water! But in this order, all six boxes the top was broken!! I just got my May order and all the tops are great!!
0.0915036	I noticed Jessica Alba promoting ZICO while taking credit as a well behaved, caring parent who had many health issues when she was a child and now how proud she is being part of these fine companies including ZICO (meaning she shares the profit of the sales). Let's look at some facts on ZICO;1. INGREDIENT: all natural coconut water. Ask yourself, have you ever seen a natural food item, any food item even a coconut water when you crack a fresh coconut, where the natural water of that coconut to last for months in any temperature. No it will not last more than few hours so why is it that Jessica is not disclosing the preservatives that are included inside ZICO cartons and bottles when infact you will get no preservatives when cracking a fresh coconut and drinking the coconut juice for a dollar a coconut instead of four dollars for ZICO. With fresh coconut you will even end up with fresh coconut meat as well,,2. HYDRATE: hydration requires consuming water at zero calories, not sugar. You can drink all the coconut juices in the world and it still will not hydrate unless you drink water. Sugar will force you to drink water so you will have to consume water after drinking ZICO,3. HAND HARVEST COCONUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD: meaning not a Fair Trade certified product. Meaning ZICO is the same as Coco Cola, the same as the competition without Fair Trade certification,4. AS MUCH POTASSIUM AS A SMALL BANANA: Let' compare based on NUTRITION FACTS. For a cup comparison although not the same since we are comparing liquid with solid, but regardless ZICO vs. banana in calories 50/33, potassium 360/317, sugar 10/2.4 and tall of that not considering where banana offers 3.7mg of Phytosterols in lowering cholesterol, all other vitamins and minerals from 171% vitamin C, A, K, B6, fiber, and all minerals where ZICO offers none other than sugar in a processed container.It is fine to consume a processed food or drink if one wishes to do so but for Jessica Alba is purely misleading public while acting as a caring individual. ZICO is a processed drink in a carton, which has a whopping 40gr of sugar processed just like other coconut water brands, like Coca-Cola, not a Fair Trade product which has nothing to do with hydration or banana. I drink coconut water by cracking cold coconuts that I keep in my refrigerator and understand the nutritional value of each when a fresh coconut costs me a dollar, a banana twenty five cents not four dollars for a processed coconut in container with preservative.
0.0915036	I love coconut water.I don't like companies that lie and deceive.Zico was bought out by Coca Cola in 2013. Therefore with every Zico coconut water purchase, you will be funding GMO's, GMA, and all that they stand for.Purchase Vita Coco instead.
0.0915036	The &
0.0915036	Tastes aweful. Not like real coconut
0.0915036	We LOVE the Zico Chocolate coconut water, so we thought we'd order some of the regular Zico coconut water, but they all taste rotten!  We drink other brands of coconut water and love it, so not sure why this tastes so horrible.  Wondered if it was maybe just one, so we've tried multiple, but they all taste the same... like it's fermented or something!  Horrible purchase!  Going to stick with O.N.E Coconut water!
