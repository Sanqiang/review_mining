4	1405123200	Really user friendly!  easy to use and keep clean and allows for lots of different functions.
4	1405036800	I originally purchased a Cuisinart toaster oven htat my boss was too fancy and complicated for the office. The Black & Decker was my begrudging replacement. It works as described but is too small for other than toasting a bagel or heating up a small piece of meat or a slice of pizza. I gave it 4 stars but if your not too pick you may feel free to give it a 5 star rating. The price was great and aAmazon shipped it very quickly. Thansk again Amazon!
5	1404864000	I ordered this little oven a bit over a year ago and it is still going strong! It looks great and works perfectly. I've never had a problem with it. It came on time, no damage and was a great price!
1	1404777600	Too Small. Returned
5	1404777600	So far, so great.  We needed to replace our toaster oven and we're glad we chose this one.  The price was right and it's working great.  Looks great on the countertop.
5	1404432000	Love it.  No problems,  Our second unit, as we gave our original to MIL.
3	1404172800	It gets really HOT.  I don't put anything near it.  The toast burns easily and the timer is not fine tuned.  I use the timer on my stove to avoid the problem.  I've baked small items like zucchini's an potatoes in it.  It does the job well in baking department.  I miss our old De Longhi, which lasted for 15+ years.

4	1404086400	so far so good......
4	1404086400	so far so good......
1	1403913600	I have had this toaster oven for less than 2 months.  It has never lived up the the reviews.  It does not toast evenly and will not hold 4 slices of bread.  Forget about baking in it.  2 days ago, I was making my toast as I do every morning, settings always the same.  Kitchen started to fill with smoke, I opened the door and the toast started flaming.  To make a long story short, I got the fire out without getting injured.  I will never buy a Black and Decker product again.
4	1403222400	This thing has made mini pizzas, cookies, and bread. Everyone in my office uses it for toasting bagels and such. It does a great job although it feels a little flimsy and will not survive much abuse. Still for the price vs. many of the others, it does great work. You'll just have to take care of it.
1	1403136000	It chooses when it is going to turn off. I have had the dial turned off and it is still lit 15 min. later.I unplugged it yesterday and plugged it back in this morning and didn't have to touch it, it lit right up and toasted my bread. We have to unplug it to make it turn off! I just bought it a couple weeks ago and this has been happening on and off. Don't leave it while something is in it, because you can't rely on it turning off. Don't waste your money, like I did!!!
2	1403049600	I bought this toaster oven because of the size and colors.  It doesn't take up too much room on the counter, yet toasts four pieces of toast or two bagels.  I am very disappointed with it, however, because of several reasons.  First, it does not have a safety shut off when you open the oven.  I consider this very dangerous for children who might not know enough to keep their hands out of the oven when the door is open.  Second, there is no control for light, medium or dark.  You have to turn the bottom knob past 10 and then guess at how long your toast might take to brown.  Third, the oven is slow.  You have to put in the toast before you even start your eggs, or your eggs will be cold by the time the toast is done.  Fourth, when I went to clean around the knobs on the front of the oven, the numbers actually washed off the oven.  I had one of the first toaster ovens that Black and Decker made years ago, and it was much better than this one.
2	1402876800	Not quite what I expected , Noise timer , tic, tic, tic  When you open door , element stills stays on, no shut off switch as my previous one. lighter material , Crum tray , very lite , looks better in picture .
5	1402790400	This toaster oven replaced an old Black and Decker that saw use twice daily for many years.  But my criticism of that older toaster was that if someone toasted something, the next person to use the toaster needed to wait until at least an hour passed or else you wouldn't get a full toasting cycle in.This toaster is fantastic!  Our dog initially wasn't sold by it because of the ticking sound that would be made while it was toasting, and also the bell to announce that it was done was louder than our old one.  But she's now used to it.  It is super easy to clean, too!  Can't say enough good things.
5	1402358400	I caught my first one on fire! But I loved it so much I had to buy a second one that was exactly the same as the first. It was my fault the first one caught fire, I left my toast in to long and I walked away from the toaster - left the room. This is a great product!
5	1402272000	Easy cleaning and spacious inside. Good price too. I'm pretty happy with it. I would definitely reccommend this toaster to anyone.
1	1401753600	The door was (very obviously) badly aligned and would not close all the way.  The first time I turned the timer knob, the cap on the end of the knob fell off and would not re-attach.  I returned it to Amazon.I've bought many Black and Decker products over the years (including a different toaster oven several years ago) and have generally been satisfied.  This product seemed flimsy with poor attention to detail during assembly.
1	1401580800	This thing basically burns the toast within a minute. If you dial in regular times (2 minutes or so) you get ashes. Unfortunately at the short timeframe the timer in our unit doesn't work properly and may not time at all so you cannot rely on it either and basically have to stay next to it to get it (the bread) right. If you turn the dial all the way to the left, it  is not off but turned on without timer, which is kind of dangerous and not intuitive.Looking for another toaster oven right now. In principal it works but not as expected.The vendor contacted me and I responded, let's see where this goes. .
5	1401580800	This was part of a gift and the recipient loved it! We have utilized every setting and are pleased with the results! Great buy!
4	1401494400	Amazon's product description leaves out a very important bit of information:  the size of the baking area. The size of the entire unit is given, but that does not tell you whether a 12 inch baking dish will fit in. The baking area dimensions are 10 1/4 inches wide, 8 1/4 inches front to back, and 3 1/4 inches high (if you measure from the grill surface to the top).So, no, a 12 inch baking dish will not fit in.
5	1401321600	I was so upset when my old toaster broke and &#34;settled&#34; for this one.  Boy am I glad I did.  This looks so much nicer and classier in my kitchen and works better than the older model.  Would recommend.
4	1401235200	After looking at a lot of reviews I decided to go with this one. Our old one still worked and was serviceable but it was showing it's age and we'd just remodeled our kitchen so I thought it was time to get a new toaster oven. The old one was simpler to operate, but this one as long as you pay attention and go through the extra steps to make toast (the old one you pushed a lever and it popped when the toast was ready. You do have to experiment with the toast timer. You turn it past 10 then back to the darkness setting you want. Once you've toasted a few different kinds of bread you'll figure out which timer setting works best. I've also used it to reheat pizza and works great doing that.I do like that you use the timer to cook things. So that it shuts off when it's done.
5	1401148800	Great value for the money. This does the trick perfectly for toasting, baking small meals (chicken, etc) without the need to turn on the big oven. Simple, functional, works well.
5	1401148800	I used for toast sandwich, cook frozen entry or veggie patties, even sweet yam. works good, don't even need microwave anymore.
5	1401062400	I loved the price, I've had it for a few years. Worth every penny. Easy to clean. Does take up alot of counter space but its much better than having to wait to turn my stove on to heat up a few fish stick or pizza rolls (microwave pizza rolls are just gross!!)
1	1400025600	This toaster oven broke after the first time I used it.  I have tried everything to get it to turn on again.  My husband can usually fix anything cannot get it to work either.  I am very disappointed in this purchase and that AMAZON is not letting me return this!! I will no longer buy items such as this via Amazon if I cannot return merchandise longer than 30 days!!
5	1399680000	I had owned a similar model to this one for about 12 years. Recently, the bottom element went out. I found this model on Amazon, and I liked the fact that it was finished with stainless steel (my previous one had a white plastic finish). The controls are very easy to use, the toasting function works fine--I especially enjoy the &#34;bagel&#34; setting, which my old oven didn't have. Also, the oven fits just right in my limited space; I live in a one-bedroom apartment. All in all, a good value for the money. Hope it lasts at least another 12 years!
3	1399420800	This toaster has a very strange and un-user-friendly operating system. You have to turn multiple knobs just for a simple toast.  Fit, finish and heat levels are great though.
4	1399334400	Bought this unit after coping all info off another.  This unit does not have a functioning grill that slides out when. The door is opened.  Otherwise good unit.
4	1399161600	Works great, does what it is designed for.  Doesn't take much counter space and definetly uses less electricity that a full size electric oven.
1	1398297600	Purchased this for my elderly Mom.  Very disappointed, not easy to operate.  Don't get the results of the oven component.  Would love to return but of course, she threw out all the packing.  You win some and lose some.
3	1398297600	Made in China. Wish I could find something that wasn't. Nice tray for catching crumbs -- makes cleanup easy. Rack slides out when door opens but gets stuck going back in too often. Chinese not so great at design -- a slight modification to the shape would solve this problems easily. A bit too narrow for four large slices of bread. First one was $28 ans that was a great price for a good appliance. Went to buy another (ex-wife took all the good stuff) and now it is $50 WTF?
4	1397865600	I purchased 2 one for my mom and one for my mother in law.They both use it daily for toast and small items.Being single and cooking for one and in heat of summer it is great.Heats up quickly and cooks evenly.
4	1397865600	Really like the size of this oven plus it has a bagel option which is extremely useful.  Seems to work very well.
5	1397779200	I'm a big fan of toaster ovens and this has all the features I wanted at a very affordable price. My folks paid about $80 for the precursor to this model and I snagged it for almost half! The crum tray being slide out is a lifesaver, the dials are responsive and make sense and the interior space is generous enough for my needs.The only thing that the precusor had over this was that, when you open the door, the prior model &#34;pulled&#34; out the rack a small amount; this one leaves the rack in place and the door opens all the way without the spring-loaded &#34;padding&#34; (slightly pulled it back towards closed) the other offered.I use mine almost as much as my microwave and this is better than the ones I found in local stores!
3	1397520000	I liked this toaster just fine in the beginning, but after nine months the timer stopped working and would never turn off; We had to unplug it when not using it.  Then, 15 months after using it the temperature dial started smoking and then caught fire.I'm so mad that I'm contacting Amazon today about getting my money back.  I used to think of the Black & Decker brand as decent, but now I think of it as complete junk.-0-UPDATE: Amazon referred me to Black & Decker which referred me to Spectrum (800-231-9786), which I assume manufactured the toaster under the Black & Decker brand.  They were very concerned about the smoking temperature dial and took my complaint seriously.  They are sending me a new toaster and will pick up the old one.I'm changing my rating to three stars from one under the assumption I got a bad unit and because Spectrum responded well to my call (very good customer service).  I'll keep you posted as to what happens next.
4	1397174400	Replacement for similar older model with a design defect in that the door would not stay attached.  This new unit is an improvement in function and exterior is slightly smaller while interior is the same size as previous model.  However they cheapened it by using silver paint instead of real stainless steel for the facade.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.
5	1397088000	My room mate bought this toaster and I fell in love with it.  The knobs are easy to use, do not burn from the toaster being on, small and cute but still can toast/heat up a lot.  Very durable and easy to clean since the tray comes right out and can be put in the dish washer.
1	1397001600	I received this as a gift from my brother, and he bought it based on the generally favorable reviews. This is the biggest piece of crapI have ever owned. The first thing I did was run it at high oven temp for about 1 hour to burn off all the manufacturing crud, and I did this with my oven thermometer inside. The temperature never got above 375. Next, the toast function, which is supposed to turn on and stay on until finished, cycled on and off like an oven trying to maintain a set temp. The dials were clumsy and sometimes wouldn't even move-sometimes moved but did nothing. Being fed up, I called B&D;, who instructed me to cut off the plug, send it into them and they would mail me a new replacement (actually received a refurbished unit). This new one had all the same problems as the old one, so I boxed it up and took both to an e-recycling center. POS-that's all you can say. IMHO, B&D; sells products that are cheap and made like crap-then try to make up for it by giving you another one of the same POS products you had before.I will NEVER AGAIN buy a B&D; POS product and I don't recommend that anyone else buy them either.
1	1396915200	Hi All,we have received the toaster with SCRATCHES AND DENT ON CHASSIS, i gave it to our church as donation. it was working fine but i think that was used one.
5	1395792000	Works well, and looks good on counter.  just the right size, I would recommend it for someone who is looking for a mid size toaster oven
1	1395792000	For the amount of money this toaster costs $45.00 it is so poorly made it is flimsy and cheap should be priced at $20.00 It does not toast the bread evenly and the crumb tray is not locked in place and falls out ,it broke made out of aluminum. BD is going to replace it at no charge as they should I only purchased it in December 2013 I should have returned it immediately my mistakes if it breaks again I will through it away Do Not Buy this toaster
2	1395619200	We received this as an engagement present almost two years ago and it's worked great. But today while routinely heating up a couple slices of pizza, I heard a large bang from the kitchen and my wife scream. The glass exploded out several feet after only being on for 4 minutes. We will be switching brands for our next toaster oven purchase since we try not to use microwaves whenever possible.
4	1394841600	This toaster replaced another B&D that we had for 14 years. I considered getting top rated Breville but I didn't see any compelling reason to spend at least 3x what this one cost (actually we got this B&D for less).  Controls take some getting used to, they are a bit cumbersome. Otherwise, we're reasonably satisfied after several weeks.
1	1394236800	I thought I was buying a great product. I ordered it, opened the box which appeared factory taped. The door was taped closed and showed no signs of previously being opened. There was no wire rack, no baking tray and no owners manual. I contacted Black and Decker Customer Service and explained the problem and they agreed to send the missing items. After waiting 7 days for delivery, I opened the package and tried the rack.It didn't fit because it was approximately 3/4 inch to big. Tried CS again. Closed by the time I called. It was a Friday. Now I have to wait until Monday to see if they will ship out the replacement rack. Then another 7 days for shipping. I guess I didn't need the item as bad as I thought. I'll have owned it for a month and still not been able to use it.
4	1394236800	good for one person or maybe two depending on their toasting needs.  have to be careful, if foodstuff drips on lower heat bar cover, it really smells as it burns off if you don't get it off right away.  after 2yrs use, still going strong, toasting is tricky to be honest.  each bread is different, so I just watch it to be sure it is ok.  use for Tyson chix, van de kamps, stouffers fr breads etc. and is fine.
1	1394150400	Had to throw it away.  The dial indicators faded and it became dangerous to use. Would not recommend it, especially for children.
4	1394150400	I must have read at least twenty reviews before purchasing this toaster oven. I have seldom had such difficulty making up my mind. After a lot of research, I concluded that there are essentially two categories of toaster oven. One is the gigantic oven that purports to be a reasonable substitute for an actual oven, albeit a bit smaller. Apparently some folks who either live in hot climates and seek to limit the heat put out by a full-sized convection oven, or those living in small lodgings without any other actual oven, are baking cookies and roasting chickens in these things. Since I use my real oven for most of those things and the Nelco Electric Roaster I purchased from this site for larger holiday items, I eliminated those products from consideration. I didn't want to give up a lot of counter space to my toaster oven; didn't want to fork over a small fortune for it; and really only wanted it for toast, bagels, garlic bread, nachos, and similar items. And as one astute reviewer pointed out, if one buys the mini-oven that you can shove a chicken into, the elements will be so far away from your humble slices of bread that toast will be a long time coming, whereas a little cheap thing like this one will do it quickly.If you want to toast 4 slices of toast in this oven, there are a couple of things you will have to live with (hence the missing star). Loaf size matters. If you buy a large loaf and pick 4 slices out of the middle, they aren't going into this oven at the same time. Think of it as a large 2-slice toaster oven and you will be happier. Also, when you pull the rack out to take the toast slices off, if there are four small pieces of toast or bagel and you pull the two front slices off first without carefully clutching that rack edge with your oven mitt, the back two slices will flip off the back, onto the element and burn like hell. Good luck with that! It only happened to me once, and after that, I was prepared.Every toaster oven should be kept a couple inches away from the wall. We learned this with a previous toaster oven, when one of our teenagers left it on late at night and we smelled something that resembled burning plastic. It WAS burning plastic--namely, the switch-plate into which said toaster oven was plugged! The switch plate was starting to melt. Likely the house might have caught fire if we had not gone down to check. This is a reality for every toaster oven I have ever seen. If you have to leave the room, don't leave it on. Keep it away from the wall while it is in use (and we choose to play it safe by keeping it away from the wall at all times, now that we know!) And yes, some steam rises above the window when your toast (or whatever) is almost ready. Don't touch. Hot. This is not rocket science! But the steam goes away immediately when the door is opened, and neither the walls nor the ceiling are discolored as a result of this after a month of frequent use.For medium browning, set the selection button slightly below the middle. If you set it on max, you will get black toast, and don't yell about that, because some people really do like their toast that way. (I am related to one of them.)As for me, I am happy. I got a much cheaper toaster oven than the Rival model I bought about 6 years ago at the local hardware store, top of the line and top of their price range. I can get two slices of whatever I want toasted, and although the insides of them will be darker than the outer edges, they meet my standard. It doesn't take up too much space, and it didn't cost a fortune.Because really, all we want is fast, reasonably well-toasted carbs. If you want to bake cookies or roast a chicken, this is not your machine.
5	1394064000	My oven is broken so I needed a backup plan.  This a a good small oven for dependability and cost.
5	1393891200	i loved my previous hand-me-down black & decker toast-r-oven and knew when it came time to replace it, that i wouldn't settle for any other brand.  it just arrived today and although i was used to an older model with one less knob, it is easy to figure out and i am totally loving it.  always worth it, love my black & decker products!
5	1393718400	I received the package on time.  I am very satisfied with the product.  It is really a 4 slice toaster oven, better than the previous one I had with the same model number.  Better temperature control.  I don't have to worry about over heating.Carlo D.Sunrise, FL
5	1393459200	It works beautifully!!!! For the price its definitely worth it. I'm happy with it. Best purchase I've ever made yet.
3	1393027200	We do not like this over as well as our previous Black & Decker unit.  Single rather than double heating elements may have something to do with its sub-par performance.  It does well in keeping food warm, but the toast it makes is too crusty.
3	1392768000	After reading the manual carefully and a few experiments, I finally mastered using this toaster oven. I'm only just satisfied with it, nothing more. Next time I'm shopping for a toaster oven, I will try to find one with much simpler user controls. The knobs for toasting, baking, and broiling are all intigrated with one another so you have to be very sure that you've got it on the right setting.
4	1392508800	Working well, good size oven area, crumb tray is good idea, controls provide ample options beyond the basics. No extra frills but I was not looking for extras.
5	1392422400	works great as a toaster and mini oven.  Easy to use dials, easy to read, nice pull out crumb tray.  Black and chrome sleek look.  compact for counter.  Would recommend.
5	1392422400	This toaster oven is just the right size to use an a &#34;oven&#34; and toasts or broils better than I've had.  Great item for the price.
3	1392336000	This was the only unti I could find that fit the very restricted space I have.  It seems to work well, but it will be interesting to see how it holds up.  It's a lot more flimsy than the 20+ year old B&D unit it replaced.
5	1392249600	This is a great toaster oven. For cooking or baking small amounts, it is perfect. I love the toaster oven!
5	1391990400	This was definitely a good purchase. I'll just break this down to pros and cons, for simplicity's sake.Pros:-Toasts bread, English Muffins, and Bagels evenly.-Bakes frozen foods quite well. I've only recently started to use it to cook fish sticks for my young son, and it really did a great job.-Durable. Keeps on ticking!-Easy to clean.Cons:-While is use, the top and sides do get quite hot to the touch. Do not store anything on top of the oven.-For someone who lacks patience, the controls can seem quite confusing. But, really, it only takes a couple seconds of extra thought to sort it out.-When you open the door, the rack slides out too. However, the rack will stick when you try to close the door. You'll need to use a knife to push in the rack before closing the door. It's really only a minor annoyance.
5	1391904000	We love this toaster oven and use it every day.  We camp and bought one also for our camper.  Does an excellent job and don't know how our kitchen would function without it!  Love it.
5	1391904000	This was a Christmas Gift for my daughter & since she didn't complain about them she must of liked it!
5	1391904000	This was a Christmas Gift for my daughter & since she didn't complain about them she must of liked it!
5	1391731200	I love toasted bagels and English muffins and this oven does a great job. Also great for baking small muffin tins and brownies and broiling meat.
1	1391644800	this product is a fire hazard!!! started two fires already, just from toast. the tray sits too close to the element...... want money back
5	1391472000	We've owned several Black and Decker toasters over the years and they've always been consistently reliable. This one is no exception.
5	1390089600	A little small, but I wanted a small one because it doesn't take up a lot of counter top space. Great for multiple uses. Very good quality and has lasted a long time.
5	1390003200	I love toaster ovens.  They're super nifty and I can make toast one second, and pizza the next.  Perfect for a college student who doesn't want to wait for the oven to heat up, or who doesn't have access to the kitchen.  It's definitely resilient;  my roommate set a loaf of pita bread on fire about three years back and it's still going!
2	1389916800	The toaster oven gets very very hot. It lit a couple of my dishes on fire. Then after a year it broke. The auto shut off and timer stopped working. Should of done more research.
5	1389657600	We use one in the office and I just purchased this one for home. It's heats quickly and gets the job done. The top does get very hot though so watch out if you store anything on top of it...
5	1389571200	This is the best toaster oven I've ever owned.  It has sooooo much to love about it:- Gets hot fast, toasts fast-  Can really truly be used for an oven (when you don't want to heat up your whole house)-  Easy to broil with-  Easy to keep clean---love the slide-out crumb tray!-  Has a feature where the door can hook the tray if desired so it auto-slides out (great feature that will keep you from burning yourself and makes food retrieval easy)-  multiple settings makes it very versatile-  comes with a broiler pan!- attractivenice capacityThe ONLY negative of this is that, as other reviewers noted, the top and sides get hot (so you can't set anything on top of it or near it that is flammable).  It is not an &#34;under-the-counter&#34; type oven---it sits on the countertop.  But for the price, this is an unbelievably versatile little tool.  And you won't need a separate toaster anymore.  It comfortably fits four slices of toast. I've even used it for making grill cheeses when my stove was on the blink (though you have to line the pan with foil and flip the sandwiches, or else it gets too messy).  And I've often used it for things like broiling chicken for two, or baking appetizers, when the primary oven was full on holidays or when I just didn't want to heat up the whole kitchen.Buy it---you won't be sorry.  It's a good product and has lasted with regular, daily use.
5	1389571200	I love this toaster. I love how I can make just about anything inside. Doesn't burn my food . quicker than an oven
3	1389484800	This works ok, but having three dials to mess with is confusing at least until you get it down (switching from &#34;oven&#34; to &#34;bagel&#34; requires three adjustments).  And from &#34;bagel&#34; to &#34;toast&#34; requires two.
5	1389398400	My Black AND Decker Toaster oven has saved us energy cost and time, being available to cook as well warn warm food up is what has made this item so available to us.
1	1389225600	This toaster oven was about 2 years old and worked ok, but fire safety concerns causes me to rate this one star.  It started smoking suddenly and I turned it off and unplugged it.  I took it apart and found heat marks and a terminal insulator melted.  I believe this toaster oven could have burned our house down.  LOOK AT OTHER SIMILAR REVIEWS!  It is a cheap product made in China.  I would avoid buying one if you are shopping.
1	1388880000	Like other users have complained, when you use the toast setting it will stop ticking after a while and go into the &#34;stay on&#34; setting.  We have burned many pieces of toast because we weren't standing there watching it to stop it manually.  We have never seen ours stop on its own with the final ding, we always have to turn the knob to &#34;off&#34; ourselves.  Never had so much trouble with a toaster oven!
5	1388880000	I love this toaster oven. everything about it is great. the easy of use, the design and the output is always great.
5	1388707200	I have toasted bread and frozen waffles and both came out even in color.  I use the bake function to re-heat foods I want to be crispy like homemade waffles, fried chicken and pizza.  Turn past 20 minutes and then to the amount of time you want.  Works great, looks good, not heavy and easy to move on and off the counter to storage in the pantry.
5	1388707200	Just what i was looking for! Neat, compact, efficient and unobtrusive. Great when cooking for one or two people as you don't have to turn on your main oven.Would recommend it highly.
3	1388361600	This is a smaller version of the 6-slice toaster oven that I had previously.  It works fine for what I need it for, except it uses a smaller tray.
1	1388188800	This oven is a fire hazard -- I have had trouble (burning toast, not switching off, hot exterior) with it since I first purchased it 3-4 months ago, so I learned to not walk away and to switch it off when I saw that the toast was "good enough."  Today I walked away to answer the phone, with the oven set on "toast" (I do not use it for anything other than making toast, because of the ealier experience).  When I returned to the kitchen, the slice of bread was in flames -- actual flames, not just burned to a crisp.  This should be taken off the market.
4	1388016000	This toaster oven does a very nice job of toasting bread.  We love it for the many things it can do otherwise.  One thing I would like to see, would be a light inside the oven.
3	1388016000	When making toast, you must guess at the appropriate &#34;doneness&#34; level - there are no markings for &#34;light,medium or dark.
2	1387929600	No simple way to toast bread. 3 settings to get it to toast. The last time the toast caught on fire.
5	1387756800	I love my toaster oven,works great  and has a timer for toasting bread or cooking or heating up food.,I even made home made pizza in it came out great.
5	1387670400	Liked mine so well,got one for my daughter.It toasts evenly on both sides.The knobs are easy to turn rather than the round ones.It has a pull out tray in the bottom to easily keep clean.
1	1387584000	Annoyingly, the high-limit thermostat turns the elements off well before the toast browns.  The result is BAKED, dried out, not browned  bread.  Same problem with the broiler.It works OK as an oven.  I imagine it was designed by lawyers.
5	1387584000	I like it very much, it is lightweight and attractive, Best is the crumb tray.,....it slides right out for an easy wipe or wash !Had to learn, though, not to set the dials too high when making toast or it got too dark....
4	1387584000	Timer feature works well.  Overall does a nice job of heating food.  The small size is plenty adequate. Fits on the counter nicely.
1	1387152000	It is very slow, and the time ticks down with an annoying sound.  Worse than the older models.  Returned it.
2	1386979200	I have always bought Black & Decker ovens and been very satisfied.  I find I need to keep watching the settings that change on their own.  I probably would not buy this brand again.
5	1386892800	Terrific product. We have had it for years, and it still works great. Does exactly what you want it to do: toast, heat, cook. Nice large heating area; intuitive controls that even I can figure out. Not too ugly, for a toaster-oven, either.
2	1386892800	I bought this toaster in 2010 to replace the ancient one I inherited from my parents. I kind of wish I'd held on to the old one.The top heating element burned out after about 12 months- and this thing doesn't even get used every day.The toaster is still usable, but to get an even toast on bread I have to flip it over halfway through toasting. So toasting kind of works. Baking works. Broiling does not. I almost wish both elements had burned out so I would be forced to buy a new one... as is it still works and I feel like it would be a waste to toss it, but now I'm stuck with a gimpy toaster oven.Even after all that, I still would have given it 3 stars. I'm used to the gimpiness, plus I'm stern but fair.However, I docked it another star because the cord is insanely short. I have a tiny kitchen, but I have to have this thing awkwardly set up sideways on my counter. Otherwise the cord doesn't reach. Or I suppose I could have extension cords running all over my kitchen.It's really frustrating that these appliance companies keep coming up with more and more ways to reverse engineer and cut corners so we're stuck with sub-par products that we have to replace every 2 years.
4	1386720000	Functions very good and I used it so much that I wore it out and bought another one.  Good Features!~
5	1386547200	This piece of equipment works perfectly. Some people wrote that theirs caught fire when used. Maybe if they read the instructions and were there when cooking, a fire could have been prevented. I use mine almost everyday and haven't had any problems.
5	1386547200	have had this for years now and it still works like it's brand new! would never purchase any other brand except this one.
5	1386547200	have had this for years now and it still works like it's brand new! would never purchase any other brand except this one.
4	1386547200	A little small. Controls are not as user friendly as others. But it heats up really fast and works OK.
4	1386547200	A little small. Controls are not as user friendly as others. But it heats up really fast and works OK.
5	1386460800	Easy to use with multiple cooking features such as toasting, baking, and broiling.  You can also set it using the timer or using the &#34;always on&#34; option.
4	1386374400	It's good all around and I use it a lot. It is tough to get even toasting on bread, but not terrible.
4	1386028800	This is still going strong after a few years. Gave it four stars because the rack the tray sits on comes out too far when you remove food or the tray and the door won't close. Not a big deal just an annoyance when you are trying to do 10 things at once in the kitchen.  Hard to clean but all toaster ovens are from my experience.
4	1386028800	I bought it for a rental oroperty, but have used it a few times myself. My only issue was that you have to turn the dial past Toast and then back to get it to toast. It does say that in small letters near the dial but if you're like me, and didn't notice the wording, you will have lots of burnt toast before you figure it out.
5	1386028800	This toaster is five star to me because you can't beat the price and the performance. One of the best buys you can broil, roast, bake.
1	1385942400	This toaster caught on fire on my 14 year old son this morning. I haven't had it for a full year yet. Very disappointed.
5	1385942400	Item does not work!!! I wish I would have looked at it sooner after making the purchase. A lot of the times I see a good deal and make a purchase...typically do not have "bad luck" with receiving broken items...wish I would have opened the box sooner, definitely would have been returned or replaced!! Highly disappointed!!!Update: The item works, it took forever to set(turning the item past toast etc) Thankful for the helpful customer service representatives.
5	1385942400	This toaster oven is very nice, easy to use, easy to clean and not too big for counter space if you live in an apartment complex or condo.
5	1385856000	One of the best buys I have made in a long time. You can broil, roast, bake and it has been used for all purposes and I am  very pleased with performance and for the price it was great.
5	1385769600	I've used this twice daily for over a year. Great value for the price. We'll definitely try this brand again when this one dies.
5	1385510400	My second Black and Decker toaster oven purchased in over 10 years. Need I say more? This one is larger but works perfectly and is very easy to clean. It has been used every day for one thing or the other and we've had this new one for at least six months with no issues.
5	1385251200	The reason why we bought this particular brand is because my mother has one and of the slide out crumb tray makes for easy cleaning. We really enjoy it!
3	1385164800	You get what you pay for! I didnt want to spend a lot so I got my moneys worth. Its been going pretty well for about two years now. Its not perfect, but its better then paying 100+ for one that will (maybe) give me evenly browned toast. Its easy to clean, which is very nice. Its simple. it gets the job done. You cant expect much for $45 bucks.
5	1385078400	this toaster oven is heat's up pretty good speed. the tray comes out and easy to clean. simple knobs use
5	1385078400	Accurate temperature settings, long lasting, efficient, small, convenient, mobile, easy to clean, and easy to use.Not intended for serious baking but perfect for everything else.
5	1384819200	many fine uses for this and it is fairly easy to clean. The broiler could be a bit hotter as it's toasting function is slow. Good value and rugged. It gets hot onthe outside when used for a while so be careful around kids.
5	1384646400	This has been a great toaster oven, I've used it almost daily since getting it, it now stays outside the apartment and used almost exclusively to broil fresh fish !  yes fish !  and since the smell can be quite &#34;fishy&#34;  that's the reason it's outside. So far it's working great
3	1384560000	My oven was about what I expected for the price. Basic...but OK. A little bit flimsy here and there but it does the job.
4	1384473600	I really like this toaster oven.  We went through two toaster ovens in 3 years.. and we've had this one for a while now.  It's small, but we don't have a lot of room so small works for us. All we could find in this size previously were cheap ones. We wanted small, but nice... this is the perfect find for that category.
2	1384473600	This oven is still working but it doesn't work well. You get what you pay for. I can't depend on it to cook anything as an oven. It warms rolls and toasts bread ok.
5	1383868800	Gave this oven as a Christmas gift to a family member some time ago and it has served her family well.  It is still working and used every day.  I have an earlier model myself and it has served me well for 5 years.
4	1383782400	I have used this toaster for over two years. Its easy to clean, bakes well, doesn't take too long to heat up either.Overall very satisfied.
4	1383523200	It's good looking, sleek and not too big, sits on the counter with room to spare. it's easy to use, mostly we use it to toast breads and it does this faster and more evenly than our last toaster. We also use it to crisp cooked chicken and it does this very well too. I don't cook or bake in it so I can't comment on that. For an everyday toaster it's perfect.
5	1383436800	A &#34;Big Bang for the buck&#34;! A good quality, compact, Toast-R-Oven by Black & Decker. I use it now for 3 years. No problems. Easy to clean, and  the lower bottom tray, comes very handy to collect the crumbs .etc...
3	1383436800	Bought the same model a few years ago. We like it, but recently we melted a plastic container there, and created quite a mess. We decide to get a new one. Shopped around but could not find a better alternative (with the price range that we are considering); therefore we did an encore purchase. This version seems to be slightly different from the old one. It seems the quality is not as good as the old one. They probably have a different factory making them now. The auto-slide feature is gone, and cooking seems taking longer time. They just lost one star from me.
5	1383177600	I love it. it's  great for singles, It can do everything my regular oven can do.  I would recommend it to my family and friends.
5	1382572800	Very nice appliance.  Shopped around and determined this had the best value.I would recommend it!  Oh, I hear the &#34;ding&#34;--my bagel is done.
3	1382572800	It just okay - a little complicated for a Toaster Oven - should be simpler.  But I've only used a few times so hoping once I get use to it it will be better.
4	1382400000	Trust Black and Decker the most for high quality. This Toaster oven takes a while to learn all the bells and whistles, but there isn't a day that goes by that we don't use it at least once or twice. Saves a bundle for two people as opposed to heating our large electric oven!
2	1382140800	The toaster itself works fine so far but I have had it less than a year and the numbers and function settings are already rubbing off so I can no longer read them. It is rather difficult to use if you can't set the temperature properly. I would not recommend this product. I contacted the company since it was still under warranty and in order to have them replace it I had to send a check for shipping and buy a special bubble wrap envelope to return the plug to them. If they stand by their products they should make a return easy and cost free.
1	1382054400	We wanted to replace an $80 Cuisinart that was 4 years old before the elements failed. Saw this Black & Decker for 1/2 the price. BIG MISTAKE! The Black & Decker was 1/2 the size and the wind-up timer failed in two weeks. Toasting performance was marginal as it has one element on the top and one on the bottom. It really will only hold two slices of bread for toasting. It is not deep enough to hold a dinner plate for warming. Amazon did a great job fulfilling the order, but the product is very poor quality.I just processed the refund through Spectrum Home Appliances and now I'm going back on Amazon to order the Cuisinart that I should have stayed with. Live and Learn.
3	1381276800	Toast seems to burn quickly and when toasting is uneven.Slide is flimsyNot sure if I like the door pulling the tray out.Bakes ok but still burns the top faster than the food is cooked.
1	1380758400	Recieved it quick with my Prime Status. Wife cooked our breaded fish from Schwan's that night, all went well. Two days latter got up and fixed some toast and a fire started about one minute latter, the heating elements started shooting out fire for some reason.Was able to put out before it did much damage.It did burn the toast to charcoal. Since this was my first Black & Decker Toast-R- Oven that malfunctioned in 20+ years of having different models that worked fine until they died after 8 to 10 years of service. I have ordered a different model. I'll let you know if thier quality control has gone down the drain.
5	1380412800	I gave a 5 star rating because of priorty experience with Black & Decker products.This toaster oven works great and is very easy to use.I highly recommend this product.
4	1379980800	I love this toaster.  It's really easy to use and so much more convenient for quick food items like personal pizza's, egg rolls or grilled cheese.  It heats up faster than an oven.  And when you are toasting your bread, you can actually see how brown it gets without worrying about it burning like with regular toasters.
5	1379980800	The quality of this item surpassed my expectations. It is attractive and meets my needs for toasting,  baking small items.  Temp levels are true to settings.  Not all small appliances do their job even if they are expensive....this one is a surprise!!
3	1379808000	I was very pleased with this oven until the bottom element stopped working completely a couple of weeks ago. I have had the toaster oven not quite one year. The size of the toaster oven is perfect for my counter and my toasting needs. My son has not been happy with its results when heating frozen snack items. Perhaps the element had been inadequate longer than I was aware. The pull out crumb tray made cleaning easy. The dials made it especially easy to use. I will purchase another oven with similar features; not sure if I will buy the same model since I got unlucky with this particular unit.
5	1379721600	After reading all the reviews, I purchased this model at a super sale at a department store.  I would not hesitate to buy it again.  Family members have expensive and larger ovens that don't come close to the efficiency of this one.  Have had mine for 3 years with not a problem.  My mother paid seven times what I did and hers had to be replaced twice
2	1379289600	After 5-10 uses, I tried wiping the faceplate with a wet paper towel and to my surprise the labels began smearing off. I wasn't applying excessive force, nor was I using any abrasive cleaning products (just water on a paper towel). So now, the knob that regulates temperature is missing half of the temperate labels.
1	1379203200	Took 5 minutes to do toast to medium brown and I had to turn the toast to get there. I prefer dark toast, but gave up as I was hungry. We tried this Black & Decker TRO480BS  five times and never would it work properly.It is attractive and a nice size, but that is all I can say for it.  We have a 20 year old Black and Decker that is getting very tired, but felt we should stay with the company due to its good service.Quality has obviously decreased markedly. Avoid this disaster if you like toast.
1	1378944000	I purchased this unit about a year and half ago.  Was working ok, thermostat was a little off.  Most recently started burning toast when in the past it did not (same dial position).  Then, last night while making toast it started smoking and smelled like plastic burning.  Shut it off and unplugged it. Today the top dial still smells like burning plastic.  I'm glad I did not leave it unattended..could have had a major problem.
2	1378771200	We selected this oven based on its small size as we wanted something that would fit in our appliance bay. The bottom element stopped working after about three months, and B&D; replaced it under warranty. About two months after they replaced it, they sent a postcard asking me to mail in the power cord from the broken oven, which of course I had thrown out.  A year later, smoke starting coming out around the temperature control dial of the replacement oven with a faint burnt electrical smell.  The timer and the top element both stopped working after this happened.Although the price is pretty reasonable, it's disappointing to get less than two years of service out of any appliance.
5	1378252800	The cord is not even 2' long, so unless you are putting this AT a plug it WILL NOT reach; there is absolutely no way I can put mine in my kitchen without buying an extension cord...1' cord is a joke. Also the crumb tray does not sit in very snug leaving a nice big gap for heat to escape through. That being said it is a good size and so far heats quickly and evenly.Edited 1/24/14: After having this for a while I bumped it up to 5 stars. Yes the cord is super-short and I had to purchase an small extension cord to plug it in even though it sits right in front of the outlet, but it works very well. Heats up very quickly and heat seems very well-balanced between the elements, toasts both sides of bread almost exactly the same. I have seen some reviews that complain about it not toasting well but I think most of those people don't understand that it cooks with heat and even when elements are not actively/visibly heating they are still giving off heat. I was pleasantly surprised that even though there is a fairly large gap where the crumb tray inserts that it has enough of a convection effect with the vents to keep much heat from coming out there.
5	1378080000	The design and color fits with my other kitchen appliances.  It heats up quickly and toasts nicely.  The bread crumb tray pulls out with ease.  I couldn't ask for anything more.
2	1377475200	I purchased this toaster oven less than 9 months ago and have found that it does less of an effective job of toasting every time I use it.  The elements that toast the top of the bread barely light up.  I'm extremely disappointed with this toaster.
1	1376352000	Our old toaster oven died after 5 years of hard use, it was time.  We purchased this toaster oven to replace it in late February and it has already started to fail.  The bulb on the bottom no longer works so you have to flip your toast over half way through to toast both sides, as well as stir anything that you are &#34;baking&#34; since there is no heat coming up from the bottom.  The rack gets stuck all of the time, so in order to close the door you have to manually push the hot rack back in to the oven.Unfortunately, we are also not able to return this poor quality piece of equipment because we can not contact the seller and the return window was 1 month....off to purchase a better product at a store that we can physically return to if there are any issues.
3	1376006400	Pro: looks goodDoesn't take up too much spaceHandy crumb tray remove ableCon: doesn't fit 4 slices of breadIf bread is too close to the edge, it steamsToaster dial is fussy
2	1376006400	Would be great if it cooked evenly, but alas it does not. Great size for small space, like in a camper. Another problem is that the outside gets really hot. It could use double walls or something.
5	1375747200	It works fine - everything just as I expected from any Black & Decker product. Always have good results from their productsI have several Black & Decker products - all very satisfactory
5	1375315200	My boyfriend is VERY picky about his things but I gave him this toaster and he actually likes it! He hasn't burnt anything in it yet and it fits anything he wants to put in there easily and still doesn't take up much space in his small kitchen
5	1375315200	This is the 2nd Black & Decker toaster oven I have owned. It does what it is supposed to do and looks nice on the counter. The dials are easy to use. I like that it has a timer because I am prone to walk away & forget something is heating up.  It's a good size and doesn't crowd my counter. I recommend it!
3	1375315200	I'm normally only cooking for myself and using the large oven is a waste of electricity and heats the house too much. As a result, I've been using toaster ovens to do the majority of my cooking. The oven works very well: it heats and makes toast consistently. However, the amount of interior space (both horizontally and vertically) is smaller than one would think from looking at it. It also tapers from the bottom to the top which loses some space for larger items. The toaster oven I had previously had a rubber guard on the door (not just the handle as in this model). As a result, the first week or so I had this one I continually touched the very hot top of the door - it isn't a big deal and I got used to it, but noteworthy nonetheless. It would also be nice if there was a catch to pull out the metal tray when the door is opened. While this oven does what it is supposed to do very well (heat evenly and consistently), the want of an extra inch or so of space in the interior would probably push me toward a different one when this needs to be replaced.
5	1375142400	This is a great toaster/oven combo and has an easy to clean crumb tray. We use it every day to heat rolls and toast.
2	1374451200	My husband insisted he wanted one with a slide out tray so we got this one. The rack and the toast itself (or bagels) get so hot you have to use thongs to pick them up. The kids like to make their own toast too and it seems like it creates way too much heat too fast. The little icons that show how burnt your toast would be are innacurate. I'm barely at setting 2 and my bagels just got fried.
5	1374364800	What's unique about this model, sadly, no longer exists.  I bought it because it has little hooks on the glass door that pull the shelf forward when you open the door, which makes it easier to get things out without getting burned.  However, the model being sold now has the same model number but no hooks.
5	1374192000	now she can cook anything she wants as she loves cooking cakes, meals and many other nice thing she will be so excited when she unwraps this on christmas day
4	1374105600	Have this model in my primary residence.  Look for quality first then ease of care!This model is great for both!!!!  Slide out crumb tray is very convenient for general cleaning and the entire unit does not have to be unpluged, lifted and shaken out.  Have owned this model for several years.  Purchased a 2nd one for a summer residence.  Very satisfied.

5	1374019200	Much better than having to light the oven - especially in this brutally hot weather. (can't anything be purchased these days without being asked for a rating??!!)
5	1374019200	It is not strong build. But who moves the oven everyday? I keep it on one place all the time. Size is definite small enough to not fit a whole size of frozen pizza. I usually cut it half and cook seperately. Being not cook myself, I wish the manual indicates detail description of cooking mode.
2	1374019200	1) I used this mainly for toasting.  There is no preset for toasting slices of bread for lighter to darker.  The only control is an inaccurate analog timer.  Many times the bread got burnt.  The marking need to be made for each minute between 1-10 so at least the timer can somewhat be set better.  That would have cost pennies!2) The upper element failed too early.  I see why they have a 2-year warranty only.  Basically, throwaway units after a couple of years.3) Sides gets VERY hot.It was cheap and not a bad buy - I just hate throwing away things after a couple of years!I would prefer a Stainless Steel exterior because it retains it looks over time.Eveness of toasting should be the first goal and this unit does not meet that goal.

5	1373760000	We enjoy using this product. It fits into our kitchen shelf nicely and is easy toKeep clean. The only problem we have is we have lost the instructions for theOven. Would it be possible for you to send another set of instructions to us?
5	1373760000	I ordered this for my son who lives with two other 20+ guys.  One of them is extremely messy and careless, yet even he has not broken or started a fire with this toaster oven.  It has baked mini pizzas, toasted sandwiches and is much appreciated by the three all too single guys in the house.  There is a rule that they must unplug it after using...and one of them always forgets...yet the house has not been burned down.
1	1373328000	IF I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD!  This is the worst toaster oven I have ever owned!  My first toaster oven I owned (1977) was a B&D and it lasted for many years and worked great. My second was also a B&D and it too worked great, but didn't last anywhere near as long as the first.  The third was a Kenmore and it worked good for about 5 years.  Then I got this one.  It's impossible to set it for perfect toast, so you have to watch it and manually turn it off before the toast burns.  If you turn it just a little past the off position,  it stay's on which is a safety hazard.  I also use mine as an oven from time to time.  Brownies do not bake, french bread pizza's do not bake nor anything else I have tried to bake, even when I preheat the oven and set the temp. for higher than called for and leaving it in for longer than called for. Don't waste your money on this one!
2	1372550400	The timer mechanism broke after only a few weeks, but I fudge it, and manage to warm the bread OK.
1	1372464000	I purchased two of these - one for home and one for my small office - and neither toasts well.  In fact it takes forever to toast because it essentially bakes the bread rather than actually toasting.  The one at home recently stopped heating at all after only one year.  I would not recommend this toaster oven.
1	1372291200	I had a Black and Decker Spacemaker Toaster oven, model TRO405 that lasted for over 20 years, it worked great. It toasted, baked, did everything you needed for a small meal. When I got married, my wife looked at it and said, "that is old, let's get a new one". I told her to try it out. She soon realized how handy it was.  Furthermore, I have walked into million dollar houses with stainless steel everything and I still see the old style B&D; Spacemaker ovens in the corner, with a bit of rust or whatever, but people keep them forever. Why?Well, products like the TRO480BS are the answer. They don't toast, or do so really slow on certain parts of the bread. They don't bake. Worst of all the controls are a disaster. On my TRO405 I pushed one lever to make toast. On this thing I have to turn two dials and set the timer to the middle and back to 10. After two months, it is going in the trash. I am tempted to buy a used TRO405. The element broke on my TRO405 and I can't get parts.
3	1372032000	After accidentally burning down our last one, we decided to replace our toaster oven with the exact same model since it was a good price/value.  Well, even though it's the same model, B&D has reduced the features.  Little things like the cheaper knobs and front panel finish can be overlooked, but the rack no longer slides out when the door is opened like our first one.  That's pretty annoying after having gotten used to it.  Otherwise, it's still a good unit, just not as good as the first one.
5	1371859200	Black & Decker home appliances, (formerly GE), are the best, in my opinion. They keep re-designing the Toaster Oven, and when I need to replace one, I go to my favorite brand. The last one lasted for more than ten years with constant use by a very busy family. This new design is my new favorite. Wonder how long this will last.
5	1371600000	We love this toaster oven. It cooks evenly, heats quickly and I feel saves money from heating the entire oven up every time we want to make a slice of left over pizza.  It does get hot to the touch on the exterior, as do all toaster ovens. It is easy to clean and we would definately buy another.
2	1371513600	The top heating component stopped working after a year and a half.  The outside of the toaster also started to look burnt after normal daily usage.  Stainless steel appearance turned brown.
2	1371340800	I was disappointed in this item.  I find the controls somewhat confusing.My husband hated the way it toasts, so we wound up buying a regular 2-slice toaster which he is happy with.Perhaps I will like the oven if I figure out how to operate it correctly.
1	1371168000	I don't think there is enough space here to tell you all the things that are lousy about this oven. Start with a baking pan that is so small it can only hold 2 waffles at a time. The worst part is the amount of time it takes to preheat this bomb. You have to run your electric bill up for a full 15 minutes or more to get it to your desired heat. Forget toasting. It just doesn't happen. You need to use broil and watch it like a hawk. I take the blame for having the stupidity to buy a toaster oven that only has a 30 minute timer. Big inconvenience. And now, after owning it about 2 weeks and taking perfect care of it the tray crumb does not slide back in evenly which prevents the door from closing snuggly. More wasted electricity. The only thing nice I can say about it is that it looks good in my contemporary kitchen. I read a lot of good reviews about this item but really it is a "buyer beware" item.
4	1370995200	A very nice oven...  The included food tray is great for holding just about anything you want to put in there.  I actually usually just cover it in foil so I don't have to wash it every time I use it.  The &#34;crumb tray&#34; is a little strange.  It's really part of the bottom of the unit, not just a tray that slides out.
1	1370995200	Black and Decker toaster ovens are the WORST appliances on the market.  I've personally gone through FOUR in maybe ten years, each time all efforts to have the unit repaired instead of throwing it away were fruitless.  I understand that the cost of labor for repair makes an appliance "totaled" (to use car lingo) but the fact that EACH one has broken in such a short period of time infuriates me! This morning my toaster oven wouldn't turn off and it's just over three years old.  Now I have to plug it in when I want to use it.  Went to their website and - surprise!  No quick way to get in touch with them, couldn't figure out quickly how to write a review.  DON'T  BUY ONE!  I'm going BREVILLE this time - Cook's Illustrated's TOP RATED toaster oven.  At twice the price of B&D's it'll be a splurge but I will NEVER BUY BLACK & DECKER AGAIN!
5	1370563200	At first the size was an issue. But after using this little oven it makes up for the space.Works very good. Getting urself acquainted with it takes a little time but worth while.
4	1369785600	This is a very nice toaster oven.  It looks good and seems to be made very solid.  It has nice cooking features and works quite well.  My only complaint is that it seems slow to heat up.  I got this to replace an old worn out toaster oven and although this one works great is just seems to take about twice as long to get hot and cook things.
4	1369612800	My daughter is stationed at Fort Polk and her living quarters has a cook top but no oven.  This counter top toaster oven is perfect!!
1	1369526400	I've had a toaster oven broiler since the 70's. My last Black and Decker performed phenomenally and just wore out. I purchased this one just over 2 years ago based on its appearance, small footprint and ability to toast and broil. The toast function, now on a dial instead of a lever, is a very fine line between burnt and raw. After 2 years and 2 months (2 yr warranty) it gave out completely. All I had done over the 2 years is toast 1 slice 4 days a week at most. No broiling or oven use in that time. I just want a small unit that can toast, but can also do a small steak on occasion. All of the current alternatives have large footprints or like this one, are not of quality. Please bring back the simple toaster oven broiler with the ability to set the toast time (permanently) and start it with a button or lever and is of quality to last longer than 2 years.
5	1369440000	Very happy with this purchase.  Read several reviews on the smaller sized toaster ovens before deciding on this one.  Had a few questions I put out to folks who had already purchased this and decided this was the one for me.  I made the right decision!
5	1369180800	Gave this to a person in need who  hasn't had one in years--- loves it. It can do so much, she said.
5	1369094400	Nice design, toasts evenly and bakes little pizza bagles like a champ. The elements don't turn off when you open the door in toast mode.
5	1369094400	What else can I say it works, it does what it's suppose to. Easy to operate. look good on counter.
1	1368921600	I purchased this toaster oven in Dec 2012. We used it a couple times a week for bagels or toast, about 4 months after I got it, it failed to shut off after the timer sounded and I removed my bagel. Total on time 20 minutes. Handle melted off, it took 4 weeks for the melted plastic smell to dissipate from my kitchen. I had to unplug it to actually turn it off even though the timer and temp gauge were off.
3	1368835200	It makes great toast.  But, I have not quite figured it out-even after reading the instructions.  I watch the toast and take it out when ready.  I have not let it go to full time on the timer----just need to understand it better.  With time-----------.
4	1368748800	I have a B&D blender so it's nice for things to look consistent on my countertops.  And like my blender this taoster oven does what I need it to do: toast bread, english muffins, maybe a single serving of veggies.  It is what it is and I aint trying to make a meal in there or anything.
5	1368403200	This is a great toaster oven. I love it. I have cooked refrigerator rolls in it and they turned out perfect. Today I baked a boxed carrot cake in it and it worked great. You just have to divide the mix and cook each pan separately. I haven't had any problems with it at all.
5	1368403200	Have had the toaster for a year now and use it every day. An important staple for our kitchen. Great size and surprisingly easy to keep clean.
1	1368230400	We have bought several of these Black & Decker small toaster-ovens over many years. The first ones lasted several years, but each toaster lasted a shorter time than the one before. This last toaster-oven was only 5 months old when it started smoking through one of the dials and had an electrical burn smell. It is too bad that the electrical system of this product is now so poorly done. It had a few good points: affordable price, a small foot print, and a great crumb tray. But it is A FIRE HAZARD. NO RECOMMENDED.
2	1368057600	I am very sorry to say that I must revise my opinion on this toaster oven. Unfortunately after just 3&1/2 months of use the off switch broke and it developed a smell of burning electrical wires. It worked great while it worked for toasting, reheating and light baking.
5	1368057600	This Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven is a quality product. I've had other, more expensive Toaster Ovens by other makes, but this one is the best I've had. Controls are easy to use, the oven heats quickly, and it looks great. Let's see if it holds up over time (the others did not). Recommended.
1	1367712000	When I received it the carton appeared to have already been opened and resealed.  After set up, the thermostat did not work.  It took 40 min to heat to 350o.  I checked the temp with an oven thermometer and it NEVER heated to above 350o.  The heating element would get red hot and immediately click off. I packed it up and sent it back and will never buy another Black & Decker anything!
5	1367625600	makes great toast n bagels fast heats up great and not bad for baking small stuff thats why i buy black n decker
2	1367625600	Replacement of two previous toaster ovens. None perfect but this is the worst. In a two person family this appliance is both useful and necessary. I use it to bake and roast vegetables, make toasted sandwiches, etc. BUT the racks slip during sue, the bake pan is flimsy and smaller than I had in previous ovens of the type and size, and the temp does not get up to speed. Example. To bake a potato that should be cooked at 400 degrees for 40 yo 60 minutes, I need almost two hours. i will keep the darn thing, but definitely would not recommend or replace with a Black and Decker.
4	1367452800	This is a very good toaster. My office has one in the kitchen and, after using it for several weeks, I bought the same model for home. While I think that the three-knob interface could have been simplified, it is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. However it is also easy to accidentally set it wrong. This usually happens when you want to make toast and the previous user set it to bake, thus leaving with you with bread that takes three times as long to brown. But that is really the only flaw.One suggestion I have is to cover both the baking sheet and the crumb tray tightly with foil. This will dramatically increase the life (or at least the cleanliness) of the unit.A few reviewers have stated the unit gets very hot on the top and sides. While I don't disagree, IT'S A TOASTER, and an inexpensive one at that. I have it on my counter, a cabinet overhead and various items stored to the side, and heat has never been a problem.
4	1366848000	So far I like the oven.  I use it almost every day for toast and for bagels.  It isn't too big so it fits on the counter not taking up too much space.
5	1366502400	I have had this model of a handy kitchen must-have over the years.  It is compact, easy to use and attractive on the counter.
1	1366502400	More often than not, the heating element remains on after the timer has stopped.  Also, the heating element does not shut off when you open the door (unlike previous B&D models).  Making toast requires constant vigilance.  B&D is making a lot of junk these days.

5	1366243200	Honestly, I don't know what more you can want out of a toaster oven. I am definitely surprised that this toaster oven is so well made and works exactly as it should despite being far lower priced than the over ovens on Amazon.  I actually have purchased 3 of these. My sister bought me the first one 3 years ago as a house warming gift to heat up my beloved pizza slices. I still have it and love it! It's still in great condition, heats up quick and consistently. I live alone, so I bake small quantities of fish fillets or chicken in it and they always come out exactly as they did the last time. You know, awesome.I was so satisfied with it, I bought one for my boyfriend and for my boss, both of whom like to cook/reheat food quick and easy like me.  Clean up is a dream. You remove the bottom tray and stick in the dishwasher, same for the wire rack and pan that comes with.  If I want to be EXTRA lazy, I just coat the wire rack with foil to keep the drippings off the bottom, crumple and toss after. The design is really sleek, the knobs are sturdy. I didn't find there was an ostentatious ticking. I love that the "on" light is blue, rather than red/orange, nor does it have a crazy, loud and annoying "Ding".What else is there to say?
3	1365897600	After nine yrs. with my old Black & Decker, I decided to replace it. I miss the push down toast button. Now I have three dials to contend with to make toast. The oven tray is small so I saved the old one to use. The power cord is ridiculously short and on the wrong side of the unit for my plug. It bakes ok but a week after I paid $42.00 I saw the exact same model in Wal-Mart for $29.99.

5	1365897600	Does everything it is supposed to do. And is easy and simple to use. Nice looking and easy to care for.
1	1365724800	Everything about this toaster is cheaply made.1.) The crumb tray doesn't fit properly as one side sticks out 1/4" due to poor metal forging.2.) The toaster never keeps the elements on for long enough. It will take forever to toast something, as once the element gets red hot, it's shut off soon after, then left off for 30 seconds or so until it starts up again. You can hear the thermostat click over in side the toaster and shut off the elements. So even on toast setting the oven bakes everything instead of toasting. Pathetic. I bet they did this "quick fix" to stop this toaster's poor track record of bursting into flames and shattering its glass door.3.) Just like other cheap toasters, the labels around the dial will rub off over time.4.) Power cord is WAY too short. I know it's a safety thing, but the least they could have done is give a few more feet. Two feet of power cable is pathetically short.Don't buy this unit: avoid at all costs. Worst excuse for a toaster oven I've ever seen from Black & Decker. The brand name means nothing anymore with the cruddy products they've released like this toaster.
5	1365552000	For many years I was looking again for an owen from Black Decker. The best oneVery good and useful, and beautiful for my kitchen
4	1365465600	This works just as it is intended. It does a good job with the temperature consistency, the controls are easy to operate and it looks pretty good in the kitchen.
3	1365465600	I purchased this because I wanted something I could use to heat up the random bagel in the morning, and also toast 4 slices of bread at a time and make open-faced sandwich melts. It does work rather well in that regard, however, I think finding the correct setting for toast and/or bagel is more a personal preference, for example, if I put it all on the standard settings my toast comes out looking like it got a bad sunburn, rather than a bronze. I do like the little thing, however, it does take some tweaking to get what you want in terms of usage preference, etc.
1	1365292800	I'm not sure it even lasted 6 months....maybe more like 3.  The dial to toast has a VERY fine margin, like those awful hotel showers where you either have scalding hot or freezing cold water.  The toaster will give you untoasted food or burntly toasted food.  Also cooked the items in the back more than the front, and eventually only burnt the right side while leaving the left side frozen.Worst $30 I've ever spent (which is still better than the $120 we spent on the Cadillac of toaster before this).
3	1364947200	First, as others have mentioned, this oven DOES IN FACT get stuck in the on position!!! I have caught mine on two separate occasions. You turn the timer knob, but it fails to start counting down. I come back in 10 minutes and the timer is still exactly where I put it. The key to look out for is the ticking. If you don't hear the timer ticking, it's stuck. Give the knob a flick and it'll start up. Watch the blue light to ensure the oven is off when you're done. It works correctly the vast majority of the time, but I guess this could end very badly for some. Just exercise some supervision (as you should be), and you'll be fine.This oven is large enough for most any need. I'm able to fit my square baking pan in there without issue. It also gets plenty hot enough to cook/toast anything. Frozen fries on a tray take some time, but turn out very well. The included trays and racks are a little cheap, but do the job. Like many toaster ovens, the glass door has two hooks on the inside which hook around the wire rack to slightly pull it forward when the door is opened. While it kind of works, I frequently find myself wrestling with it. I think there's just too much slop in it for it to be effective.Really not much else I can say. It's been doing the job for almost a year now, but it certainly has its flaws. Oh well. At least it's cheap.
4	1364860800	This is a replacement for my last Black & Decker toaster oven. These appliances are well made and relatively inexpensive. I just use them until they break or out of &#34;pilot error&#34; I break them.The latter is the case for replacing my old unit with this one.I am happy with this upgraded model. It has good features for the price.
4	1364601600	We've been using ours for maybe 6 months now with no problems. It is easy to clean and works great.
5	1364083200	I've had this oven for about 2 years now and it works great.  The temperature is no more than 10-20 degrees off and as long as you set the dials correctly and don't cook too long everything turns out great.  The dials are not complicated - just toast, bake, broil, keep warm.  I haven't used the broil function but all others work well.  The toast setting based on a range of a white toast icon to black toast icon is a little unclear so I recommend erring on the side of caution and making it lighter as you can always toast longer if necessary.It is very easy to clean the tray that slides out at the bottom.  The handle on the front is sturdy and the knobs are easy to turn. As has been previously mentioned, the &#34;On&#34; dial does stay on if you turn it all the way to the left, but if you set the timer it shuts off after it hits the &#34;Off&#34; mark.  The sides do get hot so you don't want to have anything touching this or too close even while you're cooking.You definitely don't want to leave this unattended, but I think that goes for any toaster oven (or any oven at all, for that matter).  I feel fires with this oven are the exception, not the rule.This is a good buy - great value and low price. I highly recommend and would buy again.
3	1363996800	I love the look and the size of this model. The toaster toasts the toast evenly. However, be aware of the timer not working properly, at times the Toaster stays on despite of the pre-set timer.I have had three fires with this model, which caused some damage to my kitchen.
3	1363910400	So far I have not used my new toaster oven for much but am still having problems warming up my bagels or rolls. Not quite sure how to do it but am working on it. Toasts great but again am working on not getting my toast burnt. The instructions given are not as clear as I would like. I chose this item because of the good reviews given. I have had a Black and Decker before so feel sure that once i figure out how to work the different features to do what I want them to do i will be satisfied.
1	1363737600	The front panel metal is stamped so cheaply that the surface is not smooth.  And not rough on purpose.  It is simply incompetently undulating...yes, like Chinese quality from the 40's.  Amazing.  These days finishes are on purpose.  Shiny and smooth like the iPhone, or rough on purpose.  This is undulating by mistake and incompetence in manufacturing.  I am so embarrased I bought this product.  And Black and Decker, which I held as a national brand.  OMG, it is like hiring a contractor to tile a floor and ending up with holes between the tiles.  With dirt and grime and holes.  SO you say excuse me what about the holes...and the contractor says &#34;what you are a perfectionist?&#34; as he scratches himself.  OMG.  I hope some VP at Black and Decker gets fired over this 1940 quality product ending up at Amazon.
5	1363651200	I love this toaster oven, so far have only made toast, but it is perfect. I wanted a small one, and this fits my counter, I took measurements and it fit just right. Thanks for prompt delivery. It is slower than a toaster, but makes good toast, so I adjust.
1	1363564800	We had a B&D;  toaster that looks like this less than a year when the timer dial caught fire.  It was a fine toaster until then.  Most people would want something more durable.  Just used it once a day for morning toast for 1 person.Update:  To their credit, they honor their warranty and they did send me a new toaster oven model CT06120B. I'll try to let you know how this model works out. Hope they have their problems worked out.
3	1363564800	It was a pretty good toaster oven, and you can't argue with the price.  It has a 2 year warranty and it broke after 2 years and 8 days.
1	1363478400	We bought this toaster oven early last year, and for the most part, it operated about as well as any other toaster oven.  That is to say, we didn't have any high expectations, and it more or less lived up to that in performance.The main reason I'm giving it a 1 star here is that the timer dial stopped working last week and rendered the device useless.  It first stopped making the 'ding' noise when it was finished with a cycle, and shortly thereafter, we started smelling a burnt plastic odor coming from it.  The final time I used it before I unplugged it and threw it away I noticed smoke coming out from around the timer knob, accompanied by that same acrid odor.So, there you have it.  It is what it is... a completely disposable commodity.  At this price point, repairs are not worth it.  I just wish it had lasted a little more than, oh, one year.
5	1363305600	Couldn't have chosen better.  I get perfect toast and my bagels come out just the way I like them.  The handy crumb tray pulls out for cleaning with ease and it fits on my counter as if I had tried for a custom look.
1	1363219200	I purchased this oven for a vacation rental home less than one year ago.  Today my renter reported that he put two slices of toast in the oven and went and sat down.  He heard a load noise and the glass door on the oven had exploded shooting broken glass all over the counter top.  Luckily no one was in front of the oven when this happened.  I did some research and found many reports of this same thing happening with the Black & Decker ovens along with them catching on fire.  All I can tell you is - DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN or any other Black & Decker oven.
4	1363132800	I got this for &lt;$20 when it was on sale and am very pleased with it.  It does everything it is supposed to do, though the controls aren't as simple as the older Black & Decker models, so it's easy sometimes to forget to change it from toast to bake, etc., which is why I deducted a star.  No complaints otherwise.
4	1362960000	Got this when we moved into the new house because our old one was, well, old.This is a pretty good toast-r-oven the only thing thats somewhat weird about it is if you want to toast something, you have to turn the bottom knob all the way past 10, then turn it back to whatever setting you wantNothing too serious. Overall its pretty good
2	1362787200	i bought this toaster oven may 2011 and it worked well until recently when the cooking timer stopped working.  it just keeps on ticking...  i think a good toaster oven should last at least two years.
2	1362700800	the bottom dial has this setting where if you're not totally paying attention, it keeps the toaster on even after you're done. it seems dangerous.
5	1362700800	My brother requested a toaster oven for Christmas, so I gave him this one.  It was reasonably priced, and just what he wanted.He has been very pleased with it, and that's all I know, because I've never used it.
1	1362528000	I bought this model and TWICE now, it did not turn off and the toast caught on fire. Unless you are there to watch this like a hawk, you are at RISK of burning your house down. I estimate that the failure rate is about 1%. It seems low but what that means is that if you make toast daily, about four times a year, it will catch fire. This is a VERY bad and dangerous product. DO NOT BUY IT!
5	1362441600	Great so far - no problems. Only thing is it seems to take longer to toast than a regular toaster. Guess that's the price you pay for having a product that can also bake a mini pizza.
5	1362355200	I've had this toaster oven since Dec 2012, and I use it a lot! From my daily toasting of bread and bagel for breakfast to baking chicken and pork chops for two in a small pyrex baking dish for lunch or dinner. Very convenient!I like the "Keep Warm" function and the other functions it offers with its easy to turn knobs. And its size is perfect for a small apartment counter top.
4	1362355200	I love my toaster oven. It does exactly everything I expected it to. I have made, toast, pizza, garlic bread with cheese, etc. It works great!
5	1362182400	Love this toaster oven. Only paid $25 and shipping was free. I got rid of my toaster cause I use this oven for so many things. When it's something small I don't have to use my big over and this is handy. Not to big on the counter and looks nice.
5	1361923200	Ths product is used to assist my wife for preparing and warming food for the family dinner or snacks. Kids will probably use this product also.
5	1361404800	I can even bake biscuits in this stylish stainless steel, glass front toaster oven. Even heat distribution, easy to clean, easy to read dials and easy to use. Worth it!
5	1361318400	This toaster oven works great for when you are cooking something small and don't want to heat up the oven.  I make toast in it all the time, and it also has a great broiler for making garlic bread.  It cleans very easy, and has never caused me any trouble.  I once accidentally started a fire in it and all I had to do was dump a glass of water in and close the door - and the darn thing still works perfectly.  Don't put anything that can melt on top of it - as it does get very warm.
1	1360800000	Ok, I hardly ever write a negative product review on Amazon, but this oven had a major flaw which is why I sent it back to Amazon. When toasting, the element cycles from off to on, not sure why - is this a safety feature so the unit doesn't over heat? I emailed Black and Decker, which was another awful experience. FInally they got back to me saying the element is designed to cycle on and off.So basically, it take forever to toast a piece of toast and it never really gets crisp....Bad design, plain and simple.
5	1360627200	Couldn't be more pleased. Oven performs as expected. It is replacing conventional toaster and I am pleased with the quality and versatility.
5	1360454400	Nice and not too big to take up too much room.  It toasts beautifully, bakes and browns.  I have cooked, warmed up and toasted in it and love it.  Good value too.
2	1360195200	This is $25 at Walmart and I returned it.The metal strip under the handle extends into the oven and will burn your knuckles when you grip the handle unless you are careful or have small hands.The bake setting turns on both the top and bottom heating units with the top unit being on more than the bottom so it should be called 'broil'. The broil setting also turns on the bottom unit but only a little bit, I may have kept it if that was the only problem.My search for a toaster oven that understands 'bake' is only the bottom heating unit and 'broil' is only the top heating unit continues!If the problems I mentioned don't bother you then I think this toaster oven seems good for the $25 price as it has lots of settings and is large for that price point. But consider I didn't even keep it one day so I don't think my review is complete.
4	1360022400	Very nice flat toaster oven for small spaces in college housing for my daughter.  Big enough for small pizzas and quick meal and breakfast preparation. Easy to clean.
5	1359936000	great for its price. I have had this for more than 3 years and it still goes strong, no complains! WORKS PERFECTLY, great value!!!
5	1359849600	For the price, this toaster can't be beat. It does everything i could ask for. Completely worth the purchase. A big step up from my previous toaster.
1	1359504000	I got this to replace my previous toaster oven.This one is nice, but not as clear as my previous if you use it to toast.Its hard to tell what temperature you're toasting on, because the toast function is the first notch on the temperature gauge.EDIT: Toaster oven is broken in less than a year.Without any damage (I never moved it nor did I break any of the dials or damage any component) the knob to set the timer no longer functions. The toaster will not turn off regardless of its setting. I woke up one morning, wondering why my apartment was so warm and realized the toaster had never turned off from the night before! I could have burned down my apartment!Do not buy this product! It will randomly break without warning and you will only be able to turn it off by unplugging it from the wall. The fact that it cannot be trusted to turn off is a huge safety hazard!
5	1359504000	I got this for my mom as a Christmas gift she hasnt opened it yet because shes in the process of moving however, she really loved the gift.
5	1359417600	I've had this toaster oven for several years, good price, works after many years of use, looks good, and doesn't do anything funny. What else could you ask from a toaster oven? It's fantastic!
5	1359244800	i blow through toaster ovens all the time, but this one did not fail me like the others. The thing with toaster ovens is that once they start getting dirty they don't work as well and they are troublesome to clean. This toaster oven has a slide out crumb tray which makes it MUCH easier to clean. It's big enough for 4 slices of bread, great for small frozen pizza, and it cooks evenly enough to use as an emergency oven. I cooked stuffing in it on Thanksgiving because I ran out of oven space and it came out great. This is definitely the one to buy if you are looking for a good toaster oven. Even if you were just looking for a toaster, and not a toaster oven, buy this. You will be glad you did.
1	1359244800	This toaster over is a big disappointment! It was NOT tested in a kitchen for design flaws!!After cooking something then open the glass front, it curves up in such a way that users easily burn their hands. ouch!!It has a very small cooking area and I do NOT think it should be rated for four slices....
1	1359244800	On more than one occasion, the timer failed to complete it's run down to zero and turn off the oven. The timer would simply stop close to &#34;off&#34;, and stop counting down (no audible clicks). The last occurrence resulted in the sandwich wrap in the toaster at the time catching fire. It could have turned into a major fire, had we not been able to put the fire out almost immediately.
1	1359158400	It is a very nice toaster, good features, but lasted less than a year.  I bought it in March of 2012, and it just died on me in January 2013...it started by not turning off after the timer timed out, so I would have to unplug it each time I was finished using it.  Then it started smoking out of one of the dials...this is my 3rd toaster oven in 3 years!  I think I will spend a little more money on a really good brand that will last me more than 10 months!
1	1359158400	I've had two other Black & Decker ovens and they worked great and lasted a long time.  I bought this one recently and it is not the same quality I am use to from B&D.  Have to find my glasses to see how to set all the dials just to toast my bread.  I cook biscuits often and in my old ovens they baked quickly.  It takes a long time to bake in this one.  The price was fine but the quality is not in this product.
4	1358640000	I love this little toaster oven. I am very happy with it. My only problem is, it says it's a 4 slice toaster. I can only fit 2 slices in at a time. So really, a 2 slice toaster. Haven't tried a personal size pizza in it yet (really that's all it will hold and that is fine). So far I have baked and cooked several things in it. Meat, potatoes, cookies. Things like that. Everything comes out great. It does take a bit longer than the package recommends for baking. Not much but a few minutes so keep an eye on your food and keep that in mind. Also, the rack and pan are not non-stick. I sprayed them with just a little vegetable oil spray and they do just fine. I do this after each wash. Overall, really happy with this product.
1	1358553600	I seriously hate this thing. I've wasted too much time and too many slices of toast on this. The timer dial sucks - it is very hard to find that perfect setting for my toast - 1 millimeter off on the timer dial is all it takes. And a few times when I brought the timer dial back to zero, I've accidentally gone too far a little and put it on the "stay on" setting, which might have set my house on fire! The "stay on" setting should be put on the other end of the dial, which makes more sense anyway. And finally, three dials are totally unnecessary. I don't see why the middle setting dial is needed. It's redundant and makes things confusing, like a simple (and lousy) toaster trying to look sophisticated.
4	1358467200	I had a Black and Decker for almost 20 years. It was only that I wanted a newer one that I bought this one. So far I love it. I trust Black and Decker products and would buy one again.
5	1358467200	Compact in size, arrived fast. Bought for my mother and she uses it all the time, no problems and easy to operate.
5	1358467200	This is one of the best toaster ovens i've owned- found it at a better price than any of the big box stores in my area.
5	1358380800	I really like this toaster oven. The toast function works great. I've also tried making some chicken cordon bleu with the bake function on 375 degrees and that turned out great as well (the &#34;stay on&#34; setting really helps). I've noticed some people commented that there's too many knobs to turn for making a piece of toast, but I personally like the fact that the temperature, setting (bake, broil, toast...) & timer knobs are all separate, especially for the broil function. The top of the oven does get hot when using it on high temperatures/for an extended period of time so be mindful of that. It also comes with a shallow baking pan that fits it perfectly which I thought was very nice.
5	1358294400	This toaster oven is the best I've ever used.  I liked it so much I bought it for my daughter and her family for a Christmas gift.  She loves it, too!
1	1358121600	This oven only lasted me six months. It began to fall apart. The door on it wouldn't close all the way.
1	1358035200	We had this toaster oven for about a year.  We had a very old Black and Decker toaster oven that worked great.  Unfortunately we decided to upgrade and replace the older model with this one.  While I was broiling vegetables the glass door literally exploded and shot out glass all over the kitchen.  I was a couple of feet away when this happened, thankfully.  I think what happened was was the pan (included w/ the oven) warped with the heat and hit the glass door, causing the glass to shatter.  Terrible!!!
5	1357603200	This purchase was to replace a 15yr old Black & Decker Toast-R-Oven that finally died. It is great to discover that Black & Decker has not cheapened their products, but instead have made them even better. This new oven has a slightly larger capacity, more features & baking/toasting options. For the price, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a counterop toaster oven.
5	1357430400	A little smaller than I expected even though I checked the measurements, but does a great job of toasting(watch it at first so you know what setting you like). Perfect for the job I need-toasting and small baking needs. Received it super fast.
5	1357430400	I have been using this oven for 4 years now, and its probably one of the best investments i have ever made, it does exactly what its advertised too, nothing on it has broken or worn out, and I use it almost daily.
5	1357257600	We bought this over a year ago and use it daily!! This toaster oven works great!! We have not had one single problem with it...love it!!!
4	1357171200	This toaster is great!  I bought this toaster before reading the reviews, after reading them I tried to cancel my order and was unable.  I thought what the heck I'm going to try it. After a few months of use here is my review. This toaster has been great and I haven't had any issues with it.  It hasn't exploded or failed to work properly.  I would purchase this toaster again.
2	1356825600	This toaster oven, while not the highest quality, did its job just fine until just under a year when it completely stopped toasting.We don't use it that often, so it's not like it was abused. I would spend more money for higher quality.
3	1356825600	I had a Black & Decker toaster that had died after 12 years. So I thought another one would be great. This one takes twice as long to toast bread. I like the old &#34;light to dark&#34; dial and the lever you push down to toast. The was on a separate dial and was easy to control. This new one is a pain.
5	1356825600	Great product for baking, warming, broiling and toasting.  Saves you from the dangers of microwave ovens.  You will need a very small area for using the oven with proximity to a good, safe electrical outlet.  Have used this product for years and love it more all the time.
5	1356652800	My sister is very happy with the Toaster Oven! She says it works great! So, that makes me very happy with my purchase!
5	1356566400	I've had this a couple of months.  I use it daily, for toast, bagels, English muffins, scones, to put a delicious crispy finish to frozen wraps and pizza, and on and on.  Easy to use, versatile, compact for use on a counter.
4	1356566400	Great looking oven, like it over all. The only thing I don't like about this oven is the rack doesn't slide out smoothly. Sometimes I need to use both hands to slide it out.
3	1356220800	When my trusty old black & decker toaster oven died, I found finding a decent replacement difficult, as only have a small space & need something a specific size.  This works ok, but is not the quality of the older items & I wouldn't trust it to be left unattended as sometimes it shuts off, sometimes it doesn't.
4	1355702400	A multifunctional piece that can be used as an oven and a toaster - exactly what I was looking for to complete my kitchen for one.  Thanks B&D!
2	1355356800	It was time to purchase a new Toaster Oven as my old one was broken. It seems that with all the newer models they really just wanted to add as many features as possible yet really do a bad job at doing any of them. I always trusted Black & Decker with Toaster Ovens as my last machine was one though with this newer model they really did a bad job. So many differnet types of options yet it really doesn't do a good job with any of them as it either takes to long to toast, bake, get hot at all. With the 3 differnet types of knobs as you see on the machine it really can get confusing as to how to use it as an oven as it really does a bad job of getting warm and staying warm as the it seems to go off and on with the heat. The worst part of this machine is the constant ticking... With ALL the toaster ovens out there now I couldn't find one that doesn't have that ticking when the timer is going down. Some good qualities of this machine is how much room there is in it as it is pretty spacious as well as the crumb tray is really easy to clean up.I don't recommend this product as it really is more of a hassle to deal with as well as it doesn't toast in a timely manner. I miss the old Black & Decker Toast-R-Ovens.
4	1355270400	I was looking for a basic toaster oven to toast, melt cheese, and warm things up.  this does the job.  it heats up really quickly, has a great timing feature (you can set it to only stay on for x min), and is easy to clean.  my only complaint is that it seems like it could be smaller given the size of the cooking space.  but otherwise, big thumbs up.
1	1355270400	I have the same fire story as some of the others.  Placed some waffles in the toaster this morning to warm for my son.  I turned the knob and then back as instructed for the toasting setting.  I was only attempting warm the waffles because they didnt need to be cooked.  I heard the timer ding and thought great they are done.  About 15 minutes later my smoke alarm is going off and there is a plume of smoke coming from the kitchen.  I get to the toaster oven and it along with the waffles are in full blaze.  I put the fire out before any major damage.  My presumption is that the toaster never cooled off and though I heard the ding from the time indicating it was done, the oven continued to cook the waffles.  I have used other toasters before and never have had this problem.
5	1355011200	Love the compact size. It heats up quickly and saves space on the counter. Plenty of options on the dials.
2	1354924800	this toaster heats up too hot...especially on bottom element - even tho I turn down temperature...I have to keep an eye on it at all times to make sure toast doesn't burn too quicklyand it has a tray that is poorly designed...it gets caught/hung up too often doesn't smoothly slide in or outand the irony is that I bought this toaster oven to replace a GE rotisserie convection oven that I had ordered  from Amazon a few months ago...one that was over $80...but it was evidently designed for the Slowski family...took 2 hours to bake one potato ...and Forever to toast bread...I gave it to a construction worker at my building...now this one burns bread within moments even tho I have done all the tricks in their book to prevent just thiscan't there be a Normal old fashioned toaster oven out there that works evenly??!!
2	1354838400	I read some reviews that mentioned it is hot. I didn't realize just how hot. My old Black & Decker (20+ years old and has been better days) gets hot but not enough to actually burn my fingers. This one did. I returned it. I didn't care that I'd not get full refund. It is dangerous to have on the counter top. The timer is so loud I can't concentrate on cooking while this toaster oven is ticking away. I had to use Stay On setting just to hear myself think.
4	1354665600	Overall this toaster oven works well but the toasting/broiling is a little uneven.  Also, the way they printed the numbers around the dials is a bit fuzzy.  But it looks great and is a good value for the price.
3	1354579200	I just threw away yet another burned bagel, so I probably shouldn't be writing this review right now, but here goes. I pretty much despise this toaster oven. The best thing about it is the price. To toast something, you have to make sure both top dials are on toast, which is annoying, and even more annoying, you have to turn the toast setting dial clockwise to 12:00 and then back counter-clockwise to the toast setting you want.  There are pictures on the dial for dark, medium, and light and I find I have to set it just a hair above light to avoid burning my toast/bagel/waffle.  Then sometimes it's still too light, so I have to set it again and it frequently burns.  I can't imagine anyone ever using medium or dark on this thing!  And heaven forbid the toaster has been used in the last hour before I need to make some toast! Then I have to set it on the lightest possible setting and watch it like a hawk to avoid burning.  The controls on this thing are just a pain and I grow tired of monkeying with them to try to get my toast to turn out right. That being said, the oven feature works fine and this technically gets the job done on toast (with practice!), but be prepared to throw away more bread than you'd like. Oh! Another really annoying thing is that when I have the door all the way open and go to close it, the rack often snags and won't close. Then I have to grab a utensil to adjust the rack before I can close the door. I do like the crumb tray, which makes clean-up pretty easy, but it's still not as nice as the last model I had, which doesn't seem to be available anymore. I think I will have to break down and spend more on my next toaster oven to avoid these annoyances.
5	1354579200	Great to have when you just need to heat something up for a few minutes.  Or when toasting two pieces of garlic  bread!!
2	1354579200	This is almost identical to the B&D I finally wore out and had to retire after years of doing a good job.  This new one does a sorry job of toasting, very uneven top & bottom.  This is the function we use most.  We don't understand how you can mess up a good  product like the old one. Needless to say I can not recommend this product.
5	1354406400	I've a user of Black & Decker toaster ovens for as long as I can remember, something like fifteen years or more. This is the best one yet. I use it a lot and really like the built in convention system.
5	1354147200	This was the best toaster oven I ever had. needed something not too big for the kitchen. very,very nice. pretty too
4	1353974400	I bought this to replace my previous B&D Toaster Oven that had served for many years. This was as close a match as I could find. The one feature I don't like is having to turn the toast timer past 20 minutes and then back to the time I wish. Besides that, it performs fine.
1	1353888000	The count-down timer on this product gets stuck sometimes and the oven stays on continuously.  I set the timer for 2 minutes to give some Eggos a little extra time while I went to the bathroom.  I came back quite a while later to find the oven still on with flames inside and the Eggos burnt to a crisp.  The entire oven was burnt and had to be thrown out.  I see now that dozens of other reviewers have noted a similar problem.  It's a wonder that this product is still on the market.Do not purchase this defectively designed item.  This is a safety hazard.
1	1353715200	Purchased to replace wonderful, reliable 8-year-old Black and Decker toaster oven. Controls are difficult/annoying to use. Does not cook food uniformly. Unit generates too much heat on counter - likely fire hazard. To the trash with this.
5	1353715200	I bought this for $34.95 + free shipping in August 2012 from amazon. It works great and is much better then using a microwave. I do still use a microwave for some things, but I try to use this as often as possible. The food tastes much crispier and its not soggy like a microwave typically makes food. I see the price right now 11-24-2012 is 44.95. Its worth that much but if you can find a better one for that price then go for it. Ive actually got my toaster oven making some left over pizza hut pizza right now. Its soooo much better then cooking it in the microwave. Its basically the same as cooking it in the oven.
2	1353196800	Bought at dept store at crazy price! Listed at $45, saw it on sale for $29. A week later, on sale for $19! Well, for $19 it is okay. It only has one heat element on the top & bottom. Compare to others at the same non-sale price that had 2 elements on T&B. It is okay for my use. Toast has burnt so I have to watch it closely during this process which is a PITA. Keep reading these reviews for a better model.
4	1353196800	Some improvements over earlier model we had. Better Toaster. Only hangup is that you hear a release sound a minute before the bell rings and you think that the toast is done. Don't know why you need that release sound.
1	1353024000	This must be the poorest of toaster ovens.  Bought mine over year ago and today it is dead as a doornail.  There was always problems with trying to make it work right and we got to the point we had to plug it in and unplug it as it would NOT shut off.Will never buy another one of these.  Total waste of money!!
4	1352937600	Had my old Black and Decker for 15 years! Loved it. Based upon the size and the reviews, especially one in particular I purchased this item. Found out that it did not have the hinged, slide out tray that my old one had, so that you do not need to use a pot holder. Called Black and Decker and they stopped making the hinged grill tray!! Called Amazon, and as always their service is great, and this will probably go back. The review that I based this purchase on was written in 2009!!!Kept the toaster and have been using it for many months now. Not having the hinged door is no problem for me as I mostly use it for toasting. It has an added feature that the old one did not have. The heat lowers automatically when necessary. Would now recommend it.
1	1352764800	This thing had a hard time not burning our toast at work finally one day it did not shut off and the employee's toast caught on fire. We bought a Hamilton Beach so far so good. I would not recommend this item
4	1352505600	Bought this because it was small (counter space issue) and was reasonably priced. It works well and does what it is intended to do, such as toast, muffins, and small over items.
4	1352419200	Really nice, basic design andgood quality finish, slightly retro with the round dials. Removable tray makes cleaning really easy. Best Toaster over I have had. Excellent product, would recommend
5	1352332800	This is a great toaster oven.  Toasts evenly.  Bakes nicely.  Broils great.  Easy to clean. I am very happy with this purchase.
1	1352332800	Bought this toaster due to the really solid reviews. The problem I have is this toaster does not toast, it warms. I plugged it in, set the dial to toast, turned the timer past 10 and waited. The toaster clicked along (it makes a lot of noise), the red heat came on and just a minute or two later the heat went off when the bread was still entirely untoasted. I turned the timer back up to 10 minutes again but the heat would not come back on. Each time I want to toast something I have to toast it 3 separate times, unplugging and replugging the toaster, or resigning myself to 'baking' the toast at 450 degrees.
4	1352246400	GOOD PRODUCT GOOD NAME BUILT GOOD DESIGNED GOOD JUST AS DESCRIBED IN AD, OVERALL PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE
4	1351987200	This toaster oven has worked beautifully for me. It evenly toasts bread and heats up food without obnoxiously melting or burning it on a medium setting. The only downside I have found so far is that it is exceptionally difficult to set it to a lightly toast setting, and the merest twiddle of the dial will abruptly carbonize your bread. If you're not paying attention, anyway. Other than that, is quite lovely! 8/10 would toast again.
5	1351209600	The Black and Decker Toaster oven met all my requirements for a toaster oven, its compact, easy to use and does a great job on anything I use it for.
5	1351209600	let me tell you - i spent 35 bucks 2 years ago with tax and now it's almost doubled. wow this is a great toaster oven and still works the only thing is it's a bit small. as for buying another one- not till it brakes but i love it and does the job.
1	1350864000	We bought this toaster to replace our ancient toaster, and I wish we'd kept the old one instead. We've had this oven for a few months now; it worked great for the first week, then went downhill. This oven is fine for the baking function, but for toast (which is what we use it for the most), it is unpredictable and uneven. The bread on one side will burn while the slice on the other side stays light. Infuriating. Also, there is a "toast" function and a "bagel" function; both seem equally bad. This oven also has a hard time toasting thick slices of bread (it doesn't toast them at all). With thin slices, it burns from the top. Argh.
1	1350691200	Have to set 3 differesnt dials just to toast a piece of bread.....and even then it doesn't toast.I just want to press one simple button. Macys is selling this for 20.00 this weekend.........what does that say ? They"re trying to unload them.
5	1350000000	I got the TRO480BS as a back up for a very old Delonghi 6 slice I have that is stillgoing strong after 15 years (I don't replace stuff unless it breaks, and I can't fix it).This unit is smaller (4 slice) and is at least half the weight of my old Delonghi which isa major factor with me, as I carry the unit outside to bake my favorite meat (chicken breast),and don't want the smoke (or smell) in the house.This is a much better choice for a single person, as the 6 slice size is just overkill, but nowI can just use it for those occasions when it is needed.I agree with a lot of the reviews that have said this is the best bang for the buck.I know I paid over twice this price for the Delonghi 15 years ago.The Chicago Metallic 26639 Nonstick Petite Broil & Roast Pan is a great addition when baking and broiling meat, with or without the grill; just foil the grill or pan to make the clean up process go faster.Please note: I do see major differences in the product review from 2009 (which were mostly good) to the currentreviews (which are mostly bad).  This usually means the product was outsouced to a new location, so will come back to addendum this review at a later date.As promised, I am back 6 months later, and this oven is used at least every other day, and sometimes every day and is going strong.
2	1348876800	This toaster worked great, but sadly it broke after only one year. The timer does not shut off, so the oven will stay on, and has in some cases overnight. Thankfully, our house didn't burn down! The other thing worth noting is that the silver coating on the front just above the door handle turns brown after much use. Too bad they don't make things like they used to.
2	1347408000	[[AS IN:B002CVTT3Y Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven]]THIS TOASTER OVEN DOES A GREAT JOB OF TOASTING ETC.  BUT  THE OUTSIDE GETS SO HOT WITH A MINIMUM OF TOASTING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF. IT ALSO BURNS STUFF AROUND IT IF USING THE OVEN PART.  SORRY, IT LOOKS GREAT BUT THAT IS NOT SAFE TO USE. I AM DISCARDING IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO USE IT AND GET BURNED AND SUE ME. NOW I AM AFRAID TO BUY B&D TOASTERS.  ONCE BURNED TWICE SHY.
1	1346976000	We've had the toaster oven for a few months, and it was working well, until this week. On Tuesday night, my wife was warming up some dinner rolls for only a few minutes, and when they were done, she reached for the handle and was about a foot away when the front exploded, sending shards of glass all over the kitchen. Miraculously, she wasn't injured, but it certainly scared us. Given how easily she could have been injured, and how badly it could have been, this is an issue of the utmost importance and needs to be addressed immediately. The glass on the front is CLEARLY not tempered correctly, and if it exploded while my wife was actually touching the handle, it could have cut her arm to shreds. Suffice it to say I'm not happy. We took plenty of pictures of the toaster after it exploded, and will gladly show it to friends and the managers of the local Walmart locations to encourage them to remove the product from the shelves. After this experience, I can't imagine a circumstance where I would purchase a Black & Decker product again.
3	1346889600	I had mine for about 6 months and it was quirky with the settings so I always watched mine like a hawk.  One day I saw that someone said there was a fire risk with the cord on the back of the unit.  I was worried so I checked the cord on mine and sure enough, there was a couple of tiny holes started from the wire getting so hot it was melting the plastic covering.  I threw it in the trash.
1	1346803200	After owning for a year or two this oven cycles on & off, on & off and won't toast properly. "Stay on" feature doesn't work either, still cycles. On to another brand.....
5	1346716800	This toaster toasts fast and is easy to clean. Although it's advertised as a 4-slice toaster, I can only fit 2 slices.. but I also buy the larger grain bread slices (specifically Pepperidge Farm 15-grain). No complaints, it's the perfect size for my needs!
2	1346457600	After 1 year the broil option stopped working. The only thing I can use it for toasting, baking takes forever.
1	1346457600	I just bought a new  Black& Decker TRO490B, and it caught fire the very time I used it.  I read (after of course) this is a very common for Black&Decker; Toaster Ovens.I will never buy another Black&Decker; anything.
1	1346284800	I bought this looking for something that could easily  toast bread, instead I got something that smelled funny even after the first use and didn't toast on both sides. I tried all permutations of settings but couldn't get it to make a single piece of normal toast. Needless to say this got sent  back to Amazon
1	1346112000	I almost never write a review on amazon, but I feel compelled about this very very poor toaster over. It should be recalled. Seriously. The timer mechanism often gets stuck just before you would normally hear the 'ding' of it turning off and so the darn thing stays on. I have kids and the distractions are endless. Needless to say it's a bit frightening to smell burning toast and run down stairs mid diaper change to see it almost on fire because the stupid oven didn't turn off like it's supposed too! Avoid this oven.
3	1345766400	This recently replaced a B&D toaster oven that lasted 11 years, which toasted faster and was easier to use.  The controls are overly complicated -- you set 3 dials to make toast, and it won't lock-in a toast setting.  You must first turn the toast/timer dial past 10 minutes, then back to your chosen setting.  Turning it off manually (to override the timer) requires more attention than it should, because "off" is right next to "stay on" -- I always check that the oven light is off in case I turned the dial too far.  It takes 7 minutes to make toast, which my old oven did in about 3 minutes.  Mine toasts evenly, best with the rack set high.  The case does get hot, and there's bare metal behind the door handle, which could be a problem for someone with large hands.  So far I've only used the bake function a few times for breaded fish, which came out OK, and I like the slide-out crumb tray, but overall this oven should have been designed better.
4	1345680000	I bought this back in January 2011 from Macy's for something like $25 on sale. It worked great since then. We use it regularly to toast, broil, oven braise, and bake. It's great for 1-2 portions of meat, 3 to 4 cookies, a small casserole, baking a few salads worth of croutons, 1-2 slices of pizza, etc. It certainly beats heating up the entire oven for smaller tasks.Toast is fine. You really have to make sure you set it up properly, and to set the timer accordingly. If you take toast seriously and have the counter space, a pop up toaster is worthwhile investment.My last B&D; toaster oven was a cheapie model purchased in 2001 for something like $19.99, and it could broil like no other. I can't tell you how many fires I started in that thing (not a bad thing if safety precautions are taken; good because I could do some serious searing in that thing). It was awesome and a joy to use. This new one doesn't get nearly as hot, but it works just fine, especially for the price. The old B&D; was given to my ex-neighbor when I moved out of my old place a couple of years ago. As of a couple months ago, he was still using it, though he said that the toast setting ceased to work. He can still toast bread using the bake setting, he just has to flip the bread over halfway through. Let's hope that my current unit lasts as long. Somehow I doubt it will.
5	1344816000	I love this toaster oven, absolutely no problems whatsoever with it whether it be to bake or toast bagels or bread.  I do not, however, know how to broil in it.  Can someone please help me here?  Thanks so much.
3	1344556800	Basically: the alignment of the oven door was warped a tiny bit when we took it out of the box from walmsrt. We thought it would be ok since the oven still worked. Over time ..about 7 months now...the door wont stay shut at all. It still works. The silver finish is cheap. The glass door is nice,  but doesn't shut.Update: the door shuts again after not shutting for 4 months. I still don't like the cheap metal it's made of....you can cover the pan with aluminum foil though.
2	1343952000	I bought this model (on a very good sale from Macy's) with a lot of hope - nice features on paper and nice size - but had to return it.The controls leave a LOT to be desired, including what I consider a safety hazard:1. You must rotate the mechanical TIMER/TOAST dial every time you toast to set it to the desired toast shade.  The different shades are very close on the dial making it almost impossible to repeat the same setting each time.  This is a recipe for inconsistent toast.  Further, unless you read the instruction booklet (itself a confusing folded poster with half upside-down printing) you miss the need to turn the dial all the way to 10 (minutes) and then back to the desired setting, presumably to prime the spring-loaded timer.  Way too easy to miss that, with unpredictable results.2. Much worse, to turn the toaster off early (when you see it getting too dark thanks to #1) you must rotate the same TIMER/TOAST dial counterclockwise to the OFF point.  It is much too easy to overshoot OFF to the "Stay ON" position just past it and not notice the rather dim ON light (which is hidden by your right hand turning the dial).  Can you spell "FIRE HAZARD!"?3. The markings around this high-use TIMER/TOAST dial are just painted on the surface of the metal and are quite likely to rub off with continued use.4. I also find the other two dials confusing.  The TEMP dial has a Bagel/Toast setting at one extreme, while the FUNCTION dial has Bagel at almost one end and Toast at the other extreme.  A further recipe for bleary-eyed staring at the thing and yielding surprising results.  The first time I tried to toast with it, I turned the TIMER/TOAST dial and the light came on, but it didn't heat up!  Why?  I hadn't set the other two dials correctly.Fie on Black&Decker;'s designers!  Reminds me of early programmable home heating thermostats that economized on one LCD display and 2 buttons by creating all sorts of cockamamie manual sequences to use it.We have long enjoyed a Panasonic toaster oven.  It had on/off buttons separate from the toast shade slider, a much better setup for guaranteed repeat toast shade performance.One last annoyance:  the plug has 3 prongs.  Probably safer (anybody have an informed opinion about this point?), but in my older kitchen I have polarized 2-prong outlets.  I have had lots of counter-top appliances like toaster ovens, coffee-makers, and even a modern George Foreman grill that all work fine with 2 prongs.  A minor annoyance, but I didn't want to have to upgrade the sockets just to plug this thing in.  Also the plug sticks straight out (not angled), arguably another fire hazard since it positions the power cord sticking out a couple of inches where it could easily come into contact with the HOT exterior of the appliance in some positions.  In this day and age, you might expect any decent countertop appliance to either be double-insulated (eliminating the need for a 3-prong plug) or have a flat and rotating plug.So, alas, our search for decent compact 4-slice toaster oven continues!
2	1343865600	This toaster worked great while it lasted... which was maybe a year.  Towards the end the toast just stopped toasting unless you left it on the hottest setting for 20-30 minutes.  We now have to buy a new toaster oven and I will definitely not be buying this model.
1	1343692800	This toaster oven was okay until the timer occasionally stopped functioning properly ("stay on" wasn't even enabled). Sometimes turning the dial causes an audible ticking and sometimes it doesn't. The latter situation means that if you walk away, it will stay on forever until it eventually lights your waffles/bread/kitchen on fire. It's dangerous enough that my boyfriend started two small fires. Even if you avoid this fire hazard, the way the bottom dial is adjusted makes it difficult to anticipate how toasted something will get. I always have to monitor everything I put in there. I am throwing this toaster oven out, it's just a huge pain in the butt.
1	1343692800	Worked okay until after about a year the top coils just stopped working. I keep hearing the warnings about B&D appliances being junk and I should have heeded them. It had some "features" I wasn't happy with, such as the timer that was inaccurate, the undocumented burn feature, the difficulty cleaning it, the door not closing all the way - letting heat escape, and the rack that often jammed when trying to slide it out. Other than that, I guess it actually did cook some things okay.
5	1343001600	Have had this for about 8 months.  This item should be RECALLED.  The toaster knob does not shut the oven off, and I have to unplug it after I use it.  It can burn a house down.  I am not the only one that has this problem.  Please read the reviews and DO NOT BUY this oven!After writing this review, called B & D.  They replaced it with no questions, and I sent the defective one back.  They have fixed the timer, so I will now give it 5 stars.  It works well.
4	1343001600	Just got this and what is important to me is the size. It fit nicely in my utility cabinet. I have not used it yet but I will update when I have used it for a while. I have added some pictures.Now I have owned this for a month and love it even more. I use it more than my fancy microwave. It is August here in San Diego and we had a few humid hot weeks and I used this a lot compared to heating up my big oven. I toasted cashews 5 min quickly in it last night and made a loaf of zucchini bread at 350 degrees for 2X30 minute timers and they both turned out so well. You can use the timer that has a max of 30 minutes or override it to as long as you want without a timer. I also made spaghetti with meat balls and put parma cheese and used it like a salamander to brown the cheese. I can imagine this would be a great little oven to cook for one or two and my next endeavor will be cooking fish pocket in tin foil with herbs and thinly sliced vegetables. Its almost like the pretend Betty Crocker oven I had when I was little but it really works!
1	1342051200	This is not the toaster you want!  It does not have the hooks on the door to pull out the tray as depicted in the picture.  So lame!  Also, the vendor selling it Duddly's does not respond to inquiries about their mis-representation of the product.  It is also true what the other reviewers said about this toaster either toasting a little bit or burning the heck out of your toast.
5	1342051200	We first got this off of our wedding registry, so we were a little overwhelmed with everything else to really research, you know, toaster ovens. It served us well, though. Heats up quickly. I've used it for everything but casseroles, cookies, and cakes. The top gets hot but the sides and everything seem to be ok. Probably don't want to put anything exceedingly susceptible to heat next to it while it's on, but I don't think it's really that bad. Certainly doesn't heat up the whole kitchen. It's definitely been a livesaver in this ridiculous heat wave - when the AC can't get the temperature down below 80 I don't really want to worsen things by cooking, but the toaster oven doesn't contribute to heat.The controls are pretty intuitive.Had to get a second one. Our kitchen is small, so the bread is kept on top of it, except when we use it. Hubby forgot to take the bread off one day so the top of the toaster oven seems permanently imprinted with the bread label. Aesthetically that's not really very charming, so I went researching for another toaster oven. Figured we could get something better since we seem to use it so much. After a few hours of looking around, everything else either seems smaller or less reliable or harder to clean (crumb catcher and wide open space in this one makes it very easy). So we got a second one. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but not for this price. Recommended.
5	1341964800	The thing is great!  It does as well as can be expected for 30 bucks.  The folks complaining about it burning their food or that the temperature control isn't calibrated are crazy.  You can even get this thing for less than $30 if you look around.  If you use your brain you'll get plenty of value for that small cost.  If you need your toaster to do your thinking, you'll have to spend more.  For what it is, it's a good product.
1	1341619200	Bought this with confidence from reviews. Broke down within two year. Toasts unevenly, burns in back, now only bottom elements heat. Top heating elements already broke. Cheap. Invest in something better.
2	1341100800	I ordered this toaster oven last July and it died in mid-June. I was never happy with it and should have returned it after the first few weeks. It toasted unevenly from the start and frequently I saw smoke escaping from the sides of the unit. Too bad because the basically good reviews were what motivated me to buy it. I just got a lemon. I decided it's not worth the hassle of contacting Black & Decker to get a replacement and have just ordered a Cuisinart from Amazon, hoping for better luck.
5	1340928000	Compact, fits the small space available.  Bought this as a gift for my daughter's birthday to use in their Airstream trailer.
3	1340582400	I got this to replace my old Black and Decker toaster oven which finally kicked the bucket. My old B&D; TO was simple and cheap, after 16 years it was stained but still worked faithfully until the top heating coil broke. We thought about getting a fancier one or a digital one but we don't have a lot of countertop space and our last B&D; lasted 16 faithful years so why not just get the same one? Unfortunately, B&D; doesn't make the exact same model anymore so we just got the same bottom of the line starter toaster oven.Function: We use this mainly as a toaster and only occasionally as an oven. The biggest drawback is that it doesn't have a toast switch anymore. On the old one, you can press a rocker switch to toast. On this one you have to twist a toaster knob that determines the amount of time the coils are heated. The timing function is inaccurate the toasting is uneven so you can get your toast burnt and unevenly (more in the back than front). Not only that, the timer is noisy and irritating. I have to ask B&D;, why fix something when it ain't broke?Apart from that, everything functions ok. I just wish they still sold my old toaster oven model and I'd just get that instead. But this thing is cheap, and maybe it'll last another 16 years.
5	1340496000	Very practical, space saver, good looking oven. The timer feature is very nice, as well as the removable tray for the crumbs.
1	1340409600	The controls look wonderful, but it goes on and off at will and does not toast well.  If it worked properly it would be a great toaster
1	1340236800	Toasts and heats items fine, the issue is that I have to take a few minutes to explain to every new house guest how to use this thing.  It's a friggin toaster oven; it should be simple to use!  Unfortunately, it's very easy for someone to inadvertently leave this appliance running oven mode.And when you're toasting and open the door to get the toast before the toasting cycle is done, the unit keeps on running.  "Normal" toaster ovens will automatically end the toasting cycle when you open the door.Lastly, the bell is great - if you're incredible hard of hearing or need something to improvise with at the boxing ring.  But it's too loud for my kitchen.  This one is going back.
3	1340064000	Pros:still works after a yearpretty lightweighteasy to cleanCons:the door has two hooks that hook onto the rack.  when you open the door, the door pulls out the rack a bit.  when you close the door, the rack doesn't just push back in.  you have to push the rack in with your finger before you can close the door.
5	1339632000	Have one for about 2 years and use every morning to make toast. The comments about "burning" reflect the users incorrect operation. The toaster has a spring loaded timer which turns toaster off after time set on dial. Be sure to turn toaster knob at least half-way up to load spring AND THEN set it to LO. A higher setting tends to burn toast. If you just turn knob randomly high and leave it there, it just keeps toasting till toast starts to burn and eventually catch fire. If you don't first wind up spring by turning knob half-way up, toaster may not turn off and burn toast.
4	1339632000	Can't go wrong for the price. I miss the simplier controls of a bygone model. This requires the setting of three dials to make it bake or just toast. Door is not as snug as I would prefer. Like the pull out crumb tray. Overall a great little toaster oven.
1	1339372800	The unit gets too hot on the outside. Before it broke 1.5 after purchase, it burned all food even at the lowest setting, while leaving the inside uncooked. It only toasted the top side of bread, while the bottom got moist while sitting on the tray, so I had to turn the bread around and toast again.There ARE better units for a similar price.
2	1339286400	Used this toaster oven about a year and a half. Moved it aside to clean the counter and it fell to the floor. Glass door shattered into very very small pieces and thin slivers. Obviously, not laminated for safety. What a mess. We considered getting a new door (we're big on self-repairs) but as quickly as we thought about that, we just as quickly decided to buy a new one because we HATED this one so much.We only use a toaster over for toast and to heat lunch things like taquitos and pizza slices. For toast, you have to turn the timer knob to 10 minutes, then back again to the time setting you want. The problem is that the scale is so small, it is impossible to set it consistently at the level that toasts the bread how you like. Consequently, you have to just watch it through the glass and take it out before it gets too dark. Given that it takes a very long time to toast (compared to our old wonderful toaster oven that finally died after 20 years), you'll be watching through that glass for a while. When you open the door, the toaster oven does not turn off, so after you take your toast out, you have to turn the timer back to zero to turn it off.Also, this toaster oven is loud. It sounds like a cartoon-bomb ticking away...like the sound effect on 60 minutes when they go to a commercial break.As a toaster, I'd give this a 1 star. It does reheat pizza, though, so I'll give it 2 stars.
5	1338595200	The precision of the selector buttons is amazing.  I can set to "Bagel Medium Brown" and leave the room, knowing that it will be toasted only on top (bagel setting) and medium brown.  I have owned toaster ovens for 50 years and this one tops them all.The fact that I was able to purchase it from Amazon at between $15 and $20 less than elsewhere was a factor since there was no shipping fee.  I received my product in a timely fashion via UPS which brought it directly to my door.
3	1337817600	Before you return the oven or spend an hour waiting to talk to B&D customer service because there are no hooks on the oven door. When I finally got through to a CS person, I was informed that they discontinued the rack hooks on all of their toaster ovens. However, the hooks are still mentioned in the manuel & shown in all the pictures of the oven. I suspect that they were discontiued because they never worked all that well. I think it would be easy enough to design a new mechanism for pulling the rack out when the door opens. If you can put up without the flawed hooks, I think the oven has better controls than most inexpensive toaster ovens & the best thing about the oven is clearly the price. I paid $30.00 & you can probably find a new one for less. The oven does not come with a user's manuel. There is a pdf of the user's manuel on the web site.
1	1337644800	This toaster is slow. I mean, while toasting some bread for my tuna fish sandwich today, I just got so frustrated. In fact, the toast is still not toasted, and I feel completely comfortable logging onto the computer to complain while my toast is still not toasted. The milk is warm, the tuna is room temperature, and the toast is still not toasted--I can guarantee it won't be burned by the time I type this. This is a new toaster oven, running as it is supposed to run.ALSO it bills as a "4" toaster oven, but it only fits 2 bread slices inside from an ordinary loaf. Same for poptarts, no more than 2. This would not be a problem if it toasted a little quicker, but making sandwiches for my 2 kids for lunch, and then one for myself has taken a freaking half hour no joke.I am going to ditch this piece of crap.
1	1337558400	I received my toaster in a timely fashion, but upon opening the shipping box, several pieces of an unknown substance fell out. When I opened the factory box, inside the shipping container, more white ceramic-like material fell out. When I inspected inside the toaster I observed that the bottom heating coil had shattered and the ends of the coil were detached from the walls. The upper heating element was also damaged. In otherwords the toaster unit was in a complete mess and unacceptable. I then repacked it and sent to back to Amazon. I am very displeased with Black and Decker with the sloppy packing. Someone goofed up on the assembly line and this unit slipped through the inspection line.
2	1337472000	Worked fine for almost two years, but now the upper heating element has gone out.  Also, the toaster is very noisy.  I liked the easy to remove crumb catcher tray, but my toaster before this one lasted a good ten years before conking out.
1	1336608000	Bought this toaster from a seemingly reputable brand to replace a terrible toaster that we used to have. This is now our new terrible toaster.The timer broke after a week of use. One week. So now I use the microwave timer to remind me to turn our toaster off, which is similar to buying a motorcycle to follow my bicycle in case the chain derails. The bottom element gets so hot that it's impossible to toast a piece of bread completely without scorching one-third of the piece. I have tried numerous positions.My wife won't allow me to throw it into the driveway, which I think is the only way I could possibly get any joy from this device: hearing all of that beautiful glass and metal smash.I wish things weren't made like crap. Get bent, Black and Decker. I'll never buy one of your junk products again.Am I over-reacting to a malfunctioning toaster? Maybe a little bit, but I feel better.
1	1336003200	While this is a pretty nice toaster oven it has a big safety flaw. When making toast all three dials need to be set to "toast". For the top two dials this means turning the dial all the way to the right. The lowest dial, if turned all the way to the right however, will set the oven to run for 30 minutes.Making it worse, on the lower dial the proper toast setting (an icon) is located 180 degrees from the setting that sets the oven to run for 25 minutes. The dials have no clear indication as to which end of the dial is pointed toward the setting (only an embossed arrow head, look at the product photoBlack & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Ovento see this). This makes it extremely easy to think you have the dial set to the toast icon, when actually you have it set to run the oven for 25 minutes, guaranteeing your toast will be generating dangerous flames right under your kitchen cabinets.A correctly designed toaster oven would not make it possible to set two dials to "Toast", but still allow the timer to be set at a flame producing 30 minutes.
4	1335830400	I'm happy with this little toaster oven. It can hold four slices of toast if they're jammed together, so it's not huge, but I'm happy with the size. With the screen on the middle rack, it toasts bread and bagels perfectly. I use it mostly for toast and a little bit of broiling, and it works great!The only thing I'm taking a point off for is the timer. It has an old-fashioned, mechanical ticking timer, which works fine now but I'm worried about the longevity of it. I've had a few of those old kitchen egg-timers that slowed down considerably after some use, and I think this may be the same type of mechanism. However, the oven was cheap enough that I think it makes up for this one flaw. I would buy this oven again.
4	1335744000	Does the job, toasts fast.  The warming function is also very useful as it can warm things like sauces and dips that I keep in the fridge.  Some difficulty cleaning around the bottom heating element, as bread crumbs and the like can get stuck at the bottom in the corners and crevices.  This can cause some smoke to come out of the unit.
3	1335744000	A very poor quality toaster oven - it would regularly burn bread, over heat, and had a very uneven temperature profile - some parts of the oven would get really hot and some would not - making it impossible to judge the correct temperature. However, that was not a real problem as the thermostat was fairly useless - so trying to set a temperature you wanted was a joke.
5	1335225600	This is by far the best toaster oven I have ever owned, and the least expensive.  It toasts very quickly, it is light enough to see into the toaster to view how brown it is getting, and when you open the door, the rack AUTOMATICALLY pulls out so you don't get burned getting your toast.  It is also sleek looking, and easier to clean than any of my previous toaster ovens.  I LOVE IT
1	1335052800	This toaster oven is ridiculous. It must have a safety feature or something because it doesn't cook or toast or anything without the elements going off ten times. when it takes 10 minutes for toast something is wrong. I waited 45 minutes for biscuits the other day and they were barely warm, still doughy. Stupid gift, too bad we got rid of our 1990 model. Worked like a charm.
3	1334880000	Toaster is good but the timer is too noisy, i can not used in the morning i wake up every body
1	1333756800	Worked great till about a couple months ago when it started malfunctioning.  "Toast" would be selected but it would keep cooking even after the timer ran down.  My bagel caught on fire while I was getting dressed for work the other day.  Needless to say this piece of crap is going in the trash.  If you're looking for a product that will last, I recommend paying a few extra bucks.  I should have put this $30 towards a quality product.
5	1333756800	I do not know what I would do without it. I cook nearly everything in it. Pies, biscuits, casseroles, toast. I rarely ever use the large oven
1	1333584000	This is one of the dumbest appliances I have ever come across!  First, the toaster elements do NOT stay on during toasting; they cycle on and off, as if it is trying to maintain a pre-set oven temperature. Who ever heard of a toaster doing that? Therefore, it takes a lot longer to toast, which is very annoying. Second, this machine has a bagel setting which only toasts the top of the bagel!! Do the designers of this feature think that because the bottom side of a bagel is brown, that it doesn't have to be toasted?? Where do they come up with this stuff?? And in case you were wondering, I called Black & Decker, and they said this is the way it's supposed to work, so my unit was not 'defective'. This product is certainly economical, but if you want an efficient toaster, this is NOT it!
1	1333324800	I bought this 2 months ago.  It never toasted correctly, no matter how dark we set the toast, it was never quite done.  As for baking.  Two medium potatoes at 450F for more than an hour, and they were not even close to being done.  This is going back today!
1	1332288000	Searched for just the right toaster oven and chose this one based on the picture and specs.  One of the main features I wanted was the bracket fixture that pulls the oven rack out when you open the door.  One of the reviews mentioned that this oven had that feature so I took a chance.  When the oven arrived it was obvious that there was no bracket attached for auto extension of the rack. Since I had chosen the oven for a gift and my daughter had purchased it for me, I decided to keep it anyway.One of the main functions I use the oven for is toast (does that sound familiar?).  The toast function is much more involved than I would have guessed.  One must set the middle knob to "toast", turn the timer knob past 10 min., turn it back to the toast icon for it to start.  I wasted/burned several pieces of toast trying to determine how close I needed to set the timer knob to the "dark" toast icon and still get edible toast.  Finally I found the right setting and for the next couple of weeks making toast was not a chore.However, I have had the toaster oven for 3 months now and the toast feature no longer works.  I can set the "bake" feature and use the oven but I no longer have a "toaster" for morning toast.  I certainly expected a little longer service than this.Don't waste your money.  Find another oven.  I am in the process of looking for one right now.
5	1332115200	During thanxgiving weekend, all stores are closed, so was doing some house cleaning, and accidentally broke my old oven. Got online and happens to see amazon having online block friday sale of this oven at an amazing price, immediately purchased. The oven works great, we use it for, heating up over-night pizzas, crossness, toasts, bagels, bake cookies. So far all these worked out great, no complains. I haven't got the chance or need to do anything else complicated. The only thing I don't understand is why the manual tells me I have to turn the timer knob pass 15 first, and then turn to my desired time.
1	1331078400	You were probaboy thinking this would be just like the one you parents had 20 years ago. It's not. It is so Poorly made that it turns it's self off after a few minuets.
2	1330992000	This is a basic toaster oven and works fine for heating up leftovers. But not so much for toasting bread. The elements don't get hot enough so it takes longer for the bread to turn brown. As a result, it completely dries it out and makes the bread hard throughout and not just on the outside of the bread like real toasters.
5	1330905600	Easy, quick,and exactly what I asked for. This is a really nice toaster oven. Works excellent! I highly recommend this brand.
2	1330300800	Quick Review:The Good1.  It gets things toasted and heated2.  Decent price (NOTE:  I bought this for $26.99 on Amazon in 2010.  Right now I see $47.55... that's not decent)The Bad1.  Safety features2.  Noise3.  Dubious temperature controlI decided to finally write a review on this product after over a year and a half of using this and seeing its performance over a long period of time.  Elaborating on the good points first.  Basically, it works.  It toasts things and heats things.  The price WAS good when I bought, but not now...Moving onto the bad.  Safety.  1. This thing can be dangerous because the sides and top get extremely hot.  I'm not talking a little hot to the touch.  I mean a drop of water on the top when it's going, and that water will fizz and vaporize instantly.  Also, other toaster ovens i've used have an automatic shut off feature when you open it.  Not this... it keeps going.  2. The timer on this has a really annoying tick tick tick tick old school timer.  The only way you can stop it is if you use the "stay on" feature, but that means you gotta manually watch your toast and then shut it off.  3. What i mean by dubious temperature control is that it doesn't really make an attempt to maintain the temperature you specify on the nob.  It just goes full blast every time.  If you are trying to bake anything here, where you care a bit more about specific temperature ranges, i don't recommend it.Why even 2 stars?  Well, I'm not a moron and i know that you get what you pay for.  Obviously I didn't buy this thinking it was gonna digitally measure exact temperatures and maintain even heating throughout the entire time.  However, I expected a better attempt at doing so, which it didn't.  But, to be fair, this does toast well, and if you keep things away from it and remember not to touch it with your hands, or anything plastic or anything that could melt or catch on fire, then it's not bad.  I've used it to not only toast, but to heat up pizza (I hate the microwave effect for re-heating pizza), baking some simple pastry, which of course didn't turn out too well, etc.  (And also keep in mind the annoying ticking.) Overall, there are better options in this price range, and hence the 2 star rating.
3	1330300800	Seems OK for basic toaster oven functions. It is not very big, but thats good if you have limited counter-space. It looks nice. The door has hooks to pull out the shelf a little bit when you open it, I thought that was nice. Only word of warning I could think of is that the power cord is VERY short. It is about 2 feet maximum, maybe less. Plan on putting it very close to an outlet unless you use a power strip. It has a grounded 3 prong plug so do not use a cheap un-grounded extension cord.
5	1329868800	Bakes, broils, and toasts evenly.Great slide out crumb catcher. Excellent value for the money. I would recommend to anyone !
1	1329782400	I selected this toaster because it was the only one I could find that made some attempt to insulate the heat. It does heat quickly. It gets very hot on the bottom and back. The timer control for darkness on toast is very hard use with any accuracy. You have to stay with it and monitor visually. Perhaps the model with the digital selectors does a better job. The crumb tray is easy to wipe clean but it is permanently attached at the back so be sure to install it close to the sink. When you open it the crumbs dump on the counter. The space between the door and the oven catches everything and is impossible to clean out completely. I consider this appliance an excellent idea with a bad design.
5	1329523200	I love the toaster.  It was as represented on line.  The service was good and I received the item in a timely manner as stated when I purchased it.  The toaster itself is great and I would recommend to others to purchase.
5	1329350400	I've had this toaster oven for over 2 years now and I have absolutely no complaints.  It is not digital, but the price is right and I've never had a problem with it.  It has a stainless steel look (altho not really stainless) so I like the design.  It is easy to use and understand and cooks my food to perfection.
1	1329350400	I bought this piece of junk to replace another Black and Decker Toaster Oven which worked fine for 3+ yrs,(it was a hand me down).The Previous one was mostly made out of metal, this one is mostly made out of plastic, it feels cheap and futuristic in comparison.This one has seen moderate use and 5 months in,it's already broken,the timer/toast knob lost it's chime and functionality in effect making this a Russian Roulette affair since it basically now works as an on/off Toaster Oven when it feels like it, the fun part is that to turn it off/On, you have to (get this) "Unplug the Unit", what are we Cavemen ?As mentioned elsewhere, the dials/knobs are a safety/design mess,and that's even before they failed. about the only thing I can think that has improved from the last model is the crumb tray.Bottom Line: Dangerous Low Quality Badly Designed Cheap Toaster Oven.
4	1329264000	This toaster oven was purchased as a replacement to an over 20 year old GE toaster oven, so it had big shoes to fill.  The oven is actually a bit bigger than it looks but 4 slices of regular toast is not going to fit the oven unless they are scrunched up against each other.  The stainless front is easy to clean and the instrumentation is relatively easy to read.  Fit and finish is OK, nothing to brag about.  Looks nice from a few feet away.So now to the quirks - After a couple of uses, I thought the toaster portion broke.  Well it turns out that when the oven is set at a temperature and the timer is OFF (meaning it is not on), that the toaster will not work.  You must turn the temperature knob to the off position before the toaster knob will turn on the toaster.  Not very intuitive.  So there I was waiting for the toast and the bell rings but no heat in the oven and no toast.A friend of mine has an identical toaster in white and the center timer knob cracked and the knob would just turn without setting the timer.  It was a simple enough fix, but it makes me question how long my knobs will last before I need to make the same repair.  Overall I've been fairly happy with it.  Not much has changed in the 20 years of toaster oven technology.  So hopefully this one will last me another 20 years.
4	1329177600	My only concern with this toaster oven was the ticking noise I heard customers complaining about.I purchased the toaster anyway and almost brought it back the ticking was much too loud.  Then Ifound if you set dial to "stay on" position it does not tick, quiet.  You can do that on broil, bake,orkeep warm settings. I use a separate timer I have in the kitchen for everything.  Toast and bagel go fastso I use the toast settings and hear the tick for a short while. It's good looking, cooks well, slide out front to clean is convenient and large enough for 4 slices.  I'm happy, and I ask alot. Bought it at Sears for under $30
5	1328832000	I've had this Black & Decker Countertop Oven for a couple of months now and I find it very useful.  It has three dials, with Dial #1 controlling the temperature, Dial #2 controlling the cooking function, and Dial #3 controlling the timer.  This timer (max time is 30 minutes, unless you select STAY ON) makes audible ticking sound when the unit is in operation and when it reaches the end, it will give out a loud PING sound and the oven will shut itself off.  If you want to take out the toast/dish/bagel sooner, simply turn the timer dial until you hit the OFF position and the oven will shut off.  What I love about this oven is that the back of the interior is curved so that I can easily put my 9" dinner plate to stay warm and still be able to close the door.  The design is sleek and it's easy to clean.  It's a great addition to my kitchen!
1	1328659200	I have only owned this toaster oven for 6 weeks.  You do need to read the manual to figure out how to make toast.  Both dials need to be in the correct place and the tray has to be on the bottom rack.  Toaster oven worked fine but then suddenly the timer function broke.  There is no OFF switch so the toaster will not not shut off.  You have to unplug it.  Very dangerous.  Of course I already threw away the box.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Since I only owned it for six weeks and will now need a purchase a new one, I don't think I got my money's worth.
5	1328227200	My Black and Decker toaster oven was not working properly, so I decided to look for another one on Amazon. I wanted a larger one that was big enough to hold a dish for baking or a small pizza. I looked especially for Black and Decker.  I choose this one. Mainly because I do like the company, but I also liked the looks of this one. Plus it is big enough to hold a 12 inch pizza,a bread pan or muffin tin.  The first time I used it,I burned the muffins black in just a few minutes! I couldn't figure out what was wrong for quite a while. I read the book several times trying to find the answer. It told me nothing.  After looking at the picture for quite awhile, I figured it out. It comes with a pan ... the book doesn't tell you where to put it, but the picture shows the unit all together. The pan fits on a rack under the baking rack and acts like an oven bottom.  Once I had it assembled correctly, it bakes just fine.  I do have set the temperature lower than instucted by the book. So be careful of that. The unit gets really hot, so make sure to put it out of harms way if you have children.  I liked this one so much I bought another for my Son.
2	1328140800	With all the positive reviews, I can only assume that we just got a bad unit.  Ours does not toast bagels evenly so we're forced to flip them half way through, the door catches on the rack when closing it and you have to fiddle with it to get it close properly.  I'm giving it 2 stars only because it was so cheap.  I should have returned it.
1	1327708800	There is a timer knob that has a stop/off position at center, turn right for toast, left for "stay on" (oven).  The mechanism in knob does not work, so it no longer catches at the stop position, so the only way to turn it off is unplug.  I am concerned that someone won't realize this, will leave it on all day creating a fire hazard. My next toaster oven will have a discrete knob for turning on/off and selecting various functions (not built in to a timer).
2	1327536000	Other than this issue I liked the toaster oven....HOWEVER, IF YOU CANT DRIVE THE CAR, WHY BUY IT???This was my first use of this beautifully designed toaster oven.I placed a food item that required 400 degrees for 30 minutes to cook. I also wanted to make sure the toaster oven was working properlyso I placed my oven thermometer inside to check the temperature.  After 20 minutes I checked the temperature that was set at 400 and thethermometer read 305, a full 95 degrees below the setting.  I increased the setting to  450 degrees and the thermometer went up to 353.This is a real issue if you want to use this for more that toasting a bagel!
1	1326499200	This oven is so small and lite u can only do  childs  size dish in it. I did not even plug it in. I was looking to replace a very tired b&d that holds a true 9x 13 pan and this is not it. Further more when I tried to contact b&d with a question of what model # might match my old one they wanted $30 just to answer that question !! I have heard they have gone hill now this 15 yr. die hard customer is changing brands also!
2	1326153600	Will not hold any set temperture. Turn it up to bake at 450 and food still does not get very hot. Will not stay on during toast setting. Only thing that stays on is broiler setting. Hey it looks nice on the counter.
4	1325808000	This toaster oven works great! the special Bagel setting is great for getting a perfectly toasted bagel every time!4 stars because there is only 1 coil burner on the top rack :/ otherwise no problems!
4	1325808000	This toaster oven is used almost every morning. Works great for bagels. I have a bagel amost every morning and does a real good job toasting it for me. Also use quite a bit when need to bake something too small for regular oven which has been working very well. I'm happy with this Item.
5	1325635200	For the price, this is a very good toaster oven. A toaster oven is never quite the same as one of those old-fashioned toasters, but this one is good at toasting more or less evenly. Also, good for frozen bagels and breads.
1	1325635200	As described by others It will definitely burn the food and it is difficult to make it work correctly.Finally gave up and returned the item.
5	1325548800	This is the toaster oven you want. It's small enough to do the light jobs that you just don't want to do with a microwave. Slices of pizza, anything you want crispy and warm as opposed to hot and soggy. The dials for me took a bit to get used to and at a glance can look like a lot but after a few uses you'll be toasting with ease. I taught my kids how to use it by using a back to the future analogy, this one tells you how hot, this one tells you how long, this one tells you for what.
1	1325116800	This toaster oven is not made well at all!  The door doesn't close properly and is actually installed crooked.  On the 2nd use of the product, the timer broke.  No matter what I try to turn it to, it springs back automatically to the "on all the time" setting.  There is no way to turn it off now other than to unplug the appliance at the wall.  I'm returning it!  I do not recommend this oven at all!  Save your money!!!
5	1325116800	This is the exact replacement I got for the one that my cleaning ladies broke.  The toaster itself is everything we needed and fits our need perfectly.
2	1324425600	I cooked french fries that never browned - the oven keeps cycling off, the toast is too done or not done enough.  would love to return this but don't think Amazon allows this - waste of money.
1	1324252800	I count on Amazon.com to offer competitive prices, quick delivery, no-hassle responses. Just ordered this appliance and it is the bare minimum one would want to use. Functional in lieu of nothing else. However, it arrived the other day and just saw same product for sale locally for half what I paid. Will not make assumptions anymore and heighten diligence when making purchases from here. Picture looks good, appliance looks good, but it is very small, toast takes a long time (4 slices bread? Maybe from a mini-loaf)...and pricing through Amazon.com quite the disappointment. My mistake.
1	1323993600	I ignored the warnings about this toaster oven.  It worked great & I loved it, but after having it for less than 3 weeks it caught on fire in my kitchen this morning while making toast.  It was used properly - the knob wasn't turned past off like the other bad reviews - it just burst into flames quickly.  Luckily I was able to unplug it, grab it with mits & toss it into my back yard.  This item should not be on the market & I will never purchase another black & decker toaster oven again.
1	1323907200	I read all the stellar reviews of this oven online and decided to give it a try. Plugged it in and turned it on for the first time to preheat last night, and left the room. A few minutes later I heard what sounded like a glass explosion, and I returned to find the front glass door in a million pieces and the handle across the counter. I realize this may be a fluke, that I got a glass door that wasn't properly tempered and expanded irregularly when preheating, but what if I'd been standing in front of it waiting to put food inside? I'll be getting a refund - too scared to get another one of these.
1	1323648000	We returned this substandard piece of junk almost as soon as we bought it.  The damned thing can't make toast correctly unless you stand and watch it.  Unlike their old toaster ovens, where you could find a setting for toast and then leave it there, on these damn things you have to select the setting every single time.  The difference between light brown, golden brown and charcoal is the difference of ~1/1000th turn on the dial.  Good luck being consistent with that.  The result is inevitably either charcoal or warm bread unless you stand and monitor the oven as it toasts.
4	1323648000	Exactly as advertised, works well, doesn't take up too much counter-space, and is deep enough to accommodate a small pie.  It actually looks much better than you'd think for the price and I haven't had any problems with the timer dial as some have talked about on here.  I took forever deciding what toaster oven I'd buy given all the different comments on the reviews but I'm very pleased with the purchase.
5	1323302400	Black & Decker has done it again....created a wonderful quality product!  Love the various options/functions, and for the first time ever I baked mini-muffins in a toaster oven and they only took 10 minutes and turned out beautifully!  Toast feature actually toasts, doesn't burn or take forever.  Very happy with this oven and highly recommend it!
3	1323302400	I chose this item because of the reasonable price since I needed it for a temporary purpose.  It seems to take a bit long to warm up and/or toast things but I'm quite pleased.
3	1323302400	Recently purchased the B&D toaster-oven -looks really good -easy to follow the knob diretions broiled a delicious 1 1/4" T-Bone steak  and chicken thighs. As a toaster it sucks toast one side of the bread. really disappointed in the performance.
5	1323129600	I have very little counter space in my apartment kitchen and needed a toaster oven that did not take up much space and still was large enough for baking and broiling for one person.  The appliance is attractive, works well, is easy to keep clean, and I like the added feature of the timer and "stay on" option. I have only had it a few weeks, but so far I am quite pleased with the purchase and would recommend it.  I am especially pleased, because it has cut down on my use of the gas stove,lowering my gas bill.  I found myself not wanting to waste the gas oven baking one lone potato, or a small pizza, so I didn't include them in my diet.  I guess that was a good thing, because since I have had the toaster oven, I have gained weight!  It is just too quick and easy to use!
5	1322697600	This is a very high quality toaster oven considering the price you can find it for. I got mine for $20 on black Friday, and I must say this is easily worth double that. What makes the deal even sweeter is the two year warranty. The unit is very well made and has a lot of screws and metal parts, unlike some cheaper toaster ovens I used in the past. You can do anything with this toaster oven that a conventional gas oven can do, except it won't get your kitchen hot and will use a fraction of the energy. The two heating elements appear to be quartz, not the resistive "wire" elements like in the cheaper toaster ovens. The small size and the quartz elements allows the oven to preheat within a few minutes, saving you time. The compact design is also very space saving and I was able to sit it right above my microwave. Don't let the size fool you though, you can fit a 9" pizza or a whole pack of hot dogs with ease.The oven comes with a good quality grill and baking pan. The grill extends when you open the hatch, making it easy to access your food. The grill can also hold the baking pan right underneath, turning the baking pan into a drip pan. This prevents liquids from falling on the lower heating element; very innovative and convenient.People who had problems with the timer misfiring should remember to turn the dial past the 10 minute mark before setting the desired time. This is necessary because it winds the mechanical timer built inside. Otherwise the timer will run slower or even stop and you will burn your toast; I had to learn this the hard way... that poor little bagel didn't stand a chance :(Some issues I had with the oven are regarding the dials. I am worried the markings around the dial might slowly fade over time. Black and Decker should have put a shield or coating around the markings. I also dislike the redundancy of the dials. For example, to make toast you have to turn the temperature dial and the function dial to toast.All in all this is an excellent toaster oven that you'll end up using quite often.
4	1322524800	We bought this toaster oven at the Black Friday sale at Macy's. It was $20 after rebate, so we figured that was a good deal. We are very happy with it. It makes great toast, and heats up pizza slices quite nicely. I can imagine that you could bake small tnings as well, since the oven tempurature seems to be accurate. Our only negative statement about this product is that the cord is ridiculously short! This cord is so short that you would almost 99% of the time need to get an extension cord to set it up in your kitchen. Other than that, it was a great investment! If it wasn't for the cord, we would rate it as 5-star.
4	1322179200	HEADS UP FOR BLACK FRIDAY BUYERS: this was originally nineteen bucks, not thirty six--don't think you're getting a to-die for deal. Chances are, the price will drop in a week or two.Last year, I lived in a decrepit hole-in-the-wall known as "student housing". The oven (older than my parents) was coated in an inch of black tar--completely unusable. Being on a tight budget, I opted for this toaster oven. I wouldn't say it's the best, but it served its purpose well. I cooked: toaster strudels, home-made pizzas, chicken, beef, home-made fries, home-made chicken pot pies, etc. Very versatile, good for anything you can't just heat up in a microwave.It does take time and patience, though. Seeing as I cook more to eat food rather than enjoy it (I'm no chef) I don't really notice a difference in quality. Those of you who actually know what you're doing when you cook, or are not used to sub-par living conditions, might not enjoy this product as much as I did. Also, I never used it to toast toast--I have a TOASTER for that. Most of the 1/5 reviews come from people frustrated with literal toast.NOTE: I would recommend lining the bottom with foil--makes it much easier to clean/remove crumbs.NOTE: Want to enjoy ghetto pizza like me? Toast pita bread, take it out and cover it in sauce, add cheese, add whatever toppings you want, and stick it back in until the cheese melts to perfection.
4	1322179200	This is somewhat smaller than the one I previously had but it serves the purpose for the two of us. I like that it seems to heat more evenly even though it takes skightly longer for things like biscuits and baked potatoes to cook. But you have to be careful! The oven door gets VERY HOT! In stead of a baking pan there is just a removable tray. The controls are easy to understand and the "leave on" timer function is very convenient. Overall I am very happy with thi product for the price paid.
1	1321747200	It seems almost impossible to create a toaster that works this poorly.  This toaster oven really only has two settings: "cold" and "burned."  After a month of tinkering with the settings, the level of the grate, and the timer, I have concluded that it is impossible for this toaster oven to heat something without burning it to a crisp.  Next stop: garbage can.
1	1321747200	My Black and Decker older toaster oven bit the dust and I needed another one. So I bought another Black and Decker. What a mistake. They have certainly cut corners on the new ones. The thing I really hate the most - is that you have to be very careful to turn it off. It just doesn't pop-up like my last one did. The first toast takes forever and then the toast seems dried out and hard. The next ones don't take as long but still longer than my old one. There were 2 heating elements on top of my old one - now just one. I should have sent it backbut I had company and needed to use it. ALsoI did pay more for it than I should have. Sears had the same thing $20 cheaper. My bad for not checking out the competition. First thing I got from Amazon that I am not happy with.
1	1321315200	The hook on both side of the door that grab onto the sliding rack is flawed. Instead of making it curved, it is at the wrong angle, so as you close the door, the sliding rack does not slide inward.Other than that, this would have been fine. The lack of the one-button toast function really make it undesirable.
1	1321056000	This Toast-R-Oven doesn't toast at all. I'm am going to have to purchase another toaster, because the toast function doesn't work. I'm VERY disappointed with this purchase. I live overseas and it doesn't pay for me to send it back. A huge waste of money for me.
1	1320969600	I bought this toaster oven to replace a very old but scruffy looking Delongi toaster oven.  There is one major problem with this toaster oven - it is incapable of getting warm enough to toast anything or indeed to cook anything!!  I am terribly disappointed.  I frankly do not care how easy it is to clean if I have to wait 15 minutes to get mildly light brown toast for my kid's breakfasts. We don't have 60 minutes to wait for little muffins to cook.  I am so sorry to have replaced by Delongi with this under powered machine. Do not buy one of these.
5	1320969600	My toaster oven arrived in only a few days and in beautiful condition.  After a little experimenting I find that it is quite reliable.  Now don't let this gross you out...we live in the country and now and then would have a mouse in the house.  Maybe once every two or three years.  It would always find it's way to my counter top.  The idea of having toast made with a toaster that was visited by a mouse..well that grossed me out.  The mice don't live long but how do you clean the inside of a toaster??? So now I have can have my toast with the assurance that a mouse hasn't been able to get in the toaster. And can use it for other small cooking also.
4	1320969600	Works well on bagels,toast,pizza. Browning is excellent. Process seems  to be a bit slow. Unit is attractive and cleans up well, including crumb tray.
5	1320796800	I purchased this Toaster Oven after reading the reviews and am very pleased with the product.  It was very easy to set up (less than 5 minutes) and while I've only used the toaster control it works very well.  I would recommend this to anyone in need of an inexpensive Toaster Oven that looks (and seems to perform) like those that are double or triple the cost.
5	1320710400	This toaster oven was what I had been looking for. I used the regular toaster machine before.However, when I need to just quick bake, it is too hard to use the big oven.This toaster oven is very useful every morning even I can bake the cookies.There are several options that you can choose like the bake style.It is very helpful to have that. If I were you, I would very much like to buy this.There are so many brands out there.This brand is a reasonal price and great quality.
1	1320278400	This is a cheap Chinese piece of crap.  If you want something that makes your food taste like burned metal and will break in 3 months, then you will love this product!
4	1320192000	Works well, and fits well in my little kitchen. Not a huge fan of the wierd baking tray, but aside from that, it's like Mary Poppins, practicly perfect.
4	1320019200	I have only used this once so far, so I can not comment on how durable this might be, but previous Black and Decker toaster ovens I have used lasted for many, many years.  This has all the necessary features, including a bell to signal when the toast is up.  Toast was very evenly browned.  I didn't realize the other one I was using did such a bad job until I used this one.
2	1319846400	If you are looking for something to use for making your basic sliced-bread toast, it's impossible to get any consistency with this toaster oven due to it's design. It has a rotary timer that you wind and *try* to get in the right spot, but if you are off by a millimeter of so, you have burnt toast. If you're off the other way you have underdone toast - in which case you have to try again (and *don't* forget to turn PAST the ambiguous "must turn past me" icon, then back),  in which case you invariably end up with burnt toast anyway. I can't, for the life of me, understand why Black and Decker abandoned their old standard set-the-timer and push-down-the-button-to-start design. It was so simple -  you always got your bread toasted right, since you could set the timer and leave it! Incredibly, *every* non-digital toaster oven out there now uses this new, retarded timer system!The other problem we had was with the door - it broke and now flops down annoyingly all the time.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that it does work pretty well as an oven.
1	1319760000	I just unpacked my oven and it is much smaller than it was described on Amazon, actual size, measuring on the outside of the oven is: 16x8x10 inches vs Amazon's description: 18.9x12.4x15 inches, you can barely fit anything in it, not even a personal pizza will fit as it's shown on the picture, description is just misleading, Amazon offered me either exchange or return/refund, they said nobody had issue with the size yet, which I cannot believe
5	1319760000	This is a great toaster over for reheating pizza or anything else you don't want to pre-heat your oven in your stove for.  It works wonders for that purpose and takes so much less energy.  It also works great for toasting bread or making small portions of garlic toast.  All in all, this was a great purchase and works wonders in a kitchen for 2 people.  I appreciate that I don't have to use the big oven for smaller things.
5	1319500800	Well after 3 evenings of search and comparing reviews, I selected this unit based on Look, Black and Chrome Finish, just like other SS appliance in the kitchen.I received Toast-R-Oven yesterday and ran trial run to warm up left over food.  Food come out at right temperature.  I like the knob controls and full length of handle design (No High temp Glue to stick handle)Many people talked about size of the oven in the reviews and mentioned that size per specification shown by manufacturer is not correct.  I was more interested in inside size of the unit.  I was not able to find it anywhere.  I made a judgment call and purchased the unit.  For future buyers, here is some dimension data may help you to decide buy or not to buy this unit.Inside open-usable space with rack in a bottom slot.  10" Wide X 9 1/4" Deep (may gain 1/2" due to curved door) X 2 1/2" high (allowing 3/8" to 1/2" Space left between top element and utensil).I placed Pyrex rectangular pan with following dimension.  9 5/8" (wide) X 8" Deep X 3" high.  Width and Depth wise had some open clearance.  Gap between Top of the pan and upper element did have much space left, may be 1/8".  Pan was going in and out fine and closing door was no issue.  If you keep food 1" to 2" high in this size of pan it should cook fine.  Make trial run for temperature and time settings to see results.Outside Dimension: 15 3/4 wide X 11" Deep includes safety spacer knob in the back (3/4" Long) X 8 1/2 High.Overall it is worth what Amazon is selling for with shipping included.
5	1319155200	Needed a small toaster oven to fit on my counter.  All the new toaster ovens are combined convection ovens/toaster ovens and huge, take up a huge amount of counter space.  This is a little retro but perfect if all you ever want to do is toast bread, bagels, tortillas/
4	1318723200	The Black & Decker TRO48O5BS Toast-R-Oven (4-slice) works just as it should.  Ordering was easy and it arrived on its scheduled delivery date.  It comes in very handy when cooking smaller items while not wanting to heat your house from the heat of a larger oven (especially in the summer).  So, it saves on your cooling bills.  I've cooked salmon, toasted bagels, and even made a delicious batch of banana bread.  The only drawback is that it's a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  Otherwise, it performs great!
5	1318550400	Bought this a year ago...I only use it to toast thing nothing more so I can't say about the baking and broiling part etc..Anyways i love it..Cleaning the cheese from it is a bit hard but otherwise its great.
4	1318550400	I think this toaster oven is a great size! Works really well too. The only thing is a i wish it was a little bit bigger because the rack can only fit on the top shelf part and if you lower it the door doesn't really close well. BUT other than that it is a great product. Would recommend!!!
1	1318464000	Excellent product. The many choices for cooking and toasting make this a desirable product.It compares more favorably than other makers toaster ovens.The price is also admirable.
2	1318291200	So I purchased this toaster oven back in May (less than five months ago) and it has served its purpose pretty well about 99% of the time. However, the timing mechanism is mechanical and made quite cheaply, so as the minutes toasting add up to hours, some problems have begun to surface. Namely, the timer occasionally sticks and if you aren't there to turn off the device it just KEEPS-ON-A-TOASTIN' until you've got a piece of charcoal in place of your waffle and a kitchen filled with smoke. No fires have been caused to date luckily. Just a word of advice: you get what you pay for. Sure, this toaster oven will work fine in the short term, but look elsewhere if you want something that will last and operate reliably and predictably.
3	1318118400	Smaller than I thought it would be and made cheaply, however, it does the trick in toasting and heating foods.  Wish it was made more sturdy.  We used to purchase better quality for the price, prior to Chinese coming online.
5	1317859200	There is absolutely nothing wrong with this toaster oven!  I had to write in after seeing some of the reviews, I use Amazon reviews when buying many things, and thought this was a pretty solid unit, but was concerned over some of the reviews I read.  I've had it for a year now, and love it.  Everything works perfectly, and the price was very low.  The timer works, It toasts, bakes, turns off correctly, dings when items are done, etc.  I do mini pizzas, bread, bagels, soft pretzels, even chicken breasts in this oven and they all come out crispy and done perfectly.  I'm a multi tasker, and often will forget something's in there, but the timer always goes off, and the oven shuts down as it should.  The bottom slides out easily to dispose of the crumbs.  Toast does get lines on the bottom from the grill on which it sits.  Nice and small, fits perfectly on my counter, yet roomy enough for everything I need.  Great for reheating pizza slices, tastes much better than using a microwave, still quick, and uses less electricity than your large oven.  I have a wooden tea box right beside the oven, and the heat hasn't affected it at all.  I like the metal baking tray that comes with it, I line it with foil to cut down on clean up. A dependable toaster oven...buy it and love it!
4	1317859200	THE PRODUCT IS WORKING FINE & IT IS REAL ATTRACTIVE. IT ARRIVED WELL PACKED AND WITH NO DAMAGE.  I FAILED TO GIVE IT A 5 STAR RATING BECAUSE THE SHELF DOES NOT COME OUT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR.  MY OLD ONE DID AND I GUESS I'M SPOILED) YOU ARE TEMPTED TO PULL IT OUT WITH YOUR HAND BUT THAT'S A NO NO!  HOT, HOT, HOT.  LUCKILY I HAD A TUPPERWARE UTINSEL IN MY DRAWER FOR YEARS JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE.  PRICE WITH AMAZON WAS $25 CHEAPER THAN MY LOCAL DEPARTMENT STORE.  DON'T HESITATE TO GET THIS ONE IF YOUR LOOKING.
5	1317600000	Again, thanks to Amazon reviews, I chose this toaster.  It was exactly what I was looking for, and I love everything about it.  What I appreciate the most, besides the great price, is the ease of cleaning.  As a woman who does the cleaning, I couldn't have designed it better.  Not only does the crumb tray come out easily, but the "bottom" of the oven does too, or I should say bottom liner, slides right out.  No shaking the oven over the trash can as I have had to do with toasters, or try to wipe it out with a cloth.  It is very convenient and is very attractive, as well.
1	1317513600	I bought this toaster oven last April (it's now October) after owning a B&D; toaster oven for more than a decade.  I really didn't like the new design but the price was low; I basically just needed something to toast bread and occasionally heat a slice of pizza or grilled cheese. After six months, the door no longer shuts tight, so it's basically unusable.I also have the complaint so many others have had: the toaster timer is unreliable and the Timer Off switch is easily confused with a Stay On stitch.  And the tray is constantly getting stuck on the door hooks.My old toaster oven was simple for toasting; this one is a nightmare.  It feels shoddy and cheap and -- surprise! -- it IS shoddy and cheap.In a word: AVOID!
4	1317513600	My only criticism of this is the toaster element seems a bit more complicated than necessary and it was hard in the beginning NOT to burn the toast, however this was easily remedied by setting the timer lower.  For the price, it's a good basic toaster oven and doesn't take up too much counter space.  Looks good and will blend well if you have other stainless appliances.
3	1316995200	My latest in a long line of Black and Decker toaster ovens that I have had over many years. It toasts well and more evenly and quickly than my last one.My only complaint is that to toast you to set all 3 dials to toast. Set the top Temperate knob to toast. Set the middle Function knob to toast. Set the bottom toaster knob to desired toasting time.  Turn the toaster time knob past 10 minutes and back to the toasting time you want. Or you can turn it to the stays on setting. Everybody who has used it for the first time so far and who has pulled the toast out prior to the timer stopping, has accidently turned the toast knob past off to the toaster stays on position. I personally think this is a design and safety flaw. A first time user thinks it is off, walks away leaving it on and then "something smells hot". When you've don't it once you remember that toaster off is not at the end of the toast time knob rotation as on the toaster oven we owned.This toaster oven toasts better than the last one, but I liked the toast time control on the old one better. On that unit you set the time and then pushed the toast button. Next time if you were toasting for the same time you just pushed toast the button again. This was a better system for our household.We almost never bake in the toaster oven, though this oven is a little smaller than the last one.  The old baking slides are too wide for this unit. You could only bake a very few biscuits or something in a very small pan. That is not a problem for us because we usually only toast bread slices, cheese toast or bagels in a toaster oven. My last toaster oven lasted about 4 years, which I think is about average for the units I have owned over the past 25 years.
2	1316995200	My sister-in-law and I bought this item at about the same time in two different states.  After three years of use, we both developed the same problem: the timer became erratic.  Sometimes in the middle of the toasting/baking it would simply stop ticking and wouldn't get to zero.  The first time it did this, I charred my bagel through and through.  I tested the toaster oven again and again after that to see what the problem was.  Now I stand nearby and if I stop hearing the ticking of the timer, I go to the toaster oven and physically push the timer forward until I hear ticking again.  It seems to be a flaw in design.  Don't walk away from this thing or you might end up with a fire.
4	1316908800	This is the most efficient heating oven I've ever had.  It toasts really well, and it heats food quickly.  The only downside is that it doesn't turn off automatically when the door opens.  Hubby thinks that's a safety issue.  Other than that, it's great.  Worth the extra money.
4	1316908800	works as expected. no problems yet. heats up fast. i dont know what else to write but amazon is telling me to write more to publish this message.
4	1316736000	This product seems to bake well and evenly.  The product seems sturdy and efficient.  The only criticism I have is that the wording around the knobs is difficult to read so I have to actually use a flashlight in order to read the temp.  It is easy to clean. I like using Black and Decker products, and find they have good workmanship and last longer.  I think it is priced right for what it provides.  I shopped around and Amazon had the better price, but only if you get free shipping.
2	1316563200	Bottom crumb tray/"floor" of toaster broke after 1 1/2 yrs.  Uneven & takes a long time to toast or broil or bake.  Hard to clean...
1	1316217600	I would strongly recommend against buying this toaster.  Many have mentioned the glitchy knob which makes it tricky to set the timer and difficult to turn the toaster off.  This is definitely a major flaw, but the problems do not stop there.  There is also a strip of metal on the door which is located very close to the handle.  When opening, it is very easy to burn one's self on this as it gets very hot and I have done this several times.Finally, the toaster is very erratic.  When the timer is set properly, for instance, on the "bagel" setting, you never know what you'll get.  one day it will toast the bagel perfectly, the next day it will be a charred black crumb and the next barely heated at all.We usually stand right next to the toaster and just monitor it and manually remove the toast once done.  There is really no other way.  The product is that bad and we will soon be returning it.I have never even thought twice about any toaster in my life but this product is so bad I had to write a review to warn others.
4	1316044800	We had a black and decker toaster oven for over 7 years and it worked wonderfully during that time.  Unfortunately, it finally died on us and we replaced it with another black and decker because we were so happy with our last one.  This one seems to be really nice as well.  It toasts and bakes evenly.  My only criticism is that the knob to toast is a little tricky and can easily be accidently left on.  Other than that, a very nice product that will hopefully last as long as our last one.
1	1315872000	Should have known this price wouldn't yield a high quality item. Maybe ok for toast but doesn't work well as a mini oven. Baked a small potato for 70 minutes at 400 degrees and it was still hard as a rock. Other toaster oven we had before worked fine. Returning and will buy a better quality one next time.
1	1315785600	Okay, I will join in with the many others who have warned you about this toaster, and warn you again, do not buy this toaster!  I replaced an older model by B&D that worker fine for many years.  This unit looks good, is not too expensive and I just wanted something to toast bread and bagels and once and a while melt something on top.  Nothing to difficult right?  Last Sunday morning I finally had it with this thing.  I don't tend to curse much, but the fact that this had burned yet another bagel put me over the edge.  Instead of having the traditional setting for light, medium and dark, and then starting the unit, this thing has a crazy dial that you have to turn past a certain spot and then back to some setting that you have to guess at.  There is no way to really fine tune how long the timer is going to run.  Sometimes it is too short, sometimes charcoal.  Ugh!  I agree with others that is takes a long time to toast, and the unit gets incredibly hot.  Don't let the good looks fool you, stay away!
3	1315612800	I hate toaster ovens. I like them, but not the ones that have been around for the last several years. I had an old GE that friends gave me over 20 years ago that lasted nearly as long. When it expired, it took awhile to find one and when we did, it was a Proctor Silex we bought. It was not the best, but did the job. Unfortunately, in our latest move, it was broken and we had to find another one. This time I did a lot of research and read reviews on Amazon and other sites to find one I would like.This is a nice little counter oven. It heats up nicely for baking and broiling. The toaster part of it, the reason I purchased it leaves a great deal to be desired. It has three knobs and no sliding switch, as with its predecessors had, but I knew that. There's a noisy timer that ticks while it is toasting and toasting takes awhile and when it is done, even set for dark, the bread is barely toasted.Now, all I can do is buy an actual toaster for when I want toast, which makes another expense and another waste of space. Should I find another toaster oven that actually toasts, I will be giving this one away. It's adequate as a compact oven, but lousy at toasting, and even though it is called a toaster oven, in my opinion, it is not.
4	1315094400	I had a great feeling about it as soon as I got the box! Well packaged - everything was in there. It looks great and works great! It is rather light though, so be careful when you're pulling stuff out of it - don't yank too hard or the oven's going to come along for the ride as well!
5	1314921600	With this toaster oven I don't have to turn the big oven on.  it's fast, accurate  and easy to use.  I just love it .
1	1314921600	We had previously owned an earlier version from Black and Decker, and this newer product was much, much worse. While the previous version was nothing fancy, it performed well on the basics: quick heating of the coils, even toasting, relatively short toasting time for bread. The baking was fine. This version is inferior in almost every regard. The coils take a long time to heat up, toasting is uneven, and the bread winds up more dessicated than it does toasted. And then when you are cooking something more substantial like chicken nuggets, chicken strips, or fries, the oven seems to have an aversion to running at a high temperature. It takes longer to cook chicken nuggets in this toaster oven than it does in my real oven, and it's not even close. So I really don't get what the manufacturers were thinking. It sucks as a toaster, and it sucks as an oven. It's also the last Black and Decker toaster oven I will buy.
1	1314921600	I bought this toaster oven to replace one that I had for many years.  It's "energy efficient" which means that it takes three times as long to toast.  The chrome finish started to discolor almost immediately and it always looks dirty.Very, very disappointed.
3	1314748800	When I bought this a few weeks ago, it was half the cost it is now. I was coming on here to say it IS worth that amount. Not sure about the current cost!For the price, this toaster oven looks great. Matches well with my nicer appliances. And the pull-out crumb drawer is a good feature. My old toaster ovens had to be turned upside down to clean, creating a huge mess.The cons:It ticks constantly (and loudly) throughout every toast and/or bake cycle. If you are a person bothered by little noises, this will drive you nuts.Second, it doesn't toast evenly at all. The front half gets toasted while the back is not browned at all. This even happens with a single piece of toast.Third, it's sort of overly complicated. There are three different knobs that have to be set for each function. So if you want to toast, you have to turn two knobs to 'toast' and then set the timer. Although, the other day I toasted when one knob was still on bake, and it made no difference (still uneven).And, finally, as others have mentioned, the 'stay on' feature is somewhat easy to turn to accidentally. If you turn just slightly past "off" it will ding but still go to "stay on". Just be sure the blue light is off.Overall, fine for the price I paid. Not sure I would pay $40 as listed now.
1	1314662400	I have been shopping on Amazon.com since the beginning of time and I have never left a review...until now. I renovated my kitchen and needed a very small toaster oven that could easily fit in one of my pull out tray cabinets. We only use a toaster oven to toast so I didn't need anything fancy. I thought this toaster oven would be perfect. Within about a month of using it, it would give off a horrible smell of burning plastic. Not only do I clean out the crumb tray after each use, I never plug the unit in near anything. I continued to use it and then discovered that the timer would not shut off and the coils that get orangy-red when it use would sporadically go off/on. Anytime I used the toaster I would have to stay close by and then unplug it as soon as it was done (timer would still continue to tick). Needless to say, I just tossed the toaster in the garbage before it set my nice new kitchen cabinetry ablaze. Now granted, I know there are reviews out there which are favorable and I am sure they did get toasters that don't have issues, but that is definitely not the case with many, so do yourself a favor and run the other way. Although this is a very inexpensive toaster oven, please do not even bother wasting your money. Put the money towards a better toaster oven. I wish I did. Shame on you Black & Decker!!
4	1314576000	i purchased the black and decker toast-r-oven after much thought and research. the toaster oven isn't very large, but it can toast 4 slices of bread with little room to spare. it is a great toaster. works great. the only drawback, the cord is extremely short. so short, we had to move a bunch of things around in our kitchen just so the toaster oven is close to an outlet. i actually purchased 2 more as spare toasters since the unit is reasonably priced. a+
5	1314403200	Having gone through several toaster ovens that were either given to me or my old one dying, I looked for one that fulfilled all my needs at a good price and to my satisfaction no tax and no shipping fees. I just wish the baking function had an element on the bottom as well as on top, but I knew that before I purchased it. I need it mostly for toast anyway and It does this well. A good item overall.
5	1313971200	Been using this over a year now, and have not had any problems.We use with bagels, toast, open faced sandwiches, reheating dishes, reheating bread sticks, pizza, etc.This things works great :)
5	1313884800	At first, second and third glance, the Black & Decker TRO480BS toaster oven IS your mother's GE toaster oven of 20 - 30 years ago. Only visual changes: The update is bigger, has an extra dial, and features a crumb tray.Result: You can toast more bagels or pizza rolls at a crack.So what makes the TRO480BS so special? Under $16 everyday price at the local Big Box discounter. That's 75% less than Mom paid 30 years ago.Kicks the crumbs out of our toasted one-trick over-priced DeLonghi toaster, too.
1	1313712000	I'm writing this review because I am on Amazon ordering a new toaster oven, less than a week after buying this model.  It hasn't broken, but I am throwing it out because it is VERY UNSAFE.This toaster oven was a replacement for an old toaster oven of the same brand and similar model.  The old one worked great and was still chugging along after over 10 years of use, but the white exterior had yellowed and looked crummy in our newly remodeled kitchen.  No bells or whistles, but since all we used it for was toast and making toasted cheese and reheating pizza, it was just fine.  We especially liked the ease of use and the small footprint.  We bought a new silver colored one of the same type (we thought).The replacement:1. Fire hazard!!  Absolutely RADIATES heat from all sides; NO insulation apparently.  Burning hot after one "light toast" usage. I can't imagine what it would be like if it was used for more than a couple of minutes.2  Worse fire hazard!!  As others have mentioned, if you dial even a tiny bit past "off", you have set it on "stay on". This is very easy to do.  My son called in a panic because his toast was burning and he could not figure out how to turn the thing off.  He (and our contractor, luckily still there) had to unplug the thing to turn it off.  How this got past the design crew, I cannot imagine.  This is a fatal flaw. I'm amazed this item is still on the market.3. Extremely shoddy construction.  I know it's cheap.  Okay.  However, one dial fell off immediately.  And the lack of insulation is ridiculous and unsafe, and compares very badly with the old model.
5	1313625600	I like my toaster oven.  It's works well and it is just the right size.  It doesn't take alot of space on my kitchen countertop.
4	1313452800	Picked this up on sale at the local supermarket for $19.I was looking for an inexpensive toaster oven that wasn't too small to bake most items and wouldn't fall to pieces every time you open the door. This one fits the bill quite well. Some things are just better baked but in the summer running the large conventional oven just about cooks us out of the kitchen.Many of the inexpensive ovens just have one dial that doubles as on/off and timer together. I don't care for that design myself, and this oven can do quite a few different things.Front to back the oven is large enough for a Totinoes party pizza and does a much better job of it than my large conventional oven.I don't use the built in timer so I can't really say whether it is accurate or not. I have several digital timers in the kitchen so I use the "always on" setting by turning the bottom dial counter-clockwise. As I'm not an idiot and know how to use a toaster oven, I don't leave it unattended either. I always unplug it when I'm done using it.The cord is long enough and I can sit the toaster at the front of the counter if need be.It has a nice and large handle on the door that stays nice and cool to the touch.Yes the top and sides get hot...it's a toaster oven. If this is a real issue for you then buy an insulated one. They generally start at around $80 on sale.Temperature settings seem fairly accurate but users need to keep in mind that toaster oven cooking times are usually shorter than conventional oven cooking times.**Preheating is very critical with toaster oven baking.**Uses far less electricity than my conventional oven and doesn't heat up the house as much either.Cools off pretty quickly after use.Perfect for small 9" pizzas, Texas Toast, etc...
3	1313452800	HMMMM...... IT DOSNT TOAST EVENLY...... BUT STILL DOES A GOOD JOB..... AND THE SAME DAY I ORDERED IT, IT WAS ALMOST 10 BUCKS CHEAPER AT WAL-MART (I KNOW I HATE THE PLACE TOOO... BUT COME ON AMAZON BEAT WALLEY WORLD!!!)

1	1313366400	This was given to us as a gift, so my comments do not relate to Amazon, per se. The toaster function of this device is terrible. It cycles on and off every ten seconds or so, and it can take as much as ten minutes of this nonsense to toast a piece of bread so the point where the color begins to change. Been through the manual, managed the settings according to the instructions, and nothing makes a difference. Frankly, one shouldn't have to adjust three separate knobs to perform a function as simple as making toast. Waste of money!
5	1313280000	outstanding item!  arrived earlier than expected.  toaster ovens are a limited life item & will last 5-10 years if used semi-daily.  if item lasts more than that, then you are in luck. thermostat seems to be the part that wears out first.  very easy to clean.

2	1312934400	Want mine? I'm throwing it away before it burns down the house.The mechanical timer switch is unreliable and does not always shut-off. I neglected to keep an eye on it this morning, and was thankfully alerted by our smoke detector. The toaster was stuck on, and the contents burst into flames.I snapped a photo (after extinguishing the fire, although my wife suggested the photo would have been more dramatic if I captured the flames) and uploaded it to the customer images. I was surprised to see how many other similar photos were there.So, why am I giving what appears to be a defective product some positive stars? Because as an oven, it's not that bad. As others have noted, the toaster function is not great. And, clearly, the mechanical timer is dangerous. But the oven part works pretty well.
2	1312761600	The Photo that you show is very deceiving. I could not believe how small is this toaster oven. Very big disappointment
5	1312588800	got it for $28 its such a good deal! thanks amazon!! and it looks so good in my tiny kitchen! :)i always wanted a toaster oven to simply bake some healthy food .love the user manual , easy to understand,though, there is no preheat dial....but i preheat 10 min anyway hahhahaha oh , and  the pan does get sticky . guess i should use more olive oil at the bottom i guess.so far i have no problem with it and been baking chicken steak and toast in it everyday!with using a toaster oven it save me from sweat and the heat while cooking  all around my small apartment !very good investment if u live in a small apartment and want to save yourself time cooking and sweating . :)
4	1312502400	The appliance works well.I found the instructions confusing and we needed time to master.Also it was a little small for toasting 4 standard slices of bread.Did well with broiliing small steak. ( Black and Decker TRO 480BS Toaster Oven
4	1312416000	I had this toaster oven in my on campus college apartment and it worked great.  The product is great looking and functions well.The product has three knobs as you can see.  From bottom to top, you have the timer, the function, and the temperature.  All three knobs worked great and to the functionality they said.We toasted bread, bagels, melted cheese for sandwiches and even heated up left over pizza to perfection.  Again, the devil is in the details of how you do it, I recommend bake or toast for a bit then broil to get the top nice and warm and melted.The crumb tray is large and easy to remove.  This is a great function over my other oven and makes getting a good solid, but not complete clean easy and quick.  You simply slide the tray out (the bottom is much lower than the door) and can wash it off very quickly (make sure it's not still hot!).The product on toast, high will burn your bread, so make sure you get your settings down right the first few times and you should be fine.  With my different Toaster oven at home, and this product I found flipping the bread made the sides toast more evenly.  Maybe adjusting the height of the grill could help this, but I recommend watching toaster ovens works as they can be very dangerous if they malfunction.I strongly recommend unplugging all toaster ovens when done using.  This product, and a completely different one at home cane be finicky in turning them selves off - especially if you do not turn the timer dial past a certain point.  This speaks more to Toaster Ovens in my opinion than this specific product.Overall in my experience with toaster ovens this one functioned well.
1	1312329600	I had an old b&d; toaster oven which worked fine.  The knobs fell off.  I tried to glue them back on, but they stuck in one place.DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK THEY HAVE PRODUCED.1. you need to set THREE dials to make a piece of toast.  ridiculous.  neither does it seem to sense when the toast is done, so it burns a lot if i don't guess the right minutes for said particular piece of bread.2. i burned my fingers on the outside of the front door.  the outside.  that is how poorly the thing is insulated.I would have sent it back, but it is too much trouble for a cheap appliance.You know I would be willing to pay a little more for something that worked and lasted, but alas in today's world there is only junk to buy.
2	1311984000	When this attractive stainless steel and black toaster oven arrived less than two months ago we were very pleased with its appearance, the price, and its function. We had scarcely used the toaster function, but when we did it had worked just fine up until the day before yesterday.  I have been following the directions exactly, including moving the timer/toast dial all the way past 10 and then back to the desired setting. A bit of a pain, but since I had read in advance that was what we would have to do I accepted it and the toast/bagels came out very well. So the day before yesterday I set the timer/toast function and the english muffin I was toasting came out a bit too light so I tried setting it again. This time I could not get the top heater to work plus the timer would not shut off the clicking sound when I turned the dial to off. I tried unplugging the unit and then retried everything fifteen minutes later. Same problems as I described above - the timer even kept clicking after I unplugged the toaster for a time! I forgot about it until the weekend when my husband attempted to make some toast. Same problems, so we had to forget about any toast that morning.  On Monday morning I will call the company and try to get a replacement sent, but this is very disappointing as I had my last Black & Decker toaster oven for over ten years with no problems.****UPDATE to a 4* product review: Amazon was contacted and a brand new toaster oven sent to us with a label to send back the defective one. VERY HAPPY and the new toaster oven is functioning perfectly after several weeks of daily use.
1	1311724800	I bought this toaster oven about a year ago. I didn't like it as much as my old Black and Decker that I had had for years but I couldn't find that model. I'm not sure they make it anymore. But I tried three other new toaster ovens that were unsatisfactory as well and just decided to settle on this one. I don't like the dial you use to set the toast time. The timer ticks annoyingly and it is not easy to figure out just the right amount of time to set it for.  But I have used it pretty much every day so I've gotten used to it.BUT...today, I put a piece of bread in and set it as I always do. I then went to finish an email on my computer while waiting for the bing of the timer. I'll admit, I was side-tracked and got into my email. When I remembered the toaster and realized that I hadn't heard the timer go off, I went into the kitchen which was filled with smoke. The oven was STILL ON though the time was not ticking or moving. The dial was stuck! There were small flames on the bottom which went out when I opened it. The bread was charred - totally black - and giving off so much smoke. All of my smoke detectors were going off. I got the smoke to stop as well as the detectors. But getting the oven to turn off was no small feat. It stayed on when I opened it. I even turned the dial past the OFF point where it usually bings and turns off. It still stayed on. The dial is faulty and could easily have burned my kitchen down had I not gotten there in time. DO NOT BUY THIS DANGEROUS TOASTER!
1	1311724800	This is the toaster you want if you want to burn down your house. I got this oven as a present 7 months ago and when it works right, it's a nifty little appliance.  It has this little quirk with the timer, however, where it doesn't always turn off when it's supposed to. There is a "Stay On" setting that is right next to the Off setting, and the catch between the 2 settings doesn't always engage.  We learned this early on with a mess of blackened toast, and so I am always super careful in setting the timer.  This morning I was making toast and the phone rang so I turned the toaster to off and walked away to answer the phone. I came back to find flames shooting out of the toaster and charring the underside of the cabinet above, even though all the settings on the toaster indicated that it was off.  If you buy this, make sure you put it in a place where you will be able to keep an eye on it, not in a pantry or enclosed space.
5	1311638400	I was tired of making toast in the oven for the last 20 years, so we finally splurged and bought this Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven.  For $30.00, the price seemed right (though I see that in the past few days since I ordered it, the price has dropped...thanks a lot, Amazon).  Our toaster just arrived today.  After I unpacked it and washed the rack and the little pan it came with, I followed the simple pre-baking instructions: I turned it on for 15 minutes to sear off the manufacturer's residue.  Light smoke came up, which quickly disappeared.  Keep your eyes on the toaster during this process to be sure there are no defects that might appear the first time you use it.So far, I have only made toast, which is one of the few functions I wanted a toaster oven for, such as reheating pizza or baking snacks, etc.  I certainly don't intend on using it to make a pot roast.  It works best for toasting if you set your function knob to BAKE.  This way, you don't have to turn the timer back and forth, as the manual says, which seems like a very quick way to break the knob if you do that every time you want a piece of toast.  Start by setting the temperature to 250 degrees or lower to experiment at first; that's how I figured it out.  Set the timer to 10 minutes.  If that doesn't do the job, set it to go a little longer or raise the temperature.  I was using frozen bread, so it took the toaster longer than 10 minutes for the toast to reach a light golden brown at 350 degrees.  The toaster also has a BROIL setting to melt or brown items on the top side of your food without burning it underneath.I like the toaster's little blue light on front, the ticking noise it makes while it's working, and its pleasant "DING!" when the toast is ready.  Someone here actually complained that the ticking is too loud, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a safety device that prevents me from forgetting the toaster is on.  Its exterior gets very hot, as some reviewers have noted, but the flat top wasn't too hot for me to set a stoneware plate on it to get warm, which is a nice extra.  It didn't take very long for the unit to completely cool off after use.  I suggest that if you have a plastic counter, as we do, set the unit on tiles (ceramic, stone or brick).  They keep the rubber feet of the toaster stable and prevent the counter from getting hot.  Keep the toaster away from potentially flammable areas, and don't leave the room while it's on.  In short, use common sense, and you and your toaster should get along fine.UPDATE: Still very happy with the toaster!  I heated a bunch of frozen vegetarian corn dogs in it and they were perfectly done in 20 minutes baked at 400 degrees.  I used the baking pan which I wrapped in foil to keep it clean.  No need for cooking spray or grease.
3	1311638400	On the plus side this toaster has an attractive appearance and is moderately priced.  My biggest negative is the oven rack frequently snags upon attempting to push it back when closing the cover. This requires getting out an oven mitt or utensil to manually push back the hot rack.  Moreover, the oven is not particularly big and the control settings are not very intuitive compared to other toasters I have used.Still, it gets the job done for a relatively inexpensive price. 3 Stars.
4	1311465600	i really like to eat so that means that I love my new toaster oven. It works great,toasts evenly and best of all it's easy to keep clean. It has a coated crumb tray that slides out easily and all you have to do is wipe it off. Great product at a great price.
4	1311465600	Have only used for toast and bagels. For that it is OK with one shortcoming. Unlike a toaster, you cannot set the toasting level.  There is a medium setting, but you can never tell if the dial is on medium, a little above or a little below.
4	1311379200	I bought this oven pretty much for the broiling feature as my trailer range doesn't have a broiler. The other features are secondary to my needs but nice to have.
4	1311206400	This is a great toaster oven, especially at the price I picked it up for ($19 when amazon dropped the price). Unfortunately, the small size of this toaster oven also means it really cannot handle a lot of food. The tray it comes with is only 8" x 9.5" (which, for reference, was just large enough for me to fit four slices of bacon without layering them on top of each other). It's done a fine job of cooking or heating up small items, and really that's all I need it for. For bigger jobs, I'll use the normal oven. One slight downside is that when the interior grill is pulled out too far (for example, when you're removing food), the grill is beyond the hook of the door's latches, meaning the door will not close unless you push the grill in a bit yourself. This is only a slight annoyance which could be rectified with a change in design on the door hook.
1	1311120000	First of all, I paid 45.00 for this at my local hardware store and saw it for 20 bucks at Wally world the next week.  IT IS THE WORST TOASTER I'VE EVER OWNED. I call it my crouton maker.  You get a dried out, untoasty, piece of poo when it comes out.  It's 45.00 I'll never get back and I'm really mad at myself for not doing my homework!!
4	1311033600	I've only used it for toast and melts on the toast setting, and you do have to get used to the right amount of toasting - stand there a few times because it can get too dark fast- but you can figure it out.Be careful - When I slit open the carton, it cut right through the product box and the top of the toaster oven, so it started out looking flawed.  Also, as soon as any piece of food falls on the heating bar, it's impossible to clean without leaving a mark.  However, the tray and outside cleans up easily.Everytime I touch it it strikes me how flimsey it feels.  BUT...it works, and you can't beat the price.
4	1311033600	We needed a small toaster oven for our RV, and this unit does the trick nicely.  It's the right size, and warms food items without creating a lot of heat in the trailer like would be the case from the built in propane oven.  It's toasting qualities are not up to the quality of a good conventional toaster for bread or muffins, but it's enough to get by on.

Thank youBlack & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven
3	1310947200	I returned this toaster oven for a kitchen aid. I could not put anything heavy (corningware) on the rack without it falling down. Also, the chrome finish started wearing off after a bit of vigorous cleaning with sponge/paper hand towel and fantastic spray. I say skip it and trade up for cuisinart or kitchen aid.
3	1310860800	The toaster functions well, but in my opinion functions somewhat slower than the Toastmaster oven that it replaced.  In addition the timer must be turned beyond the toasting setting in order to function. All in all the product is satisfactory for the use intended.
5	1310860800	Thanks to Amazon I have a great new toaster that I love.  We do not have a microwave (thank god) and this toaster fits our needs sufficiently!Lovin it!
4	1310688000	To save electricity, I need a small size oven for baking small items. Due to limitation on shelf space, I searched the web and comparing the price and size. This one come out on top. I have used it for three months. So far everything is working as it supposed to be. No complaint.
5	1310688000	B&D came to my rescue; I wanted a smallish old-fashioned toaster oven (no bells/whistles) and this is it. Works beautifully, toasts and bakes perfectly, and the price is perfect. A winner in my book.
2	1310688000	First one sent to me quit after 2 times of using it. The 2nd one seems to work just fine. For the price it is a great toaster.
1	1310601600	It does not cook evenly and it is very slow to toast.  The controls are not efficient.  It is nothing like my last Black and Decker toaster which I liked.  I would have returned it but it cost $10.00 for the return.  I will keep it until I can get something better.  Boone
5	1310515200	This oven is easy to use and works well.  Great alternative to using the big oven.The only complaint, as I've heard others say, is that there's not a consistent toast setting.  You just have to set the timer each time and hope you get close to what you've learned is ideal.Still, for the money, I'd buy another.
1	1310428800	I've had a black and decker toaster for about three years.  It has not worked right since I purchased it, and now only works at all about half the time.  I called black and decker customer service and they refused to make it right.  Take my advice: buy a different brand.
5	1310428800	I got this for the office, it matched the other appliances we have and it was a great price!It is a perfect size for a small pizza and all other items you would put in the toaster.I brought in pizza rolls and realized they suck in the microwave so I asked the boss if we could purchase this item and everyone is very happy we did:)
5	1310083200	I just got this toaster oven, and I love it.  It is absolutely perfect for what we needed.  It is a good size, not too big yet not too small.  It is easy to use, and works great.  This really was a deal for the price! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a basic, inexpensive, yet reliable toaster oven.
1	1310083200	I took a chance with ordering this toaster oven.  Big mistake, but luckily I was able to return the item.The biggest problem is the quality.  When I was setting up the oven, I noticed the door would not completely close.  Then I examined the grates and they were not level.  I anticipated minor quality issues with a cheap toaster oven, but this was absurd.  The grates were at least half an inch off level.Please avoid this product.
1	1309824000	I bought this May 21st. I used it on the weekends to toast bagels, thats it.  Now, one month later, its not working at all.  Its not even heating up. I should have listened to the other reviewers that warned about this. However, I figured it wouldnt happen to me. What a waste of time, money and the free shipping I got from amazon.  Now amazon is saying I have to pay to return it and I will only get a partial refund -- which blows. Why shouldnt I get a complete refund on a product that is not working after just 1 month!?!? Black and Decker needs to stop fooling people into buying this piece of junk.
5	1309651200	Bought this item because our last one caught on you know what! Has proved to be a great buy for an affordable price!
1	1309564800	Black and Decker Toast-R-Oven Top Element Always Comes On, Cannot Turn On Bottom Element Only.No matter what setting I put it on (Bake, Bagel, Toast and of course, Broil), the top element always comes on.  It burns the cheese topping, while the pizza crust remains raw.In fact, I see no difference between these settings, as both elements come on every time, no matter what the setting (except broil, when only the top element comes on).  You can never cook with it only from below, with the bottom element only, though that is how food is basically supposed to be cooked, from the bottom as hot air automatically rises to the top.That is the basic setting of most ovens--the bottom element only.  Stoves, grills, rice-cookers, they all cook from the bottom.  As the bottom heats, fluids in the food (and surrounding air) rises to the top; colder fluids in the food and colder surrounding air goes to the bottom.  This sets up convection currents that allows uniform and thorough cooking.  Therefore, most cooking in the oven is done with the bottom element only.The top element has a very limited purpose (except while broiling) and can actually destroy the food, as hot air already is at the top, and the top element only adds to this problem, leading to burning of the top of the food.So when I want to heat pizza in this oven, the cheese starts browning, while the crust remains raw.  No matter how I change the setting, the top element always comes on (usually first and stronger), the cheese then turns black and starts burning and smoking, while the crust remains raw.Similarly, tortilla chips start burning at the top, while those on the bottom remain uncooked.All attempts to turn off the top element and have only the bottom element come on to cook the crust have failed.Amazing that such a big company can make a product, call it an oven, and disable the most basic feature of an oven.  It would be like somebody making a car, and disabling "D" from the automatic transmission.
4	1309478400	I replaced my very old (and much used) Black & Decker under-the-cabinet with this new toaster oven.  Overall, I am very happy with it.Pros:  It toasts four bagel halves at the same time. (Good capacity)It dings when it is done.It's very easy to clean.It doesn't take up very much space on my counter.Cons:  I have to rotate the timer knob past 10, then back to the setting I want for toast.  That seems like a major engineering flaw.If not for the weird knob rotation, I would give this 5 stars.  However, I am still pleased with it.
4	1309392000	This toast-R-Oven was as I expected from Black & Decker. An excellent product that performes as described on the Amazon Website. An easly understood description that gave the features I needed. Has performed quite well under normal usage and we are totally satisfied. Although it has three controls, they are very easy to operate and get the desired result.
4	1309305600	It looks good, it works perfect but a med size pizza does not fit in it as what they promote.
5	1309219200	This is quite a fancy little toaster oven for the price! Lots of settings, built-in timer, good capacity, heats up very quickly - I have no complaints, this thing does everything I could want it to. Great buy!
1	1309132800	This LOOKS like it should be a good toaster oven. It looks clean, has all the bells and whistles, etc. I've owned this for barely 3 months and used it only 4 times and it already has a short in it that pops the circuit breaker in every single outlet and so now it no longer works.Extremely disappointing and a waste of money.
2	1309046400	I purchased this because my previous appliance broke after many years of faithful service.  So far, I've been disappointed it it.  Other reviews are glowing but the performance of this oven has not impressed me in the slightest. I bought the unit to use as a small oven.  I live in the desert and don't like using my full size oven in the summer.First of all, it is very shallow.  I saved the trays that came with my previous oven (which was a inexpensinve non-brand unit),  They are of much higher quality and barely fit into this Black & Decker, plus the other unit came with a broiler pan.  Cooking is uneven and seems to take longer than in my previous oven.  The unit is extremely shallow, so it's probably not holding heat efficiently.  If I wasn't so lazy, I'd get out my regular oven thermometer and test it; I'm guesstimating it's at least 30 degrees off and probably more like 50.The most annoying thing to me is the short cord.  I'm unable to use it in the space occupied by my old toaster oven because I can't plug it in. All in all, this Black and Decker has been source of annoyance for me.
4	1309046400	I was looking for a basic toaster-oven without all the high-tech features because my parents wouldn't know how to handle all the buttons and options. I saw this one on sale with all the good reviews, and it looks pretty sleek so I just bought it. It works great, its sturdy, gets hot quick and just a good looking toaster-oven.
4	1308787200	My brother mocked me for wanting this. "You have an oven," he said. Typical man.Of course, a toaster oven is a whole different animal. I love this one because it has a good capacity and perfectly fits in my kitchen hutch.I can't really compare a lot of different ones, but this has worked well for me.
5	1308700800	This toaster oven not only toasts bread, but also pine nuts or walnuts for a recipe, can broil livers if you eat them, reheat a small pizza or bake a one-or-two-person casserole.  Why bend over or heat up the whole oven when this can save energy right at counter height?  An added attraction is the glass door, enabling you to watch the browning  of delicate things like those pine nuts.  Crumb tray is easy to slide out for cleaning.
1	1308614400	I will stand out by critiquing this toaster especially when there are so many great reviews.  I have always owned B&D toaster and been very happy with their performance.  There is a major flaw in the design in that when you wantd to toast (and not burn your food), you have turn the bottom know past "10" in the clockwise direction and then revert back (in counterclockwise direction) to the desired level of toast.  If you even set the toast to the dark level, it will burn.  We had a fire in the toaster w/ simple white toast.  Our children used to be able to use our previous B&D toaster w/o problems.  It was simple.  Set to desired toast level and be done.  The UI is confusing and unclear.  Look like they had a microsoft reject design this product!
1	1308441600	I didnt like this toaster for many reasons.1-the timer is hard to set just right every time.2-the timer is now broken after 3 months3-the elements are in the middle so it toasts everything in just the middle4-the bottom element is now broken after 3 months.I'm going to spend the money on a nice toaster.
4	1308441600	This is a good oven so far.  I had a much older Black and Decker that lasted a long time, so I stayed with the same brand.  The three dials are a bit confusing at first but nothing too taxing.  It's worked well for baking frozen foods and for toasting.
4	1308441600	Have only used the Black and Decker toaster oven a couple of time to bake chicken breasts. The chicken breasts came out the same as though I baked it is the regular oven, the difference is I didn't have a stove running with 2 items in it and it gave of no extra heat in the room.  I purchased this toaster over because of the summer months, to keep the heat out of the kitchen, I can easily take the toaster oven outside on the deck to use if needed.  I would recommend this unit if you are cooking for 2 people, I fill the inside is not big enough for a small pizza though, however, you could make a meatloaf inside big enough to feel 3 or 4 people.The appearance of the toaster oven is a lot nicer then I thought it would be, the quality of the finish is excellentand find it extremely easy to keep clean.
3	1308355200	They say you can get a 9" pizza in this oven, but the baking pan is only 7 1/2" front to back.  Am I supposed to fold the pizza in half?
5	1308355200	It costs about 4c a hour to run... Propane oven costs me about a dollar... Why didnt I buy this toaster oven years ago?EXCELLENT PRODUCT
1	1308268800	I used the predecessor B&D Toaster Oven for years, but it was time for it to go to toaster heaven.  I spent so much time trying to find a replacement with a satisfactory toasting dimension--they all seem to be great little ovens, but mediocre toasters.  We like open-faced grilled cheese, though, so needed a toaster oven.  This model got decent reviews, but has the most bizarre dial configuration.  Firstly, you must preset two out of the three dials to make toast, and then you must turn the toaster dial past 10 minutes to the right, then back to the left to the little toaster symbol if you don't want to burn everything.  The toasting option takes up less than 10% of the dial space, and it's very hard to gauge.  My husband was trying to toast a tortilla, turned his back, and the tortilla was on fire.  I wish I could return it and start again.
3	1308182400	For a toaster oven, it's ok. You would think in all this time that they'd improve on the toasting. It seems to take forever and very often needs to be turned on again.
2	1308182400	The slide-out crumb tray looks like used one. There are cheese stains and a chipped edge etc.Does it mean I paid a new toaster oven's price and got a used one?
4	1308096000	This was purchased to replace a convential sliced toaster.  While it is affordably priced, ample in capacity, reasonably sized for normally limited countertop space, and does a good job of broiling and toasting small items; it does have a few minor flaws that must be lived with.  They all have to do with the control functions1)  The timer control is more "guess work" than accuracy.  You twist the knob to what you think is the proper amount of time and be prepared to watch the progress carefully.2)  The timer makes a rather loud "ticking" clockwork noise during operation.3)  If you select too much time, there is no way to shut it off unless you force the timer knob to the off position.  This has not yet caused a malfunction, but it feels like it would do so if done too often.These little problems are due to the mechanical nature of the timer control.  I'm sure if it were digital there would not be these issues.  But then the price of the unit would probably be a good deal more expensive.  As it is, I am willing to live with the little problems.
5	1307923200	I was able to catch this on sale for under $20, and that's the best price i can find. I've used it to warm up few things so far and i am very happy with it. I like the way it looks, it matches other items in the kitchen. i like the stay on feature. used it for Pizza and it's worked great. used for few other things and happy with the results. it helps not to turn on the big oven for small items. i will recommend this to others.
5	1307750400	Ok I have to admit, buying this was the result of spouse wanting more stainless steel (SS) look for counter top appliances in the kitchen, so this was bought to replace existing (bigger) one that is mostly black. This one has good amount of stainless steel surface for this price range. Doing all SS color knobs would be cool, but we actually think black with the matching SS pointer is nice contrast.As for how it performs on the daily basis, we expect all toasters that have above average reviews to do a good job for us as we only need basic features. This toaster does the job well. The internal space (laying down 4 toasts) is adequate. Since the "look" is important, keeping it clean is an important criteria. We like this one for the ability to take glass a part and clean the edges.  Could not do that with our existing bigger toaster oven.
1	1307577600	The timer on this is very flaky. It often doesn't actually turn off when the timer should be done. The timer is also very inconsistent.The user interface on this oven also totally sucks. If you want to switch from toasting to baking (or vice versa) you have to adjust all three knobs. I hate that.If all you want to do is have cheap, stainless steel oven sit on your counter looking pretty then this is the one for you, but if you want a reliable oven that won't try to burn your house down look elsewhere. That's what I'm doing now.
3	1307491200	For the price, this toaster oven is ok so far.  It was purchased for my elderly parents who needed something easy to operate and inexpensive.  I previously purchased them an uppity brand costing $80 thinking it would impressed them with its solid good looks, but just my luck it turned out to be defective and burnt their toast to a crisp filling the kitchen with smoke.  So much for impressing the parents--failed again.This B&D; toaster oven must be doing the job since I'm not hearing complaints from them.  It looks good enough, though rather tinny upclose and not something I'd buy for myself.  It's adequate for a toaster oven for a second home, a tenant, or for someone not too demanding about having top of the line appliances.
2	1307491200	Its been about three months since we purchased this oven and I am still trying to find positive features... I wish B&D; had the a small SIMPLE model, as they used to. I had my small older B& D for about 8 years and it was perfect! There are many new features that simply don't work for me. The timer sound is driving me crazy, there is no place to turn it off. The door doesn't close well and when closing, it gets stuck with the sliding rack.The only nice thing about it, is that it looks well with other stainless steel appliances, but other then that it is really more a 1 star appliance.
5	1307404800	I purchased this after reading the reviews and made a great choice.  This works just as described, it is the perfect size for my counter. I didn't want anything too big, or too small and this is just right.
1	1307232000	I purchased this awhile back and just now opened it.  There is no inside rack for it!  So, it's pretty much unusable since I can't put food directly on the heating coils.If you purchase, be sure to check right away.  I'm sure it's a good product, just wasn't complete.
1	1307145600	Received this toaster oven as a Christmas gift in Dec 2009.  From the get-go have had problems with the timer -- on random occasions, the ticking stops (and no bell "ding") but the oven stays on.  Fortunately, usually keep a close on on it because of this flaw.  Yesterday, toasting a couple of frozen waffles, went into the other room, heard the "ding" and assumed toasting stopped.  Well, not the case.  Smelled smoke, went into the kitchen, and one of the waffles seriously in flames.  Was able to pull out the waffle with tongs, throw into sink, and finally able to douse the fire.  Wasn't easy, though - it was as if the waffle was possessed!  Net result was a totally charred waffle that looked like a flattened hockey puck, and a toaster oven that is rendered unusable.  Top heating element on left side completely burned.  I used to trust Black & Decker products, but no more.
1	1307145600	I bought this in June 2011 and took it home to find that the bottom element did not work.  Called the Black and Decker customer service number and was put on hold for 20 minutes.  Eventually left my number and they did not call me back.  Could not find a way to email customer service. Ended up taking it back to the store and bought another product.  Even with just one element the stove exterior got quite hot and the timing device was hard to use.
3	1307059200	Yes, you get what you pay for. This inexpensive, basic toaster oven works but it is rather frustrating to use. The toasting is uneven, the dials are labeled so tiny that I had to relabel some. The scale indicating how dark toast should be is so narrow that you cannot set it at the same place every time for your toast to be just right. But the price is right!Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven
3	1306800000	There is no way to set the timer.  It has the numbers setting of 10 mins and 20 mins you just have to guess where to put the time to the right or to the left of the number 10.
4	1306800000	Works very well.  Not a lot of bells and whistles, but does what it does well.  I would buy it again.
4	1306627200	I really love this toaster oven. I bought mine about a year ago and it still works like new. Its a great size and the price was very affordable. I have used better toaster ovens before but they were triple this price. I would overall give this toaster a B+ (:Good thingsQuickly HeatsEast to useHas a crum tray that actually worksEasy to cleanBad thingsThe outside does get really hot. So dont use this toaster oven as a place to put anything on. No bread on top of it! I learned that the hard way.
1	1306627200	This toaster oven should be called a toaster for that is all it does.  I've tried roasting a small piece of fish (1/2 lb), oven roasted french fries, a small loaf of cornbread, roast potatoes.  It does none of these things.  The heat cycles on and most particularly off way too often for the oven to heat up enough to roast anything in my opinion.  I am returning mine tomorrow.  It is useless for we already have a toaster that works perfectly well.  I need a real toaster oven.  In the summer I try to use it instead of turning on my large oven to roast small items, like roast vegetables or the above listed items.  This one just does NOT work.
1	1306540800	This product is a fire hazard in my husband's and my opinion.It is very difficult to see when the unit is on and which functions are on.  It heats up very quickly as well.  I would not want to see it in a home with children or teenagers.  Also, you have to be incredibly careful because the outside gets so hot so fast (I don't think the little embossed reminder does the job.
3	1306454400	The bell that rings to let you know the timer is up broke within a week of purchase. Otherwise the toaster works fine, but I have questions about overall quality.
2	1306454400	Grew up with a B&D toaster oven and they were bullet proof.  This one . . . not so much.  I had to return the first one which came out of the box defective.  The second one worked fine for 6 months, however, the design of the mechanical "tray slider" (basically two prongs on the door that slide the wire toasting grill in and out upon opening and closing the door) is poor. I always had to help it along because it tended to stick.  It was so cumbersome that I would hear my wife cursing in the morning trying to get the kids ready and bread products toasted - ok granted, she curses in the morning anyway, however, finally as luck would have it, the unit decided to kill itself and chose fire as the method to go out in a blaze of glory.  I don't know how it caught fire, but I don't think a gluten free waffle could inspire the dante's inferno coming out of it.  Bottom line is if you get one out of the box that a)works, & b) is not possessed by satan, you should be fine.  Just be aware it's not made to the same standards as the older ones . . . too bad.
5	1306454400	This toaster oven is compact and takes up very little counter space but holds four pieces of toast. Works great on all levels. Toasts evenly with English Muffins. No food drops down the back of the rack at all on removal. Very well designed for the money. Very reasonable for a top class kitchen small appliance.
5	1306368000	I have been looking for a toaster oven on sale for quite some time when this oven was offerred thru Amazon.  I LOVE IT!  It cooks evenly, heats up extremely fast, very well put together and I'd purchase it again.  Shipping was fast also.
4	1306195200	I haven't used the toaster oven to do anything but make toast yet.  However, it took a couple mornings of over cooked toast to find the perfect setting.  It will take a little playing to get that perfect setting.  Other than that it's a great, nice looking toaster, perfect for small spaces.
4	1306022400	Nice little toaster.  Heats up quickly,easy to clean, especially like the front access tothe crumb tray.  Only complaint is the dial timer.It is difficult to get the time for toast right.
5	1305849600	Make sure you read the instructions and put the settings exactly on what your doing! Its not hard! the reviews that say it BURNS their toast is probably because they aren't doing it right. It does get warm on the outside but I have never met a toaster oven that didn't! I love to make mini pizza's and occasionally make the single cookie! Works great and I would highly recommend it. It doesn't take much counter space either!
5	1305676800	Works ok, New style heating rod above and below toasts both sides of the bread; an option to turn the bottom heating rod off would have been nice.  A little learning curve on setting the toasting--can not seem to get consistent shade of toasting.  Does turn off with a ding so you do not have to watch it to keep it from burning. Primarily toast in it; it has 2 dials for adjusting its use as an oven; probably good for those who need the oven thing.Had it 2 months now and Hey! The bottom rod is off when set on broil and it is good for heating up fish sticks and chicken tenders for the grandchildren.  Better for reheating pizza too.  Turning off with a ding eliminates the burning when you forget.  Really handy; a lot better than I first thought it was.
1	1305590400	the oven worked great until it starts smoking and you have to clean it.  the metal piece above and below the heating coil was difficult to clean.  if you get any type of grease on it...it's game over. i tried cleaning it normally but it didn't work so i bought some easy clean but it absolutely destroyed the inside of the oven
5	1305504000	I have used the Toaster oven to cook everything from chicken to toast, including brownies and it has never let me down. The timer is a perfect addition to this oven; you can just set it and forget it. Everything that I have made comes out perfect and tasting great, This is a lot more convient then having to preheat the oven and wasting all the electricity, it only takes about a minute to preheat to 400 degrees and the adjustable rack makes sure that your food comes out perfect everytime. I recommend this oven to everyone. a must Have.
5	1305504000	Purchase this as a gift was exactly what we were looking for at half the price. And received in three days
2	1305504000	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Ovenif your main purpose is to use this as a toaster as mine was, choose another model.Usually you can set a toaster to the darkness you want and leave it there.  This toaster you have to set every time you use it so it is not at all consistant
5	1305504000	Bought this to replace another brand that only lasted for 2 years. This model happens to work very nicely and was also very reasonable in price and looks like it's built well. We've been using it for the past few weeks instead of the regular oven for cooking smaller items and so far we have no complaints. I would recommend this model.
2	1305417600	This oven is much smaller than it appears on the picture and does not produce alot of heat. I was disappointed. I switched back to the old one that I had replaced.
5	1305417600	The first time I ordered this toaster, the toaster worked perfectly for 25 days then the timer stopped working. The second one I ordered has been going strong for 30 days. Overall the toaster is very well built and the toast and bagels toast perfectly and you can also make pizza's in it.
5	1305331200	I bought this toaster oven over 4 months ago and have used it daily. I have only good things to say about it. It heats up very quickly and all of the cooking functions clearly work. IE broiling vs. conventional vs. toasting. It was very inexpensive and works as well as a conventional oven. Toasts bread in 3 minutes! Cooks bacon PERFECTLY in like 8 minutes! I would definitely recommend this toaster oven.NOTE: Other reviewers had mentioned that the "stay on" dial setting is placed poorly/dangerously. Every other toaster oven I have used has this exact same setup, so there is really nothing unusual or special about it. A friend of mine accidentally did over-turn the dial on this one, and left the toaster oven on all night. However upon discovering this in the morning there was clearly no danger- the wood surfaces surrounding the oven were cool to the touch, no signs of burning or even heat buildup, and the toaster oven had no problems either. Still works great! In my opinion, when using small heating devices the burden of safety should always be with the user, not the device. Toaster ovens are by their nature somewhat dangerous and should always be monitored carefully when in use.
1	1305244800	DON'T BUY THIS OVEN!!!!  DANGEROUS!!!  I bought this oven at a discount at Macy's 2 1/2 months ago, and I loved my oven until tonight. I had read about other Black & Decker toaster ovens which had oven doors that exploded, and I thought I was buying a different/safer model. Tonight I preheated the oven to 425 degrees, and then put in a sweet potato to bake. Luckily, I was not in my kitchen 20 minutes later when I heard a very large explosion from my kitchen.  The glass door on the toaster oven exploded into hundreds of pieces, and the explosion was so violent that the handle on the door was ejected around 6 to 7 feet across the room.  If someone had been standing in front of the oven, especially a small child at the same height of my counter, there might have been serious bodily injury.  Needless to say, the glass oven door is defective and not properly tempered.
5	1305244800	Absolutely Fantastic Product, bar none.  For the price it has (whether on sale or not) it is WELL worth the purchase.  It does essentially what you need.  Though the size isn't massive, it's quality is fantastic for the price tag it has.  I've had this toaster for 6 months now and it hasn't failed me yet.  Not one bit of disappointment in this product.
5	1305158400	I call it a great "oven/toaster" because I mainly wanted to be able to bake small items without heating up my big oven (and the entire kitchen, in the process).If you read and follow the directions, everything works just as it should.I love mine - and I suspect "cockpit errors" on the part of some of the negative reviewers.Regards,EdB
4	1305072000	At this price abt $28 shipped I finally threw out my old flea market toaster oven.It works really well and heats up faster than all the others Iv'e had. (titanium crankshaft I think)Even fits a Jeno's frozen $1.00 pizza with out cutting first.This is well worth the price ,and I would recommend it and even perhaps buy one for a friend.
5	1305072000	I've had this toaster oven for about a month or so and have found that it easy to use and does a great job.  Compared to other more expensive ovens, I think this model is a good value and would recommend it to others.
1	1304899200	Ordered two of these toaster ovens.The first one the toaster function did not work at all!When I received the replacement neither oven or toaster worked at all!!Poor qualtiy by Black&Decker.Very disapointed with this product!!!!!!!!!! Amazon was as good as you could expect trying there best to Plz me!!!!!
5	1304812800	The toaster over works great and was just what we wanted--a replacement for our old toaster oven and not a large toaster/convection combo.  It's the right size and works great.  Thanks.
5	1304812800	look like small,but very helpful. i think just save power and can do almost all bake work i want to do.
4	1304726400	First time having a toaster oven; good price; looks nice.Only a few odd things:- There's not really a "cancel" or stop button. The instructions says if food starts to flame, unplug it. Duh.- It says to rotate dial past 10 and then bring it to the number of minutes you want. I did that, but you really can't turn it counter clockwise.- FYI... very short cord so it needs to be right by an outlet.Fine otherwise and I like the silver/black look.
1	1304726400	I bought this toaster 6 months ago, and in the first week it caught fire because the timer sometimes gets stuck on.  I don't leave the toaster on without being in the room anymore, so I can stop it before it catches fire.  Now the door won't stay closed, instead it constantly falls open, even when I'm using it.  No wonder this toaster was so cheap.
2	1304640000	The Amazon webpage for this toaster-oven included these specs:Product FeaturesLarge-capacity 1200-watt 4-slice toaster ovenMeasures approximately 12-2/5 by 18-8/9 by 15 inchesProduct DetailsProduct Dimensions: 18.1 x 13.3 x 10.8 inchesThose two sets of dimensions are contradictory and both suggest an appliance that is much larger than it actually is, which is 16" wide by 10" deep by 8" tall.The first of the above claimed dimensions calculates to 2.03 cubic feet, the second comes to 1.5 cf and the actual dimensions compute to 0.79 cf (and those are outside dimensions not actual interior cooking volume.I purchased this because I don't have an oven, only a microwave, and wanted a non-radio frequency alternative for warming and cooking complete meals and maybe even baking bread. I was terribly disappointed in the inaccurate representation of this appliance.Caveat Emptor.
5	1304467200	I've had this Toaster oven for almost 1 year and still looks great.I've used it many times with no problems.Nice design, good color scheme, and heats evenly.Good capacity as well.Would recommend to anyone.
5	1304380800	This item is a replacement of an older Black & Decker Toast-R-Oven I had for many years before this.  The old one finally got worn out after being using by a family of four for a long time. Since I was always happy with the old one, I figured that their company does make pretty good toasters and buy their product once more. Actually, before I got the new B&D, I bought a new toaster at a walmart, but it was not half as good as the B&D ones...so back to old faithful for me. At least someone from Goodwill got a gently-used toaster for a small amount of cash.
4	1304208000	I paid $24 for this item October 2010.I have been using this toaster for well over 6 months now and it works perfectly.  It is a gorgeous looking stainless steel toaster and a great addition to a kitchen that has other stainless steel appliances.  It toasts bread very fast especially compared to my last toaster.  I also love the 3 knobs which provide numerous cooking options from broil, to bake, to toast, etc.  For under $30, you really can't go wrong.Wish list:1. I wish the glass front door could be removed easily for cleaning.2. Sometimes I see steam rising from the toaster and this was somewhat alarming when I first got the toaster because I immediately think something has caught on fire.  This doesn't happen all the time; I haven't determined if there's a specific food item(s) that triggers this.
5	1304035200	Bigger ovens  took up too much counter space and didn't make good toast, but then my terrific Cuisinart toaster couldn't make a toasted cheese.  This toaster oven is the closest I've found to my GE toaster oven of 30 yrs ago,with updated style--looks much better than price would suggest. While the three controls may look a bit much, they work well & simplify use for toasting, baking, and broiling.  I like it so much that I ordered a second oven for future use. I was concerned to see those photos of burnt toast, but the buyers who had these disasters couldn't have read the very clear instructions or even looked at the dial that shows an outline symbol of toast for light, arrow for medium , or a black toast symbol for dark toast.  This is a good value.
2	1303776000	I like it except if I wipe it with a damp cloth the numbers and words on the control panel just melt and smear off.I don't mean when you scrub or use cleaners. They just wipe off with waterNow it is difficult to remember what the settings are as the is very little paint left. Out of all these reviews you would think someone else has the problem too.
5	1303776000	I love this oven.  The pull-out crumb tray is a great feature.  It's much more than I expected for the price.  Looks great in my kitchen too.
5	1303689600	This toaster works great and looks great. We got it for a great price.  What more could one ask for?
3	1303689600	It's inexpensive, so you'll get what you pay for: an average product.The oven is somewhat small, so depending on the type of bread you're toasting, you may not able to fit four slices.  It does not toast evenly.  I usually move and/or flip the bread or bagel trying to make it more evenly toasted.  Unfortunately, its bagel mode is not very good.  It leaves the middle of the bagel kind of soft while toasts the surfaces.I have no problem with its three dials interface.  And I like that it is mechanically controlled.
5	1303689600	I like it very much.  Big enough and the control combinations make it easy to heat up and cook many things.
5	1303516800	This was bought to put in my office, but it was so much better than the one in my home, that I kept it at home instead. Small in size but large in capacity, perfect toast, etc. The best low cost toaster oven I have bought.
5	1303257600	Heats FAST and cooks even.  I have had many toaster ovens and eventually they poop out.  I'm hoping this one lasts, BUT when it's gone, I will return and buy the exact same one.  I LOVE it.....
4	1303171200	I recently purchased a new convection range with a huge oven.  However, I needed something smaller to bake and broil small quanties of food when cooking to only me and my husband.  That's why I purchased this Black & Decker Toast-R-Oven and it fits the bill.  It seems to be well made and I like the control knob selections.  I also like the pull-out crumb tray.  It makes clean-up a breeze.  It is small enough in size not to take over my entire counter top.
5	1302825600	I'm overly excited about my decision to purchase this Black & Decker Toaster Oven. I knew that I was in the market for a toaster oven because summer was fastly approaching, and I don't want to use my regular oven. I knew when I saw this toaster oven that this was the one for me. It cooks great and takes up limited space on my counter. I also like the fact that my 13 year old loves to cook in it verses asking me to toast his pizza rolls, etc. The price was also great and I would recommend this particular oven if anyone is searching for a toaster oven.
3	1302739200	Don't buy it for the looks as they don't last. The graphics on mine wore off within six months but in the case of the timer it's not that big a deal. Nearly all the toasting occurs on the last 10% of the dial. E.G., to toast normal bread from cold it takes 90% of the dial, with bagels often ended up going all the way round, then adding a bit more.  has to stand alone as it gets hot on most surfaces.cleans ok, tray that comes with it is a  pain to clean. If you only need one for six months  this is pretty good:")
5	1302566400	Replaced an old black and decker toaster oven that I bought for $20 probably about 10 years ago.  I had no complaints about the old unit, but it was starting to quit working so it was time to replace.  This unit is much nicer and works great, for basically the same price.  I know you can spend a lot more $, but this does everything I need, has simple controls that are less likely to break, and is cheap enough to not break the bank.  If I have to replace with another in 5-10 years, I don't mind for this price.  I know others who've spent over $100 on a toaster oven and need to replace after a year.
3	1302393600	I bought this model because it's inexpensive, and I've had good experiences with B&D; toaster ovens in the past.While it toasts bread evenly, and the 'Bake' mode does a good job, I find the user interface very annoying.  It has 3 knobs: 'Temp', 'Function' and 'Toast/Timer'.  To switch from oven to toast, I need to 1) turn Temp knob to 'Toast' (at the top of the temperature scale); 2) turn Function knob to 'Toast'; and 3) turn Toast/Timer knob past the 10-minute mark, then back to the tiny part of the dial corresponding to its range of toast darknesses, a process that requires craning my neck to compensate for parallax.  Gone is the toaster-style push-down lever that graced older toaster ovens.  Every time you want to toast a slice of bread, you have to turn the knob past '10', then back to the spot corresponding to your desired degree of darkness, even if you want it toasted exactly the same way as the previous slice.Another caveat is that, while turning the timer knob to 'Off', care must be exercised to avoid going beyond 'Off'to 'Stay On'.Pros- toasts evenly- oven works well- inexpensiveCons- simplistic-yet busy controls- no 'memory' of toast darkness setting- too easy to switch into 'Stay On' mode
4	1302220800	Nice looking toaster oven, easy to clean crumb tray. Works great, but 3 knobs? Could have been simpler with less knobs.
1	1302134400	No problem with the product.  My problem is with Amazon -- within hours after paying $30.00 for the toaster oven Amazon reduced the price by $5.00.
3	1302048000	Product looks good.....ok for all functions BUT toast..  Controls are not accurate..and much too difficult to control....either it burns the toast or does not toast enough....Older version of this product was significantly better.Would not recommend to anyone.....
5	1302048000	we like the new toaster, especially the crumb tray that pulls out to be able to clean the inside of the toaster
4	1301961600	This appears to be a quality product for the price.  It is rather small for a 4 slice Toast-R-Oven though.  Otherwise it does what it is suppose to do very nicely.
5	1301875200	It was my duty at my company to research toaster ovens to replace our office's defunct one.Any new one would have been an improvement over our last!About 30+ people typically use it during the week, and on Thursday it gets a lot of use because of our Bagel Day routine. The B&D; toaster oven has proved to be a very durable, efficient, and easy to use appliance.I agree with some reviews that it can get VERY hot on the top, but it's obvious that almost all toaster ovens do this. The blue light helps to prevent the user from turning the knob to "stay  on" so what some other 1's and 2's reviews have stated as a problem is really a problem with the users, not the appliance! Just make sure it's "off" and it should be fine...Overall, everyone thinks it was a good buy, performs solidly, and is a hard-working addition to our office kitchen. Good for toast, bagels, and melting cheese, etc.
3	1301788800	After 3 months use, I'd say it toasts ok, and can bake half a supermarket frozen pizza.There is a removable cleaning tray, but when things drip onto the protectors that cover the lower element, its very hard to clean that.When you open the door the little grate slides out, but it always slides out too far for closing the door to push it back.  You always end up having to push the hot grate in manually before closing the door - which is a pain.I would prefer 4 elements and convection - but at this price it is cheap enough to replace every 6 to 12 months, which is how I like it (my "deep cleaning" method).
4	1301616000	Great item, I really like it and it was dirt cheap with free shipping. Even if it breaks, I didn't go wrong.
4	1301356800	This is your basic classic toaster oven.A single radiant heating tube across the top, a single one across the bottom (most fuller featured units have two top and two bottom). Compared to the original toaster ovens, these are "quartz" radiant tubes which radiate better than the old fashioned solid iron rods. Unfortunately there is a perforated "safety shield" over each tube which interferes slightly with the radiant effect.No convection fan.No "pizza bump" or circular bulge at the back to better accomodate a round pizza.There is a very handy drip tray which we definitely need for our grilling.We got this in conjunction with an "upscale" toaster ovenBlack & Decker CTO4500S 6-Slice CounterTop Convection Oven with Pizza Bump, Stainless Steelwhich I am separately reviewing. Our thinking is to treat this one as "semi-disposable" and use it solely for grilling chicken thighs/legs/wings on our condo patio. Should be fine for this limited purpose, and when it gets irretrievably gunked up from spatters, our hearts won't break to see it go. The "upscale" version will be used for pizza and baking - non "spatter" cooking, in other words.Don't use these as toasters - a dedicated toaster does a much better job with less power consumption, and they aren't very expensive these days; for better results with pizza, get the one linked above.--------------update:Since it only has one quartz heater element top and bottom, it won't "sear" your meats as much. We run ours in "bake" mode to assure there is plenty of heat to actually cook our chicken pieces and pork rib pieces, and our meat takes a long time to cook (about 45 minutes to an hour) but comes out incredibly juicy as though "slow cooked." Only a light browning/crisping, none of the "scorching" common to quad or dual top element toaster ovens. In this case, the reduced number of elements turns out to be a benefit, not a disadvantage!
4	1301356800	This toaster oven is great for the price.  It has many features and works well.  It is a little small, but I am really only using it for toasting.
5	1301270400	I recently got this product in replacement for an old Kitchenaid toaster oven.  It is very nice.  It has a nice finish and also works great.  I bought it after the many positive reviews, and I like every bit of it.
5	1301097600	I wanted something small and attractive in my kitchen that would evenly toast a bagel without toasting my wallet.  This is the perfect device.  It's small, attractive and consistent.  It's also lightweight, which means it's easily portable for the person on the move.My bagels get evenly toasted within two minutes.  The Swiss cheese I place on top of each half gets melted but doesn't liquify nor get browned.  The appliance has settings for "Bagel" "Broil" "Bake" and "Toast" but I prefer the "toast" setting for my bagel.  The toaster can heat for up to 30 minutes at a time at maximum heat of 450F degrees.  The ticking timer is audible and dings when the food is ready.This is a great little breakfast toaster.  It's easy to clean.  However, the interior is very small, so baking a whole chicken, unless cut in half, is improbable.  I reserve this thing strictly for my morning meal, but have used it for single-servings meals as well.This is a great little dorm appliance for those hungry college kids, and the price is right.  I bought my first one two years ago and it cost me thirty-five bucks.  Now the price is under thirty bucks and I haven't found a toaster oven elsewhere that is this affordable.ADDENDUM:  I have been reading the many one-star reviews stating this oven causes fire or has a "stay on" function that burns food.  The problem I see with that is that people aren't using this device properly and are not keeping it clean.  As long as users do not have items touching either heat element inside, as long as they do not overcrowd the inside, as long as they keep it clean AND as long as they don't carelessly turn the knob too far to the left so that the "Stay On" function remains on, this is a very effective device.  I don't mind the loud ticking sound as it reminds me that I have something baking.  I'm convinced that people who experienced toaster fires either didn't keep the appliance clean or had items touching the burn elements.
4	1301097600	This toaster oven is pretty small, which is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something functional that did not take up much counter space and did more than just make toast. There was an electrical smell the first couple of times I used it, so I watched it closely just to be safe.Pros:Does not take up much counter space.Heats up quickly. Cooks evenly.Comes with a small baking tray.The crumb tray is easy to empty.Cons:Might be too small for most people. You can fit four slices of bread in it, and that is it.
3	1301097600	The star rating is not applicable.  It is a required field for submitting comments.After reading all the critical reviews, I must say it would be helpful if someone would state what they bought instead.If the unit caught on fire, then I suppose any other product would be an improvement.  But if you just don't like the dials, or the tray or the lack of insulation, and you found something better in a similar size and price range, it would be great to know. After spending hours poring over all the specifications and reviews, it begins to seem overwhelming to find a product that fits my needs.
2	1301011200	This toaster oven was significantly smaller than the one I was planning to replace. The automatic pull-out for the shelf inside is a good idea but the entire unit is very noisy/rattly. It has a nice appearance. The pan that comes with it is extremely shallow, I did not use it because it was too small for my purposes.
1	1301011200	First day out of the box put 2 pieces of toast in. Put dial on toast, jumped on laptop and looked up to see flames shooting out of toaster--big flames!! Unplugged it and fire died down in about 3 minutes but lots of smoke.  Had read other reviews of fire but though with so many good reviews I would try it.  Cannot believe this is still on the market.Do Not Buy!
1	1300924800	I had to finally throw this in the trash after several fires.  This unit catches simple toast on fire under normal settings and conditions and the inside of the unit becomes engulfed in flames.  The final incident was very scary.  I could no longer risk the safety of my household.  Keep shopping!

2	1300924800	Upon opening the carton I discovered a smaller toaster oven than expected.  I rechecked the measurements provided in the description and confirmed that the oven is 2.5 to 3 inches smaller than advertised.  The dimensions shown in the description did match the outside dimensions of the box.  I immediately sent it back.  This is the second time Amazon dimensions or a recommended accessory were not correct.  Thankfully there was little difficulty in returning each item.
4	1300838400	Using the oven as an oven it is a very good oven.  It has a nice look and blends with other things in the kitchen.Using it as a toaster is frustrating.  You can't set the desired toast setting once and have it stay there.  Each time you use it, you need to dial the timer for the way you want it.  I have a hard time getting it exactly where I want it each time.  I've burnt a few frozen waffles trying to guess if I set it to the right length of time only to discover I had the timer set too long.  If you guess too short and have to add more time it is also a frustration, but saves on the cost of wasted waffles.Good quality, nice look, nice oven functionality, frustrating toast function.

5	1300665600	I bought this toaster at a store, because I was able to measure and look at a display in person.  The cost, at the time, was lower than Amazon as well.The dimensions on the Amazon description did not seem quite right, which was good, because it needed to be a bit smaller.  When I got my toaster home, I accidently dropped the package on the ground.  It did not break, so the packaging was good.It took me about half an hour to figure out how to make toast the first time.  Even after reading the instructions, it was not till I read the "Trouble Shooting" section that I realized that all 3 buttons were supposed to be on a toast setting.  The top button was not that obvious to me.  Using it as an oven for the first time was much easier.I am not sure if it really fits a 12" pizza like it says.  I bought one of those "Tony's" pizzas from the store, and it fit inside, but not with the door closed.  Perhaps the "Tony's" pizzas are slightly larger than 12".  It was really close to fitting, though.I love the toaster now that I am used to it.  It works really well.  It is nice looking.  It is compact, yet large enough to fit four slices of toast.  You cannot beat the price.  It is a good quality toaster.
5	1300579200	I have had several toaster ovens over the years.  This is my third Black & Decker.  The first one was very old and I was very upset when I could no longer find one like it. Finally found the exact one at a Thrift store.  The front glass front door popped up from bottom to top when the toast was cooked.  This one is bigger and does more and I am very satisfied.  But would still like to have B&D bring back the old one.
1	1300320000	Like many of you, I researched everywhere for a simple toaster oven to replace one that lasted for 8 years.  I read the majority of the 400+ reviews here on Amazon and decided to give it try despite the 60+ 1-star reviews.  Afterall, we consider ourselves easy to please.  The oven worked for 2 days.  Then, on the third day, the timer on the toaster stopped working.  I re-read the instructions cover-to-cover and gave the oven a few more tries.  I watched intently and the timer knob never moved.  The heating elements would come on and go off while the knob remained in the same position.  Each time I waited until the bread is burnt before I shut off the oven manually.  I agree with many of the other reviewers; this model has a design and/or manufacturing defect.  Maybe I got a lemmon but if you choose to buy it, be aware of its highly probable risk of starting a fire.
5	1300147200	I had been without a working oven for years and ordered this just after fianally asking my landlady to replace the existing one.Although she kindly replaced the old oven this one, the Black & Dekcer works very well.  Uses less energy and is easy to clean.  Highly recomended at an amazing price
1	1300060800	I purchased this Black and Decker Model TRO480BS toaster oven in Nov of 2010. It has caught fire on more then one occasion until I removed it from my house. What I am amazed with is that none of us using it in my house were doing anything wrong. I have kept the toaster ove to experiment with outside and have since found I can duplicate the failure causing toasting bread to explode into flames 100% of the time, using the toast setting just the way it is supposed to used and I even turned the timer past 10 minutes first as directed. This is a fire disaster waiting to happen... Beware of this fire hazzard of a Toaster Oven. I have kept it, and have contacted Black and Decker and have heard no response so now I will call the local news stations and hope they will want to see the hazzard demonstrated before their eyes and cameras.. Cherish your Families and Home, DO NOT TRUST THIS TOASTER OVEN, IT IS UNSAFE UNDER NORMAL USE !!!Black and Decker, Please Re-test and Recall This Model TRO480BS
1	1299974400	So sorry I bought this one. Dials are hard to read, thought removable tray was a good idea butit e poses the heating element which got drippings on it and caused a flare up. Less than 30 days after purchase I pulled on handle to open he door and the handle broke right off. Garbage
3	1299628800	This toaster is listed on Amazon as between 18 and 19 inches wide.  It is actually 16 inches wide and the interior dimension is only 10 inches with actually less useable space because of the rack design.  I did not turn it on and so can not attest to how it works just that you need to know it is much smaller than the listed dimensions.  This is the downside of the internet when purchasing products like this.  Frequently sites like Amazon don't bother to actually verify the dimensions of products.
4	1299628800	The toaster is attractive but I still use my old regular toaster for toast.  I thought the wattage would make the bread toast faster but it takes twice as long.  I can see the advantage if you needed 6 slices at one time but not for a single slice of toast.  It does a decent job of melting cheese on bread and heating rolls.
5	1299369600	Received this toaster oven a week ago from Amazon.  It replaced another Black & Decker toaster oven that is over 8 years old and still working!  We bought this new one because we purchased new appliances and countertop and the old one no longer matched. The black and stainless look of this toaster oven matches our appliances perfectly and it also makes perfect toast!  It browns the toast evenly and is faster that our old one.  We mostly use a toaster oven for making toast and reheating an occasional piece of pizza or a snack - not for actual baking.  It is compact but fits 4 slices of bread easily without taking up much more room than a regular 4-slice toaster. The price of this toaster oven was very reasonable so I was concerned when I ordered it how good it would perform.  I was very pleasantly surprised and it is great to have this nice looking toaster oven that works great at such a low price!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5	1299369600	This toaster oven works great for quick snacks and toasts bread faster than a regular toaster. I have a small apartment with limited counter space and it  fits perfect. Its very attractive too!Good product for the price.
5	1299196800	We use it almost everyday to toast or heat many things. I really didn't expect it to last more than 6 months but it still works like new. The only thing that has a visible wear and tear is the aluminium tray that was included with the unit.
4	1299196800	I bought this toaster to replace another B&D toaster that was at least 10 years old & the non stick coating was staring to flake.  I needed it for my camper trailer.  Although it is a little bigger than the old one, it does fit in the small space I have.  I tried the new one at home & it works fine.  Yes, it does get very hot on top, but so does every toaster oven I have ever had, including one I have now at home that I paid twice as much for.  This one has warnings on every page of the instructions & has a warning label on top.  You do have to be careful with toaster ovens, and in my trailer I always unplug it as soon as I am finished using it.  If you are worried about the hot surface, get a microwave!
3	1299196800	It's a pretty good toaster oven.  I'm satisfied except the toaster timer does not goes off if it's being set to very low, thus, your toast is always burn unless you time it and turn off yourself.  This happens about 90%.
5	1299110400	We replaced our old toaster oven because it took between 3-5min to make one slice of toast, we upgraded to the Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven and we now have toast in less than a minute!!! We have had it for a little over a month and I am completely satisfied with our purchase. The oven itself takes up less space on the counter than our previous toaster oven however, it has just as much room in the interior. The knobs are very easy to use, the exterior of the toaster oven easily wipes clean and the removeable crumb tray makes cleaning super fast. This toaster oven comes with hooks that pulled the tray out when opening the oven which prevents you from needing to stick your hand into the oven to retrieve food. All functions work great, Curved Interior for Medium Pizza, Broiling Rack Fits 4 Slices of Bread, Dual-Position Rack Slots, Bake, Broil, Bagel, Toast and Keep Warm, Toast Cycle, Stay On Feature, 30-Minute Timer.
5	1299110400	Works wonderful! A little smaller looking than i thought it was going to be but still fits just about everything needed. I highly recommended it. Good buy for the money :)
4	1299110400	This oven works pretty well.  It took a few times for me to get used to how to work it.  My previous toaster oven was easier to set the dials.  You need to remember to set the time, even for toast.  One other thing I'm not crazy about it when I warm up a hard roll taken out of the freezer, it will burn the top of the roll slightly.  Otherwise, this toaster oven works fine.
5	1299024000	Over the years I have owned several toaster ovens, but this one ranks at the top.  All of the settings that I require and easily cleaned.  Also, looks nice on the kitchen counter.  I highly recommend this countertop oven.
1	1299024000	I have never reviewed any product on Amazon before, though I've bought countless items for many years and I am an Amazon Prime member. But this toaster oven is sooooo annoying that I want to tell the world! Mainly I used it for toasting bread. But the controls for toasting bread are so lame that there's no way to guarantee consistent results each time: The darkness setting is a dial which you must rotate and set each time and hope you get it approximately to a setting where it's not over or under-done. Half the time I end up burning the toast since the dial was like 1/16" too far or something. I've never had more problems with a toaster oven. (My last one had a dial you could set and leave permanently on whatever darkness setting. Then to toast you just hit the "Toast" button and it comes out perfect every time.) The only way to guarantee you don't burn your toast is to sit and monitor it the whole 2-3 minutes that it's toasting. But I don't have time for that since I'm usually multi-tasking in the kitchen. One time I burned 3 pairs of toast one after another just because I refused to babysit this toaster!!! The last straw was when the oven spontaneously combusted not once but twice! That was all the excuse I needed to immediately condemn it to the garbage can. If forced to choose between no oven and this oven I'll happily take NO OVEN!Save yourself some trouble and get a different toaster oven.
4	1298937600	This is a great toaster oven for the price that I bought it at which was $20.  I would highly recommend it for that price if you can find it again.
5	1298937600	My Black and Decker Toast -R-Oven was a very pleasant surprise.  Great value and it looks great on my countertop.  While I have only had itfor a couple of weeks it has worked flawlessly.  It really does a very good job on toast, english muffins and bagels taking a very short timeto become with the temperature settings and the timer settings.  Just read the instructions before using!
5	1298937600	I have had this toaster for about a month now.  I use it at least once a day for baking and toasting and have yet to find a problem with it.  The outside does get hot so its best to keep it well ventilated, away from walls or other items.The instructions say to preheat before cooking but I find it cooks better by just turning the oven on, putting the food in and setting the recommended time for the food on a timer.I would recommend this product and would buy it again if needed.
4	1298851200	This is a nice entry level toaster.  It has a clean look and matches my stainless steel appliances.  I like that it can bake a personal pizza quite nicely, but I don't have much success with toast.  One side gets burnt while the other side is semi burnt.  I suppose I could do the time half and half to get better results.  If you are looking for a toaster to make toast, go with a conventional toaster.  For the value, this is a great buy.  If you can, splurge a little more for a convection version.  A simple thing like a fan in a oven makes a huge difference.
4	1298851200	This was to replace an older unit (different manufacturer) that was just falling apart.  This unit has a nice "pull out" feature where, when you open the door, it draws the rack out with it (so you don't have to find a fork or other utensil to pull it out with).  Also, the BEST part about this unit is the removable, drawer like crumb tray that comes out from the front!  Our older unit had a door that swung open from underneath which was difficult to handle.  So, there you have it.  Easy to clean, nice features, great price.  Nothing to complain about.
5	1298851200	It was exactly what I was looking for and more. I am pleased with the product and it's quality.  Well worth the money...
5	1298851200	After almost 2 months of daily use, this toaster oven has performed reliably and given no problems.  I highly recommend this very useful small appliance.
5	1298764800	I've only had the TRO480BS a few days but I've a few comments that may be assistance to prospective purchasers. A bit of history. About three years ago I bought a Krups toaster oven for around $150 on the assumption that German-made stuff was good quality, and especially so at that price. Besides which it was highly recommended. It didn't toast particularly evenly but otherwise worked okay. Just past the warranty period the door hinge broke off making the unit unusable. It had never been abused but Krups was only interested in the warranty period, not the fact that their quality was poor. I could have sent the thing back but it would have cost a sizable packet to fix, so I improvised, using a few small, powerful magnets to hold the door to the frame. Over the next year the heating rods became more and more uneven till the oven would toast only one side of the bread. I dumped the Krups and found this Black and Decker for less than 20% of the cost of the Krups. It's the most even-browning toaster I've ever owned. Of course it also heats up tortillas and leftovers, it broils and bakes. Sure, it's small, it's flimsy feeling, weighs next to nothing, but even if it lasts only a year, buying four more over the next five years pretty much equals what I spent for the Krups which gave up the ghost after three.
5	1298764800	This device works great for baking smaller things like a snack size portion of mini corn dogs and slices of pizza. Sure beats preheating the full size oven for 20 minutes or ruining the food in a microwave!
2	1298764800	We have owned Black and Decker tools and appliances for years.  After our last toasted oven finally gave in after 20+ years, we purchased another Black and Decker.  Today we had a small fire.  The timer has already broken with only a 7-8 months of use.  They don't seem to make things like they used to.
3	1298678400	I liked everything about this toaster oven from the size to the controls.  I bought one last April 2010 from Amazon even with the comments that the control sometimes breaks.  I have used it and liked the bake, toast, bagel features,the easy clean, and the nice slide out to remove the hot items easily. Then one day the bottom control did not turn off when it was supposed to and the food caught fire and we would have had a small fire if we were not in the kitchen. Now what do we do?I went shopping and looking and decided to buy this model again, because it still had all the features we wanted. And for the time being we will stay with this toaster oven.  Even the reviews were higher in the positive and just a few people had control problems so we figure we are home free this time around.  And if it happens again we will send it back under the warrenty and start the search again.
4	1298419200	We are really enjoying toast that is toasted equally on both sides! Our old toaster oven toasted the top side, but barely warmed the bottom side of whatever we put in it. It is also nice that it is big enough to put in both parts of two large hamburger buns at the same time - I had to do one at a time before. I think you could do a small pizza too, but I haven't tried it yet. I also love the removable crumb tray so I don't have to stand it on it's head to get the crumbs out. When you open the door, a hook pulls the rack out so you can get to the food without getting burned. It is supposed to slide back in when you close the door, but the hook sticks occasionally and you have to help it along - which is not much of a problem at all! It also looks nice and matches our other black and brushed chrome appliances. It doesn't take up any more space than our old toaster oven that had a lot smaller interior space.My only complaint is that we are still trying to learn exactly where to set the dial to get the toast as light or dark as we want. The dial settings range from "light" which is barely above "off" then over to "dark" with no marks in between, so it takes some practice to figure out where to turn it to get what you want. The oven temperature seems to run to the hot side, so the first few things we toasted on what we thought would be "medium" got burned to a crisp! I can see how it would be easy to set something on fire if you didn't keep an eye on it or the dial stuck.Overall, I think this was a good purchase.
5	1298419200	I really wanted this toaster oven, primarily because it matched my other appliances perfectly (Black & Stainless).  The dimensions listed would have made it too big for my available space.  One of the reviewers said it was smaller and gave the measurements, so I took a chance and ordered it.  I was thrilled to find out that he was correct.  The actual size is 16" Wide, 8.5" Tall and 10" Deep.  There have been complaints about having to adjust 3 dials just to make toast.  That's mostly what I use it for and once you set the top 2 dials to "toast" you never have to touch them again, until you want to use it as an oven.  It makes perfect toast when set on Medium.  Perhaps the only slight flaw is that the tray pulls out when you open the door, making it easier to get items in and out, but it doesn't always want to go back as easily as it should (this doesn't bother me). It works great as a toaster, or as an oven, and I love the way it looks.  If this one fits your needs, buy it you won't be sorry.
1	1298419200	Got a great price off amazon, but not worth the money. Bought in Aug 2010 and broke Feb 2011. The timer no longer stops and there is a burning rubber smell. Now looking for another brand.
5	1298332800	It functions as advertised. Has a timer for when such a feature is desired, but can also be set to "always on" if something needs to be cooked for an indeterminate amount of time. I'm a little disappointed that the catch tray/cookie sheet isn't dishwasher safe though. I'm not sure why one couldn't just toss it in there, but I've been following the directions that came with the product and washing the tray by hand.I like the product for many of the reasons that I would like any toaster oven. It preheats quickly, uses less energy than a conventional oven, toasts irregular or extra large slices of bread (works well in conjunction with a bread machine), etc... I've cooked toast, pizza, steak and even a s'more in the machine.The only "Con" I might list is that I would have liked a convection oven, i.e., a toaster oven which included a fan setting to circultate air. However, considering the price of the product, I can't complain. I'm not sure how much difference it would make in any case since we're dealing with such a relatively small enclosed space.
2	1298332800	It worked great until today--7 months after I bought it. Now the door refuses to remain closed. The spring that holds the door closed seems to be broken, so as soon as you shut the door, it springs back open. Useless!
5	1298332800	This toaster is exactly what I was looking for and thanks to the reviews I read, I decided on this one. It is compact and quick. So easy to use and so inexpensive. Don't pass it up. Great value!!
5	1298246400	The Black & Decker 4-Slice Toaster Oven is really an incredible kitchen tool for those of us who don't have a Gordon Ramsey kitchen or the desire to have an appliance that replicates the ovens that are already in our home. As the compact toaster oven has been replaced by these larger, prettier, heavier and more expensive counter ovens, the simplicity and functionality of this model shine even brighter.The 4-Slice model is clean, quiet - accurate in its toast settings and generally an unobtrusive addition to our kitchen environment. It's easy to clean - something that many of its competition are not - and I recommend that at least once a week, you wipeaway the crumbs and other detritus that accumulates with heavy use.Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this Black & Decker oven is it's price - one can purchase a new one - every year for 3 years and still not spent as much on a toaster-oven that will outperform it.
5	1298246400	This works just fine....Seems like a solid product and it has been great so far.  I have been through many toaster ovens and I know they don't last too long, so for the price, this works for me
4	1298160000	GREAT TOASTER OVEN. BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE.I HAVE HAD 4 OF THESE FROM SAME CO. OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS. THEY DO WEAR OUT, USUALLY A SWITCH GOES BAD. BUT THEY LAST 10 YEARS. USED  SEVERAL TIMES A DAY, THATS NOT BAD. A GOOD PRODUCT IN TODAYS MARKET.  EASY TO CLEAN, EASY TO USE, NEAT ,AND COMPACT. IF THIS ONE GOES BAD IN A FEW YEARS, I'LL PROBABLY GET ANOTHER, SAME BRAND.Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven
5	1298073600	We really like the precise way this toaster works. The toast always comes out the way you perceived it to be. There was a slight learning curve but all seems to be fine.
4	1297987200	We were looking for a toaster oven to replace our Krups Toaster Oven that we had for 10 years. Our problem was we have limited counter space. We wanted a toaster oven that had all the features of the larger models, just smaller in size. The Black & Decker TR0480BS was the perfect fit. It does every thing we wanted in the size we wanted.
1	1297900800	You would think that after all these years they could figure out how to make toast, but they can't.  The toast comes out either burned on one side and not toasted on the other side, also the bread is not toasted evenly, meaning that the edges get burned and the middle is not toasted.  Amazingly bad product.  I bought a Breville.  It's more expensive but what a difference.
5	1297900800	This little oven does everything I wanted it to do. It's also quick to heat up and accurate. Just keep your hands away from the top and sides while it's on. They get quite hot.
2	1297641600	I have had several Black and Decker toaster ovens over the years. they were great. However, I am not happy with this model. with the other models I had, you set your darkness for the toast and press a button, toast is done it shuts off. Never had any problems. This model you have to turn two dials just to toast, and then with the third dial make sure you get it exactly where you think it should be for the color of toast you want. because of this feature, I've had 3 fires in my toaster oven. I expect with the time bomb ticking stops and the toaster dings the toast is done, but it has burst into flames 3 times. When you try and toast again, the oven it too hot and keeps shutting off and on like a regular oven while set to the toast selection.....It looks good and bakes good and that's about all it does. Black and Decker, we don't need three dials just to toast. I've been looking for another toaster oven.
5	1297641600	I love my new toaster oven. It works great,toasts evenly and best of all it's  easy to keep clean. It has a coated crumb tray that slides out easily and all you have to do is wipe it off. Great product at a great price.
1	1297555200	It's a toaster oven.  It works.  Price is right.  You can toast, bake, broil, everything you'd expect from a toaster oven.  No complaints there.Until one day you toast a piece of bread, hear buzzing sound, turn around and see flames coming out from the vents on a side and from the back.I bought it around half a year ago and it should still be under warranty (not sure, haven't checked that).  I'm confident the warranty would cover it, but I don't intend to go that route.  I'm throwing it out and getting a different one instead.  The risk of this happening again is simply not worth it for me.I don't typically post reviews (this is my first one) but I felt like I needed to share my experiences.  Make your own decision and good luck.
5	1297555200	I wanted a mini toast-R-oven to make quick breakfasts for my kids and this served the purpose. It's small enough to fit anywhere and powerful enough to efficiently carryout it's mission. I love it!!
4	1297468800	We ordered this oven to replace a Black and Decker cool touch toaster oven that was really great. It arrived quickly, and while the shipping had tweaked the oven a bit (one corner seemed to be misaligned but luckily popped back into place easily), it was easy to set up and test. We have cooked a few snacks and toasted bread and waffles in it over the past couple of weeks, and all in all it works in a fashion comparable to the oven it replaced. It looks nice and the price was really great. On the down side, it gets really hot, so we had to move things around to give it some space, but given the price I am happy with it so far. It does the job for what we want to use it for and while I wish it had the same features as the cool touch we had, it really is about as good as you can gt for a low-priced toaster oven.
3	1297382400	We are definitely a "toaster over" family, and would be lost without one.  Over the years we've had our share of various brands of toaster ovens, so when our last one broke a year ago I searched Amazon's reviews for a replacement.  I opted for this because of the name and the reviews.I have to say that after a year, I am not thrilled with it.  The most bothersome feature is the three knobs.  Running a busy household means that you need appliances to be simple and easy to use.  Extras can sometimes just get in the way.  It is very annoying to have to set three knobs each time you want to pop in some waffles, an English muffin, or heat up a leftover slice of pizza!  My kids agree with me that it is a bit of a pain to have to do.I do like the crumb tray that pulls out.  I keep it covered with aluminum foil to keep it really clean.  The ticking for the toast that one reviewer mentioned is true but I don't mind that.  It's one way for me to know that the settings are actually on "toast" and one of us hasn't turned one of the knobs the wrong way!It does clean up well and doesn't hold food stains like some of my previous toaster ovens.  Also, there aren't a lot of small places for the food and crumbs to get caught and live forever because you can't get to that place to clean them up.It certainly has worked and maintained itself well over the past year, my family and I just feel that the three knobs thing is a bit of an annoyance.
4	1297209600	This is a good and simple toaster oven its not to big and I just got it so we will see how long this toaster will last I will try to update the review after more testing but i dont promise
5	1297123200	What a great buy Amazon. Free shipping too. Yay. My last toaster oven took ten minutes to toast one piece of bread, this one is way more efficient. I love it!
5	1297036800	Black and Decker is always a good buy.  This toaster oven is easy to use and easy to clean (very important!). Has a nice capacity -!
5	1297036800	The Good:I now use this toaster for everything: waffles, french fries, little pizzas.  I also use the timer when cooking items outside of the toaster since the dial's analog.  I live in a smaller apartment and I like that the unit is very light so I can move it around from my shelf to the counter top when needed.  Lots of functions and overall I'm very happy with the product after a year now.The Bad:Only complaint is that the toaster heats food more on the top, and so sometimes my waffle will burn a little on the top, but not at all on the bottom.
1	1297036800	This toaster has what I expected - easy to use, heat up quickly, and clean stainless steel look.  For this price, I wouldn't expect function such as automatic turn off, and I will stay around when cooking something with it to avoid accidental fire.I took out one star because the surface is thin so it does turn hot and waste energy.UPDATE: after six-month (sharp) use of this oven, the timer gave up.  So if you set your timer for, say, 5 minutes, it will keep toasting your food forever without you knowing it.  This is a dangerous product, even for $20, I wouldn't suggest you buy it.
1	1296950400	I have many user interface issues with this product, all of them are not flattering, but none worse than this one; In an effort by the product designers to help the user know the toaster is on, you will hear a "tic tic tic" sound (very annoying) when the lowest knob of the toaster is turned on. Now unplug the toaster. While the toaster will not work because it has no power, you will still hear the "tic tic tic" noise, and if you are not paying attention, you will *think* your toaster is working, but it's not. A major inconvenience if you're in a hurry in the morning.The three knobs to set your toaster are very confusing. Why not just two knobs? or maybe just a slider? That would be too easy. I wouldn't be surprised if these industrial design geniuses figure out a way to add more inconvenient and annoying features. Ever learn the design principle KISS? (Keep It Simple Stupid)Oh yeah, we had this toaster about 5 months before it broke. It's a hunk of junk, an oversized paperweight. If I could give this toaster a rating of zero stars I would. I can't wait to throw it away and buy a different toaster, from a different manufacturer.There, I feel better now.
4	1296950400	I bake my own bread and muffins etc... My decades old $8.00 toaster forced me to cut down the size of my bread to fit their slots and then still got hung sometimes.  The B&D toaster will handle my bread and english muffins regardless of the thickness or size.  I like this toaster oven.  I read reviews before I bought it which included comments about the timer ticking being loud and the door not closing...Well, The timer is not loud and the door will not close right if you pull the tray out too far...There is no idiot-proof design.  The "fix" is easy...Just push the tray back in a little.  I would have given this toaster five stars except for two issues I have.  1).  The control which is most used is the timer...It should be on top where you can see it and not on the bottom.  2).  The timer should have a larger dial so you can have a better chance of repeating a setting you know is best for your desired results. All in all, If I had to do it over again, I would buy this toaster still and be glad I did.
5	1296864000	Great price.  Looks terrific with our stainless steel appliances. We didn't need anything fancy - just a toaster. Easy to clean.  My mother in law was also buying a new toaster and she brought two home of another brand that didn't even toast - so she bought this one too.
3	1296864000	I have not used this toast a lot; however the only thing currently bothers me is that its power cord is too short. I have to place it just besides the wall outlet. It's not very convenient.
5	1296864000	I have used my toaster ovens a lot for meal preparation.  So, what I look for in one is (1) fast pre-heating, (2) a good, solid door to retain even baking temperatures and (3) spacious interior large enough for small casseroles and dessert pans.  Have used many, over the years, and this one is a champ in these categories.  I must admit that I don't use it for toast, not being a "toast person" so I can't rate its performance there.Added pluses, though not part of my big-3 requirements: sleek design, 3-prong substantial plug & cord, removable crumb tray that slides in-and-out easily.
1	1296864000	The timer for this toaster sporadically malfunctions, and keeps the toaster operating indefinitely.  So if you place something in it and turn on the toaster, there's a chance it will keep burning whatever is inside until you manually turn it off or it sets itself on fire.  There are several customer images for this toaster showing a burnt bagel and a burnt toaster - this is exactly what happenned to ours.  If you do get this toaster, be sure to keep a close eye on it when you use it.
4	1296518400	I've had this oven for a while and used it a great many times.  I don't have a microwave.  It works great.  I love the drip pan underneath the wire shelf, and the ticking noise on the timer doesn't bother me at all.  Actually, I like the noise, so I know it's still cooking.  It has a blue light indicator as well.I have broiled, baked, and defrosted in this oven, and it does everything very well.  It gets warm on the top, but I have cut foil strips that fit up top and I use it to warm the buns when I cook my veggie burgers --works perfectly, and keeps things warm as well.The only thing is that I wish it was larger -- it's kind of small.  My other oven that quit was larger than this one, but for the price it is definitely worth the money.
1	1296345600	We bought this toaster a few months ago and we have always had trouble with the timer. This morning my daughter's toast caught on fire because the timer never went off. Also there are too many features on each nozzle, if you are not exactly precise on where you direct your nozzle you can easily burn your item. I would not recommend this item to anyone, especially if you have teenage kids or if you are elderly.
2	1296259200	We have always had and liked Black & Decker toasters.  This one is confusing to use and seems to have hot and cool spots when toasting.
5	1296172800	We got this a year ago on sale.  It's very good and we're happy with it.  I thought I'd regret not getting a fancier model with digital settings but this has been a reliable unit.  Does what we need:  toasts 4 slices of bread and bagels, reheats pizza slices, garlic bread, etc.  Timer and temp controls work fine and keep it simple.  My only complaint is that when you open the door, the wire grill comes out which is great, but when you close the door, many times the latch that engages the wire grill doesn't line up so you have to nudge the grill to get it closed.  Not a big deal but I have burned a finger or two trying to get the grill back in line so shut the door.  Great value and great looking to match our appliances and counters.  It's small enough to not take up much space on the counter, yet big enough to toast/cook the things we want.
4	1296000000	The toaster oven functions well, although with three dials to adjust it somewhat more complicated than it should be.  We haven't tried all of the functions yet, but those that we did try worked well.  As with most units like this, cleaning is a challenge in spite of the slide out tray.Overall, it is a good value for the price.
1	1295913600	Not all inexpensive products are junk, but this one is.  I had to return the first one after two months because the drop-down door wouldn't shut properly.  B&D replaced it.  The bake pan is made of a questionable metal.  The first one developed rust spots after two months' use.  The replacement pan developed a gray coating that wipes off.  I'd never put any food on it.  B&D wasn't concerned when I called and about this -- I was afraid it was lead (the right color).  They sent another pan same as the first two.  Don't think so.  Now I'm looking for another toaster oven, preferably not one made in China.
4	1295827200	little is an Understatement, It actually is a great size toaster oven. It has a number of settings for different foods which is Nice, But it gets very hot and you just have to learn what temp/setting to put it on to not burn your toast. The thing i like most about the oven is that it STAYS ON when you have the door open. It's nice to broil things in a small pan or finish up a nice omelet. Overall I like the oven and it's perfect what I was looking for - Something that gets the job done while not being to complicated or extremely huge.
2	1295568000	Quality isn't great.  Timer for toasting doesn't work properly.  Burns the toast every time (can't seem to set for a lower time).
5	1295481600	The toast-r-oven is perfect for the counter top. The directions were clear and easy to follow and it does everything that a large oven can do without heating up the house. It is great for the single person or a couple.
1	1295481600	JUST THROW YOUR MONEY IN THE TOILET.  THIS IS THE WORST ITEM I HAVE EVER SEEN,  TOO MANY FLAWS TO LIST PLUS IT ALMOST WORKED FOR ONE WEEK.  IT IS ON THE CURB AWAITING GARBAGE PICK UP.
1	1295395200	As many users have pointed out, this toaster oven is a fire hazard.  I imagine that if I had followed the directions each time and turned the timer past 10 and then back to the time I wanted, it would not have caught fire. If I had not left the room while cooking, I could have prevented the fire.  However, if you are the type of person that commonly sets the timer where they want it, and who does not monitor the cooking progress of our toaster oven, I would recommend you find one that either has a better spring timer, or is digital.  This toaster oven cost me a used fire extinguisher and could have cost a lot more.  I'm sure black and decker was aware of this potential problem and that is why the instructions say things like: Don't leave toaster oven unattended." and "Turn timer past 10 and turn back to desired time."Well, I don't want to follow those directions. I want toast.
5	1295222400	I purchased this toaster oven for my husband's family and they LOVE it! They've been using sit religiously from day 1 mostly making toasted sandwiches. The settings are accurate and the cheese gets melted perfectly.
5	1295222400	Product works well. Since my other item was not working well I had to adjust on how I used my new toaster oven.  I had to lower the settings on the toaster oven because I did burn a few toast and bagels.  But now I got it right and it a great product. I would reccommend and the price is great as well.
5	1295222400	This is a great toaster oven for the price.I was looking for a smaller type of toaster oven and was not thinking of this one due to the stated measurements. I however saw it at a friend's and realized it was smaller than I thought.The actual measurements are:16" Depth x 8.5" tall x 10.5" deep
1	1295222400	This toaster oven has many design problems, but the biggest problem is that it's DANGEROUS. The knob controlling time is mechanical, and it often STICKS before arriving at off. In other words, if you set the timer for "light toast" it will sometimes stay on forever. Three pieces of toast have caught on fire this way. In addition, if you turn the know manually to "off," but move it just the tiniest bit beyond that point, the oven will also go on and stay on indefinitely. So you have to remain in the room and watch to see if you toast is done.Other design flaws:Complicated controls. To toast you have to put the top control to "Bagel/Toast" and the middle control to "toast."  If you have one dial set on bake and the other on toast, you will bake your slice of bread.Poor sizing. The front is curved (for aesthetic reasons, I assume), but this means that some standard baking dishes won't fit. There's no reason for this curvature.Overall, this is poorly designed with abysmal quality control. Spend a little more and get a decent toaster oven. That's what we're going to do.
5	1294876800	I have gone through a few toaster ovens, most of which I have given away or sold in a yard sale for a dollar.  This is because most toaster ovens in the 40-dollars or less price range do not work as toaster ovens.  They do not heat up enough, and they take 20 minutes to make warm bread.  I remember when I was a kid I babysat for people who had a black and decker toaster oven, and it worked so well.  That is why I bought this one at the bargain price of 23 dollars.  I am not disappointed!  The functions, temperature control, effectiveness and price are all outstanding!  You can actually bake things in this toaster oven!  There is a removable crumb tray for super easy cleaning, and it comes with a little cookie sheet.  It takes no time to heat up, and the temperature is very accurate.  I have little porcelain ramekins that I use to make baked apples, and they cook in about 15 minutes in this toaster oven, which is so much better than baking these little guys in my regular oven and heating up the entire house, wasting energy.  When I first got this toaster oven, I thought I would use it maybe every other day.  I am finding myself using it multiple times a day.  I even make soft puppy food in it by adding water to puppy chow and baking it for five minutes.  This is better for puppies than buying canned food for them, and it is so much easier than boiling water.  The uses are endless and the price is right.  Do yourself a favor and buy one of these toaster ovens!
3	1294704000	Maybe I don't know how to toast (or chew gum).  But apparently,  my toast doesn't brown like the other reviewer's.  First, I have a bit of trouble setting the toast dial so that it is repeatable.  A few degrees of rotation will turn under cooked toast to over.  There are no stops along the way and its actually hard to see where the dial pointer is pointed.  Second, the heating element on the bottom browns the portion of bread immediately above it unevenly. The portion immediately over the element might almost burn, while the rest of the piece can be undercooked. On a positive note, the side facing up browns uniformly.  I've only had it a week, but so far, Im disappointed in the "toast" feature.  The price, appearance etc are great. And I should say I purchased it thru Amazon, and was very pleased with the rapid delivery.
4	1294617600	Bought this to replace a very old toaster oven. Although the B & D has a bigger footprint, the inside dimensions are a little smaller than old one it replaced.Unit works fine, but I do have a few gripes.Why do they still use mechanical timer controls that need to be turned past a certain point and then backed off for shorter cook times? Surely by now digital controls must be cheaper. And what is the reason for turning past a certain point - wind up the spring or something?The mechanism that pulls out the rack when opening the door doesn't work very smoothly and catches sometimes when trying to close the door.After only a month, the painted on labels marking temperature settings, etc. began to wear off. No harsh chemicals or scrubbing used to clean it, just wiping with a damp cloth. Its possible that heat is causing this as the labels closest to the door are coming off first.
5	1294444800	This little oven has far exceeded my expectations. There are only 2 of us to cook for and this oven is great for cooking small portions in a reasonable amount of time. When we bake or broil fish in it we do not get the fishy smell throughout the house. We love it!
4	1294272000	I haven't used this much but will update this later so it will be of greater use. I can say I ordered this on Nov. 30, it was shipped Dec. 2 and arrived within a few days in perfect condition so I was very happy with that. When I placed the order the estimated delivery date was Dec. 8 - Dec. 13 so this arrived in advance of the first given date. I will briefly restate what others has said and this is that the top of this item gets very hot when in use. I actually moved it from under a cabinet where I had planned to place it to a more open space in my kitchen. Not to frighten anyone; just to make them aware. I've used this to cook a chicken breast once and it cooked evenly. I've toasted in it three times and each time had to stop the oven and turn the timer to off but that's just a matter of me figuring out how much time I need to set on the timer and not a problem with the item.
5	1294272000	Before buying, I searched for reviews for large sized toaster ovens and the best rated small toaster ovens.  I wanted a toaster with more food heating options with no intention to replace or supplement my large oven.  This Black & Decker toaster fit the bill-even at this price, if I didn't like it I would give it away.  I was pleasantly surprised by its performance. It operates easily and heats very quickly and relatively evenly.  I've made egg rolls, bagels, toast,hors devours, and re-heated pizza and I've only had it a couple weeks. Everything comes out great. It takes up just a little more space than my old toaster and it's aesthetically pleasing.  What I really like is the bell when timed cooking has finished. Now, I can cook all those little snacks and things in the toaster oven that I could not justify heating a large oven for.  I'm ordering a second one for the office!
5	1294272000	Very nice product! Very good quality/price ratio. Elegant looking with nice handling of the knobs. It takes some time to get used to it, but after that produces supreme results.
5	1294272000	Use it as toaster; for heating pizzas and bagels; baking... Its great!! It is not too big so does not swallow up counter space. Have had it for nine months and still love it.
4	1294185600	Used this item for the past few months. Very easy to use but will need to get comfortable with timing required for toasting different bread items. It does take longer than what I expected to cook certain items - I use it for light food items like veggies, shrimp, salmon burgers, & muffins. The size is nice - not too big/bulky but it depends on what size you are looking for. Good size for counter area.
4	1294185600	I'm very happy w/this toaster oven, which I've had for about a month, now. It toasts and broils very well, but is still fairly low wattage, so it doesn't trip the circuit breakers in my home's ancient electrical system. Only one tiny complaint - the cooking tray is square and somewhat smaller than the rectangular capacity of the oven itself (it's also kind of thin). I recommend you keep the tray from your old toaster oven and use that, if you prefer a rectangular shaped/size tray. Aside from that, I can't find anything to criticize. Really like this little toaster oven. Great deal for the price.
5	1294185600	I have been using this daily since I got it with no problems at all. Looks nice, inexpensive, cooks well. It also has a bit larger cooking space than I had originally thought it would have, so I'm pleasantly surprised by that. I've got no complaints at all.
1	1294185600	I had a GE Toaster-Oven for over 32 years (a wedding gift) which served us well until it simply wore out.  I purchased this Black and Decker one and it is truly unreliable unless one stands next to it as it toasts.  Once the setting is made for toast or bagel, then you have to set another infinite rotary switch to begin the toasting process.  The timing is so inconsistent that just a slightly higher setting can burn the toast/bagel.  You have to stand there and watch it as it toasts to take it out quickly.  A lower setting takes forever to toast anything.  I've resorted to a standard toaster with a timer that works and the toast pops up upon completion.  Seems like the old stuff is more reliable.
4	1293926400	Buy it!Works great as a toaster and small oven.Love the Bagel setting but you have to remember to set the function and return it to toast or the "other user's" toast will be underdone.Small footprint.Reasonably (cheap) priced.
3	1293926400	I've had this toaster oven for a few years now and felt a need to revise my past review.  Overall, the oven has worked fine and has heated up or cooked food perfectly fine.  I have dealt with the piece that holds the handle which gets very hot.  You can burn your fingers on it when you go to grab the handle.  The only other problem I find is the timer doesn't work well with making light toast.  If you use their guide on the dial for toast it comes out overdone to me.  If you turn the dial just a little which in time is about a minute or so running the timer doesn't go off and neither does the oven.  I have burnt too many pieces of bread and after setting my smoke alarms off this time I have decided to look for another oven.  If you don't make toast or have children using it it is still a good buy.
5	1293753600	Works like a charm, holds/maintains temp well, and plenty spacious. Easily one of the best options at it's price point.
1	1293753600	I have this one, didn't buy it here, and the door doesn't shut all the way, and its a stretch that they advertise fitting 4 slices into it.  You dont even get what you pay for here, look at other options and dont make the same mistake i made when purchasing this oven.  Expected more from B&D.  I am here looking for a replacement...
5	1293667200	This toaster oven is great.  I use it to warm meat and bread instead of using the microwave and for cooking some items.  It is so much more convenient than using the oven on the stove when cooking for one.  It is compact and nice to look at.  Works really well.  I am happy I brought it.  It was cheaper at Amazon than the retail stores near me.
5	1293667200	I was replacing a Black and Decker toaster oven where the "toast" timer stopped working.  I LOVE having a toaster oven...use it all of the time with a small pampered chef stone for reheating leftovers and toasting bagels (put the bagel on the stone cut side up and then use the toast setting so the bottom gets warm, but not toasted)LOVE IT!!  For $25, I can't go wrong!
1	1293580800	This toaster oven is absurd.  Three dials to make toast that toasts on one side. Hard to read dials.  I have owned Black and Decker before.  This new version is the worst ever.
4	1293494400	I've had it since about June 2010.  So far, no problems.  I just use it to toast bagels/bread and heat up leftovers.  Works fine.  Cords a little short (a few feet, I guess) but not a big problem.
4	1293494400	This toaster broiler oven was a very good deal for the price. Toasts each slice evenly, heats up leftovers very well, broils meats well. Caution: this toaster oven should not be left unattended because it does get very hot.Steve B
4	1293321600	Fit in a relatively small space.  Most Toaster Ovens today are very large.  This is not so big but easily handles 4 pieces of bread.  You have to watch the toast.  This toasts faster than any other T.O. I have ever used.  Burned a few bagels the first week.  Even the low/quick setting is powerful.  The door seems to get stuck on the oven rack quite a bit...not a huge deal, just a bit of a pain.  Overall, a great oven!
4	1293321600	This toaster oven is a great size for our small apartment.  It can comfortably hold 4 English muffin halves or 2-3 large pieces of toast (think Nature's Own organic whole wheat bread size).READ THE INSTRUCTIONS before you use this!  It clearly states that it gets HOT and that you should UNPLUG after use.  Don't store anything on top of it (I put the pan that it comes with on top as a reminder).  They are not kidding.  As long as you use common safety sense, this is a great toaster oven, especially for the price!!I have not had the issue of the timer sliding into the "untimed" function that other reviewers have mentioned.  But once again, use common sense and don't go far away when using a hot appliance!This has made great tuna melts :)
4	1293062400	This is my 2nd B&D; toaster oven and it works as well as the first one I had which lasted 5+ years. Don't pay any attention to all the reviews that talk about it catching on fire, etc. The people that wrote them (probably) didn't read the manual which tells you to turn the timer past 10 mins before you set the time on it. This is very common on toaster ovens and it's what keeps the element from staying on. The spring in the timer has to be wound to a certain tension so it will ring the bell which ends the timer and shuts the element off.Good toaster and a good price.
5	1292976000	Love this item!  I have cooked many small meals and snacks in it including cookies, chicken/fish, pizza, biscuits, etc.  Works great as a toaster also.  Very easy to use and clean.  Much easier to cook small meals in than using a full size oven and faster also.  Very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.
5	1292803200	I got this for my wife for our camper and it does the job. She is very happy with the product and a happy wife is a good wife!
4	1292803200	Considering the price, I am very happy with this toaster. We have only toasted and baked breads and ready to eat items. So far have been very satisfied.Need to be careful about setting the timer otherwise it can burn the toasts. If you put the shelf on the lowest rung you need to set the heat time lower and so on.
5	1292716800	wow very happy about price plus quality.Easy clean ,timer works the way it suppose to.Looks good.Best one I ever got.I will buy this one again.....
2	1292716800	After 2 years, our B&D; 480BS had its last gasp... shame because 2 years isn't enough time. The dial knobs got too hot and fused up, leaving it useless other than a paperweight.I can't remember the toaster over we had prior to this one, but we owned it forever and abused it daily. Not going to buy this brand again. Hope this helps you.
5	1292544000	Product is well made and very easy to use!  I replaced my toaster for this item and we pretty much use it for everything that needs to be warmed up!  Fast shipping helped!
4	1292457600	This toaster is OK. Takes longer to toast then my old Black and Decker toaster. Other then that no complains. Great price.
4	1292457600	This is a really nice small toaster oven. Yes, it does get hot on the outside - I've had a dozen toaster ovens over the years and every single one of them did. This is my second B&D toaster oven with the Stay On dial and I haven't had any problems with it accidentally getting turned on, mistakenly by me or automatically after the toast cycle. It is a small size, so although you can toast four pieces of bread at one time, they don't lie nice and flat - they are propped up a bit against the sides. It also has single elements top and bottom, so it does toast unevenly with four pieces of bread stuffed in there. It seems very sturdy, especially the dials. As inexpensive as this unit is, I would recommend it.
4	1292371200	the unit is working well and it looks nice. It was ordered from Amazon at a reasonable price, however I thought the baking tray would be slightly bigger
5	1292198400	Does exactly what it says it does, it does it well, and it does it in style. The over looks great, cooks great, and it keeps my tummy happy.
4	1292198400	We bought this when our oven ignitor went out and it is a great little gadget for the money! Heats up and brown things nicely and quite fast, we often prefer this to a microwave for so many things, such as heating up leftover pizza and such. Not only that, you don't have to heat up your big oven if you just want to make something like a frozen dinner for one person, etc. The only drawback is the size - which does not accommodate bigger items (although we did manage to get a Callender's potpie in there). It seems to heat evenly and has many features for the cost and we use it a lot more than we thought we would, even now that our range oven is fixed.
5	1292198400	Wow I gave up my Hamilton Beach Toaster oven, 3 years old only because it was quitting on me, choose to try this Black and Decker. The price was great and it is very classy in design and color. Fits perfect on my counter and works great. So far so good I am delighted, as always Amazon right on the ball, delivered quickly as promised. Thanks Amazon
5	1292112000	Everything works just as described. I had read about people getting confused by the knobs, but I can't see how. It's not complicated at all.
1	1292112000	Purchased to replace our poor, deceased Hamilton Beach toaster oven.  Do not try to warm delicate items like croissants because:1. Both top and bottom elements come on when baking.  This will char the item.  There is no difference between toasting and baking.  This seems to be a common characteristic of all toaster ovens these days.2. The thermostat is inaccurate.  I calibrated it with an accurate temperature meter.  Here's what I found:Setting -> Actual150 -> 225200 -> 300250 -> 335300 -> 370350 -> 450
2	1292025600	Yes, this toaster oven is astonishingly affordable. But it will still seem like you wasted your money just weeks after you bought it.As anyone who peruses my other Amazon reviews will note, I almost never take the time to write negative reviews. Life is too short. But this device is so badly made, I would be irresponsible not to share my experience.I have a friend who's a firefighter in Tucson, who surprised me once by telling me that toaster ovens are one of the leading sources of home fires.  He must have had a model like this in mind. The timing dial is nearly impossible to turn off, making it easy to leave the oven on by accident. Altogether, this oven is built more like an inexpensive power tool than a kitchen appliance.  Bread toasts unevenly, little fires (from cheese dripping onto the heating element) happen much more frequently than with toaster ovens I've owned in the past, and though we've only had this for a few months, the toasting rack is already bent so that the oven doesn't close correctly.  It's noisy, it's hot, and toast falls off the back of the rack easily, inviting electrocution as you fish around with a tongs to retrieve it.Yes, the "keep warm" setting is nice.  That's about the only thing good about this machine.  It's disposable technology: you'll own it for a couple of months and not even think about buying another Black and Decker toaster oven when it's time to replace it.
5	1291852800	I've had the toaster oven for over 3 months now.  Works great.  I always read the negative reviews 1st but the positive reviews won out.  I figured for $20 what do I have to lose.  Turned out to be the best $20 buy in quite awhile.  There are a lot of settings to get use to but I have had no problem toasting, baking or broiling.
5	1291852800	For the proce this is an excellent toaster oven. It was better than expected. It is very nice. It is just like myreal oven except smaller which i love and it is very simple to use.
4	1291852800	I LOVE GETTING MY BLACK AND DECKER TOAST-R-OVEN I USE IT MORE THEN MY OVEN AND IT COOKS EVERYTHING IN IT
4	1291766400	Got this for a month. Working good. Very basic toaster oven which is perfect for what I need. One minor con is it toast bread very quickly.  I burned a few pieces of bread before I can get it right.  The key is turn the knob between 'off' and 'light toast'.  Even setting to 'light toast' burns the bread.
1	1291680000	Before I purchased this I read the reviews and thought we just needed a simple toaster so this would work. Well I got this home and have had it a while, the numbers and letters on the dial melted off...yes melted and my husband left a piece of bread on the toast setting and it didn't turn off completely, then caught on fire...yes we had a kitchen fire with this piece of junk! DO NOT BUY!!! I expected allot more of a the name of black and decker!
1	1291680000	At first, this seemed to be a pretty handy peace of cookware, despite having dials instead of digital controls (who makes dials any more?). However, it soon became clear that I got what I paid for.  The interior of the thing was almost impossible to clean (with the exception of the pull out tray) and all of a sudden it started to kick circuit breakers. That made me more than a little nervous.  Finally, it just stopped working, all after just a couple of months with intermittent use.  I would not invest my money on some cheap piece of junk again.  Invest a few more dollars and get some quality.
4	1291680000	I bought this oven from Amazon.  The old one (different brand) died unexpectedly.  Delivery was quick and in good condition.  We use it mostly for breakfast toast.  The control is sensitive and need to be set just right.  Otherwise, the toast might get over done.  Otherwise, it is good and very reasonably priced.
5	1291593600	I purchased this oven to replace one that finally gave out. I was so amazed how quickly this oven heats up and also how good it is at maintaining the set tempature. I like the all the features this oven has on it, especially the keep warm feature and the slide out crumb tray. So if you looking for a good quality product I highly recommend this one..
4	1291420800	This is the second of these I've bought. The first one worked just fine, so , when our old model died at our other place, we replaced it with this one. Works fine and the crumb door is an improvement over other models I've had where you had to pick the oven up and turn it over to clean it out. No to here.
3	1291420800	....be carefull as sides and top get very hot when on for a long time, it is expected but need the special attention, other than that is a good buy.  One feature I would have liked was for the power to turn off upon opening the door, older models used to do that, this model stays on.
4	1291334400	Well I was looking for a toaster-oven without all the high-tech features. I been having a toaster-oven for years and I been looking for a modern looking one and and when I saw this one on sale, I bought it. It works great, its sturdy, gets hot quick and just a good looking toaster-oven.
5	1291334400	This is a really nice, and CUTE toaster oven.  It doesn't take up too much counter space, and I have already tried it out, it works perfectly.  You can set a timer, or put it on "always on" for longer cooking/broiling times.  It has a pullout tray at the bottom to easily clean crumbs, drips... a height adjustable rack and a cooking tray too.I REALLY love this for the price!
5	1291334400	I got this as a gift for my daughter in Owensboro, Ky. She said it works great and she loves the looks of it. Thanks.
4	1291334400	This toaster does everything you would want in a nice sized toaster oven. My only improvement suggestion concerns the handle on the front which gets very close to the heat when opened the incorrect natural way with your hand turned up . Needs a re-design.
5	1291161600	This is the first Black & Decker toaster oven that's really great and I've had a few of them. You do have to read the instructions on how to use it but its easy to get use to.  It looks really good and toasts and bakes well. The price was terrific particularly with the free shipping.
4	1291161600	This has a very updated design, works great, just a little slower than a regular toaster, offers more than a toaster @ the same price!
4	1290988800	For the price and brand name, you can't go wrong! It works well for toasting bread, waffles, and heating up leftovers. I even put a small pie in to heat up and it was perfect.The only con I can think of is that it does take a little longer than a standard toaster to toast bread, but that is usually true of most toaster ovens.Definitely a product I recommend.
5	1290902400	If your looking for somehting to cook the small stuff in and dont want to warm up the huge oven.  This is a great alternative.  It will fit four normal pieces of bread for some cinamontoast , or one small 8 inch round pizza like totions.
5	1290902400	Over the years we have owned several toaster ovens of varying quality. I ordered this one because of the good reviews and the sale price. We love it! It's the first toaster oven we've had that actually makes toast fast AND does a decent job baking. The controls are sensitive for better cooking results and we don't feel like it is a fire hazard. The inside is spacious and the crumb tray is very easy to remove and clean. We are so happy with it that we bought a second one for our cabin.
1	1290902400	one day for lunch i had 3 instead of 2 toasts and this thing caught fire the time i tried to toast the third slice.Took a while to put it out and now the entire things is charred on the instead.be careful about buying this item.Also keeps overcooking the food items earlier evn though i used the recommended settings and times in the guide book.
4	1290902400	This is the first toaster oven I've owned.  It's great for bagels - they are nice and toasted on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside.  They seem like they are softer than when we used the toaster.  I've also baked the little Pillsbury bread dough from the tube and they come out great.  I don't mind having to set 3 different dials - although I did forget to check them the last time I baked bread and I burned it beyond recognition before I caught it.  If I have any complaint at all, it's that only 2 slices of toast fit inside.  And I can't fit a 10" pie pan in it.  My mom says she can bake pies in hers.  So someday I will be shopping for a big girl toaster oven.  For now though, this one works great for what I need it for.
4	1290902400	I originally purchased this for my camper van to have something small and multipurposed, but so far it hasn't left my kitchen.  It is a basic toaster and oven with digital controls, but that is all I need. I had a previous toaster oven that was great, except that the door didn't open all the way flat and I would burn myself taking food out of it.  This door opens all the way, making it much easier and safer to use. My one little complaint - and maybe it is common in all toaster ovens - is that when I accidently turned on the timer, it wouldn't turn off until the timer ran out, which was sometimes after my food was already out of the oven.  Overall, this is handy as a second oven, can make 4 pieces of thick toast/bagels at a time, requires minimal time to heat up and takes up very little counter space.  I may have to buy 2 of these so I can finally have one for my camper.
5	1290729600	Bought this a few weeks ago.  You can't beat it for the price.  Stainless steel, cook timer, temperature and several cook settings.  Small cavity, but again, a great price for this model.  I love shopping Amazon!
4	1290729600	My first purchase of the Black and Decker Toaster Oven I had to resend it because it did not work.  The second one that they sent to me worked fine.  Now that I have a working oven, I am satisfied with the price (close to $10 cheaper than Wal-Mart), the appearance was nice, easy to maintain and keep clean.  The only complaint would be the size, you can only fit a small pizza or container in the oven.  It would be perfect for a dorm or a back-up for a full-sized oven.  Overall, after the second time around, I am satisfied so far so good.
5	1290729600	I bought this as an alternative to heating up my big oven.  I have made garlic bread, toast, bagels, and even reheated leftover dinner.  So far everything has worked great, we even got rid of our regular toaster.  Small enough that it doesn't take up too much space.  The only complaint I have is that I might look for one with the heating element in both the front and back.  This one has only one element in the center so when toasting I tend to move the toast around once when it is half way done to get an even toast.
5	1290556800	I am very happy with this toaster oven. I bought it mainly because I wanted to update my kitchen accessories to the look of stainless steel without breaking the bank.  It looks great so my first goal was accomplished, but it also works very well.  It heats much faster than my old toaster oven and I have a much easier time cleaning it out of crumbs since the crumb try slides out from the front instead of the back, which is what my old one did.  The operating knobs are easy to understand and are sturdy. Overall, the toaster oven is much more well made than I expected for the price, which was under $25.
2	1290556800	This unit is cheap, but not worth the savings over a bigger and better made toaster.  Cosmetically this one looks fine, but the operations are under par.  First, there is no toast dial.  You need to put the dial to a specific time, so you have to watch the bread lest it burn.... not very good design for a toaster.  The other problem is that the hooks that grab the door are relatively thin aluminum, so can be easily bent which will throw the whole procedure off, making it difficult to open or close the front door.  Lesson learned?  Buy a sturdier toaster than this one unless you are expecting very light use....
1	1290470400	It has a misleading appearance. It has a BROIL dial but there is no broil rack, pan or anything that is used in a broiler. I am going to have to remove the needed items from the old toaster oven/broiler/cooker that we are replacing. I hope they fit!
1	1290470400	toaster oven is small and poorly designed.  when opening the door fully, it pulls out the metal rack inside.  however, due to the shape of the metal catch arms on the door, which pull out the rack, one cannot fully close the toaster oven because the arms then catch on the rack and will not close properly.  This was a minor annoyance.  What is really bad is the self timer does not work, so when cranking the knob to toast for instance, instead of winding down and turning off like most toaster ovens, this just stays on.  Just caused a fire which I had to put out with an extinguisher.  Overall, most all B&D products I have tried in recent past have been poorly made, this is no exception.  Stay away, this poses a fire danger.  get one with digital timer, and another brand.
3	1290470400	This is a nice toaster oven because it is stainless steel but the controls are a little complicated.  The dials have to be reset each time for the type of toast you want.  It is easy to set the control for the wrong type - toast, bake, etc. accidently and not do what you want.  You have to turn the timer on the bottom past a certain point in order for it to work.  I had to return my first one because it did not work but did replace it.  The size is nice.
3	1290384000	Although the oven looks great and does everything it's supposed to....it has a flaw that many others have as well. After using the oven for a few months I noticed that the toasting selection is not as accurate. Many things tend to toast and then burn very quickly no matter if the dial is at it's lowest setting.I got used to it and now watch everything more closely. Just something for you to be aware of.I do love the slide out crumb tray....as it's so easy to clean and very non-stick.I do like that it's rather deep and bigger items all fit in well.I don't like the fact that you now have 3 dials that you must rotate for your needs. Going from bake to toast requires you to move each dial to the correct selection.If I just want some toast...I wish I could just press a button...instead of having to turn each dial.All in all it's a nice oven ....but I'll probably look for a different one next time.
2	1290384000	I bought this toaster to replace a Black and Decker toaster that I loved, but had a problem with the door.  Unfortunately, this toaster was a poor replacement.  It has lots of settings, which I don't really want or need, but every time you make toast, you have to dial the knob past '10 minutes' and then set it to desired level.  There are no in-between marks for 'medium' toast -- just a pale toast icon and a dark toast icon.  There's also a bagel icon, but they don't explain how the bagel setting is different....  In the old toaster, I could set it a little past medium, and know that the toast would always be the same since you could leave it at the desired setting.I was ultimately disappointed in the amount of time it took to toast the bread to a medium level of brown toast.  I think it took about 7 minutes or so, and by that time, the toast was dried out.  It was also uneven - more toasted on the bottom than on the top.  I ultimately returned the toaster.  I believe the heating element is to blame -- it's a long fat cylindrical element on top, whereas they used to have two thin heating elements on top that toasted bread much more quickly.  Black and Decker, please bring the old model back!!
4	1290124800	I love it.  This is the first time I've bought a toaster oven rather than a plain toaster and I love it!!  The three knobs on the side allow you to set a temperature, choose a method (bake, broil, toast, keep warm, and bagel), and set a timer.  There is a great crumb tray on the bottom that easily slides out.  It even comes with a small cookie sheet.  The only thing I would change is the fact that the outside gets pretty hot.  Other than that I have no complaints!
1	1290038400	There is a timer for the toast option.  The instructions state to set the timer past 10 minutes first then set it to a shorter time.  i tried the shorter time first without going past 10 and the unit stayed on for a long time.  This is a fire hazard.  It is not intuitive to go past 10 minutes first.  With the children having their friends over and other guests unfamiliar with the operations i would not trust everyone to know or remember the 'going past the 10' rule.
3	1289865600	Compact which is good but the door is hard to close sometimes and no one gets the dials right so there is a lot of burnt toast.  Really is no light, medium and dark toast settings that are definitive, so it is best for people who want to heat stuff up without using a lot of counter space or starting a large oven.
5	1289779200	This toaster oven is fantastic, and for the price, its amazing.  Don't let the price scare you into thinking this isn't a quality product - it absolutely does what  it needs to, stays clean, and looks great with stainless kitchen appliances.
4	1289692800	The price was the best and the product looks good and works good. The only thing I need to get used to is operating the three dials on it--it seems you have to turn all three to get the combination of heat and time for it to work.
4	1289692800	I ordered this toaster oven for use in my dorm room at college, and it performs admirably given its rather inexpensive price tag. The controls are not entirely intuitive, but once I started using it regularly they began to make sense. It heats fairly evenly, and works well for everything from toast to making small pizzas. I use it all the time and strongly recommend it to anyone who needs a cheap but effective toaster oven.
1	1289692800	If you just use it as an oven then buy it, is a good deal at $26.But if you mainly use it for toast I don't recommend.  After two months, I still end up with burned toast, unless I watch it the whole time and pull toast out when it looks right.  The main dial that controls toasting is small and not well marked, so the difference between perfect and burned is a tiny turn of the dial.  Whoever designed this should be fired.  I'll buy my next toaster at a local store, that way if I'm not happy I can return it.  (can't return a used toaster to amazon).  Also, the timer makes a ticking noise the whole time it's on -- no problem if your kitchen is loud, but sucks if it's quiet.  Does not toast evenly either -- the part of the bread closest to the back of the oven gets hotter, so it burns before the front part is done.  I wish they still made the toaster oven I got in 1998 -- that was an awesome toaster.  Seems like they keep getting worse.If you're over 50 or have poor eyesight this toaster is not just annoying, it's also a safety hazard.  You'll be setting off your smoke alarm regularly.The oven features on this unit work well.  The crumb tray is well designed.  It looks nice.  That's all that I like about it.Update - if you set the temperature dial to 350 F (instead of "Toast") then you're less likely to burn the toast.  But this thing is still annoying to use.
5	1289606400	I am very pleased with the price and quality of this product.  Delivery was very prompt as well.  Judy
5	1289347200	This is my sixth or seventh B&D toaster oven. Each one has lasted three to five years. It gets used and abused. Kids can work there magic on any appliance! It does what say's- it will Toast! This one is much better, the crumb tray slides out with ease from the front and is super easy to clean. Cool feature, we will use. It came in its well packed box from Amazon, with free shipping and $10 less than Walmart who can argue! It's just a $29 toaster, not a major purchase. Just buy one, and be happy in life.
1	1289347200	Having to set 3 different dials just to make a piece of toast is absolutely ridiculous. The door often jams when you try to close it (a poor design feature that plagued the last B&D toaster oven we bought--I guess we don't learn). The toast does not brown evenly and I find that I have to both flip and rotate the bread in the middle of the toasting process. What a pain in the neck.
3	1289260800	The Toaster works fine.  Just remember NOT to put anything on top of it. I made that mistake by placing a towel over it and it melted the towel (towel made of polyester).
5	1289174400	We have been wanting a toaster oven for quite some time. Decided to give this one a try since it fit our budget and had some good reviews. There was also a bad review where the food caught fire, so I decided to read all the directions before I got started. We've had no problems at all and no complaints. We love this toaster and use it all the time. A 9" pizza fits perfectly. I use it for toast, bagels, fries, pizza rolls, nuggets, even warmed hot dogs in it yesterday. It is super easy to clean, and my favorite part is that it doesn't heat up the whole kitchen like my regular oven does. I imagine it is saving us on our energy bill. I am very happy with this purchase.
5	1289174400	I have had many B+D toaster ovens over the years...this on ehas to be the best. Don't hesistate to buy. The price is right.
5	1289088000	this toaster oven is wonderful.  toasts beautifully and evenly, broils as it should and bakes true to temperature.for the price, you can't go wrong.  i've had this for a month and it has yet to disappoint.if you're looking for a reasonably priced unit that fulfills promises, look no further.  you won't be sorry.
5	1288915200	I received this product a few days ago but I have to say it has be a delightful experience already using it. It contains heat very well, cooks and toast quickly and efficiently. I love it.
5	1288828800	I am very happy with my Toaster Oven.  Not complicated at all to use.  Nice, larger space for baking small items and toasting more than 2 pieces of bread.
1	1288742400	I just replaced a toaster oven that I had for a couple of years because I wanted the ability to BAKE things. The word BAKE means that the bottom heating element is used ALONE, without the top element on. My old unit used both elements any time it was on. I assumed that since the B&D TRO480BS has a control labeled BAKE or BROIL, that choosing BAKE would cause only the bottom element to be used. WRONG, when set on BAKE, both the top and bottom elements are used, making items you intend to BAKE scorch on top and before they get hot in the middle, they are charred on the top. In BROIL mode, only the top element is used, which is correct. Do all the B&D TRO480BS units have this problem, or is there something wrong with mine?
4	1288742400	We've had this toaster oven for over six months now and we have been very happy with it.  It's very simple to use and we haven't had any problems with it so far.  It's a great size, not too large and not too small.  It looks nice on your counter top and can cook a great amount of things!  You will be very happy with this product!
5	1288569600	for all the reviewers that complained about this toaster over burning your food, i suggest you let someone else use kitchen appliances for you. this things works beautifully, even using the standard settings - for example, turning all knobs to bagel actually toasts my bagels perfectly. i mean, i am usually a huge skeptic but this bad boy works. the price is great and this thing can hold up to 4 large pizza slices at one time; can toast 4 pieces of bread with room to spare. if you're undecided, i spent a week reading and comparing toaster ovens from numerous sites as i am a cheap med student, and settled on this one. i've been more than happy with it and thought i'd write a review to squash any doubts you might have if you are interested in this appliance. all this talk of food is making me hungry.. happy hunting!
1	1288483200	I purchased this item to replace our previous toaster oven that gave out. We needed something for basic use...toast, frozen waffles, grilled cheese, etc. I've never used anything but the lightest toast setting on this oven & it burns things black about 1/2 the time. It's like the setting may or may not be what you choose. The second week we had it, my husband put two slices of toast in on the lightest setting, then went upstairs to get my son out of bed & when he came back down, the toast was on fire. Flames were coming out the door, the top of the toaster was completely singed & we were lucky nothing else caught on fire. I'm extremely disappointed in this toaster oven. I think it's a dangerous product & wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I feel completely ripped off that I wasted money on it.I searched through the reviews again today, puzzled by the fact that so many thought it was wonderful when we've had such an awful experience with it. However, when I filtered by the 1 star reviews I saw that several people have had the same problems with this toaster, so it obviously has some issues. I usually just read the most recent reviews, but from now on I'll be looking at any low reviews to see why they rated it as such before making a purchase.
4	1288483200	The toaster oven is just what I expected.  It has a clean appearance, works perfectly well and I especially like the slide-out tray that picks up crumbs.  I am well pleased.  And the price cannot be beat!
3	1288396800	The toaster oven is good for reheating 3 large slices of pizza, Tyson frozen chicken nuggets cooked as per directions with no flipping required meant even cooking top and bottom.  However Pillsbury cookies or homestyle type biscuits requires 2 batches.  If you have a family of 3 or larger, recommend getting the size up.  this would be great for college or office, but probably not good for camping cooking or large oven replacement.
5	1288310400	Ordered this Toaster Oven on Sunday Night around 10pm and it was sitting in my kitchen on Tueday morning.  I mean wow and it was on super savings shipping.  I love the oven. It far exceeds what I thougt I would be getting.
5	1288310400	IF you are looking for a basic, great working, fast toaster oven to toast and bake, this is the one.  Warms up and toasts, bakes FAST. Arrived quickly, just plug and go.Perfect and works in most all budgets.Be careful not to touch, it gets HOT to the touch when working.
5	1288310400	I wanted to condense my toaster oven and toaster into one appliance, and bought this one based on the reviews. It is everything I could want in a toaster oven! My toast is crispy on the outside but still soft inside - not all dried out and unevenly toasted like my old toaster produced. I have used the oven to make pizza slices and reheat food and it is fast! Would absolutely buy another one!
5	1288310400	I am in love with my new toaster oven, it is beautiful, convenient, easy to clean...i can do so many things with it....it's just a great product all around and i would definetly recommend it to all my friends!!! My Daughter said it was sleek and sexy!! lol....thx again Amazon.com for another great product...
5	1288137600	When we went looking for a new toaster oven we had a choice between buying one that was ugly but functional and hiding it in our appliance garage, or getting one that was sleek and modern looking and leaving it on the counter.  I really wanted one that was just functional and wouldn't cost too much then I could tuck it away unseen.  Then we found this one and I have to say it looks great on our counter and still didn't cost too much.  Works great too.
5	1288051200	This is a great little toaster oven!  Nice, sleek appearance, great function and control (three! knobs), roomy (for being compact), and energy-saving (don't have to turn on a big oven for a small job), and great price.  Glad I purchased it!
4	1288051200	It may be different from some toaster ovens in that the top element heats up even in bake mode.  In regular ovens and some t-ovens bake only lights up the bottom element.  That way nothing gets inadvertently seared on top.  That might be a pain to get used to and could burn the top of something like a cake or brownies.  However, for baking fish, meat, vegetables, pizza, or toasting sandwiches or bread, I find the top element heating up makes the little oven pretty efficient and more powerful for baking than it's wattage would lead me to expect.Preheat time is very fast.  No preheat finished indicator.  You have to look at the elements and see if they've turned off to know when temp is ready, but most cheaper t-ovens are like that.  It looks a bit small but it has bowed out sides to give it more room.  It has a nice crumb tray. No digital temp adjustment, just dials.  Mostly I have to put the dial about 25 degrees hotter than what a recipe calls for.  Also, I let the baking tray preheat with the oven, otherwise the cold baking tray is enough to interfere with cooking.  These adjustments make the oven pretty good, but without them it would require extra cooking time to compensate.It has a very short power cord.Update:Once you tweak your cooking methods, this is quite a useful machine for a great price.  But, if that's not your cup of tea, spend more on something more powerful.For example, the top element is not strong enough to really broil -- too much temperature is lost.  To work around this, when I want to broil, I put the tray in the broil position but then turn on the bake setting at max temperature, leaving both elements on.  This is no longer technically broiling, but it achieves the same effect and can put a nice brown on top of your meat, fish, or poultry.Also, the oven is very sensitive to the amount of food you put in it. Cooking time varies more than usual when you add another piece of food, especially if it's something that can be cooked directly from frozen.  This makes sense given the small size of the machine, but takes getting used to. Once you figure out the right adjustments, it's no problem.I use this oven multiple times daily because it's great for cooking for two people and saves a lot of energy vs. using my regular electric oven. You have to be willing to use some trial and error to adjust your cooking methods to use it effectively though.Two final caveats: 1. The baking pan quickly warped from the heat during normal baking (still usable, just bent). 2. It emits a faint plastic-ish burning smell when it's very hot. Nothing hot's touching the cord or anything else plastic or rubber so I'm assuming this has to do with the type of metal it's built out of or something else in its construction.  The smell isn't strong enough to permeate the kitchen or the food and may be fading with time.
5	1287964800	This compact little toaster is super! It was delivered in only a few days and does not take up much space on my counter top. I love it for re-heating pizza and making toast!
4	1287878400	I have seen much more expensive, comparable ovens, but this one is exceptional for the price.
2	1287619200	I bought this for $26 and had pretty minimal expectations based on the low price - but I still had to return it.  The unit had some kind of unfinished or corroded paint or finish on the front, and some suspicious scratches like maybe someone tried to buff it and made it worse - but shipped the unit anyways.The unit also had an unreasonably short power chord - like less than 2 feet.
5	1287446400	Great price, bought it for my son to use in college dorm room. The oven has helped his popularity as it has been used quite often by dorm mates. It has held up to toast, burritos, pizza and melted cheese sandwiches.
1	1287446400	The timer has the tendency to stay on.  My kitchen is covered with smoke and the food flared up. It's really dangerous when you're not watching. Buyer beware!
5	1287446400	This is the best toaster oven ever!! The appearance is beautiful and it works wonderfully!!!! I bought it as a gift for my parents but now i want one!
5	1287273600	Great little product, hassle free, easy to use, straightforward. Fits 4 slices of any kind of bread (toasts, bagels, etc...), and I would say 2 pizza slices. It's definitely a 5 star product, particularly for its price. Can't go wrong with B&D.
5	1287014400	This toaster is a spectacular value. It looks extremely stylish and well-crafted, like a $100 toaster. When you feel it you can tell it's not $100, as it has very thin paneling, but it's still fully sturdy with no warnings of premature failure. It's even more of a value because it comes with a nice rack that automatically pulls out about 2 inches when you open the door, and a nice little bake pan, about 7x10x0.75" if I had to guess. Inside, the oven also has multiple internal rack mount guides (3 in fact) to go from normal baking to extremely-crispy broiling with no added tools.Another big plus is that it has two heating elements like anything calling itself a toaster oven should (but not all do, especially in this price range). And it gets VERY hot, VERY quick, which is excellent. I was shocked how much faster this oven got internally hot, compared to my old toaster oven from the late 80s. No need or desire to preheat it. It does get externally hot too, but obviously not even close to the internal temperature. As long as you don't put anything plastic on or next to it and keep your hands to yourself, I would never worry about it.The glass door and knobs are nicely made for the price. They work sturdily with no fear of breaking. The glass door is bowed to *maybe* let something like a tiny pizza inside, but I'm not sure. It's still better than a flat door. There's an included drip tray for crumbs and some fat, but it's basically a flat sheet and not a pan of any kind, so it will need very frequent changing (sometimes multiple times per use depending on the contents of the meal you're cooking). The five different modes for heating are also great.One big flaw is that the power cord is only about 30 inches long (again, guessing). This is really awful if you don't have counterspace RIGHT next to an outlet. Luckily I was able to make room -- kind of -- but this could easily be a deal breaker for some people. Such high-wattage appliances shouldn't be used with long extension cords. With modern house wiring I doubt it would ever be a problem, but from an electrical point of view it shouldn't be done.Other than the power cord, I can't fault a single thing for the ~$27 price I paid with free 2-day shipping. It's a far better value than anything I could find in any brick and mortar store even for $30-40. If you have no need for a convection oven (which is an expensive feature), don't fear buying this oven over a more expensive one. It also has a 2-year warranty, though buying a new one if anything ever happens might be even cheaper than return shipping!I just made a low-carb quiche pepperoni cheese pizza in the little bake pan last night and it came out PERFECTLY cooked and in the time expected by the recipe, with no burning or other problems. It was DELICIOUS! BUY NOW!
1	1286928000	How hard can it be?? It seems like ever 1-2 years we have to get a new toaster oven. It is the work horse of our kitchen and family. We've tried the expensive ones, we've tried the less expensive ones...they all break or die after a year or so. Not this one. It lasted 2 MINUTES. Knobs wouldn't turn, and after 10 minutes it only slightly toasted one side of a piece of bread. We cleaned out the three crumbs, boxed it back up, and pulled out the old one. ( Another Black & Decker, 20 months old with a wacky door, and two broken knobs-- we use needle nose pliers to turn it on.) Sigh. I just want a toaster oven that lasts longer than a manicure.
5	1286755200	This is a well designed and attractive unit. I am not only well satisfied with the oven-toaster, but the ease of ordering and prompt shipping provided.
5	1286755200	Great purchase of ideal oven toaster.My old toaster (20 year old) was dying.Safe for me to buy one that can heat as well as toast.Great lover of bagels....this works pretty well.The delivery was outstanding.  Got it the next day (Prime Member).Arrived via a shipping Co I have not used before : Order was left on my doorstep.Good idea - I did not have to wait for the delivery man.**  The only drawback was that this oven was advertised by a local Macys on a One Day Sale at $19.95.  My wife told me, this after item purchased was finalized.  B-U-M-M-E-R!!!!
5	1286668800	Great very fast and work on both sides effectively. Best toaster I ever had. Easy to clean as plate down comes out and also looks nice on counter.
4	1286496000	Works great and looks good.  Could toast a little bit more evenly though, but overall happy with the purchase.  One thing though, this same product went on sale at Macys the day after I received it for $20 less!  But I couldn't return it without a cost so I kept it.
5	1286409600	I'm very satisfied with this toaster. I haven't found anything wrong with it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small compact toaster.
2	1286409600	The toaster worked fine for a while.  However, I was toasting some pumpkin seeds in it and the glass just exploded all over the kitchen!  I have no idea why it would have done that.  I was in the kitchen when it happened, so I know that there wasn't a power surge, nothing on fire in the toaster, and there wasn't even anything/anyone over near the toaster to knock into it.  The only assumption I can make is that the glass door is very poorly made or designed.
4	1286409600	For what this costs, it's perfectly fine. The drip pan is nice. It's certainly easy to use. My only hesitation is that the exterior surface gets excessively warm. If I had a small kid, I might hesitate with it.
3	1286236800	This is a great toaster oven. My only problem is with its toast/timer rotary switch. The range between a burnt toast and a light toast is so short that it is almost impossible to make a perfect toast unless you are watching the progress. Another problem with this switch is that if you manually turn it off somewhat carelessly, rather than go off, it will turn permanently on!
4	1286236800	The metal used is low quality and bends easily. But it looks great for something thats under 25 bucks. The tray even comes out a little when the door is opened which is rare on a cheap toaster oven.There is one heating element on the bottom and one on the top. The higher end ovens have 2 each.The unit I received was so recently manufactured that it even smelled of fresh paint. I had to let it stay on for a while to burn off the paint smell! The finishing is not stainless but just silver paint.
1	1286236800	I bought this and when received it was only the crum tray. I understand about mistakes I make them too but when I called they told me they didn't have the toaster oven in stock and would send me a refund. The refund was timely and appreciated. They still have it listed so why couldn't they have sent me the toaster oven? Beware!
4	1285977600	For a cheap, basic toaster over, this item is great.  The top does get very hot and the cord is quite short, as I believe others have mentioned.  I haven't had any problems with it burning or overcooking things.  It's cheap and gets the job done.
2	1285891200	I wanted to replace my 20 year-old toaster oven with something that doesn't burn toast, so I bought this at a local store, but I'm returning it. I plugged it in and did a test toast cycle, and found that the entire exterior got VERY hot, it took a really long time for the cycle to finish, and it seemed like the toast would burn anyway. My really old toaster oven also gets hot, but not on all sides like this one -- only the top gets hot. So I'll stick with what I have.
4	1285804800	This item is a renewal of an older Black & Decker Toast-R-Oven I had for many years. The old one finally wore itself out after serving my family of five through the teen and college years of the children.  Since I was always happy with the old appliance, I figured that I would trust the company and buy their product once more.  I have to tell you, though, that before I got the new B&D, I bought a replacement at a local store.  It was NOT what I liked or wanted...so back to ole faithful for me.  At least someone from Goodwill got a gently-used toaster for a small amount of $$$.
4	1285804800	Purchased one week ago, and so far have only used for toasting (bagels, frozen waffles, bread). Be sure to follow the instructions and turn the toast/timer dial past "10" before setting the toast darkness, or it may not turn off.
5	1285718400	This toaster is a nice compact size. It is easily fits two slices of bread side-by-side with space to spare. The three nobs are all east to use. There are specific settings for toasting of bagels, vs. toast, as well as options to cook other items at specific temperatures. We have had great success with this product thus far.
4	1285632000	Purchased this item and have really enjoyed using. Crisps pizza and great for toasting and making grilled sandwiches. Only negative is that the outside of the unit gets really hot.....so far so good!
5	1285632000	I bought this for my college apartment and have been very satisfied with it so far.  It's great for toasting bread and bagels, for making chicken nuggets, frozen pizza, etc., and for warming up just about anything else.  It has a few functions for different types of food that I've sometimes used (for example, the bagel function turns off the bottom heating element so only the top of the bagel is cooked) but leaving it on toast or bake is good for just about anything you need to warm up.  If you need a toaster oven, I recommend this one.
3	1285545600	What you've read about the toast setting is true: if you leave the bread there it will burn -- black.  You just have to set the temperature to a different setting other than the toast.  There are 3 settings: the top one that says "Temperature", the second middle one that says "Function" and the bottom one that says "Timer/Toast".  The way I made it work for me is like this:1. Set the top "Temperature" setting to *350/180 DEGREES* (Fahrenheit/Celsius).2. Set the middle "Function" setting to *TOAST*.3. Set the bottom "Timer/Toast" setting on the little round, doughnut-looking drawing, which I believe is meant to be for *BAGEL* if you like your bread very light. If you like your bread a little darker, set it with the arrow pointing towards the *TOAST* drawing.Other than this, the toaster/oven has acceptable space, so for the price it's OK.  True, you shouldn't have to work around it -- the appliance should rather be designed to be more user-friendly. But if you're on a budget and want a unit that's not too small, this is an option.
4	1285545600	What a plesant surprise!  This toaster oven may be a lot cheaper than others but it performs better and is a stylish addition to our stainless steel kitchen.  Highly recommend it.
1	1285372800	This toaster oven caught on fire.  15" flames, from just toasting something. Had noticed previously it steamed while using. Thought house was going to catch on fire, threw water on it.
5	1285372800	We had a B&D TRO for only 5 years and the selector switch quit. Parts were not available from the repair station so we hope this one will last longer. Amazing pricing and shipping cost. My wife did not like how the rack pulled out but we are adjusting. I hope this one last longer.
4	1285372800	In my humble opinion - 3 to 4 stars out of 5.  Not the greatest, but a good-enough value for the money.  A bit smaller than typical toaster ovens, but the upside to that of course is that it takes up less counter space.  The advertisement refers to cooking a pizza -- believe me when I say, it would absolutely have to be one or two SMALL personal size pizzas for THIS unit to accomodate the cooking.  But, it toasts well and serves the purpose of a toaster oven -- to cook without heating up the kitchen like a full size oven does. Works well for me!
5	1285372800	I love my new toaster oven, my old one did not have a timer and I burned a lot of toast. this is great, I use it instead of turning the oven on.Loraine
5	1285372800	I got it for a college dorm. It works perfectly for my needs and budget. Despite being $30, it looks pretty legit too. I couldn't have asked for more.
5	1285372800	I like that it also has oven temperature settings that I can use for baking small dishes. It can also bake a 12 in. pizza with no problem.
4	1285200000	Oven works really well. We hadn't replaced our last toaster oven when it wore out a a while back, so it's nice to have one again where the timer goes off and everything works. It's so convenient for heating up leftovers or quick snacks  I love to toast waffles with it.
3	1285113600	My roommates and I use this product primarily for toasting bread.  It works pretty well, toasts the bread quickly, and is easy to clean. There is a removable crumb tray that you just slide out and dump into the trash can, which is especially convenient for us due to all of the bread crumbs that fall into the toaster oven.  The only problem is that it cooks the back of the bread much faster than the front; if you don't flip it half way through then part of your toast will be blackened.
2	1285113600	Looks great but gets really hot when cooking. To the point where I don't feel safe leaving the kitchen when it is cooking. Then, a little bit of drippings got on the drip pan, it started to smoke up. Would not buy this again. Still trying to figure out why it's 20% less now, 1 week after I purchased it. Guess they can't get rid of them. I do not like this policy of things on sale immediately after you purchase them. Can they not start a policy of refunding you if it drops within 48 hrs of purchase?
1	1285113600	I had a Delongi toaster oven. I could cook a chicken and bake in it. I was misled by the reviews here. THe "baking" pan is a half inch high. There is very little space between the top of the oven and the space for baking. I imagine you could cook a pork chop, but you cannot bake in it. Very disappointing. I threw it out
1	1285113600	We had this toaster oven for about three weeks. We were having some trouble figuring out how much to turn the dial. Some things had burned slightly, and other things had not toasted enough, but we were getting used to it. One of our favorite things to do lately is to toast an Ezekiel sprouted grain tortilla and then break it up into tortilla chips.So one day my husband put a tortilla into the new toaster oven. I was on the phone and sort of watching it, but he was better at guessing where to put the dial and his tortillas rarely burned, so I wasn't paying that much attention. At some point I realized the toaster oven was putting out a lot of steam or smoke, so I called my husband. He opened the window and also tried to turn off the oven, but he turned the dial to "off" and it went past the off point to the "always on" position, so it was still heating. At this point I thought the tortilla couldn't be that far gone yet, so I suggested he pull it out of the toaster oven. FOLKS, DON'T DO THAT. He opened the door and flames whooshed all around the tortilla, FILLING the inside of the toaster oven. He quickly slammed the door shut again and we waited while the tortilla burned up over about 30 seconds. We threw out the toaster oven, most of the top of which was blackened (like I'm going to plug THAT in again).I think this happened because this particular toaster oven is VERY small and the things you put in it are VERY close to the heating elements. Also the dial is VERY hard to get to the right spot. Especially for a thin bread like a tortilla, the difference between a half-toasted tortilla and a toaster oven full of flames is a few millimeters on the dial. I would never buy such a small toaster oven again (and if you did, watch it well). The funny thing is we bought this oven (and threw out our previous one) because we thought THAT one was a fire hazard! Now it's back to the drawing board again.
3	1285113600	Decent for the price. COntrols are rather confusing. Mechanical timer necessitates turning it pass 10 seconds...then turn back to 5 seconds if you want 5 seconds. Takes way to long for toasts.
4	1285027200	The Black & Decker TRO480BS is a well built, economical, and convenient toaster oven. I've had large ones by other manufacturers, but they were bulky and used a lot more energy. Hence, I did not use them frequently. This 4-Slice toaster oven, on the other hand, is an energy-efficient model and excellent for use on a daily basis.
4	1285027200	The only downside to this toaster oven is that the outside surface gets just as hot when heating something. I would have preferred that the outside surface be insulated, to prevent that
5	1285027200	Nice size for fitting up to four slices of toast and small pizzas.  It's a little bulky for smaller counter areas.  Bottom tray facilitates easy clean up and is not flimsy.  Love it.  Would definitely recommend as we use our toaster oven daily not just for toasting but also use the oven for reheating.
5	1285027200	This is a great little oven.  It is large enough to cook most meals for two people.  I have only used the full size oven once since I made this purchase. For the price the quality is truly amazing.
4	1284940800	Searched high and low for a toaster oven to make toast - shock! - and do simple things like reheat pizza. Didn't need convection or something large enough to cook a whole frozen pizza. Didn't want something that took up far too much counter space and did not want to spend more than $40, and did not want something where the buttons and knobs felt so cheap like they were going to fall off when you turn them. Thank you B&D for this one! It's perfect for making toast, reheating pizza, or even cooking a baked potato (hint - put in the micro for 5 minutes first and then bake for 20 minutes). Toast option makes toast a little too dark for us so we just set for a little less. Love this version for under $30 and trust me, you won't find it in the store.
4	1284940800	I have just a few short observations. The baking tray that comes with the toaster oven is very small, it leaves space that is not utilized on all four sides of the oven, I thought that was pretty annoying, it could have been a couple of inches larger in width and lenght. The thermostat seems to be running somewhat cooler that the label says. Overall fit and finish is lacking, but given the price it was in line with my expectations. It does toast very evenly, and works well so far.
5	1284940800	Seems to be an excellent product....great value for the money...just right for my kitchen and looks great too.
1	1284854400	This toaster oven gets so hot to touch after making toast that it is incredibly unsafe and I have burned my hands several times. I am throwing it out and buying a different machine. Oh and if you want to toast one thing right after the other you can count on it burning!
1	1284854400	Received this product and looked close to the heat dials and realized some of the number (temps) were written in with a black marker. Then saw some small dings on the corners.  When I plugged it in to try it out, it did not work.  Returned it.
2	1284854400	We didn't even get to plug this oven in.  The bake rack was far too small for the surface.  When I called Black & Decker to see if they had included the wrong size, they assured me that it was the right one.  The stainless steel shelf that the bake rack rests on (or you would toast on) was mounted crooked in the unit.  And there were several scratches on the front surface.  We boxed it up and sent it back.
4	1284681600	Looks great, is compact in terms of counter space but big enough for the toast.
3	1284508800	I like the oven but in contrast with other Black and Decker ovens that I have used this is much bigger and came only with a small tray (not for 4 slices of bread, muffins..) and no rack for Broil etc., and it  I did not like either the timer!  To Toast it has a timer that is noisy and slow.  But it do the job and cooks nicely.
5	1284508800	I ordered this toaster oven based on all the customer reviews.  I am glad that I did.  It is a nice oven for the price.  It works well and doesn't take up too much space.
3	1284336000	I recently bought this toaster oven because the door on the one that I had, which was similar, was getting stuck and not opening as easily as it should.  I had considered whether I'd be better served by getting a toaster instead since there's controversy over which makes the best toast.  But the price on this toaster oven was very reasonable at Amazon and I'm particularly hooked when I find toaster ovens where the rack/shelf slides out when the door is opened.  This is a feature that to me is so essential and so few toaster ovens have it.  As it turns out, this toaster oven makes toast just fine, plus all of the other things that toaster ovens do that toasters don't.  So I'm glad that I opted again for a toaster oven, and glad that I found one that has that sliding-out feature, and glad that I didn't get swayed by all those fancy ones that cost $100+.  Maybe they really are better, but I'm perfectly happy with this one.  There is, however, one problem, which is pretty significant.  This new toaster oven, unlike the older one,  takes way too long to make toast.  It's got additional good features over the older one, which I think was also a B&D, but the toast-making is so slow that I'm not even sure I'd buy it again.  Unless of course I'm doing something wrong and haven't found the right way to correct this problem.  I also do like the fact that it's got a bell to tell you when it's done, but I could easily run around the block and come back home before the bell might ring.
1	1284336000	DO NOT BUY!!  This unit could have seriously burned my kitchen down this morning!!  Other users have said that the knob is "glitchy" and depending on how you set it, it could accidentally be set so the timer does not shut off the toaster.  This morning, I put toast in this unit and went upstairs to go get ready for the day.  Okay - they probably say to not leave unit unattended somewhere in the manual, but who really will sit there and watch bread being toasted in the morning??I turned the knob clockwise and since it usually toasts my bread quickly I turned it counterclockwise a bit to lessen the toasting time.  I don't know exactly where it malfunctioned, but while I was upstairs getting ready, I smelled smoke and came downstairs to find the entire downstairs engulfed in smoke!  The toaster oven's light was still blue - no ticking noise though so the timer went off, but DID NOT SHUT THE TOASTER OVEN OFF!  Luckily... no fire, but lots and lots of smoke.  I also did not have a working smoke detector in the kitchen so it could have been a really bad combination. I will NOT be replacing this unit!  DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER!
1	1284249600	The second time we used this toaster oven, the toast actually caught fire. While Black and Decker is usually a good name for moderately priced small appliances, this toaster is terrible.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.
5	1284163200	This toaster is awesome! It heats up so fast, in about 30 seconds. Also, the 3 dials make it easy to use. Honestly I wonder if they make any money off these because they last so long. I only buy Toast-R-Ovens, and they seem to last 10 or 20 years.Great toaster and great price and free shipping. What more could you ask for?
3	1284163200	I replaced a B&D toaster oven with a similar unit from B&D and found that the length of new unit's electrical cord is much shorter. Check out how much cord you'll need to reach your outlet before you order.
4	1284076800	My old toaster oven finally died after many years so I was looking for a new one. But I didn't want one of those giant, counter-hogging toaster ovens that are so common now. This one looked good. It's definitely bigger than my 10 year old one that just died, but it's not over sized. It cooks well, looks good, and seems well made, especially compared to some Hamilton-Beach models I looked at. So far I like it a lot. My only complaint is that it seems silly that you need to use all 3 dials just to toast or cook something. This seems unnecessarily complicated, but it certainly is only a minor complaint.
5	1283904000	UPDATE - I am really loving this toaster.  Very good toasting power and speed.  Looks really nice too.========================I've been extremely lucky and very happy with my purchases that I've gotten from Amazon WHEN THERE IS A SUDDEN PRICE DROP/SALE.I got this toaster for $19 and it arrived really fast with free Super Saver Shipping.Compared to my no-name cheap toaster oven that was on it's last leg, this is a GREAT TOASTER!I don't know about full retail ($35 or more), but if you catch it on sale, GO FOR IT.Great toaster for the price.
5	1283731200	its designed wonderful, its looks like at least a $80 oven. i just love it.
5	1283644800	LOOKS GREAT AND HAS MANY FUNCTIONS AND PRICE IS RIGHT,HIGHLY RECOMEND IT.Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven
5	1283644800	This is a great little oven. So far I've just used it for heating left-overs, but it does a much better job than microwaving. The food comes out just the same as it tasted originally.
5	1283472000	love it! Works better than any toaster oven I've ever had. The best thing is that deal amazon gave me was better than any other we site a i checked and way better than any brick and mortar store-incl! Walmart, Target , and Costco!
1	1283385600	This may be a fine toaster oven for the money. I won't know because I'm returning it after just one use (per the instructions, I set it to 350 degrees and let it heat for 15 minutes to burn off manufacturing oils prior to cooking). That was enough for me. The body of this toaster oven, especially the top, gets way too hot. So hot, in fact, that it heats up my kitchen more than my regular oven does. And frankly, I'm concerend about it being a fire hazard. There is, in fact, a warning printed across the top that reads CAUTION HOT SURFACE. This thing is obviously not insulated. Also, the ticking timer is annoying to the nth degree. Way too loud. Try watching TV or having a conversation with what sounds like a loud time bomb ticking away for 15 or 20 minutes. It can be clearly heard in the next room. Just a dumb, dumb design. I don't care if it cooks well or not. Back to Amazon it goes.
2	1283299200	The controls on this are pretty easy to use, but it doesn't have good insulation.  The top and back of the unit get hot enough to burn.  Because of this I would not use this toaster oven with children around.You also need lots of space around the toaster oven to ensure you don't heat up anything else by accident.
3	1283212800	Purchased to replace a much loved, older B&D toaster-oven that had lost its door handle and was beginning to look dingy. This newer model, while the price was right, the settings are more complicated that need be.  Plus I hate having to use a windup timer for toasting.  After over a month using it, I still under-cook - or burn - toasts, bagels, etc.  The oven part seems to be pretty accurate for temperature and the larger space is great.  Re construction: the internal groove where the slide-in tray fits is slightly off on one side which causes the tray to be misaligned. Hardly noticeable but there nevertheless.  Made in China!
5	1283212800	After trying other (more expensive) toaster ovens, I ordered this one. It's absolutely perfect. The toast now has the texture of toast instead of overly-baked bread. It's very easy to use and it's compact. I should know to stick with Black & Decker from this point on!
5	1283212800	This thing is great... i use it everyday.  No need to heat up the whole house when you are cooking for one.
3	1282953600	Overall good value for the price.  The timer knob is a bit tricky to set for shorter time intervals, so it can very challenging to make light or medium toast.  There are no settings for light toast for example, you just have to turn the timer knob and hope for the best.
5	1282953600	WORKS VERY WELL AND DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO; FUNCTION AS AN OVEN.  MY PREVIOUS TOASTER OVEN WAS AN OSTER AND THE TIMER KNOB CRUMBLED INTO POWDER. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE AND OSTER DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. I GOT BACK AN E-MAIL ON HOW THEY "CARE" ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS,,,,BUT THEY CANNOT HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM. THEY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT FURNISH A REPLACEMENT KNOB. GREAT ! ANYWAY,I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED BLACK AND DECKER AS THEY MAKE QUALITY PRODUCTS FOR FAIR PRICES AND THIS OVEN FITS RIGHT INTO THIS PHILOSOPHY---GOOD QUALITY, WORKS WELL AT A GREAT PRICE. ALSO, WHEN I LOOKED AT AMAZON TOASTER OVEN REVIEWS BY OTHER PURCHASERS OF ALL BRANDS OF TOASTER OVENS, THEY COMPLAIN THAT THEY "GET HOT". OF COURSE THEY DO !!!!!! TO MANUFACTURE FULLY INSULATED MODELS WOULD PRICE THEM OUT OF THE MARKET--COMMON SENSE ! I RECOMMEND THE BLACK AND DECKER HIGHLY AND AMAZON WILL GET IT TO YOU FAST LIKE THEY DID FOR ME !
4	1282867200	Bought this to replace a conventional toaster, and found it to be a good upgrade.  It gives us a lot more flexibility and we don't use our full size oven as much anymore.  The only drawback is the timer, which makes it difficult to estimate accurately.
5	1282780800	This toaster doesn't have a very sturdy build, but it is very sharp looking and gets the job done.  For the money I don't know what else you could ask for.
5	1282780800	This little oven performs well while looking quite stylish. I have owned it about 4 months now and I use it a few times a week - I'm always happy with the results. If you can get good results from using a full size oven, then you should have no problem re-crisping slices of pizza, making great tater-tots, browning buns, warming pastries, heating frozen foods - all without the long preheating time and room heat that comes with using a full size oven for such small tasks. It doesn't replace a full size oven, and you shouldn't expect it to, but all in all it is an excellent addition to the kitchen for a very reasonable price.Remember that you'll receive the best results by following some of the same rules you would use with a standard oven: check your item periodically as it cooks and make necessary adjustments to temperature and cooking time, and be weary of food package instructions, sometimes they are correct, but sometimes they were written for a very different oven than the one you own.The instructions indicate that you should run the toaster oven prior to actual use to burn off manufacturing oils - this does create unpleasant odors that can be strong in a poorly ventilated area. I ended up setting mine on a table in the living room next to a large open window for this task, as my kitchen does not have a window. After repeating this cycle 2-3 times and then allowing it to air out, the oven was ready for use, and my patience was greatly rewarded.
1	1282694400	We have owned a Black & Decker toaster oven before & had super results! The one we had was their economy model& we loved it! Actually we wore it out,over several years based upon experience we purchased the same unit. Sorry to say the replacement unit although similar in appearance did not operate at all similar to the unit it replaced.The controls are complicated to use & the unit itself was not up to the Black & Decker standards we were used to. We made up our minds to Make Do & had it not been that the unit started a fire on the counter of our kitchen we would probably still have it.amazon is super & we returned the unit to them immediately after the mishap!
1	1282694400	If you like your toast really, really dark then this is the product for you. We've had it for a few months and the timer works most of the time but if you walk away or get distracted, this lovely unit will BURN YOUR TOAST. It's impossible to create a reliable setting and more often the clicking stops while the burners keep on burning. It does work. I just doesn't stop at the right time.On the other hand, in this busy, rush-rush world maybe you need to learn to slow down and watch bread turn the perfect shade of brown instead of relying on newfangled inventions like timers and such. If that's the case, this baby is for you.Wish I could return it but time has expired. Huh, sounds familiar. Will likely end up in the local landfill before the end of the year. If you're still not convinced to consider other alternatives, I strongly recommend  purchasing the warranty, it will give you peace of mind.
5	1282694400	This B and D toaster works great and has many uses.It requires not much counter space and yet you can cookquite many dishes with it.  B & D products are durable.  I hope this one will be too.
4	1282608000	Pretty good so far, no complaints. The oven works well and seems to do the job. Not much more I can say...
4	1282608000	It works great as an oven, but you have to make sure the settings are just right to make a piece of toast. Overall I think it just takes some getting used to.
5	1282521600	This toaster oven works much better than the previous lower end white models and has a crumb tray which is very useful as well. Color and style is also much improved from the bland putty. Toast is done in 1/3 the time. Have now purchased an additional unit for summer home.
3	1282089600	Product looks nice.  I prefer the type with only 2 knobs and a dedicated toaster function.  This one combines all functions with several possible settings.  A bit confusing, and toasting is hard to do exactly right.Because there are two levels for the wire insert, the baking tray has to be made for the smaller of the two.  The baking tray is smaller than the space available on the lower level, limiting the size of what can be baked.  Not my favorite design, but after researching all the competitors, I still think this one is the best for the price.
4	1282089600	My wife and I received an ancestor to this toaster oven from our wedding registry back in 2002. It replaced an even older version that I inherited from my brother-in-law that he had in college from 1985. Both worked beautifully and are still probably making perfect toast in someone else's home. We had to get rid of our toaster oven last year when we began keeping kosher. We absolutely hated getting rid of it. I have been looking for a replacement ever since. The reason I didn't give the new one 5 stars is due to the mechanical timer. The model we got in 2002 had a button you pressed in to start the oven for both toast and baking. When toasting, you set the dial for the level of toasting you wanted, press the button and it stopped when it was done. Once you got it to make perfect toast, you never had to move the dial, you just pop the toast in and press the button. Now we can't find this style on ANY toaster oven by any manufacturer. If someone knows why please tell me! With the new one, they reverted to the older style with the mechanical timer and old fashioned ding. It is really hard in the mornings to get the timer to the same spot every time to make perfect toast. Otherwise its a great toaster oven.
5	1282003200	Very good toaster oven. It does everything I wanted and is easy to clean up. It is so much nicer to just heat up this little oven. Saves energy and doesn't heat up the kitchen.
1	1281916800	has anyone measured the amount of space between the rack on the bottom track and the top inside?  How much clearance is there?  thanks.
2	1281571200	Ok, this works fine thus 2 stars.Why it lost the rest of the stars...It's a pain.  The rack doesn't go back into the oven easy which I can live with...what bothers me is why they have to reengineer something to make it more complicated.If you want to toast, you have to turn 3 knobs.  Yes!  Before I set it and just press a button for toast and it always worked perfectly.  NOW!! You get to guess how much time you need.  And a guess wrong is a burnt toast or toast not done.  If you want to switch over to something for an oven, you have to switch 3 knobs AGAIN.  It's insane, who approved this?  They should be fired, B&D; should not be proud of this item or the crew who came up with this.Compare the older model from 10 years ago.  2 knobs and a switch for toast.  One knob worked the oven temperature when you needed to bake something all you had to do was turn it off when you were done.  The other knob set how you wanted your toast.  It never had to be touched again!  Flip the switch and you start the toast.  Simple and nice through and through.  Don't mess with perfection.Now for the cherry on top, everything is set through a timer which ticks loudly and nonstop through what ever you are doing.Frankly, the whole design stinks, B&D; - go back to the drawing board and get someone to make a simple efficient design.  Skip new if it's not better!
2	1281225600	problem with the door. not properly alligned. returned to shop wise for a refund
3	1281225600	Seems OK for basic toaster oven functions. It is not very big, but thats good if you have limited counter-space. It looks nice. The door has hooks to pull out the shelf a little bit when you open it, I thought that was nice. Only word of warning I could think of is that the power cord is VERY short. It is about 2 feet maximum, maybe less. Plan on putting it very close to an outlet unless you use a power strip. It has a grounded 3 prong plug so do not use a cheap un-grounded extension cord.
5	1281139200	This a great little toaster. I've had it for a couple of months and it has performed very well for my purposes. It toasts evenly and quickly. Today, I baked a little cake in it and it performed very well. My cake browned evenly. So, for what it is I have no complaints. I love the timer function since I have the tendency to sometimes forget things in the oven.
5	1280966400	In a nutshell, this little oven does it all. Compact, easy to use, made by a trusted company and you cant beat the price. Buy with confidence.
5	1280966400	I use it to toast and heat small frozen foods.  It works like advertised. Toast comes out as set.  Foods cook correctly when the tempature is set to the directions on the box.
2	1280880000	I wanted a toaster oven that could fit a personal pizza, which is bigger than the one I already had. I bought this because the price was nice for it's size.  As a toaster, this Black & Decker is a FIRE HAZARD!!  If you or someone else in the home doesn't read the FINE PRINT underneath the BLUE LED, the oven will NOT shut off. Then whatever you're toasting will burn and can catch fire.  I think it's a poor design, as a toaster, if you have to write in fine print "rotate knob past 10, then set to desired time". Desired time being lower than 10 minutes.  I didn't have to do that for my smaller toaster oven. (Before the number 10 on this toaster, you will see 3 little pictured settings of light toast, bagel toast, and dark toast.  Better hope you wake up before those who are forgetful, or house guest who can't read fine print without their glasses.)On the other hand, if you have to bake something in this toaster oven, more than 10 minutes, no worries, this little oven gets hot enough.
4	1280880000	Although I only purchased this toaster oven less than one month, but I found it is easy to use and easy to clean. The only thing I feel is the oven size a little too small for baking. Overall, I like it.
5	1280620800	I have owned toaster ovens for years and never have had the toast results I was looking for.  Now I do!!!!This toaster is a great buy and I purchased them for my two adult children too.  They are just as satisfied.
2	1280361600	As a basic toaster over, it's barely adequate. The good and the bad from my experience using it:Good- It gets hot and heats things up- Fairly easy to use - no computer programming degree requiredNot Good- Basic toasting is very slow and uneven - one side gets done, the other doesn't. Takes twice as long to toast as an actual dedicated toaster (or my previous toaster oven).- The power light on my unit was dead on arrival, and has not lit once.- The timer ticks. And ticks. And ticks. Make it stop.- You have to turn the timer dial past 10 minutes and turn it back down to the time you want (if it's less than 10 min.) They keep stressing how important this is. Will it self-destruct if I don't? Will it injure my dog? How hard is it to design a timer that doesn't need you to do this?- If you turn the timer off yourself by manually turning it to Off, it's very easy to accidentally turn it too far, which puts it in the ALWAYS ON position. I did this once and found it still on 20 minutes later. Now I'm paranoid and very careful about it.- Cheaply made of lightweight metal, not all straight.- Cooking tray warps when it gets hot (my previous toaster oven did not have this problem).Probably going to get a new model/brand and give this one to some unsuspecting unpleasant relative.
1	1280275200	I've had B&D toaster ovens for more years than I can remember and they have always been fine.  This is a complete waste of money and space.  It takes about 10 minutes to make a piece of toast.  It's hard to open the door without pulling the whole appliance off of the counter.  It ticks like a time bomb.  I wish I had one good thing to say about this item, but I can't think of a single one!
2	1280275200	It is an average toaster.  It looks nice with the stainless steel but function not as well as my older toaster.  First, the toaster will burn if you don't watch it.  Second, you have to twist the dial pass ten and then back to toast your bread.  That's too much.  Why can't you set it to toast?  I called customer service because I though that my machine was broken.  Well, that's not the case.  It is just the way the toaster is made.  If I knew this, I would have never bought it.As for the 2- year warranty, it is useless because there is no repair centers anymore.  Before, if I had a problem with any of their products, I could get item fixed or replacement right there.  Instead they want you to call them, cut the plug and set it back to them. The best part is that will cost you $X.XX as administrative fee to process your request.After this experience, I will never purchase any black and decker products.  Not worth the hassle or the price.  Not a value for the money.  Sad...it is an end of wonderful era. RIP.
4	1280188800	Compact, but plenty of room to do the basic tasks you buy a toaster oven to do. Looks great on the counter top next to my other stainless steel appliances. One thing I read that was untrue in some of these listings was that "it didn't have a bell" on the timer, which it does. Important if you are a multi-tasker and can't sit and watch your items. I'll update my review if I run into any problems, but pretty happy with the purchase and it could be a 5 star. Delivery was much faster then expected.
5	1279843200	I bought this after a less expensive toaster oven died.  I've used it many times and love it.  Knobs are easy to see and use; both toaster and heating functions work well.
3	1279497600	This toaster has its own character, all the functions are OK, just a matter of getting used to it. It is taller than my previous toaster but my old toaster has more space inside. That is my only complain, otherwise loving it! Amazon should put size inside and out, I was going to return it but it is a hassle, for the price that I paid for, it is better keeping it than trying other brands/models which might give me more problem.
1	1279497600	I was very dissapointed after reading the reviews for this toaster.  It is really small and not made well at all.The door wouldn't close all the way so we sent it back for a refund.  Not worth the money.
5	1279411200	A great product. We are very happy with its performance. Black and Decker always makes quality products.
1	1279411200	Works okay, looks good but to make toast, the simplest of tasks requires guesswork each time. You use a dial and have to reset it each time and there are some vague settings- you have to guess and sometimes its burnt, sometimes underdone and rarely toast. If you want to make toast with this its frustrating and a gamble each time. Something you don't want as you get ready for work in the morning. This is 100% DO NOT BUY!!!Bad design, stupid functional design. I got a used toaster at a local thrift store that I now use for frozen waffles and toast, what I wanted this oven for.
5	1279152000	Nice, simple, affordable toaster oven.  Looks good, easy to use. I like that the crumb tray slides out for easy cleaning.
1	1279152000	I bought this to replace an older Black and Decker toaster oven.Pros. Size is perfect for what I was looking for, not too big, especially if you it mainly use it for toasting sliced bread, waffles, bagels etc. also a good looking toaster.Cons. The glass door sometimes pulls the grill out too much that it gets stuck when you close it, so you have to push the grill back in place to be able to close the door. the darkness setting for toasting is hard to replicate because you have to turn the knob to set a timer to toast every time and as you know even 5 seconds make a big difference when you get to the last seconds when toasting, so I cant even leave this thing on its own. the black and Decker that I used to have had a knob to set the darkness and you can leave it to that setting forever and had a lever you push down for toast, so the time for toasting never changes and it worked great.I would not recommend this product to a friend, I will be replacing this soon, do your self a favor and get a digital one.
4	1278806400	So many people recommended this toaster over I had to try it for myself.  I bought the smaller model as I have a small kitchen, however now I wish I bought the bigger version so I can cook a pizza in it. I've backed, broiled and toasted and it all has come out well.  You definitely need to preheat the oven for baking or broiling.  Overall I'm very happy with my toaster oven.  The only thing is the oven does get really hot outside so it needs space around it.
5	1278806400	Very stylish for my modern kitchen. Works great - just make sure you read the directions and set the dials correctly. I like my bagels toasted on both sides, so I set the middle dial to toast, not bagel, which will toast only the top. I also love the easy pull out crumb tray. I'm totally satisfied!
1	1278720000	I have had 2 Black & Decker toaster ovens over the last 24 years.  Both worked perfectly for toast and baking, with simple, easy to use controls.This model will not make toast without burning the outer edges a lot.  I tried all the settings.  The controls are confusing.  When turning the timer off, it is very easy to accidentally set the the oven to permanently on - a fire hazard!  So disappointed that I did not give the bake feature a test.Returned it and bought a Sunbeam toaster (TSSBTR2SBK) instead.  It was inexpensive and works perfectly on the first time down.  Will just use the big oven for baking.
4	1278633600	I received this faster than expected and it works wonderfully. Only two things I can say could be improved are:1. Too many dials. There used to be a function dial and a temperature dial. Now there is a third one that is a timer. I guess so you don't walk off and forget you turned it on, but it requires that you turn the dial past 10 minutes, then back to where you want it. For instance, to toast a bagel which is the primary use of mine.2. It seems to take twice as long to toast a bagel than the older "top-brown" feature did.But it does toast evenly and I have had no problems with it.
4	1278201600	We had to replace our old (18 yrs old) toaster oven with a new one and we picked the Black and Decker, stainless steel model.  The cost was comparable to the price of old and the function is very straight forward.  It operates very easily and the results are very good with various foods.  We would recommend this item whole heartedly.
5	1277942400	This is the first toaster oven I have purchased and I absolutely love it. I use it daily to make my meals that would normally be made in a microwave. Its features are perfect for quick usage and it makes personal pizza's and flatbreads very well.A microwave makes pizza/flatbread soggy and limp but this toaster oven makes them crispy while still soft but crunchy. I use this thing for everthing I can use it for. I dislike using a normal oven or microwave as the oven takes too long and doesn't prepare food well and the microwave makes food seem strange.This toaster oven has made my meals a more enjoyable thing, this may not be some top of the line industrial toaster oven with many options and features but it is perfect for sitting on your counter and using it once or twice a day, or even for toast in the morning if thats your thing (I moved our old four slot toaster off to a corner to replace it with this).Its functions are solid, I have only used bake and toast so far but toast seems to do the best job for what I eat. It feels like having a mini bistro or melted sandwich oven right on your counter!Its timer is perfect for making sure you don't burn your food, or your house down. It seems to do 10-15 minutes very quickly and makes the food well.Its an advantage compared to the microwave in that you can put your food in it and go sit back at your PC and continue working while its prepared and suddenly its ready to eat AND enjoyable - mmmm - Tastey;Where as with microwaves you have to stop what you're doing and go stand at it for 3 minutes ..only to get half prepared limp food...eww microwaves.For the price this gets the best performance ratio that I could find on amazon. Not too cheap or too expensive, also a very nice finish.For those who want it to turn off if you open it, that doesn't make sense its nice that it stays on because you're cooking your food, plus that kind of feature is reserved for more expensive hardware as it takes a large switch on the circuits to turn off the ovens while the door is open.This is a good purchase for anyone looking for a tastey quick meal thats better than a microwave - and cheaper!
5	1277942400	I've only had this appliance for a few weeks, but so far so good. It is fast, has a great bagel setting, and cleans up easily. All that and it looks great in my kitchen.Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a simple, inexpensive toaster oven.
3	1277942400	This is an example of another appliance meant for our throw-away society -- this is the biggest disappointment.  The toaster we found to be a good overall fit in many ways others have written about however, within 5 years, the two top elements burned out and there's no good way to access them and replace them.  The feature of using it as an oven or for top browning is lost and I fear it's landfill bound for reasons that should be easy to fix.  We bought this not only because it was one of the more sturdy ones on the market, we'd had another B&D toaster that worked for 15 years before we gave it to a student and bought a fresh one for ourselves.  Seems the newer models aren't meant to last -- a very sad and frightening trend.
4	1277856000	We bought this toaster oven as a replacement for a similar one we'd had for years.  I was very happy with the price and speed of delivery, however it was much smaller than I had anticipated, which is a good and a bad thing.  It's good because it takes up way less counter space than our previous Black and Decker toaster oven and the stainless steel and black is very contemporary and cool looking.  The only drawback though is if you plan on using it as an oven to cook in, it really doesn't have enough room to cook much. Also, one time, the timer got stuck while it was toasting and didn't shut off, burning my pop tarts until they started smoking! But that has only happened once and could've been a fluke. Overall though, it was a good buy & I'm happy with it.
4	1277856000	Overall, I am happy with this toaster. It's small and gets the job done. However compared to my old toaster, this does take a while to heat up.
4	1277683200	Purchased this toaster in April 2010 after I dropped my old Black & Decker.  For the most part, the toaster works really well, but here are a couple of things I don't like so much.... There is no toast-is-done "ding" or even a doneness setting, so you have to keep watch and turn the toaster off when the toast gets to your desired done-ness, or it will keep cooking.  Toasting takes a really long time, and by the time it's at the right toast-ness, it's really crunchy.  I've started turning on the toast function well before I actually put the bread in (so it will be in there less time), but it's only helped a little bit.The toaster is big, has a handy pull-out crumb tray, and cooks pretty evenly.  Good for the price (~ $30).
5	1277596800	At last a toaster oven than toasts well! Whether white or brown bread, bagels or muffins, they all come out perfectly. Just make sure to set controls correctly. Use the "Bagel" setting also for muffins. We have also used the oven for warming up previously cooked dishes, without burning anything.The outside surfaces do become very hot, so do not touch.
1	1277596800	This toaster oven has a major design flaw. The timer/toast switch does not function as it supposed to. The toast either gets burnt or does not toast at all. Sometimes it catches fire because it does not have a way for the timer to time itself out.
3	1277424000	It does toast really well which was the main reason for this purchase.  But it gives off so much eat that we feel we must watch it closely when in use.  The top gets very hot.It is a little smaller than what we thought (which is a great reason for paying attention to the product descriptions).  We can toast only a top and a bottom of a jumbo hamburger bun, in other words, only for 1 person at a time.
1	1277164800	Our last B&D; toaster oven lasted about 15 years. This lasted about 3 days before the oven door failed. It now does not close. Also, no one else has mentioned the annoying ticking while toasting.Having had faith in the brand, I threw away the packaging. Now I have to see if there's any way to return this piece of junk.
2	1277164800	Black & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oveni had expected a large enough tray for more roast potatoes. etc. the tray is 1/3 the size or the grid,making it useless for my intended use.  after several calls requesting why this is--they they said they would call back after checking in why this is--they never did.  this was a month ago.  this toaster is no improvment to what i have--a wASTE.
3	1276992000	I needed to adjust the front face of the toaster. The front needed to be unscrewed and realined to have the door open properly. This is something that should have been fixed before it was put in the shipping box. Poor quality control. The door needs to be engineered better for easy opening. The door does not open easily every time. Thank you allowing me to write a review.  Thank you, George Oku
5	1276560000	I recently purchased this toaster oven and I am so happy with it!  Not only is it great looking, it's well built, and very functional for my needs.  What a great price as well!  I would expect to see this for a lot more $!  Highly recommend!*Update:  Love this toaster oven...it's is SO easy to clean......the slide out crumb tray is the BEST!  I toast, bake, and use this oven every day, and it always looks new!  Just slide out the crumb tray and wipe it off and windex the glass and you're good as new!  Definitely recommend!!** Update:  It's now July 2012!  The toaster oven is still working like new!! I use it constantly to bake, broil, toast, and warm things up!  I love it and would defintely buy another if it ever quits working!!
5	1276473600	This is an excellent toaster for the price! Recently, our $100 Delonghi toaster went kaput. So, we wanted to replace it with something that was equally sleek looking and practical for our everyday needs (bonus: the B&D toaster takes up less counter space), but without the hefty price tag. We're happy with the purchase! I'm hoping it lasts much longer than the 3 short years of our old Delonghi.
4	1276473600	My old black and decker toaster couldn't handle back to back toasting but this one can! I love the consistent level of quality.
4	1276387200	So far, so good.  It works for me and I like it.  I've been wanting a toaster oven for a long time and think I made the right choice.  It makes excellent toast and I cooked fish in it and liked that too.  It takes a little time to figure how to set the dials.  If you follow the directions, all it well.  It is nice not to have to fire up the oven or broiled to cook something small and quick.The thing I like best about it is that it is easy to clean.Good product!
5	1276387200	I live alone and cook in only small amounts, so this is perfect for me.  Besides my microwave, its my main source of cooking.  It serves me quite well and I have no negative comments about it.  For the price, it is terrific, in my opinion.
5	1276214400	I love this little toaster oven. It is not as large as described, I measure it at 10x16x8ish.But, this works for me, as I was concerned that it would be tight in a small space.The price was good, and the shipping was free, so all a very good deal for me.The B&D; I replaced was 20 years old, and the casing heavier, so the outside didn'tget as hot. But, the upgrade in the pull out crumb tray is a terrific improvementfrom the old drop down style. The dials work well, and it is a good looking unit.Glad I got it!
5	1276128000	I purchased this for my daughter a house warming.  She loved it!!  AND she is one of the pickiest people I know.
4	1275696000	Good size not to big you can bake, toast, and broil. Easy to use and it bakes really well. Overall it performs well and it's truly  reliable.
4	1275696000	I purchased this for my Mom.  She is elderly and does not have to cook much nor ever turn on her oven.  I thought this would be a good idea and it was.  She absolutely loves it!  No complaints - great for the cost.
5	1275609600	I was looking for a replacement for our old Black & Decker toaster oven that finally died after 5 years of constant use. I really liked that toaster even though it had a few flaws. This toaster oven is slightly larger but looks great and has some really nice features, I love It! Also we got the best price with free shipping through Amazon. What more can you ask for.
4	1275436800	Works fine and looks good, especially for 36 bucks delivered! A small ding on the  front left top corner was obscured by tape used to hold the door in place during shipping. Too minor to go to the trouble of returning. My daughter has a more expensive Black and Decker convection model and it doesn't work any differently than mine.JDP
4	1275436800	Very happy with this Mother's Day gift.  For the price you can't beat this product.
5	1275264000	All I know is that my wife loves theToast-R-Oven and she is really hard to please.  congratulations!
5	1275177600	I got this as a gift for my 82 year old Mom, who prefers her electronics without too many bells and whistles. She loves it, and reports that it makes perfect toast. For the price, I think it's a great deal, and will probably end up getting one for myself.
5	1275177600	Oven works great. We hadn't replaced our last toaster oven when it wore out a few years ago, so it's nice to have one again. It's so convenient for heating up leftovers; my husband loves to make his "cheese toast" in it.
4	1275091200	This Blacke & Decker toaster oven works well forwhat we use it for. Namely to toast bresd, bagles and muffens. The settings and timing are perfect. However, when the grill surfaces get hot after toasting it does not go back into the oven when the door is closed. We have to push it in wihe the edge of a spoon or knife. When cooled it is easy to close.
1	1275004800	This toaster oven uses a timer to control its operation. if you notice your toast is the way you want it and open the door it continues to operate. Black and Decker are not the only manufactures that use a timer.  I returned this toaster oven and upgraded to a digital one.

1	1274918400	I've had this toaster oven for almost three months and twice, bread has spontaneously caught fire inside the oven while on the toasting cycle.  One time I figured was a fluke, but now that it's happened twice I consider it a fire hazard and not safe to use.  If you buy this, be careful and don't leave it unattended!
5	1274832000	Really an exceptional oven for the money, as advertised does everything it claims to do. More than satisfied.
3	1274745600	Dial slections are hard to see, it tips easily when you open the toaster door, setting the timer for it to turn off is a clumsy process, timer dial is hard to turn and feels like you're going to break it, not clear where to put the grating when broiling etc.On the positive side; seems to toast and broil ok and the price was right.
5	1274659200	This toaster oven answers my needs to a T.  It's been a long time since I had one I was as satisfied with as this one.  Not only has it worked well so far, it is very easy to clean and looks great.
2	1274572800	Don't buy this if you are looking for one to match your other black appliances. I am very disappointed that it is CHARCOAL GREY rather than black. My old toaster oven was not broken, I just wanted one to match my newly renovated kitchen :-(
3	1274572800	We ended up returning this because we didn't like two features.  The crumb drawer was so narrow that the crumbs were scraped off and into the oven as you opened it.  The toaster feature doesn't have a preset ability.  One must guess each time where to set the dial for the doneness desired.  We wanted a button to push to start toasting, with a dial beside it we could adjust once for perfect toast.  The dial also clicks as it runs, like an old egg timer.  We found this slightly annoying.Have added a star to this review because, having now lived with the toaster for some time (we never did get around to returning it), we feel it works well and have adjusted to the features we didn't like at first.  Still not ideal, but worth another star.
5	1274486400	Thanks to all the other Reviewers.  I read about a number of toaster ovens including much fancier devices selling for more than $200.  Reviews and comments are what helped me make the decision to buy this B&D; model.  I wanted something good for toast and bagels and re-heating leftovers.  We have a modest size kitchen so I preferred something on the smaller size.  We use our microwave more than the toaster oven, but this toaster oven works very well for what it does.  It is pretty simple, looks like it should last.Have been using it about 1 month.  It makes much better toast (more evenly toasted over whole piece of bread) and toasted bagels than our pop-up toaster.  One negative is that the bottom of the toast has rack marks and can burn a bit on the corner.  If you really want perfect toast, flip it over part way through.  I have not timed it, but seems to take just a bit longer than our old pop-up toaster.  Pop-up toaster is in the bag of donations for Goodwill.Great for tuna melts.  Great for re-heating pizza.  I'm very happy with the look and use, and amazed at the low price.
4	1274313600	I bought this toaster oven because it had pretty good reviews. Most said "Good basic toaster oven for the price", and that is certainly true. It toasts, bakes and broils...and that is it! If you just want a basic model toaster oven without all of the extras, and for not a lot of money, buy this one.But, if you aren't a patient person, do not buy this toaster oven because it really seems to take a while to toast. The dial where you have to turn it to the right and then to to the left for your desired setting also takes a while to get used to, but once I had it figured out it makes a perfect piece of toast.
2	1274227200	I bought this to replace a 20 year old Toastmaster. I really miss my old toaster. This one looks a bit fancier, but I know I will never use most of the various settings available. The timer is a terrible feature. The knob is hard to turn, and you need to turn it past 10 minutes and then back to the desired "toast color" setting. The lighter color toast setting is barely beyond the off position, so you have to stand there and observe the toast if you don't want to incinerate it. This morning I tried to heat up frozen waffles, and I blackened the first batch when I stepped out of the kitchen for a minute. I guess I'll have to see if I can play with the overly complicated settings to reduce the heating element temperature.
5	1274140800	This toaster oven is nice, sleek and fits the purpose for my kitchen.  My daughter is a toaster oven cooker (so am I) and we both enjoy all the wonderful features this one offers!We have used it nearly every day since we got it and enjoy it just as much today as we did when we first received it.I would order other Black & Decker products if this is the results of such a buy!
1	1273881600	Probably a good toaster oven but broiling on the toaster rack allowing the drippings to go into a pan precariously perched on the center heat bar is not very practical and will lead to a dirty rack and oven in no time. My old Toastmaster did a great job of broiling and came with a separate broiling pan. This oven is boxed up and going back.
4	1273795200	I am very happy with the Black and Decker Toaster Oven.  It comes in handy, and does a nice job on bagles, toast, and specialty breads.
5	1273622400	Our previous Black and Decker toaster oven died after only two to three years.  But we decided to give B&D one more chance.  We were a little skeptical when we saw the low price of thirty bucks for this one, but we figured we didn't have much to lose, so we ordered it.  It is a great little oven. It toasts quicker than the other one that cost quite a bit more as I recall, and it appears to be full-featured.  I don't know about the longevity on this one, but at this early stage I recommend it without hesitation.
5	1273622400	I decided to get this oven after looking at a few others mainly because the price was right and it was a brand I know. I have only used this oven before so cannot comment on this one compared to any other oven. I will say that I can't believe that I had gone so long without it, I has gotten a ton of use since it arrived. It's nice to not have to waste time and electricity by using the normal oven for small things like personal pizzas and pot pies. Works especially well for reheating leftovers like lasagna. The absolute only gripe I have is that the timer only goes to 30 minutes. But that is easily fixed with the stay on feature and another timer, and if you are like me you have probably ten different timers in your kitchen. In the end as you may have guessed I am very pleased with this product. Everything went right with this purchase, fast shipping, good packaging, and great price for a great oven means you can't go wrong.
4	1273536000	PROS: We like the solid nature of this product. Similar ovens we investigated seemed flimsy in comparison. So far it has met our expectations for ability to toast and bake. It's a perfect size for our limited counter space, yet it will accommodate larger pan sizes. The crumb tray is user friendly.CONS: Wish other colors were available. The cord length is somewhat limited.Overall, we are satisfied with this product and it's performance and think it's a good value for the price.
4	1273363200	Having had several toaster ovens in the past I usually expect an appliance that can get the job done and that's about all. This toaster oven also looks sharp and adds to the look of my kitchen while being functunal at the same time. The timer is a nice safety feature that I appreciate more than anything else about my new appliance.
4	1272931200	Our old Black & Decker space saver toaster oven finally quit working and we didn't feel like spending a lot of money on a new one. This does a terrific job for the money at toasting, broiling, baking. We make all kinds of things in our toaster oven and this is roomier than our old one. The crumb tray slides out for easy cleaning. The only complaint we've noted other have also mentioned, the rack slides out when you open the door, but doesn't slide in well when you close it. It's a minor annoyance for an otherwise great kitchen appliance.
5	1272758400	I boubht this for my sister and she is very well pleased with it. It does a very good job in all that she tried.
5	1272672000	First of all, any time you buy a Black & Decker product, you made the right choice.I purchased this one from Amazon because it was exactly the color scheme I wanted and the price was perfect.I use it every day and just know it will last for years.If you want a new one, this is the one to get.LindaQuincy, MA
2	1272412800	I upgraded to this from an older toaster oven thinking that the timer would ensure that I don't leave the oven on. In fact, this timer won't wind down to zero and shut it off if you don't turn it past 10 minutes. Also, if you open the oven door, it still stays on.  Add to this, there are too many knob settings that have to be selected (redundantly) just for making a toast. If you are toasting and the timer doesn't work, you will have a fire!They need to revise the logic of operation.
5	1272412800	It is perfect what I need it for.  It is small enough so you can keep it on the counter but it also is small enough that I can put it away. It is perfect for heating items up...chicken nuggets, fish sticks...items that really do not need a large oven.Looks great too!!!!
4	1272326400	I'm more than a bit OCD about purchasing things, so I can assure you that I did my research. This toaster won out, and I am very happy with the purchase. It toasts very quickly, bakes accurately, and broils like a champ. Doesn't look or feel cheap. Stop wasting your time shopping for a toaster (or writing a review about one). Just buy this one.
5	1272153600	Our old B & D toaster oven crapped out on us after 5 years of high use.This new toaster oven works just as good, but has a few very useful improvements.  The crumb tray pulls out like a toaster crumb tray.  Our old one had a hinged tray.  This improvement makes it very easy to keep clean.This oven has a timer.  I first thought this would be useless, but I use it every time now.  There are times that I have over cooked items, but this helps remind me I have food in the oven.  Also, the warmer function is great.  Keeps the buns and food warm.Get this oven, it works great.  Toaster ovens rock.  We do not have a microwave since this oven heats food up fast and keeps it tasty.
4	1272067200	We have owned a toaster oven for about 40 years.  Our old one started emitting smoke from a switch, and it was looking very 'crusty' after many years of service, so we replaced it.  After looking at reviews at Amazon and elsewhere, we weren't sure we should get another toaster over - most were either more money than we wanted to spend, or had very iffy performance records.  This model was the exception - had decent reviews and was relatively inexpensive.  We have been using it for about a month so far and are mostly pleased.  One feature we like is that the toasting shelf automatically pulls forward when the door opens, making access to the toast easier.A disclaimer is in order, though . . . we use ours almost exclusively for toast.  We seldom use it as an oven, and did not want a convection model.  For toasting, it works fine, though we preferred the previous one with its little switch for toast.  All it required was setting one switch to darkness level, then push the lever down.  It clicked off when toast was done.  Worked great . . . until the switch started to smoke.  This new model requires turning a knob past 10, then back to the desired toasting darkness level, which is not easy to get exact.  But we are learning and are over-all satisfied with our purchase.  Just hope it last as long as previous models.
1	1272067200	I bought this Toast-R-Oven based on the positive reviews as I really wanted a simple toaster oven to replace the old B&D Toast-R-Oven that I had for over 10yrs.  This one seemed to fit the bill although I was dismayed to see how much countertop space it took up compared to my previous one (space around the knobs seems wasted).  The oven seemed to work fine for toasting except that the timer was a bit glitchy ("too easy" to set the timer for too long).  After only 3 weeks of use, a Thomas (R) Thin Bagel burst into flames and charred into a carbon disk.  We're talking flames that got me to get the fire extinguisher ready in case the fire spread upon opening the oven door.  The oven is unusable (smoke damaged & burnt-out).  I don't know if the timer or the heating element was defective. I will not be exchanging for a new one.
5	1271980800	We had the toaster oven for more than two months and it's great!!!! It heats up quickly and toasts wellWe are very happy with it
4	1271980800	This item allows me to make toasted tomato and cheese sandwichs on large pieces of bread.Very pleased, not overly complicated with assist not needed.
4	1271894400	We like it very much.  We're still learning the exact settings for toasting (even when we're off, it's not too bad, although you have to let it cool off some before doing a second toasting job.)  It takes up much less space on the counter.  We're glad we got it.
3	1271808000	We really wanted a bread toaster with occasional capability for small pizzas or horizontal toasting. Toast takes too long.  It would be a better design if the timer was digital (like a microwave) and the confusing extra setting dial was eliminated.  Really only need time and temp setting with option to stop heat with one click.  The toaster was nice looking otherwise.  At the end of the day, we returned and went back to a regular pop up toaster.
2	1271721600	This is our third Black and Decker toaster oven in 15 years of marriage. The last two were wonderful, easily our most used appliance. We use it for toast or waffles nearly every morning, and snacks, deserts, fries, and other foods at lunch and dinner. This one  however has changed to the same 3 dial format used on all the other made in China trash. The result is that it heats up more slowly, cooks unevenly, and takes longer to prepare foods. We've had it 2 months and at least 40% of the time food is overcooked or undercooked. We haven't  found anything that works like the old ones we had, so have been unable to replace it. We are seriously considering buying a toaster so we can at least make toast without burning it or drying it out.  If you just need something to keep bacon warm between batches it might be fine, but if you are looking for something easy to use, energy efficient, or for effective baking, look for an older model, used if necessary.
1	1271635200	I had a black and decker toaster oven that was ok but broke in 1 year. I looked at all the toasters and thought this was just the right size and maybe I should give black and decker a second chance. The knob for the timer broke after 40 days! I will never buy a black and decker again.
4	1271462400	We just got this toaster oven and so far it seems decent.  The only real complaint I have is that I wish it were a little taller so that you could realistically cook more stuff in oven mode (I think it will fit a baked potato, but probably not much higher than that).  I like that it doesn't have an overly large footprint (i.e. it's not too wide), but I just wish it were taller -- most people could easily spare the room under the cabinet, especially since it's not like you can store anything on top of the toaster oven since it gets so hot.  Our old DeLonghi had a similar footprint but was a couple of inches taller, which I liked.The only other small complaint I have is that it arrived and already some of the baking controls were faded, I wonder how long it will be before they're rubbed right off.Otherwise it seems good -- decent looking, good job toasting so far, easy to remove/clean crumb tray.I was happy to find a replacement toaster oven that was reasonably priced (got ours on Amazon for $29.99).  When you read reviews of even very expensive toaster ovens people have complaints about the durability and the ovens breaking, so personally I'd just rather get a basic, cheap model so that I don't have to be too upset if it breaks one day after the warranty expires.  I also considered the Maxi-Matic, which is even cheaper (like $22), but I decided I wanted the oven temperature settings rather than simply a "Bake" mode that didn't let you set the temperature.
1	1271376000	This oven uses a single knob turned clockwise to activate the timer and counter-clockwise to "Stay On".  If you manually end a timed cycle early it is very easy to go slightly past the off setting and engage "Stay On". This product should be recalled for an unsafe design.
1	1271116800	This product had worked fine for about 5 months and then things started to go wrong.  The finished alarm doesnt always go off when it is supposed to and the temperature switch only works in certain positions instead of all of them.  When we want to bake, we have to have the switch between settings of bake and off for it to work.  I wont buy another and I dont recommend it.
4	1271116800	I was looking for a toaster oven that wouldn't take up too much room and this one got good reviews.  The only thing wrong is that it gets very hot on the outside, but, if you're careful, that isn't a huge problem.  Ive only used it to bake things and it does a good job.  Very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small oven that is reliable.  I like shopping at Amazon because they are prompt, offer good prices and most things have free shipping.  I've never had to return anything but considering Amazon's overall reliability I'm sure there would be no problems if I ever have to.
5	1271030400	Got the Black & Decker 4 slice toaster oven, TRO480BS.  LOVE IT!!!  I can toast in it and heat up pizza perfectly in it and bake french fries and french bread and open faced cheese sandwiches.  Each item I have made in it was perfect.  I even had a toaster oven that was less than a year old and I replaced it with this one.  It was priced reasonable and does all I ask of it.  I liked it so much, I bought another one for my daughter.  And I got free shipping!  Thanks!
5	1270944000	This is a great toaster oven for the price! It's works perfectly and is the perfect size for me. It also matches my stainless kitchen appliances.Highly recommend.
5	1270944000	I wanted something small to toast bread and maybe bake some cookies every now and then.  I am really happy with this purchase.  You can fit no more then 4 slices of sandwich bread as advertised so don't expect a lot of room.  My kitchen is very small an this unit is a perfect fit.  You may want to look into a bigger one if you use your toaster oven often but for someone who uses it simply to toast bread or a bagel every now and then, this unit is perfect!  The controls are simple and easy to set.  Every feature you need is present without the many features that the average person does not use.  The unit does get really hot when it is on, meaning the chassis gets very hot so don't leave anything on top of the oven such as a brad basket because it may burn or even worse, catch on fire.  It can double as a heater if you toast bread in the winter time!  I really like this little toaster oven!
5	1270684800	This is our 4th toaster oven in less than 3 years. The last one (Emerson Stainless Steel Toaster Oven) went on fire when the toaster timer broke and my husband forgot that he put toast in only a few minutes earlier (there was no bing!). The one before that was theOster 6290 6-Slice Toaster Oven, Black- this one was replaced once under warranty the plug went on fire, and then entirely stopped working less than a year after being replaced.Now onto this toaster: We've had it for less than a month, but have thus far been very happy with it. The bread toasts nice and evenly (unlike the Emerson), and in no time (unlike the Oster). It's small and pretty and at a great price! It also has a 2 year warranty - so even it it does break at some point (they really don't make them like they used to), it's reassuring to know that we'll at least get 2 years out of it!
5	1270252800	I love this toaster oven because it heats up quick and toasts my bagels, bread and english muffins evenly golden brown!  The price was unbeatable for the quality and I highly recommend this toaster oven.  5 stars!
4	1270080000	Read all the reviews and this one seemed good. We got it in one day from Amazon. We are very pleased so far. Gave it 4 stars because you do have to turn three separate dials to make toast.  But if that's what you do mostly then just leave the settings. But it's not like  a toaster where you punch one button. Toast comes out nicely. It  broils great. Oven seems to have a real thermostat. It's larger than our old B&D toaster oven, but it's not huge. Not small either.  For the price and features, this is a good buy.
5	1270080000	I love this toaster oven! I wanted something that does more than a toaster , read the reviews and tried this. I love the pull out crumb tray in the front, very handy and easy to dump.This cooks very evenly and does a great job. I had to play with it awhile to get the "perfect" shade of toast, but I got there. I recommend this, it is a GREAT price for all it can do!
4	1269993600	I bought this toaster oven to replace a 15 year old Black and Decker toaster oven. I use it mainly for toast and heating waffles, sandwiches, etc. It works well and has a niece look. Good value for the price. I just wish that you did not have to set the time each time.
5	1269907200	The Black & Decker toaster oven is the perfect size and it heats everything very quickly. We are very happy with this product.
5	1269820800	have had it for several weeks now and everyone in the family enjoys using it from making grilled subs and Ruebens or just reheating pizza or waffles.
5	1269648000	I recently moved to a new apartment, finally gaining a kitchen with enough space to have a toaster oven. It took me a while to find one that fit my budget and my kitchen and this toaster oven was perfect on both counts. It's small enough to fit on my counter top without taking up too much space and for the Amazon.com price, it's also a great value. One standout feature is the shelf is hinged to the door, allowing it to slide forward when the door is opened--no more maneuvering with a fork or other utensil to bring the tray forward. I've had it for about a month now and there's nothing about this toaster oven that I don't like. It's exactly what I needed to fit my life and lifestyle.
4	1269302400	Was a good addition to the gas oven, quick and economical to start and saves time also. The tray stuck at times, that's the only drawback I have noticed. The first shipment gave me a defective and crooked one, but amazon was really nice and supportive to take care of it, that's why I luv to shop at amazon. Over-all happy with this purchase
4	1269216000	Product works fine.  My only complaint is the timer - it's really loud and sounds like a ticking bomb - kind of disturbing in the morning waiting for toast!
5	1269216000	This little oven is great.  I use it for microwave pizza, corn dogs, chicken nuggets.  Perfect for a single person.
5	1269129600	I never thought I would buy one of these things, my gas bill for cooking has gone way down, takes less time to make a pizza or heat anything. Made my life easier, my son LOVES it he says when he moves out he is taking it with him..
5	1268956800	This product works really well. We used it as an alternate oven while our kitchen was beinge remodeled, and it was good for heating up pizzas, breaded chicken, fish, even vegetables, and was also a good toaster.  Like other toaster ovens, the top gets hot, but overall, it's a great value.
5	1268870400	Though I was looking for a smaller toaster-oven to replace one that died, the combination of good reviews and price led me to this one, and I'm glad it did.  Yes, it'll use a bit more power, but in the week or so I've had it, it's done a good job of toasting and baking.  (Toasting is, in fact, both quicker and more even than both my old toaster-oven and a regular toaster produced.) I rather wish one could set the timer for longer periods, but that's a quibble.  The removable drip pan is a real plus, as it'll be easier to clean up spillovers.  The outside does indeed become hot, as many have mentioned, but I find a pair of simple bamboo tongs is a good safeguard for pulling pieces of toast off the rack. With free shipping, Amazon was definitely a best buy location.Update 3/2011: Have been using this one for a year now, and am still happy with it.  That hot top surface, btw, makes a good plate-warmer.
5	1268784000	I have had this toaster oven for about 1 week now but I know that I already love it.  It took about 5 toastings before I didn't burn what I was toasting but now I know where to keep the settings for each item I toast.  Everything cooks evenly and the inside fits a lot and it doesn't take up too much room on my counter.  I was replacing a really expensive Cuisanart toaster oven that was really crappy, I will never buy that brand again.  I went with Black & Decker this time because I have other products from them and they really have held up. The price was also very good and I know that they will stand behind there product if anything goes wrong.
4	1268697600	Primarily, I just use this oven for toast.  That said, it works really well.  But -- as another reviewer wrote -- there isn't much room for larger foods.
3	1268352000	I'm less than thrilled with the Black & Decker TRO489BS Toaster Oven, but after getting to know it's idiosyncrasies, it serves the purpose.  Changing modes, for example from toast to baking, requires multiple setting changes.  Bread is evenly toasted, but it takes much longer than my old toaster oven. And, most disappointing is after taking hot food out of the oven the door will not close (I either leave the door open until the unit cools or push the rack back in place with a utensil). The price was good, so this seems to be a case of "you get what you pay for".
4	1268179200	The toaster over was just what I needed. It fits right in the space on my counter. It took me a while to learn how to use it properly, but other than that it is great.
5	1268006400	We love this toaster oven.  It fits nicely on our counter w/o taking up too much space.  It's great for nights when we do nuggets or other quick foods.  Much better than turning on the oven.
4	1267920000	I'm quite satisfied with this as a replacement for my 40-year-old GE Toaster Oven.  It is a solid piece of equipment (not tinny or too light-weight), and so far it has functioned the way it's supposed to. The Broil feature readily takes the place of Top-Brown on my old one and it melts cheese nicely on tostadas and sandwiches.  It does a good job of heating frozen pre-cooked chicken and individual frozen pizzas.  I've used it for toast only once, but it browned an English muffin very evenly on that occasion.  The controls aren't nearly as intuitive as on my oldie-but-goodie and they have very small and close-spaced lettering that is tough to read with bifocals, but it's nothing one can't adjust to.  The oven does get scarily hot, something about which the manual reminds you every other line.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for use around careless children, or around cats, who tend to jump up on things and might burn their feet.  But overall, I'm pleasantly surprised at how well this oven replaces the one I loved for so many years.
4	1267920000	I like this toaster Oven. It is small and fits neatly under the kitchen cabinets  on top of the counter.  Be carefull. It does get very hot on the outside and you can easily burn yourself. Also the sliding shelf that slides out when door is opened does not do so very well and tends to stick when you try to close the door again.  It is annoying  to have to turn all the dials when you want toast and to remember to reset the dials when toast is done. but the toast you get is evenly browned and perfect and you can toase several slices at once all done to perfection. It will cook a meal such as a casserole ok but that takes time as the oven needs to be heated to temp before being used.and the timer bell does not work very well.So I use a different timer.Ann Sillman
5	1267660800	Easy to use, spacious inside. Only shortcoming is it doesn't toast very even between two sides. Sometimes one side is brown and the other is still cold.

5	1267574400	You never quite crave a piece of toast with a bit of strawberry jam till your toaster oven goes on the fritz and you can't have one. Such was the case with our last toaster oven.So we were toastless but after reading the reviews on Amazon I just could not decide what to buy because none of them sounded that great. I was getting ready to put out the bucks for one of the bigger, fancier models when I gave it some thought. Most of the bigger, fancier models I had owned, had stopped working after about 2 years, where as the Black and Decker model I had some time ago had kept on toastin' for some time.So I opted to go for this inexpensive Black and Decker model and I am really glad I did. Not only is the price point excellent but it does a great job. Despite being only a 4 slicer, it is quite roomy, but it sports a small footprint. The model is also quite stylish and will go well with any color kitchen.The dial does have to be turned back past the 10 and then forward to toast but I prefer easy use over an electronic menu that requires a lot of thought. A simple piece of toast does not need to have an elaborate operation behind it.Lately, I have been eating a quick English Muffin lunch. Two slices of turkey on a whole wheat muffin, topped with a slice of swiss. The toaster does a perfect job of melting the cheese and toasting the muffin. Toast a mini waffle with mini chocolate chips for a sweet treat to pair with it, along with a salad. Delish!Overall, very pleased with this purchase and enjoying toast and jam again.~ Lee Mellott
4	1267574400	This little oven is exactly what I hoped it would be, with one minor flaw...when the door is open and you try to shut it, the tray that slides out hangs up and has to be pushed manually a bit to send it back into the oven. Other than that, it's a great little oven for the price, and I'd buy another.
4	1267574400	I really love this toaster oven, especially for toasting 4 pieces of toast.  I love that I can bake, toast, broil, etc with it.  It tends to toast hotter than what the settings say though.
5	1267574400	This is really a good toaster oven. I'm very happy with it. I like the removable crumb tray. It toasts well and warms and bakes well. For me it was a good choice. Thank you Amazon for your many choices and the ability to take a good look at the products online.
1	1267401600	i had no luck with this toaster.  It burned the top and barely warmed the bottom of bread/bagels.  The knobs were difficult to turn, especially for children.  i do not recommend this toaster.

4	1267228800	Basically it's a good toaster oven.  It seems durable. I like the fact that there are enough controls (time, temperate, function) to make it do exactly what I want.  It's reasonably small (about the same size as the one it replaced when that one was taken apart by someone cleaning it and couldn't be correctly put back together).  It does what I want doing with enough control and very little fuss.
4	1267142400	I have had a few Black and Decker toaster ovens over the years.The one thing I don't like about this new one is that every time you make toast you have set the doneness dial. It is essentially a timer and you can never get it the same every time.The crumb tray is convenient and can be easily removed from the front....Nice looking unit with mostly good features...Great price...
5	1266969600	Works good and looks good in my apartment. Very pleased with this product so far.
4	1266883200	at first i was a bit concerned regarding this toaster as some guys wrote not so good reviews on this one.  But since i am on a tight budget, this one i got.  looked great, matched my tassimo and blender on my counter. but most importantly, it works like a regular toaster. no probs so far.
5	1266451200	This is the 3rd toaster oven i have ever purchased.  So far so good, it is a great price, looks great too.  I like the timer very much---making it possible to turn off the unit without my watching over it. My last Black & Decker toaster oven of several years old was still working when I replaced it with a Cuisinart that was larger in size.  The Cuisinart toaster button wore out, the company has since replaced it with a dial---I assume there were many complaints.  This time, I switched back to a B&D, and hopefully it will last many years.
4	1266105600	We got this one as a gift for someone else, and it works great for her.  Personally, we like ours better because it's larger, but this one works well for one person.
5	1266019200	Toaster is very easy to use.  It's compact but still can fit 4 pieces of toast (even though they do overlap a little bit.)  The only issue is that the metal grate that the food sits on isn't very well designed.  When you open the door to put food in (or pull it out) the grate automatically comes out but doesn't catch properly to easily go back in- you need to give it a little push.  It's not a big deal, just something worth noting.  Otherwise, it's a great toaster- esspecially for someone who likes the old style knob control & doesn't want a high tech digital toaster.
1	1266019200	Insufficient numbers on the minute dial to toast or bake consistently.  You must hover over your food to prevent it from burning.  Definitely don't have anything on top of the oven when in use - it will also burn.  Don't put it on the counter under a cabinet.  How is this not a fire hazard?  I'm sorry I didn't return it right away.
4	1265846400	Black and Decker did a great job with this toaster oven.Well made and performs great.
4	1265760000	Toaster oven arrived promptly as indicated.  Like the style and the toaster oven, but the glass door does not close tightly.
5	1265760000	Great toaster oven. Love the bottom tray that you can remove.  Size is great for the countertop.  Amazon is a great place to buy electronics and many other items
1	1265414400	The first time we attempted to toast bread, it lit the bread on fire.  To say the least we were very unhappy with the product.
5	1265241600	This B&D; toaster oven is versatile and works great.It requires little counter space and yet you can cookquite a few meals with it. I have had other Black andDecker products and they last a long time -- I expectthis oven will,too!
4	1264809600	Not alot to say, it heats very evenly which is nice for one of these toasters, and it is quite powerful.  For the price it's a great buy, perfect for my morning sandwiches.
1	1264809600	I have been using Toaster Ovens and loving them for over 30 years.  We bought this oven for its compact size.  Had an under-cabinet mounted Black and Decker for many years and loved it. Since this version was no longer made, we tried this one.  From the beginning it has burned everything when on "Bake" setting, no matter how low the oven is set.  It will actually toast, but takes forever ( more than 5 minutes - which is too long and far more than any toaster oven I have ever had.) The door also sticks and doesn't open properly.  After owning ours for less than a month I am now looking for a new and different one. Don't waste your money on this one.  It is not worth any price, no matter how cheap.
5	1264550400	I was looking to replace an old GE Toast-R-Oven. I found this after a lot of searching and it is absolutely perfect. It's not a lot bigger than my old toast-r-oven which was important to me since I have limited counter space, yet it will toast four pieces of bread at a time. It's even easier to clean than my old toast-r-oven because the crumb tray pulls out the front. Some people may not like the "turn past 10 then turn back to the desired doneness" aspect of the toasting function, but I don't mind and my toast is terrific. Considering what they want for toast-r-ovens these days this was a steal and it's nice looking too!
5	1264550400	I really like this Toaster Oven. I had a Black & Decker toaster oven for many years and was happy until one of the elements blew out. Then I started using a new Oster that I had received as a gift. It lasted about one year. At first I was not going to purchase this one because it seemed TOO Large as per the measurements given in the item description which turned out to be wrong (12-2/5 by 18-8/9 by 15 inches ). The actual measurements of this oven are 15 3/4" wide, 8" high, and 9" deep (at the widest part on the bottom). The item description size was way off and it seemed like it was going to be a monstrosity on the counter. It turns out it is just an average size oven. It works great. Toasts and broils VERY fast and the timer is quiet. Looks stylish too. What more do you want from a toaster oven? The only two issues are that the power cord is shorter than expected. It just about reaches the outlet where it is placed, and there are only two heating elements. But it works very well. I really like the slide out crumb catcher. Very easy to clean. You don't have to lift the oven up and open the bottom to clean it like most toaster ovens.
5	1264377600	This is a very good product for the low price. This oven replaces an old toaster oven made by a different manufacturer. Much better quality than my previous oven. The features are everything I need.
3	1263945600	After many good years with my old B&D; toaster oven, it was time to get a new one. That's an understatement . . . when your daughter scream's, "Dad the toaster oven is on fire, come quick" . . . well its time to get a new one. Actually what happened on the old toaster oven was the button you push down to toast, got stuck, and her 2 mini bagels caught on fire. Of course she pushed the button down left the room, and came back to "toasty conditions". The handle melted, the toaster oven was history.  I liked the old toaster oven for the simple reason it was easy to toast bread, bagels, etc. You push down the lever and it toasts the same every time.Of course, B&D; probably went to the "twist the dial" timer toaster option after a few of these older toaster ovens caught on fire, the way ours did. It's not just B&D; toaster ovens that have saddled the consumer with the new twist the dial toaster oven, others have the same unfortunate feature. The main reason I don't like this "twist the dial" to toast option is because you don't get the same result each time you toast. Each time you have to guess at where to stop the timer, resulting in either an "not toasted enough" result, or a "too toasted" result. Maybe in time, I will get used to the new dial option.This toaster over gets three stars. It's OK, or good enough, but nothing to write home about. In addition to not having the old push down button, and toast lever, it has cheap, light, feel to it. Also, the the wire grill that you lay the item you want toasted (or baked) on, has a "hook" on it, which enables it to slide out as you open the door, but many times does not close very smoothly, you have to "jimmie" it a bit to close. In my opinion, a poor design.In summation: an OK toaster oven, it functions, but nothing special.
5	1263686400	An excellent and the best toaster oven I have ever had.  I have browned french bread in it- baked shrimp tempura-prepared from Costco, and done a ton of other things with this.  It is a touch hotter than the temp read but down adjust and works great.  It is also excellently priced and bigger than a regular toaster oven.  I now own two, bought one for a vacation home.
4	1263081600	Have had the toaster for about a month now. Since it comes with a somewhat silly-looking 3 dials, I would have preferred one of them be a dedicated toast dial to better control the hair's breadth between barely warm and burnt, but all in all it performs well and we're quite happy with it.*Toaster is going on 3 years and still working just fine.
5	1261180800	Cheap and dependable, easy to use, what more do you needBlack & Decker TRO480BS Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven
1	1261008000	I HATE using this so-called toaster oven because it is nearly impossible to control the darkness on it. It has a timer dial with 2 icons, one black, one outlined (white?). You have to figure out what your favorite setting is supposed to be. It will never be the same setting twice, because you turn the dial and there is no way to know you have it set at the same position. That is RIDICULOUS for a 'toaster oven'. Also, it is too large, so that if you set the rack in the middle, the top of your bread will be toasted more than the bottom, plus, it takes FOREVER to toast to a near-medium doneness. Most often you will get nearly-burned toast. Whoever designed this thing was an idiot. Whoever approved it for sale as a toaster oven was a bigger idiot. I feel like an idiot because I bought it, hate it, but did not return it. I wanted the smaller version that actually has a numbered dial for toast, but I couldn't find those. Apparently they are either being phased out the small ones are being bought and these big clunkers are left in the store. DO NOT BUY ONE unless you like frustration every morning for breakfast.
4	1260835200	The Black & Decker TR0480BS Toaster Oven is an attractive addition to the countertop.  It is easy to put together and is made of quality materials and with excellent workmanship.  The thermostat is well set.  The oven is easy to operate even if you don't read directions....BUT, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT.And, do check out how much money you save on this item!!!Amazon.com is the place to look for small kitchen appliances.
1	1260489600	I bought this yesterday thinking I was getting a good bargain. But I just found out Kmart is selling the exact same one for $26. How is this originally worth $500?
5	1259971200	This toaster is five star to me because you can't beat the price and the performance. I am not comparing it to the expensive convection ovens. For an very inexpensive toaster oven you just can't beat the features, the price and the performance. It toasts evenly. It bakes evenly. I tried to bake some Pillsbury Crescent rolls and it did a better job than my regular oven. It has a wonderful timer feature that you can set up to 20 minutes. You can also opt to leave it on in the stay on mode. There are toaster settings. Best to watch the item you are toasting the first few times and know the time for your specific bread. It holds three large bakery style loaf bread slices. It does so much more quickly than the last Black and Decker model I had. The pull our crumb tray feature is a real time saver. Whether I need to cook fish, meat, or heat a hot sandwich, toast, or reheat...I find it incredibly wonderful for the price. THere are small saftey protusions in the back of unit so you keep it the proper distance from any touching surface. What more can I say? If you want a toaster over that is not reinventing the wheel then this is the model!! How can you beat $26.99?! Besides all this it does look nice. It is compact at just 9" deep x 16" long x 8.5" tall. Amazon had the wrong size listed on their site. I bought it from SEARS because they had a much better price.UPDATE:Feb 2012  I have had this toaster oven for over two years and I still love it. There are no problems. It is wearing well.UPDATE: APril 2013: I have this toaster oven for over three years and there have been no problems. Still works great!
5	1257724800	My toaster broke after seven years and I wanted a unit that would toast and broil.  Didn't need a convection oven.  I found this unit and was very happy about the price.  It is quite attractive and matches my stainless and black kitchen. The first thing I did after cleaning the unit was make toast.  I wanted to see how evenly it toasted.  I must say I was quite surprised at how quickly and evenly it toasted.  So I'm already a happy camper.  The door has a nice size handle.  The unit does get hot, but from what I read most toaster ovens do.  Will write another review after I've had this for awhile.Update-2/10/10  I have had this toaster over for awhile now and I am very happy with it!  It still toast bagels & bread very evenly.  I have put 4 slices of Orowheat bread in it and it still toasted it evenly.  It doesn't take as long as my regular toaster did.  So I am still a happy camper.  The best part is it is not very expensive!  Wow to get what you want and not have to pay a high price!  Woohoo!!UPDAATE 3/31/12 - Still working great, but I only use it for toast or bagels.
3	1257292800	I don't have major issues with this unit. It came in with the gray powder coated metal cover panel on the front snapped on incorrectly. I was able to loose the screws, bump it up and fix the issue myself. The unit looks very stylish, heats up fairly quickly. My other issues are, 1. There's not much room for your food in the oven. One 6" chunk of garlic bread in, and the bread is almost brushing the top of the oven, made the top of the bread very easily burnt, and center not fully heated. Slicing the bread into half will solve the issue, but if you have a bigger piece, you will probably end up heating it in the big monster oven, and forget about this unit; 2. The metal body gets REALLY REALLY hot with each use. Make sure you do not put anything on top of oven.
5	1257120000	I rate this toaster oven 5 stars, not because it is the biggest, best toaster oven out there, but because for the PRICE, it's a great mid-size countertop oven, it's very attractive, it has good basic features with easy dials, and toasts evenly and has a good size interior. Amazon ought to carry this themselves and offer free shipping. I actually got mine from a department store this week for a cheaper price (loss leader probably).That other post with 1 star was kind of bizarre, getting the wrong rack?? Maybe he got a return or something but these come very well packed. A few features I like about this one is the wire shelf is reversible, no surprise there, but turned one way, it has a wire lip that the enclosed tray can slide under attached, which helps during the baking process to catch any overflow drips. Then your baking pan can sit right on top of the rail. I also like the pull out crumb tray from the front, easy to clean and put al. foil. The sides have little hooks that the wire rack can slide into and it pulls out the rack a slight bit when you open the oven, makes it easy to grab your toast. The front handle is screwed in, all very secure. The cord is shorter than most, but I consider this a plus. Most people place the oven right by a plug anyway and too long of a cord gets in the way. It's long enough to pull the oven out to the front of the counter tho if you are cleaning behind, etc.Black & Decker made a good one with this model.
1	1255910400	This came with the wrong-size wire shelf, which was too wide to insert.  Contacted Black & Decker for a replacement part, and it was nonexistent.  Amazon said this was the last one in stock, with no plans on getting more.  Apparently, the model was discontinued.  Amazon, of course, made good with a full refund, though it was a hassle taking the unit to a UPS store 14 miles away, etc.  So, I put the blame on Black & Decker for poor packaging control.  Without that wire shelf, the unit is nonfunctional.
4	1255132800	We looked at a number of ovens and wanted something that did the basic things and didn't take up too much space. No convection (we have a convection oven) and no digital - its just a basic appliance.  We looked at the B&D; 240 but this just seemed too basic and too flimsy.  Then we saw this one. It has all the basics, it's a good, small size and its silver / black which matches our kitchen.  It has 3 controls (as compared to the basic model w/ 2) making it easy to select temp, function and time.  The handle is securely attached to the glass door -the metal ends wrap around the glass so it won't fall off (a complaint about other ovens).  It has a nice slide out crumb tray that has access from the front with the oven door close - this makes it very easy to empty.  Nicely toasted our first bagel in just a few minutes and it was very evenly browned, something our regular toaster did not do well at all.ProsGets hot fastBasic controls work wellEasy access crumb trayEven toasting and heatingConsNot manyThe top and sides do get hot so don't store anything on this!
