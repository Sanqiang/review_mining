1	1405209600	One side works fine, the other is too quiet...
2	1405209600	Doesnt work all the time. Usually only one set of headphones works when using this.
4	1405123200	Really what can you say plug it in and there you go great.
2	1405123200	Well, I tried this once before and it was rejected.  Why?  I don't know.  But I shall try again.  My review is not so much how this works (which is likely OK), but more for the 'free' shipping.  It's one thing to be free, but another to be ridiculous.  The estimated time to reach the buyer (me - in the United States) is 17-22 Business Days!  Really?!?  That's basically a month!  To ship this little thing??
3	1405036800	One side is very quiet, one side is really loud. Worked alright for one trip, will probably try to find something else for the next.
3	1405036800	The connections aren't the best - you have to jiggle them a bit sometimes to get the sound to come through on both channels.
5	1405036800	Works great to allow my daughters to share the DVD player or tablet on the plane.
1	1405036800	Poor quality.
4	1404950400	Works!
5	1404950400	Needed to be able to have two people hear iPad movies while on a flight.  This product does the job.  Works nicely.
5	1404864000	Great little product. Does exactly what I got it for. Allows me to have 2 headsets hooked up at once. Arrived in a timely manner well packaged and in good condition.
5	1404864000	works great -no issues.  I plugged it into an Asus T100
4	1404864000	Great quality, fair price.
1	1404864000	&#128078;
4	1404864000	Had to fidget with it to make sound in both headphones work, but after that it worked great.
5	1404864000	Not sure why this was promoted to buy but I think we will use it.
5	1404691200	Good Quality. anytime purchase
4	1404691200	These are great.  I use mine for getting dual lavalier mics set up for interviews for cable access shows i produce at home.  They also work great for using on my Zen (ipod) when I want to have a second ear bud set up, so both my wife and i can listen to a downloaded program or music at the same time.  You can spilt the signal that comes from your computer to go to an external stereo so you can listen to sound of much better quality when you need it, than the standard computer speakers by runnig a cable to the &#34;line in&#34; on the boom box. Get some and they will become useful.
5	1404691200	Works great
5	1404691200	Works well enough - it's a simple Y-Splitter - I needed to be able to use speakers & headphones at the same time - so - in a pinch - I could turn off the speakers & just use the head phones with out all the fussing & what not of unplugging the speakers & plugging up the headphone's - the PC that sit's on my desk @ work - only has one audio out - hence - this little splitter works great for my purpose.
3	1404604800	Great splitter does the job
1	1404604800	At first I thought the output was mono on either dongle, but then noticed that after pressing the casing, it was stereo, so it sounds like there is a bad internal connection or wire.  Disappointing.  Looks good, but unusable unless you are deaf in one ear anyway.
4	1404518400	It has worked good so far.Some minor problems are both headphones have to be at the same volume. If the two headphones are different, it may cause one to be loud and the other not as much.That aside, good product for when you want to share music or a movie with someone, but not everyone.
5	1404518400	Good
5	1404518400	This is useful. I bought it but did not use it much.
5	1404432000	Works so well! Especially for the price. My friend and I live in a co-op and often watch Dexter on one of our laptops in the common areas but don't have loud speakers. Now, we can watch without disturbing anyone or straining to hear what's being said. Great purchase! I recommend it to anyone who is constantly sharing one set of earphones with someone else.
5	1404345600	Great product !
3	1404259200	It's very simple and compact but I have to take the case off of my phone everytime I want to use it. (I have the Spigen Slim Armor case).
5	1404259200	Excellent!
4	1404172800	Use it for my Kindle on a flight, My wife and I were both able to watch a movie in stereo sound.
5	1404172800	Works exactly as intended with no loss of audio quality (although the stuff I'm listening to on my computer isn't exactly pushing the limits of audio quality).
5	1404086400	Worked
5	1404086400	This worked very well in a multitude of situations.  I used it to split the audio coming from a video played on my tablet; as well as the audio feed from an in plane movie.
3	1404086400	They are ok, but will not fit all headphones correctly. You might end up not hearing well in one of the lines and will need to twist and turn the jack until you start hearing well.
4	1404000000	Works perfectly to connect two sets of earbuds to tablet for video viewing.
3	1404000000	It feels pretty cheap but it gets the job done just fine. I use it in areas where they're not disturbed too often, but you might want to consider another product if you think it will take a beating.
5	1403913600	I purchased this to split the input of my shelf system stereo.  One part of the &#34;y&#34; stays hooked up to the blu-ray player.  The other half of the &#34;y&#34; has a 3.5 stereo cable attached, neatly coiled and set aside, ready for using my smartphone to play music through the stereo.  Perfect!  Just what I wanted.
5	1403827200	Pros:Splits 1 Stereo channel into 2 stereo channelsAudio volume remains the same and doesn't drop outConnectors are made from high quality materialsComes in black or whiteInexpensiveCons:Reviews for this item are combined from multiple sellers and some send cheap imitations or broken items, so make sure you order from Amazon.com to get what's pictured.This splitter turns your lonely ride of 1 into a party fit for 2. With this fancy little wire you can enjoy your music with your best friend, sister, brother, significant other or stranger sitting next to your on the airplane. You don't need to feel awkward singing out loud to your favorite songs anymore because you'll now have someone singing right next to you. Whether you're a young couple trying to watch a movie in your parents basement without them banging on the floor or an older couple on a bus heading to a casino listening to West End Blues you're guaranteed to get top notch quality sound out of each jack. For less than the price of tall Frappuccino you can get this splitter and enjoy your ride with long lasing quality from Belkin. Anything less would just disappoint you. Make sure you're seller is Amazon.com and not some cheap china ripoff before you click your Check Out button.
1	1403740800	Totally useless.  I bought these so that 2 people could watch a movie on my mac computer on the airplane.  Both people could barely hear anything.  So this item was completely worthless!  Don't buy unless you have super human hearing.
2	1403654400	I Bought these because i wanted to be able to have 2 headphones hooked up in the same jack.It does work and Yes, It does put out In Stereo, But there is one THING Everyone needs to Know.This Jack drains the sound you receive in your Headphones by at-least 20 percent.I Didn't know that before Purchase...So i just wanted everyone to know. They are still very usefulJust don't expect full sound output. That's why i had to give it a 2 star rating.The package it was in was well made and the actual jack is pretty well made.I Will prob need to find a jack that doesn't drain any of the power...but for the moment these willDo and they were pretty cheap. So there ya go. I Hope this review it helpful to someone.
5	1403481600	I bought these for a long airplane ride and was able to watch movies on my iPad with my boyfriend.  This little splitter worked great!  Good product and a great price.
1	1403395200	This splitter has a lot of loss, forced to crank up the volume and as a result there is a lot of noise.  I will opt for the PureAV speaker/splitter on my next order, which is more expensive, but I have that many have tested the losses and have had good results.http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-PureAV-Speaker-Headphone-Splitter/dp/B0001VWHT0/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top
5	1403308800	Allowed my children to watch a movie on my Kindle Fire on a flight. Perfect! They were able to hear the movie perfectly once I found ear pieces to fit their ears.
5	1403222400	My girlfriend and I are going on a trip together.  We loaded a bunch of movies on my laptop for the plane flight.  This splitter is exactly what I was looking for so that we can watch the screen and both enjoy the movie in stereo.  It works great.
4	1403222400	does their job. Cheap and small so i can throw them in my school bag and I have them when i need em.
5	1403222400	Works great~!! Get it and you will be fine. Sound quality is great with both TV & 2nd speakers. Now I get almost theater sound at home ^^
5	1403222400	What more can you say? This splitter works flawlessly. No need to spend any more $$ on such a simple item.
5	1403136000	Works nicely.  I was worried it be junky for the good price, but I like it!  Now we can hear jams at work!
3	1403049600	The product delivers the appropriate output from my hosting unit to my two separate speaker systems.  However, once the two output sources are both connected to this unit, a buzzing sound from both speaker sets occurs.  If just one of the speaker sets is attached to the splitter, the buzzing goes away.As an amateur, I cannot say whether this experience is to be expected from a splitter or not.  All that I can say is that I did not expect a side-effect of a splitter being that the two output sources would have a buzzing sound.  I assumed that the sound quality would still be preserved.  Will be trying a different splitter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIESU/) to see if that corrects the problem.And to be clear, the unit DOES NOT split my audio into a right/left like other commenter have suggested.  My only complaint is the buzzing noise!
3	1403049600	Didn't need this item. Already had a splitter at home and didn't realize so I cant comment on it.Jacki
5	1402876800	If your family includes several children, you may have run into this dilemma: you are on a road trip and have brought along the portable DVD player you just purchased so that your kids can be entertained for the next hour and a half while you and your spouse drive in relative peace. However, upon getting the movie going and telling the kids to plug in their headphones, you find that the DVD player only has two (or in some cases, only one) headphone jack ports! What to do?Well, this little product is your solution. With this at your disposal, you can see to it that all of the kids can hear the movie at the same time. It's a cheap, effectual solution to the problem, and I highly recommend it!
1	1402876800	Used on a plane connected to an iPad.  Sound only came out of one set of headphones.  Just garbage...but what should I have expected for $2.50
5	1402876800	Being a pro audio guy....I must have $10,000 worth of cables.Honestly, It is the silly little stuff that we often overlook...This being one of those necessary items....ThanxJonny G
5	1402876800	This is a fairly simple product that allows me to connect two sets of 3.5mm speakers to my iPhone for added sound. The male jack goes into the phone, and the female jacks connect to the make jacks coming from the speakers. Sound quality is not impacted at all. At this price, given that the product performs exactly as expected, you can't really go wrong.
4	1402876800	The splitter works, though I must fidget with my headphones to hear the audio. But definitely worth the price. Cool!
4	1402790400	This is good and does what its supposed to do, but I'd recommend getting one with separate volume controls (depending on what you're using it for).
5	1402790400	This splitter was exactly what we needed for our cross country and international trips.  They made it easy for us to enjoy the same music or movie.
3	1402617600	The intended reason for the purchase did not work out however,  was cheap enough that I didn't have to return and found uses for it.
5	1402617600	Good audio clarity.  Wire seems sturdy.  I have been using this for 3 years now without issue.  My kids us this for the Ipad.
4	1402617600	Good for sharing a tablet to watch movies on a plane. Probably overpriced for what it is, but it works.
5	1402444800	I've tried some no-name splitters available locally and they only worked for a little while, before the connection on 1 splitter end would start going bad. The sound would fade/cut out and soon need to be tossed.This Belkin splitter has worked great for me during last 3-months and they get used 3x a week. Look forward to seeing how they hold up over time. The gold connectors are definitely higher-quality than other splitters I've tried. Probably why they offer a lifetime warranty.
1	1402358400	I tried 4 different pairs of headphones and only 2 pairs worked properly with this splitter. The pairs that didn't work were able to receive partial sound.  The pairs that did work were still a bit finicky and I had to jiggle the connection to get it to work properly.
5	1402358400	I have no problems with this splitter. It does the job. So far, so good. Don't know about durability but will see.
4	1402272000	I found no problems with impedance when you connect two headphone at the same time, the sound is equally distributed.
5	1402185600	As a 3.5 mm splitter it does it's job! I don't know what else to say, but it is a good price for it and it works.
5	1402185600	I used this splitter NOT for headphones but for clip on mics. I connect them directly to my HD camcorder to record great quality dialogue sound instead of using the built in mic on the camcorder. Works great. Couldn't be happier.
3	1402012800	Bought it to use it with the Samsung Tab 4. Sometimes you have to twist the female 1/8 inch ends for the ear buds to work.
1	1402012800	First off when I first bought it it did not come with a shipping tracker so I was not able to see where my package was at the time or any time of that matter second I have yet to receive it they have not shipped it to me and they are a month passed due sadly I do not know how to contact them for another one but if I could get it i will never buy any product from them ever in my life again!
5	1401926400	Why did i not get these earlier? My girlfriend and i play video games loud with the tv turned down and these are a great way to split our headphones. The connection fits standard headphone jacks so in ears will work as well. I don't feel like there is any loss of soundquality.
5	1401753600	arrived on time and works as I though it would.  Seems to very durably made also.it is nice to convert a stereo pug into a  two plugs if you happen to need to do that
5	1401753600	A splitter is a simple device that plugs into your computer or other device allowing two people to listen together. It works well.
3	1401667200	I gave this 3 stars, but it's kind of my fault. I have a pair of headphones that has a microphone and a speaker connector (both male 3.5mm). I thought this would let me plug the mic into one female connector, the speaker into the other, and then connect them into my laptop's single audio port. Nope. This is chiefly an audio splitter. If you want to connect two pairs of headphones for some reason that doesn't make any sense, this is your guy.
5	1401667200	I love headphone splitters, especially for long flights where my husband and I want to watch the same TV show or film on the same device. This works just as expected.
5	1401235200	This is a must have for my travels, it allows my wife and I to watch movies on the iPads at the same time. Recently flew to hawaii and it's a god send on a 12 hr flight from NY
5	1401062400	You use this to split 1 stereo jack into two. Not much needs to be said about this. It does its job and does it well.10/10 would recommend.
4	1400889600	Our two kids can now watch things together on flights!  they still argue about the show but at least we're not fighting over headphones anymore.  :)
1	1400803200	This piece is bad. It didn't work AT ALL!! very disappointed. Couldn't hear the actual sound, somehow, just the background score In the movie.
1	1400716800	The male connector is too thick, much thicker than in the image. It does not fit into the recess where the plug on our player is. Totally worthless for our purpose. I doubt that it is a Belkin product.
5	1400716800	some of these kinds of connectors can be loose when connecting other pieces to them (in general, not specifically this y-connector piece). Not the case here. Anything I've plugged into these so far have been snug. I bought a few extra after seeing how nice they wereAs for noise generation, I'm no audio technician so I couldn't speak for that... but my untrained ears didn't detect a difference in audio quality through these
5	1400630400	Great for sharing music cheap I would recommend it for anyone that wants to share music with their friends. Worth it
5	1400544000	I have one of these and when I go on flights I can share my tablet with a friend, or the fat guy that is taking up half my seat.
5	1400457600	I purchased this for my boyfriend and I to use on a plane ride from Atlanta to San Diego. We were able to watch movies on my iPad together without any problems!
5	1400371200	This does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I purchased this so that my hubby and I could share the ipad for watching movies.  It works great with all type of headphones.
5	1400284800	Used this to split audio to two headsets from my PC when playing video games, and it worked well. Cheap and effective.
5	1400198400	I bought this to squelch back-seat arguments between my young boys when one was listening to music via headphones on a device that the other could not enjoy. Check one for Dad.
5	1400112000	This works great with the two headphones I purchased.  Both grandsons can watch the same movie on the DVD player in the car.
5	1400112000	I got to sit at the pool with my boyfriend and listen to the same song on my ipod. I also used this on the plane to watch a movie with the person sitting next to me on my computer. It's a great way to spend time with someone else and not in my own little world.
5	1400112000	As a headphone splitter it works great as it is supposed to, it replaced one that didn't work at all.
5	1400025600	Using to run two headphone sets of one jack out from PC. Shared considerate listening for movies, games, TV, music, jammin', etc.. Thanks
4	1400025600	I needed a simple headphone splitter and wanted to go with a trusted brand. This product addressed my needs, with reliable quality, at a fair price.
5	1399852800	I bought this to use on the plane for my kids to use on the iPad. Worked without any problems but eventually was lost when we departed the plane. I recommend it.
4	1399852800	Good price, and built quality is pretty solid.I connect the 3.5mm jack to the rear of my Creative speakers.One end of the input comes from the computer sound card. The other end comes from the Apple Airport Express.Did not felt any negative sound quality from my computer sound card to my creative speakers.Take note that the black connected to the 3.5mm connector is big.If you are using it on your mobile phone or tablets with casings, it would not fit is phone cases where the 3.5mm jack cut out is small.It the 3.5mm end can be of a slim built. It would be perfect!
5	1399766400	If you wanted to share audio from a device with someone, this is the ticket.  For me it was a laptop that has a lousy built in speaker.
4	1399680000	I had no problem using this y cable with my portable DVD player.  It is hard to describe, but inserting and removing the headphone cables feels a bit off and I don't have a lot of confidence that these will last very long in the hands of my child, but for the cost I am pleased and expect these will get misplaced before they might fail.
5	1399680000	Nice to have on a long fight to share a movie. Also great way to compare earphones/earbuds. Cheap, effective, and good quality!
5	1399593600	This is a really great item, I bought it for my daughter and son to use since they were constantly arguing over who got to listen to music on the ipod at the same time.  Now they get to listen at the same time and everyone is happy.
5	1399593600	I love this Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter.  It arrived quickly and in good condition.  I love it so much that I purchased a second one for my personal use.  I have one I use with my Flat Screen Television Set, and another one I use with my Bose Radio Wave System.  These help me to be able to use my Bose Headphones in innovative & convenient ways I otherwise would not be able to.  The quality of sound I get from these is excellent.  I feel I got good quality at a reasonable price.  I would most definitely recommend the Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter quite highly.
5	1399507200	Was able to hook up one side to headphones and the other side to external speakers. So if I want privacy, i use the headphones and if I want the speakers, I power them on
5	1399507200	I got tired of borrowing everyone else in the families splitter so I splurged a couple of dollars and got my own.  Great price, fast delivery and I love the independence
5	1399507200	Does its job! No complaints and works just great.  I have nothing to say other than it does what it supposed to do.
5	1399420800	My wife and I wanted to watch movies on our laptop during a long flight.This worked perfectly on our 13&#34; MBP Retina laptop.I was worried because she used in ears, and I used over the ear - but it was perfect.
5	1399334400	I use this to split the sound to two headphone sets when i travel.  Both sets get stereo sound, even though it's a little quieter.
2	1399334400	I see that this has a good rating overall ... but the one I got was bad. you need to keep the cord stable to get good sound. the headphone cord fits perfectly but still if you move it effects the sound.
5	1399334400	Great way to put two sets of computer speakers together. just make sure they are the same wattage, they will sound a lot better that way. almost like surround sound
3	1399334400	One of the female plugs has little bit of a connection problem, need to keep fidgeting with the connection for it to work properly.  We use this to split audio to two headphones while watching movies on planes.  I wish it were perfect but it was pretty cheap so I live with it.
5	1399161600	I don't have a use for this every day, so I've only used it a couple times. Of course, it worked flawlessly. Belkin is a well-known name in the pro audio world, commanding premium prices. This is a low price for getting a little Belkin in a device that could easily be made by others with cheaper materials.
5	1398729600	This took forever to arrive from China. Almost a month, not exactly Amazon Prime shipping. The item is okay, but the wires are a little too flimsy for my tastes, smaller than a toothpick. But it works great as long as someone does not try to walk off with the headphones still connected to the plug.
5	1398729600	I bought this to be able to use a headset with two jacks (one for the phones and one for the mic) on a computer with one stereo jack for both. You obviously don't get stereo sound since you only have two channels for the mic and phones, but it works great.
5	1398729600	Just the &#34;ticket&#34; for use with several Bluetooth input feeds on the TV. You gott love little items like this to make life easier.
4	1398729600	But when it is all I have to do is reconnect the headphone again so its not a big deal to me. Very happy that I can have to headphones plugged in at the same time! What a great little item!
3	1398643200	It works but I have to fiddle with it to get both sides working at the same time. .. I got what I paid for!
4	1398643200	Not much to say. Works as intended. Purchased for kids to watch movies on Ipad while on trips. Good price.
1	1398643200	Despite many reviews to the contrary, the splitter I received does NOT split the output into two stereo signals.  As long as only 1 pair of speakers is plugged into one of the splits the speakers sound fine.  As soon as a pair of speaker is plugged into the other split, the volume cuts in half a one of the channels cuts out.  Useless junk.
5	1398556800	It worked. I couldn't have asked for anything more. this is dumb amazon requires so many words to fill out space
5	1398556800	Bought this for my trip to Europe! Had no issued what so ever! If you use two different headphones  sound will vary on each. Just use the same brand, (we had skull candy) and they worked just fine!
3	1398384000	it works fine with all my laptops and IOS devices..the small issue , is when using apple headphone .. sometimes I will miss the video voice but still here the music or vice versa ..if that happens just unplug and try to plug it partially till you here the sound clearly.nice product
5	1398297600	We use splitters a lot in my family and they always seem to break on us. This one has held up GREAT!
5	1398297600	I am using this with an iPod touch 5th generation inside an Otterbox Defender case, in order to use headphones with wider plugs that cannot fit through the case. Product quality is good to me, plastics are good and the metal connections are snug. I tried it with a friend's iPad Air inside Apple's Smart Case, and the plug is too wide to fit the small hole in the case.
4	1398297600	There's not much to say about this splitter, it has a single function and it does it pretty well. It's a good deal for the price and it's well built.
3	1398211200	3.5 mm Y splitter received, not gold plated as pictured; item description did not state that the splitter was gold plated or standard - Gold plating typically produces a better signal.
5	1397606400	I currently have it setup to split a uniden scanner to two separate speakers. Works flawlessly and continues to have great quality audio
5	1397606400	Pretty simple Y splitter.  You plug it in and it works.  No issues with faulty wiring, it just works.  :)
5	1397520000	I recommend this item to anyone that needs a splitter for their computer. It works great,  High quality item for sure.
5	1397433600	I bought this with a different use in mind but that kind of fell through.  Ended up just adding it to my rather large box of unused cables.
1	1397433600	My headphones work fine in a variety of devices. When I use this item, I have to move my male 3.5mm jacks around in the female ports of this splitter to get a good connection. I would return it, but for the price it's just not worth the effort.
5	1397260800	bought these to expand the number of wireless headphones transmitters all being fed from the flat panel tv sound board (1 rca cable).  I have this splitter feeding a sennheiser transmitter and a sony transmitter for a total of 4 wireless headphones.  No distortion of sound.pros:  works, cheap, solved my problemcons:  none but I wonder if sound quality would deteriorate if I were to add another splitter
5	1397260800	works great, a real life savor. No bleeding no hum just pure sound. I would recommend this product to anyone needing an audio splitter.
4	1397260800	I just got them a week ago and so far so very much good, my wife and I watch a lot of shows and at night we some times like to just have us hear so we hook up these and two headphones, all ready to go. Pretty worth it.
5	1397001600	This item worked very well, met all of my expectations. Sound was perfectly clear through both sets of plugged in headphones.
5	1396915200	The important traits of a headphone splitter are one it works and two that it doesn't break right away.  This Belkin works and looks like it will hold up a while  so if you are in the market for one of these, they make a good choice.
5	1396828800	nice product. It worked well this Universal PC/Stereo Gaming Headset - Yapster TM-YB100A. good combination. Must try product. All the best
2	1396742400	Does not work with the Apple iPhone headphones, the ones that have the extra microphone contact ring on the plug, some how it prevents the plug from being inserted all of the way.  It is also very hard to use with any plug as the plug seems so tight it is difficult to insert and remove.
1	1396742400	This splitter has issues when connecting iPhone headphones. It drops part of the audio when not adjusted exactly right (by pulling the cable in and out into until you can hear everything). You have to fiddle with it a few times to get it right.Annoying!
5	1396656000	I work online with a speaking/ listening software and sometimes require a second opinion on evaluations.  It is nice to be able to hear the work without the distractions of background noises.  I did plug in two headphones to see if it were in stereo and both earpieces were working in stereo.  Initially, the wrong item was sent but the error was found before it reached my home.  Amazon contacted the shipping company where the original shipment was returned and the correct one was sent.  If it hadn't been for the email explaining this and the fact that the product was two days later than I had originally expected, I would not have known.
5	1396656000	I was wary of some of the negative reviews out there, but for the amount of money you pay - it was worth a shot.And.... this thing works. Can't speak to the quality/frequency of sound, but it does the job of splitting the 3.5 into two separate stereo channels.
1	1396569600	I purchased this splitter so my wife and I could watch movies on my tablet during our recent flight.  We only were using ear buds and one side would only output the music track on one set of ear buds and no dialogue track.  Spinning the headphone plug around in the port made the dialogue track pop to life in certain spots.  I switched the other pair of ear buds to the good port and verified it was my an issue with the ear buds.I bought this because I wanted it in a few days before our trip.  I'm not going to return them for the small price I paid.
4	1396483200	Not much to add about quality and performance to what other people said.  Rating it four stars because like many of these splitters sometimes you need to fiddle with the connection to get it to fit properly.But I also want to add to the conversation about true stereo separation of this splitter.  It does separate the stereo audio, provided the 3.5mm input (ie headphones, cable, etc) have the basic three contacts on the tip.  When that is connected, it splits as advertised.  But if you attach a tip that has four contacts (such as some headphones with a microphone) then the stereo separation does not work.  I think that's what's happening to people who say that stereo separation works when they wiggle the contact.  It happened to me as well.  So as long as you have the right inputs, the stereo separation will work.
3	1396224000	Only purchased this item being the Panasonic Headset I ordered from Amazon didn't show or I missed it that the headset came with a speaker and headphone splitter. Now I have this one I will probably never use. Hey you win some and you lose some my father always  told me.
1	1396224000	My wife and I used these to listen to movies while our baby slept in the next room.  Unfortunately, after only 4 movies the sound became distorted beyond acceptability and now they are in the trash.
5	1396224000	Havent used them yet so dont know what else to say except its black and looks like photo on the net
5	1396051200	Does exactly what it says Works great, came in pretty hand and worked as designed. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for something similar.
5	1395964800	Not to much to say ... it is a STEREO splitter that works and works well.  Longevity I can NOT speak on since I just received this splitter, though using both ends and the twos sets of headphones I just purchased in the same order to test this adapter... I can 100% SAY THAT IT DOES SPLIT the stereo single to both sides.  If it will stop that over time, I can not say but until it does have problems, I can only figure that this will work perfectly.  I have another splitter where only one side seems to get stereo, but this one works fine in both sides of the splitter, as I said.I am happy I bought this one and will keep this on my Amazon &#34;wishlist&#34; to throw in future orders tooCONS:NONE
5	1395964800	I needed this to split 1 headphone jack in my tv to 2. This worked perfectly without any sound loss.
5	1395964800	Doesn't change the headphones to mono, so you can share your music with a friend. Great build quality, and has lasted me a long time.
5	1395792000	This is the 1st splitter I have bought that actually works! In the past other splitters made the audio quieter than it should be and that is super annoying when the volume is all the way up and you still can't heat the audio if you are in a noisy environment like on a plane. This one doesn't do that. I used it on a plane and the audio came through as loud as it should have. AMAZING!
5	1395792000	used this several times for road trips.  lets both kids watch movies or listen to something or play games.  very function and have had no problems whatsoever.
1	1395705600	Split the audio decently, but required the pins to be exactly aligned by twisting the headphone jack. Not worth it!
5	1395705600	If you are watching movies on a tablet on a train headed across a country and don't want to do that silly, you take the right headphone and I'll take the left hog wash, then this is the best possible thing to do. We both had noise canceling phones and it almost made us forget the 20 hour train ride.
5	1395705600	I ordered this item so I could split the signal from my blue tooth receiver, which has only one output jack,  and send it to to two different amplifiers via wire.  I can now play music or radio from my phone to either of these amps, or both at the same time.  Works great!
4	1395619200	I bought this to use in reverse to make 1 input 2, for separate use. I hooked my bluray player and xbox 360 to my tv via hdmi, then the hdmi port on my tv died... Still have dvi, but it doesn't carry audio, so I had to use the analog audio in port. I use this to have them both connected, even though I don't use them at the same time. I thought it would work ok, but when I have the xbox plugged in to this port and off, it cuts the sound from the bluray player in half... whether the xbox is on or not. Xbox sound is fine all the time, though... Maybe it's the way it's wired, maybe it's the adapter for my xbox, I don't know. not a big enough deal to take either paprt to find out, I'll just plug in the one I'm using when I use it... Didn't work for my application, but works fine for it's intended application.
5	1395619200	I ordered 3 of the headphone splitters for our families upcoming vacation. As soon as it arrived I plugged it in to see if the sound would decrease when you plug in the second set of headphones. And it doesn't. Same LOUD music with both sets of headphones plugged it!  This will be awesom to share the dvd players, ipods and kindles we are taking on the trip!
4	1395446400	This is a great product! It splits the power between two sources well. I would get this if you like to connect only two things together.
5	1395360000	compact and perfect for 2 to listen to on airplane while watching a movie on tablet. a o k !
5	1395273600	Used it on the plane to listen to movies while on vacation! Works great!! Would highly recommend this splitter. Easy to use.
5	1395187200	Just what I needed. Both headphones have full sound, and both left and right speakers work on each. Don't listen to the bad reviews, these are perfect.
2	1395187200	Splits audio so two people can hear sound, but one side's louder than the other. I was going to use it to watch movies with my girlfriend without disturbing my roommate but we can't use it because one side is really loud and the other is really quiet.
5	1395014400	These worked as advertised...Split signal from my daughter's Nexus 7 so that she and her brother were able to share audio from a movie on a recent flight without disturbing others
5	1395014400	I bought this to use with my iPad to watch movies and my iPod to listen to music while on a plane trip with my hubby.  There is nothing fancy or stylish about it, just a splitter at a great low price.
5	1394841600	I bought this so my children could share the tablet computer on the airplane to watch a movie.  Two sets of headphones and this splitter did the trick. I tried it out and no crackling, clear sound in both sets of headphones.  Gets the job done.
5	1394755200	Another excellent Belkin product. Just plug one end into your MP3 player & the other 2 ends into headphones. The product works great, two people can listen to 1 MP3 player. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5	1394755200	As splitters go, this one works fine. A very good value. I recommend this. Equazit herbality nos cemoe cujordon eto.
5	1394755200	Pretty much does exactly what it is supposed too. Used it to hook two speakers systems up to my computer and it does its job.
5	1394668800	Took a while to get here but for the price it was a good deal and I wasn't in a big hurry for it. Well built item and it works as described. Very pleased.
3	1394668800	Sometimes have to fiddle with the headphone plugs going into the splitter jack to get the sound to work properly.
5	1394496000	I have needed these at work sometimes when our new monitors have speakers built in.  You can wire up both monitor speakers.
4	1394496000	What was frustrating was at first I didn't think the connections were right - they are SUPER tight! You have to force them in and never expect to get them out.I used this in my car. I have a holder for my phone and a converter that plugs right into my stereo, and a handsfree piece rigged to stay in place. I wanted to splitter to plug in both. The stereo quality is about the same. But it's a drastic decrease in quality for the headset.
2	1394496000	Item did come in as scheduled. I waited close to a month to receive my item. Item came in a small package and was curved to fit in the package. Once I connected 2 outputs, I would get severe cracking and one channel would go off, return, then sound weak. I was disappointed and actually threw the item away.
4	1394323200	It took awhile but good service. Can't go wrong for a couple of bucks. I'll use it for a number of things.
3	1394150400	Strange sounds come from this thing... no idea why that is. The cables seem to have no interference protection inside
1	1393977600	This plug only works if you have it angled at a certain position.  If not, the volume just plays out loud on our laptop instead of in our headphones.  A little annoying when trying to watch a movie together with my husband on a really long flight.
5	1393977600	excellent product I recommend, which is described in the sale of the article, is a good material and is 100% original
5	1393804800	Gold plated conductors = Important. Buy these...What happens to a frog's car when it breaks down?It gets toad away.
1	1393804800	I'll make this short and sweet,One side plays super loud while the other is super quiet.In other words, one person has to go deaf while the other has to strain to hear if you're going to use this splitter.But hey, you get what you pay for, right? I was just hoping it would have done better because of all the positive reviews. Maybe I just got a faulty one. It really wasn't worth they buy, I should probably just throw it away.
5	1393632000	using this so that I can let both my nephews plug in with headphones and watch netflix with my phone while we are out and about without them having to bother others around us.
5	1393545600	Not much to say here, it's an audio splitter, it allows you to plug two sets of headphones / speakers into on jack.Works great, absolutely no problems.
5	1393459200	Plug it in, listen away with a friend. Works well for stereo headphone connections, not microphone connections. It is a TRS (Tip, Rind, Sleeve) design instead of a TRRS (two rings) for carrying a mic.
1	1393372800	When you connect two headphones, the sound is loud in one and quit in the other. It doesn't matter which headphones are plugged into it.
5	1393200000	We use ours with our portable DVD player on car trips. You can use two ear buds at the same time so both kids can watch the same movie without disturbing the driver. Great product!
3	1393200000	Need to make sure you push both head phone jacks in hard. May need to turn and rotate jacks to get full volume.
1	1393113600	Bought this to go with my daughter's Ipod external speakers, but they have the wrong ends. Too expensive to return.
5	1393113600	I used this to split my ipad and DVD functions via a Bluetooth transmitter.  Cheap, dependable and worth the price.
5	1393113600	I purchased a Sony Bravia for surround sound in a spare bedroom being used for home hemodialysis treatments.  The unit plays DVD's, CD's has an FM Tuner, USB port for playing digital music or photo files and the all important stereo mini input for &#34;Audio In&#34;, e.g. a Blackberry, IPod or most smart phone music files.  After initially giving up on being able to play music files from my desk top computer on the Bravia, I realized that the speaker out connection on the back of the computer was a stereo mini and the same as the input on the Bravia.  I hooked up the stereo mini extension cable and I was marvelously able to play computer music through the Bravia.  Unfortunately, when just using the computer, I would have to turn on the Bravia, as I had pulled the computer speakers from the computer output.  Enter the Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter, which permits both outputs - the Bravia and the computer speakers to be plugged into the computer concurrently.
5	1392940800	Ordered these for my computers in my classroom, so I could make more use of the computers as listening centers. They work wonderfully!
5	1392854400	Easy to use and is very practical for  doubling up in duty for example it allows two people to listen at the same time.
1	1392768000	It does not work correctly and I'm pretty sure this was not a Belkin product. Believe all of the negative reviews! The audio only works in one speaker if the other unplugged from the splitter. Not only that but the audio itself sounds very hollow, was so bad that I threw the splitter away in disgust.
5	1392768000	The boyfriend and I use thies to split our head phones on the Ipod when we are going on motorcycle rides. You really cant go wrong for only $2.
4	1392595200	This worked perfectly; it was plenty loud in both headsets, and both sets got full sound.  They're not very pretty, but they are cheap and useful.
5	1392595200	if this product was bad thgen someone just doesnt know how to make a cable. this is a good splitter.
5	1392508800	It's been over 2 months since I purchased this product. I use this to connect my 2 Bose desktop systems to my laptop. The product works as described and i have not noticed too much degradation of the sound quality (though there is some but not too much that it is noticeable).Only con that I have had with this product is that the input pin into laptop jack is not an exact fit. There are times where i have had it disconnect from the jack when trying to move the laptop around slightly. This is a minor cause for concern.
5	1392508800	I bought this in order to convert my stereo output to my 5.1 channel speaker system.  For that its been working for about a month without any issues.
4	1392422400	This product was exactly what I wanted, it is a little difficult to plug headphones into the splitter. I didn't realize they snapped all the way in at first, but after I did I was really happy with the product. It works well, the sound comes through well, and it is a decent length so it adds a little bit onto the length of your headphones.
5	1392336000	It does it's job on our TV.  Using the ext-speaker output (a headphone jack) that sends all audio inputs (HDMI component) to our limited (2) input surround sound system, I split the signal to a bluetooth stereo transmitter so that I can use some BT headphones while I work out and not have to blast the TV volume to hear.Splits as a stereo signal.  Haven't noticed a reduction in sound quality on either the SS or BT headset.
5	1392336000	Cheap, flexible and works exactly as expected. No workmanship concerns and it looks like it will last a long time. In retrospect I'm glad I didn't get a standard one piece y-splitter as the cable style of this one seems like it will be easier on the laptop jack.
1	1392076800	This piece of crap plugs into my computer fine. but when i try to plug in a standard set of earbud headphones they wont even plug into the splitter. Do NOT BUY FOR A LAPTOP COMPUTER DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.
4	1392076800	Works well so that me and my friend can watch movies on my tablet on roadtrips with two pairs of headphones attached. Although it doenst get 5 stars due to the sound not being as loud as it should. (softer than if you just listen to it through your own pair)
5	1391817600	Not much to add that others haven't said already... using it on my computers to attach a set of headphones and speakers both at the same time, sound is great on both of them ... mind you I don't use either of my computers to listen to music or watch movies so I can't speak from the point of view of an &#34;audiophile&#34; but as far as my purposes are concerned - say, watching a utube video - it works for me..
5	1391817600	This splitter is use often when me and my fianc&eacute; travels. It's a great option for us watching movies together on long flights or train travel.
4	1391558400	this works great it allow you to hook up to headphone together which makes music recording even better for to people.
5	1391472000	At this price range it's an amazing product. Doesn't come with any extra features, but I wasn't expecting any. Doesn't reduce the volume or the quality. Definitely suggest for all uses.
5	1391299200	I bought this so i can have my Headphones and speakers playing at the same time on my PC, they work great, especially for the price!
4	1391299200	Reliable brand, second time I buy this product, it is a necessary item. No changes in the original sound source
4	1391212800	No problems. I mainly use this on field trips to academic bowl games with my friend. I didn't notice any change in volume or anything.
1	1391212800	I got it so, I could use it with Bose 20 too hug up my tv and record player. It only last a few day and the sound went in and out on the record player! Then it stop working on the left input!
4	1391040000	Great item for sharing your music from one device. My wife and I use this when traveling and only want to use up the battery on oneiPhone so the other iPhone stays charged for use as a phone (imagine using an iPhone just for making calls). Great idea if an emergency arrises.
5	1391040000	Great quality.  Plugs into any port securely.  Sound feed is perfect, so go and get the  quality headsets out. Just what I needed.
1	1390867200	Broke within the a week. Cheaply made. Was hoping this would be a quality splitter. I'd look elsewhere for an 3.5mm audio splitter.
5	1390780800	I ordered this so my wife and I could listen to the same music or watch the same movies while flying or on a road trip (in the back seat, of course). It works great with my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. My wife and I watched Sherlock with it while listening with our Bose Quiet Comfort Noise Cancelling headphones on the plane. We did not experience any noticable volume loss - however we did have to turn the volume up higher than normal. I am not sure if this is because of the airplane noise, or because of the adapter.
5	1390521600	I use this splitter to hook up a headset to a TV.  It works fine, and the Amazon price was right, especially with the free shipping.
5	1390435200	I used it to split the audio output from my computer to the amplified speakers and my surround. sound system, so either can be used. Well made and functional.
5	1390435200	We rent movies on Ipad and like to watch on plane together and with this we can.  Bought extra for family trip coming up so my parents can use an Ipad and watch a movie together too!  Historically they were hard to find but thanks to AMAZON you can find almost anything.
3	1390435200	...what it's advertised to do.  I got these to hook up duel headsets to a PS3 and they work well for this.
3	1390348800	This product works as advertized, but the plug won't fit into my iPhone with the case on. I had to trip some of the rubber around the plug so it would fit into my iphone and ipad with the cases on. Also keep in mind that the iphone and ipad have 4 conductor jacks so they can use headphones wih the volume controls. This adapter works, but you have to pull it out slightly to hear audio in both L&R sides. I don't recommend this for apple products.
5	1390348800	Belkin Speaker and Headphone SplitterBelkin Speaker and Headphone Splitterboth inputs have left and right audio works greatzzz
2	1390348800	There might be an issue with different sellers shipping different versions of this product, but the splitter I received does not preserve the stereo signal.  Both the left and right channels are combined into a mono signal, so you definitely tell a difference when using the splitter.  I purchased the splitter from Elite Inc.After looking at the customer photos... I must have received a knock-off... mine did not come with the Belkin packaging and the two female ends look quite different from the real Belkin splitter.
5	1390348800	Let me start off buy saying the price for this is unbeatable, the cord is very durable and gets the job done. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting one of these.
5	1390348800	I was concerned that plugging and unplugging my speakers and headphones would loosen the audio input on my PC and make the sound wonky over time, as has happened w/ some of my portable devices, so I got this splitter, and it is fabulous. Both the speakers and headphones are now connected to the PC at the same time w/ the splitter's one jack (w/ the mic part of the headphones connected directly to the PC).The sound is fabulous. There is no loss of stereo, clarity, or volume for either of the audio outputs. And now I don't have to plug or unplug one for the other as needs warrant, because there is no need to do so. Both are plugged in and sound great.Highly recommended!Also recommended is the seller I purchased it from -- &#34;aSavings&#34; -- which had this splitter new (still sealed in original packaging) and at a great price, free shipping, and quick delivery.
5	1390348800	I remember using a similar device back in 1990s when I was in high school. (At the age of walkmans) That was a T shape device and connectivity was a big issue, often the voice was gone from one side.. So I had reservations before trying this. But since it was very cheap I bought anyway. For two weeks my wife and I are using it and it works great. I have not noticed an imbalance (higher pitch at one side etc) or breaking of connection. Very quality sound can be heard at both ends. I have not experienced any loss in volume when you split. That might be an issue for those who listen to very loud metal music, but for my purpose it is not noticed. One last thing: It keeps the stereo function so you don't end up having two half stereo or mono sound due to splitting which is great.
5	1390262400	Hey what is there to say? I bought it cheap. it worked fine. So... yeah. that's it! very good product... it's black. plugs in well on my macbook air. the ear phones plugged into it without force. so I would say it is not bad and actually very good.
5	1390176000	Works as expected. You plug it in and then you can use 2 sets of headphones with it. Works great with kids that want to watch the same thing (and have some quiet in the house).
5	1390089600	Me and my wife were able to listen to a movie without any issues.  In fact, it surprised us of how well the sound was.  Of course that's due to the actual Kindle but still, it still means this splitter carried the sound very well.  I would definitely recommend this product.
4	1389916800	I bought a bunch of these as gifts for couples attending my destination wedding. However, I overgifted and now I need one for myself. The only problem is I can't buy it alone. It needs to be added with a total purchase of over $25. That's the only downfall. Other than that, item works perfectly
5	1389916800	As with most if not all Belkin products.Works well, is durable.Spend a little more for Belkin and you will save time and money by quiting throwing cables and other peripherals in the trash due to poor construction.
5	1389830400	This is a good product...it's still in good condition and I still use it to this day!!! I'm very satisfied!!!
3	1389830400	Got this to allow 2 kids to use their headsets for mobile viewing of tablet. Sometimes mommy needs quiet time, so kids get ipad video time.  Previous hack of one ear bud per person was not working, especially for stereo productions like movies.  That hack also forced too much unappreciated physical togetherness.  This splitter works great!
5	1389830400	Having recently purchased a Yamaha CX-5000 pre/pro with two 12v trigger-outs I immediately sought out a way to simultaneously power on 4 of the stand alone amplifiers I have in my 11 channel system. The solution was the Belkin Speaker and Headphone splitter which did the job admirably. I split each trigger out with two cables and can now remotely turn on the pre/pro and have all 4 amps fire up. Outstanding! Thanks!
5	1389744000	Brick and mortar stores heavily markup simple cables like that. Internet is the way to go, unless you cannot wait a couple of days.
5	1389484800	This Belkin splitter preserves stereo separation with no loss of volume at a dirt cheap price, don't hesitate just buy it !
3	1389398400	Need to make sure you push both head phone jacks in hard. May need to turn and rotate jacks to get full volume.
5	1389312000	My daughter likes it very much. With this little thing, she can share the music or songs with someone. She was also surprised that she got this item before Christmas as the estimated delivery time was after new year.
4	1389225600	Got for our portable DVD playerWell made and we will use it sometime just haven't had the chance to
3	1389139200	It does the job. But it's a bit big : it would be better if the splitter was thiner and not so heavy. I thought (when I saw the pictures) that it wouldn't look like this. but still : I use them and they work well, nothing else to say.
5	1389052800	This is a very high quality connector. I will buy a few more of these. I really don't know of anything any better
5	1389052800	Well technically you'll be plugging in 3 things total but hey, you know what I mean. It works the way you would think it would. You plug this into a headphone jack, then plug in 2 other headphones so you never have to share you head/earphones again! I personally use this and other adapters to directly record and monitor my music on my iPad, which can be real unorthodox, but cheaper than buying that $dollar iRig thing!
5	1388966400	Just got this, and tested it with 2 different earbuds.  It does in fact preserve the full (R+L) stereo signal in both connected headphones.
5	1388880000	Super inexpensive and effective! My lady and I just watched Lord of the Rings on the computer together headphones on and it was GREAT! I have nice Bose headphones and she has crappy ear buds, and the volume was perfectly even for both. Great product.
4	1388880000	I used it for splitting up the output from my computer to my computer speaker and my main studio computer.  If I listened from both sides, one works fully but the other did not work.  I'm not sure why?
4	1388880000	My parents in India travel long duration in trains. So this is like tailor made for them - they can play music on a portable device, and listen simultaneously.Worth the convenience.
2	1388793600	Well, the item does what it says it would do, it splits one audio jack into two, but when doing this, it also cuts the volume down 50% and I haven't figured out how to fix it. If someone can tell me how, I will change my review.
1	1388448000	We constantly have to wiggle it to stay on, or only the music will play and you can't hear the voices, I wish I would have paid more for a better one!
2	1388448000	I love the idea of the splitter, but this brand is terrible. Unless i got a knockoff. It broke within three days of use.
5	1388448000	These splitters do what you think they do. The sound quality is close if not the same to what you hear before. I use them for headphones. Great value.
5	1388361600	Works good. Doesn't distort the volume or make one side louder than the other. Would highly recommend if you playing on having headphones but want to share the sound without sharing the headphones
5	1388361600	I have only used this a time or two and hope it will last.  So far it is working as advertised.
5	1388275200	We have two daughters and one portable DVD player.  We bought these so that we could give each child a set of headphones to listen to the DVD player.  Worked out great!  Also works with iPad and just about any other electronic device with and audio jack.  Would recommend as an inexpensive way to cut down on fighting about volume and listening to &#34;I can't hear!&#34; as you are trying to drive:)
4	1388188800	Guess I should have expected this but the volume was cut in half when 2 headsets are connected.  When on a plane near the engine trying to watch a movie this can be an issue.  Also, the connections are a bit noisy (only when rotated, not if you leave them alone).  But for the price, it works just fine.
5	1388188800	These are so handy for two people using mp3s or ipods from the same source!  The price couldn't be beat and Belkin is a good name.  The quality looks very good; it arrived on time and everyone's happy.Thank you.
5	1388102400	Pretty straightforward for something like this. Either it works, or it doesn't. Sometimes my wife and I will watch videos or listen to music together on my Nexus 7 while on the road or snuggled in bed. Worked great so would recommend!
1	1388102400	Received and the 1/8&#34; male plug is too small to plug in. I tried several cords without any luck. I guess you get what you pay for. I will spend the money to get a good one at Radio Shack.  They want more to ship then I paid for it. PLEASE, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE REVIEWS AS I WAS.  THIS IS JUNK PLAIN AND SIMPLY
5	1388102400	There's no need to pay more than $5 for an audio splitter. A white &#34;Monster&#34; branded splitter with gold contacts may look nice but it adds nothing to audio fidelity.
5	1388016000	I bought this so that hubby and I can watch a movie on the kindle together when we are traveling.  It worked as expected!  It also rolls up nicely to store away without taking up much room.
3	1388016000	There is not much to say about this except that it works okay. Quality is not great. We get what we pay for.
1	1387929600	I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone under any circumstances. The audio quality the device gives is very very poor.
5	1387929600	I bought this for use in the studio while recording. It's worked out great and does exactly what I needed it to do.
4	1387929600	hey, it is a simple little device. put it to use when the daughters both wanted to watch one device. price was acceptable.
5	1387843200	Works as advertised without noticeable loss of volume. I also like the flexible pigtail design compared to the solid units.
4	1387584000	This works great especially on the go like flights... with one screen and two headphones. The white color blends well with Apple products. Definitely recommend it.
1	1387584000	The connecting rod is just long enough to snap into place into the iPhone or iPad with no room to spare for any surface in between the connector head and the device.  Unfortunately, the connector head is too wide to fit into the holes of most iPhone or iPad cases that I have encountered.  This renders this splitter almost useless for me, as it requires removal of the case of the device to use.
5	1387584000	I've given one of these to my sis so that she and Mom can together listen to movies soundtrack on the laptop.I think this is a great buy - something worth having especially if you work in a collaborative environment. Imagine listening to some Ted talk, and then having a colleague join you in listening - without disturbing others around you.I'm going to buy another piece the next time I'm in the US.
5	1387411200	This splitter worked great for my car trip. My fianc&eacute; and I were able to listen to our music at the same time and ignore the other people in the car. There was no diminishment of sound as I have experienced with other splitters.
5	1387324800	I bought this Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter to move these attachment easily from a laptop to a Kindle Fire Hd without having to fumble with a lot of wires. This makes it easy.  You just  have one piece to plug in to the device.
5	1387324800	Glad that the money went for a good cause. Took awhile. But, I got on trips with my friend and we use it to listen to music together.
5	1387324800	I read a lot of the review on here, and there seemed to be no middle ground, either people saying it was great, or it didn't work at all, so I was bit concerned, but for the price I gave it a shot.  I wanted to be able to play the same music upstairs and downstairs without running wires, and since upstairs I have a rocketfish speaker I figured this would work. As a few others noted, the plugs are fairly snug and did take a little twist after plugging it in to get it to play in stereo.  This will split your output in to two stereo outputs, and does it with no issues.
5	1387238400	We bought this to go with our portable dvd players so that each kid could plug in their own headphones. They have worked great!
5	1387238400	I bought this to go with the 2 iHome speakers I purchased for traveling and watching movies on the computer.  I plugged both speakers into the splitter and that into the computer and have great sound.  Service was great and prompt! Thank you!
5	1387238400	So many people saying it doesn't work well. Their headphones probably don't work well. Either that or their hearing. A+
5	1387152000	Great product, great price. With this splitter, my husband and I are able to watch movies and listen to music together using my ipad.
5	1387152000	I plugged it in, and it worked. It seemed a good quality product, as is typical of Belkin's economical products.
5	1387152000	Compare to low price this is a great and quality item, I will order more In the future ! !
3	1387065600	It works, but sometimes you have to twist the head phones in there to make both head phones work. It's almost like it doesn't get a firm connection. But again, works and is awesome.
4	1387065600	Very handy gadget to split the stereo speakers and headphone.  It would be even better if it was longer instead of a short piggy tail.
5	1386979200	works as advertised.  worked with headsets letting the kids watch video and both can hear in car without disturbing us.
1	1386979200	I just received it. I plugged it in the laptop, the ipad, the iphone, etc and the sound is awful. Really bad quality. Don't buy it.
5	1386979200	Pros:-Gold plated connectors-Packed in a easy to tear packaging-Works greatTo those who are getting this, by using an audio splitter, the audio level will be lower and it is noticeable.
5	1386979200	Yup. Not much more to say about that.It works.Sound waves come out from appropriate locations.No leaks detected.
2	1386806400	It works, but headphones need to be seated exactly right in the jack for the sound to come through correctly.  I end up needing to jiggle it quite a bit for it to work right, and it gets disconnected very easily.I switched to the Monoprice version, which work a lot better.
5	1386806400	They do the trick. I got it for my grand-daughters so they could both hook up to the television and listen with their headphones.
5	1386720000	This Headphone Splitter is well made, it is easy to unplug and plug in again. it gives a clear sound.Tom
2	1386720000	Doesn't work very well.  Could use some specific improvements like: clearer sound, no clicking noise, having sometimes only one side working, and not as bad of a plugin jack for the earphones.
4	1386720000	It does what you expect it to do, splits the audio from one device to allow two people to plug in and hear it.  Small amount of volume loss, but nothing that seemed to bother my kids, doubt that they even noticed.  If you are going somewhere and have kids that are going to share a device to listen to music or watch a video, this is a great and inexpensive way to get them squared away.
3	1386374400	i normally don't write reviews but felt it necessary as the item received from this supplier was NOT belkin brand.  it was a &#34;no name&#34;  brand that appears to be decent quality, but again, not belkin.  their response upon contact was prompt and courteous and denied knowing it was not belkin brand.  i found that hard to believe as others had similar complaints.  they offered refund or replacement but i did not pursue further as it was not worth it.
5	1386115200	I bought 2. It splits the audio as it should. I don't notice any static or degradation in the sound. Price is good. 10/10 would buy again
1	1386115200	Purchased from Elite, Inc.  The item was generic (no BELKIN branding or packaging) and not what was expected.  The signal was split so that the left channel came through one set of headphones and the right channel came through the other set of headphones.  Inserting at different depths only resulted in slightly louder or softer signal.  Each set of headphones should play both channels of the original signal unchanged (if only lower in volume).  It also had very tight-fitting connections.  UPDATE:  Elite Inc's response was that I would have to return the item at my expense.  Also, I noticed that the name on the packaging and the return address was Sapfire, not Elite Inc.  That seems odd to me.  I will be contacting Amazon about a refund.
5	1386115200	Love the product and the benefits of using it is awesome...was searching it for ages but got it in Amazon :)
5	1386115200	Worked well.  I bought it so my husband and I could share the same Android tablet in the airport and airplane.  The sound was good.
5	1385942400	this is exactly what i wanted. works perfectly for letting two people watch our portable dvd players at the same time.
4	1385942400	I absolutely loved this, i had one problem, my dog ate it. I ordered the same one again because it was so good. Well received.
5	1385942400	Works well but isn't compatible with headsets (headphones with a Mic) but other than that no problem at all.good build quality as well.
4	1385942400	So far so good. I have been using it for long time. I was afraid that it might not work or break in between soon. Neither of them happened. It works fine.
5	1385856000	Great buy !It's cheap but usefulIt's not long but enoughWorth the money which you spend , HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
5	1385856000	Item works as designed.  Allows me to share music or watch a movie with my wife on long flights.  Very handy!!
4	1385769600	Works great.  Used it on the flight overseas so I can listen in with the same audio.  After that filight I haven't used it much.
5	1385596800	Love it, thank you for the excellent product at a very low price. The splitter cord works great with my music app and doesn't collect interference.
5	1385078400	Product does just what it says it will. Easy to use and connects to all my speaker headphones and small computer speakers. Was sent quickly.
1	1385078400	Mine worked for 5 seconds then stopped.  Neither the Left or Right side of the splitter work.  I've tried it on different devices and tried wriggling it around, but to no avail!
5	1385078400	WANT TO ADD MORE SPEAKERS TO YOUR COMPUTER OR ANY OTHER DEVICE THAT HAS A HEADSET OPENING. THIS WORKS IT MADE MY LAPTOP THATS SO SMALL YOU CANT HEAR SPEAKERS PLAY LIKE A BIG DESKTOP.I ADDED MY SOUND SYSYEM AND ANOTHER SMALL SOUND SYSTEM HOOK UP AND PLAY GREAT. NOW I CAN HEAR IT. THIS WORKS.
5	1385078400	This solved the problem of using two headsets while watching a film on my Kindle Fire.  My husband and I tried another splitter on the Auto Train last spring, but the contacts wouldn't hold.  This Belkin is a much better unit and provided really spectacular stereo sound as we watched an Amazon rental on the train in mid-November.
5	1384905600	I love this product. I used it for my Ipad to watch movies with my husband on the plane ride. It worked great!!!
5	1384646400	Speaker spliter that works.  I use it for my monitor speaker with my head phone speakers too.  I get perfect sound as if I pluged directly in to the computer.
5	1384560000	wow, never thought I love these jack as much as I do. I have these plugged in for my speakers and headphones. When I want to give  silence for the wife while I watch movies, this is perfect. No need to change the speaker every time. Great audio quality with its gold tip!
5	1384473600	Looking to split the sound out of your electronic device to two sets of headphones?  Use this.  Works just fine and is cheaper than what Radio Shack sells.
5	1384473600	This is a good quality product (as are most Belkin products). The cable and connectors appear to be very good quality. It has worked well and I recommend it to others.
5	1384387200	Love this product. I connect these to my water speakers nd to my ipod stereo to make it louder nd it looks really cool. You can connect these to almost anything. Nd they don't look cheap its a great price for these.
5	1384214400	item arrived as described. Now we can watch the same movie, listen to the same songs with my wife. Perfect setup for couple or friends.
5	1383868800	Does what it's advertised to do.  I can create a mini stereo system with this and my speakers.  Love it
5	1383782400	Great add for the sharing of headphones.  Worked perfectly.  Very Happy - nice for being @ NASCAR. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY
4	1383523200	I like it. It does what it is supposed to do, but the splitting itself isn't perfect. Depending on the type of headphones you plug in or how you plug it in, the sound might be a little off. Not every time but it happens enough to be noticeable. Not a killjoy. You just have to finagle it a little. Still, for the price you cant beat it. I purchased a different type at a local store and paid more and it works worse than this one. So, with that basis for comparison, I'm pleased.
5	1383350400	Works well, good quality construction. It was delivered quickly and in good condition. Hope it works over the long run, only time will tell.
5	1383264000	I bought these to split the sound from an iPad to two earphones for my kids on a long car trip. Worked perfectly!
5	1383091200	I ordered the headphone splitter so my girlfriend and I could share a movie on the iPad while we were traveling. It worked perfectly and we were both able to enjoy the iPad together.Belkin makes a good quality product that doesn't feel cheap. The price is perfect and I recommend it to anyone with similar needs.
4	1383091200	I buy belikin because I know it will work.  This is a simple splitter to use on your laptop or phone or any 3.5mm jack
5	1383091200	As cute as it may be when you're watching a movie or listening to music with a girl on a PED, I am not a fan of sharing earbuds. This splitter works great for allowing two sets of earbuds/headphones to be plugged into a single port. I definitely recommend this splitter to anyone who would have a use for one.
5	1383004800	Perfect for splitting 3.5mm audio cable. I didn't notice any sound distortion or volume change. I'm using it to connect two speakers to a projector and it works like a charm!
3	1382918400	This is the best splitter I've used, saying that I constantly have to keep the headphone jack just right in the inputs or the sound is off.
5	1382486400	I bought this for my little girls who like to listen to the same music on the school bus. Very well made and the 3.5mm headphones fits just fine.
5	1382400000	great product, does what it suppose to do. Great splitter for two people listening, and worked perfectly for my parents!
4	1382400000	This headphone splitter does exactly what it says it will do. The price is excellent. Its been very useful and is still working just fine after about a year.
4	1382313600	I needed the headphone splitter because my wife and I watch movies late at night and didn't want to bother neighbors. I read reviews saying it doesn't split full stereo feed and you could only listen left or right channel only. A little bit worried but ordered white one anyway. As soon as it arrived, I did a stereo sound check (you can find it from Youtube) and it worked just fine. I could hear all channels and I was happy.
5	1381968000	Just what I needed for a long road trip. Both me and my husband were able to watch movies and listen to music at the same time. Great splitter, doesn't lose sound quality.
4	1381968000	The shipping was as posted and arrived on time. The product has good quality but is not the same as when you have two separate head phone jacks. But for the price, you get what you need.
4	1381795200	It only cost $2 for me when I got it, and for that price it is a wonderful product.  Not too pretty or fancy, but gets the job done without noticeable drop in volume when split.  It doesn't quite attach on a keychain, but for $2 it's hard to expect more.
5	1381795200	It splits the output as it's supposed to do.  I have no complaints and for the price if you need this you'll be pleased.
5	1381795200	I needed this for our trip to Mexico so the fianc&eacute; and I could watch movies together! Works amazing. Fast shipment!
5	1381708800	Great investment, but the most important thing is to remember to bring them when traveling with someone else!!! Otherwise worthless! lol
5	1381622400	This has helped with sharing watching movies or listening to music while on a plane, it's basically what you would figure it to be but it works very well!
5	1381622400	Works great. Installed easy. Shipped fast. Hasn't caused any problems since I bought it. No regrets on my purchase and would recommend to others.
5	1381536000	Bought this for my husband because he trips over his studio cords and this causes extreme damage to the jacks. This breakaway cord solves the problem. Sound is still perfect with no buzzing.
4	1381536000	I have had a great time sharing music with my friends and not having to split my headphones with a friend.
5	1380931200	I bought this after reading many grave reviews that it doesn't provide proper stereo effect etc. Given the price, my risk was significantly lower and hence I decided to go with Belkin's brand value and ordered it. I was buying it for my Airways provided 2-pin headsets to be able to plug it into my iPhone or laptop.The item arrived and I simply plugged in my headset and then into the laptop. I have a very high standard about sounds and I was still mesmerized with the sound I got with full stereo effect.I guess it depends what sort of headset you are using with this unit. The sound effect will have impact of the quality of the headset too than just having this unit to blame in case of bad sounds. My two cents.I would sure say, given the price, you should give it a try. You never know, you might get positively surprised like me.
5	1380672000	Did what it was supposed to, made one headphone jack two. now both kids can watch the same show on the ipad and I can watch football in peace
3	1380672000	Pretty good product. Doesn't really connect to my MacBook Pro. Loses connection at times with just a little touch. Kinda have to twist and push for it to stay in place. Aside from that, it does what I wanted it for.
4	1380672000	When they work they are taken for granted but when they don't it's like the end of the world.This cable is a well made,high quality piece.
2	1380672000	lasted about 6 months of constant use...but...then seemed to fail.  Was cheap and enjoyed it while it lasted...but...might wanna spend a little more and get something better made if you want it to last.
1	1380672000	One of the jacks didn't securely fit the pin from my high-end headphones, so I had to hold them together the length of a trans-continental flight.
5	1380672000	Feels and works like a solid product! Cheaper than buying at BB and other places too.  Connections and joints feel solid as well to prevent wire failures.
5	1380585600	i don't know if the seller has a mix of types (at least two people mention 1 white 1 red output of a true L/R audio splitter, one who wanted that and one who didn't), but the pics don't have that and that's not what i received.  dunno if the guy is sending out mixed items, some faulty items, or what, BUT:the pictured item is what i got, and it's a stereo splitter - stereo goes to both outputs, so i can use headphones on 1 and a headset for phone calls on the other.for 3 bucks and the spread of review stars it has, i'd definitely buy again.
5	1380499200	Used this on the airplane with my 3 year old so we could both listen to the show playing. My primary reason was to use it to check volume. It's a great product and works as it should.
5	1380153600	My wife and I find this perfect for airline travel when we want to share the IPOD or DVD player without disturbing other passengers.
1	1380067200	I purchased this splitter to use with my Amazon Kindle Fire HD.  My Kindle is in the Amazon Case designed specifically for the Kindle Fire HD.  This splitter DOES NOT work with that case.  I was able to go to Radio Shack and find a splitter with a different connector design that allowed for the fact that the Kindle was in a case.
5	1379980800	Perfect for what I was looking for, they are white and look nice as they are supposed too, would buy again.
5	1379894400	Simple, works, no issues with this product.  Worked with several different applications, including on the airplane during travel. Always love Belkin.
5	1379894400	The splitter works as expected...it split a single jack in to two. Product works great and it was the right price.
5	1379635200	Worked great for our trip.  We connected them to the iPad with 2 sets of headphones for my children.  Worked perfect initially!
1	1379376000	Why was this a recommendation for my Audiovox Acoustic Research AW825 Mission Style Wireless Outdoor Speaker... when it doesn't have any place to plug it it!  Im disappointed that AMAZON recommended it as an add on
5	1379289600	Great splitter.  Didn't notice a decrease in sound.  Allowed me and my wife to watch a movie on the plane, no problemo.  Satisfied customer here.
5	1379203200	Does exactly what it is suppose to do. Plug in with a friend and smile. Needed to share headphone jack to watch amovie on a Kindle Fire.
4	1379116800	I bought several different headphone splitters hoping to find one that is durable enough to last.  This one is fine, but I would suggest either the Monoprice splitter that seems to be just as good and less expensive, or the RCI splitter is is better and only a bit more expensive.  But the plastic around the plug on both of those is much larger in diameter, so if the jack you are plugging into is recessed, this one would be the best of these options:$2.31 - good -MyGift Y Splitter$3.39 - better -This product - Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter$2.43 - better yet -Monoprice 3.5mm  Headphone Splitter$3.97 - best -RCA AH202 3.5mm Plug "Y" Adapter 3-Inch Cable
4	1379116800	This was purchased for a trip to allow sharing during the movies on the jet.  They are great for the price and beat retail shops.
4	1379030400	I only have one sound port on the back of my PC. I often use a head set so not to bother others so this works great to also have speakers that have a power switch to turn on if I need them.
5	1378944000	My boyfriend and I can now listen to music at the same time without having only 1 earphone in each ear with one another!
3	1378944000	Did it work? Yes. Did it work well? Meh. It dampened the volume some and also wouldn't work right with fancy Beats audio headphones. For it to work with those headphones I had to hold the button on the headphone chord the whole time to hear the full stereo sound and not just one side. Tried with a few pairs and a basic pair of headphones worked fine but didn't ever get the full volume put out by the tablet I used this with. We bought this to watch and listen to movies together on a long flight. Neither of us was impressed with the volume output of this splitter.
5	1378944000	What can you say about some wire? They are a nice color and allow me to split things when I want.
4	1378857600	We use this to add a second set of headphones when listening to a computer.  Sound quality is not effected, so sound quality appears to be the same when not using this device.
5	1378771200	THe work beautifully. I have them set up for my headphones and my speakers for my laptop. My only MINOR issue is that the connection to my head phones can come out a little easy. It's never a problem since I'm not moving around a lot and my headphone cord has ample length. Imagine two magnets that are kind of weak. They hold fine when left alone but it's not hard to separate them.
4	1378771200	this headphone splitter works as described, serves it purpose.  I use it for my sons to listen to movies on a road trip.  it's pretty durable.  happy with this purchase.
5	1378684800	works great when my daughter and I are watching a movie on my kindle..that way we don't bother my husband in the car, he hates not being able to listen to the radio
1	1378684800	Bought it after seeing the hundreds of reviews but unfortunately the plug is loose for my Macbook Pro stereo out and hence it constantly causes the sound to go back and forth between the mac speakers and external out with the slightest movement of my laptop.My laptop stereo out is perfectly fine since all other cables fit snugly into it except this one
5	1378512000	Work perfectly, great material, you will love it.work like a charm, buy it you will not regret. Cheap price, perfect condition
5	1378512000	I have used this item for perhaps 10 months now with no problems. It is splitting audio from a TV analog out to wireless headphones and a computer borne audio system. No problems, sounds great, so on and so forth. Buy with confidence.
5	1378512000	Plug ends are gold plated and it sounds great. No popping or fizzing.  Not much else to say except that this splitter works.
1	1378512000	One of the headphone jacks didn't work at all, and I could barely hear anything from the other.  You pay for what you get.
4	1378512000	Just used these headphones with my boyfriend as we were traveling on a 4-hour flight. The splitter worked great with no problems. The only thing I suggest is that both parties use the same headphones so that one is not louder than the other (as in our case).
5	1378512000	so far it's a great product and good to split when you have two kids listening to the same music at the same time on the same iphone/ipad product.
1	1378425600	.I ordered 3 units of this Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter from SAPFIRE.When it arrived, there was no proper Belkin bubble pack. Just a small little plastic bag held all the 3 units. There was nothing at all to indicate that Belkin manufactured this item. Anyway, I assumed it would work well and immediately plugged it in for use.What a mistake!Because from one output of the splitter, I could only hear the RIGHT channel. And from the other output of the splitter, I could only hear the LEFT channel.I could not believe my ears, so I tested all 3 units. They all turned-out to be the same.There was ABSOLUTELY NO STEREO OUTPUT AT ALL.What a waste of time, I spent testing and re-testing these items from SAPFIRE.It was a real disappointment!.
5	1378080000	Does what it was advertized to do and does it without lost of tone or volume and i like that. This is by &#34;Belkin&#34;, which was another reason i got this product, i have quite a few of their products. It seems to be of decent quality and weight, but most importantly it works great and i am satisfied with it and i do recommend this &#34;Belkin&#34; product. Thanks
5	1378080000	Not much really to say, Belkin is always good and does not disappoint.  I works just as expected, no more fighting when my kids need to share on device!
4	1377820800	Two kids, one tablet no problem. the belkin speaker and headphone splitter does the trick. good value for money light weight and very portable.
5	1377734400	Preserves L/R channels, nice white flexible cable, jacks are tight fitting.  Some devices can be difficult to plug in completely and remove from the jacks.
5	1377734400	Sometimes when i watch a movie on my tablet my wife wants to join. I got this so each of us can wear headphones (ipad audio sucks)
5	1377734400	very good price, they work as they should, and I'm looking forward to using them on trips with my wife.'nuff said.
5	1377734400	I like it because it allow me the flexibility i need by being able to unplug without having to wrestle with pulling it out of my laptop. Also because it's a heavier cord, it helps to keep your headphone and mic cords from wearing out real fast. &#34; I highly recommend this &#34;.
5	1377648000	It's amazing.I expected it to reduce the sound due to it splitting it to two.but it is not even noticeable.Sound quality is sooo good that I don't even notice that I have this splitter attached to my tablet
5	1377561600	Used this on a long flight.  My wife and I listened to the same music on my iphone.  These work well.  Good price.
4	1377561600	Works good for what it's intended to do, but the wire is too short. Should be at leat 1 ft but this is about 4 inches.
5	1377388800	This splitter, as many before me have said, copies both left and right channel audio to both outputs.  There's really not much more I can say about it.  It's small, functional, and appears to have no impact on audio quality.
5	1377216000	Good quality product for the price as described.Sound quality is fairly good.  We did not notice anydefects while listening to music simultaneously.
2	1377216000	It seems that volume in each headseat connected to splitter dropped significantly.But, there are no warnings about it anywhere.
5	1377216000	Connected 2 different sets of speakers just like I wanted it to no propblems will buy again and pass on to others.
5	1377129600	Wife: &#34;Why do you get to listen to the movie on the iPad and I don't&#34;(hand her one of earbuds)Wife: &#34;The people next to us are too loud I can't hear&#34;Me: &#34;Take the headphones...&#34;&#60;next flight with this device&#62;Wife: &#34;This is awesome.&#34;And it is true.  The fact that we're both getting full stereo sound, makes it wholly worth it.  Plus the price, can't beat it.
4	1376870400	I got this as a filler but it has definitely been useful. Now I will be able to watch movies with my friends even on the move.
4	1376784000	Used with my wife to watch videos from iPad on flights.  Works like a charm.  Great quality.  I would recommend.
1	1376697600	I bought this item some weeks ago, waited until it arrived to my country, and as i live in south america someone shipped it for me with other items bought at amazon from Miami to Medell&iacute;n, Colombia. It's a shame to have spent so much money on shipping costs, and the product doesn't even works. I don't recommend it. Please don't waste your $5 with this product, try a different one.  I bought it from Amazon.com LLC.
5	1376611200	no complaints here. Works as described. No audio distortions. Short wire length helps wire to ease wire management. What else is there to say?
5	1376524800	Lets you have 2 people listening to a movie or music on a laptop, or can be used for all sorts of things. Super handy when traveling with a friend. However, it reduces the volume more than I would have liked. Usually the device can crank up the volume enough to make both people happy, but it's not like the same volume reaches both sets of headphones. I'm happy though.
1	1376438400	The description says Belkin but it is clearly not a Belkin product. Belkin and the FBI should investigate this rip off. This sounds terrible and looks even worse.
5	1376438400	Seems to be built better than a lot of cables, chargers  and adapters out there that you can get cheap, and does the job well.  No loss of sound quality to the naked ear.  So for the price this is a steal.  I used this to split signal to two ihome speakers that you can get at walgreens for 20 bucks or on amazon for 16.  For under $50 spent I am very pleased with the setup featuring this cable.
3	1376352000	I would totally recommend this product cause you can use mutliple 3.5mm cords without having to unplug on to use the port.
4	1376352000	Works great if you are traveling and you & your significant other want to watch a movie on your laptop on your next flight.
1	1376265600	I got this so my daughter and I could listen to the same music or audio guides on my iPhone 4S.  Everything is plugged in properly and we are both using iPod earphones.  Unfortunately, I get all the treble and she gets all the bass.  Alas, tried it too late to return it.  I do not recommend unless you are trying to split the audio.
4	1376265600	This splitter does the job and is a good deal.  Perfect for sharing music, or setting up a home stereo requiring the splitting of 1/8&#34; plugs.
5	1376265600	Don't you hate it when you share headphones on the plane? One of you moves and the earbud falls out. So frustrating.This product is a neat, inexpensive, well built solution. Just use your own headphones and enjoy. The only downside is you can't select volume individually, which would be a nice addition, so if you have different headphones it can be an issue.
2	1376179200	Let me start by saying that it does preserve the stereo, at least for me. My BIG problem with it is, on first use, one of the female ports was already defective. Gotta hold/twist it in stupid way so it stays stable. So I'm very disappointed. Whether it keeps the stereo or not, if one of the splitting ports is simply defective, the item is useless.
5	1376006400	FOR THE PRICE AND AS LONG AS IT WORKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING OTHER THEN I WOULD NEVER BUY AND CLOSE MY ACCOUNT AND NEVER BY FROM AMAZON,SELLERS OR AMAZON FULLFILLED SELLERS AND JUST SAVE MY MONEY OR PUT A BULLET IN MY HEAD SO I DON'T HAVE WORRY ABOUT WASTING MONEY BUYING TECH THAT NEVER MAKES ME RICH BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO  HELL EVEN THOUGH I NOW WHERE I'M GOING IF THERE'S REAL GOD..
5	1376006400	love it... used it for long road trip with friends... split the movie sound just right... only downfall is I had to take my iPod case  when using overall 4.5/5
5	1375833600	Just what I expected, and it arrived much sooner than I thought it would. I haven't used it yet, but I trust that it is alright!
1	1375833600	I bought this to split out to headphones.  The connection is poor.  if you twist the cord or move very far the audio becomes crunchy and often loses the left or right side.
5	1375747200	This product conveniently splits one headphone jack into 2 which allows 2 people to listen from the same device. It's very convenient.
5	1375747200	The components were really great. I love how they are separated from each other and I love how it holds on tightly to the earphone jack. I recommend this item to anybody who has that friend out there that likes to listen to music with you or watch movies with
5	1375660800	I used this behind my aftermarket stereo to run a few 1/8&#34; cables into the back of the headunit...so I could have an ipod in the back seat for when passengers want to control music and one for up front.  Works well.  Probably wouldn't survive a nuclear attack but neither would I.
4	1375574400	This allows two people to watch the same movie on my laptop when traveling. The sound is fine, quality is good, yes, stereo is intact. The price is right!  Highly recommended!
4	1375574400	Got this so wife and I could watch movies together on the plane. It works quite well, but I wish it wasn't quite so bulky.
5	1375401600	Bought two of these five months ago, expecting one to break due to how cheap they are. Still have both, and they work just as well as when I got them.As for the stereo separation others have mentioned...it's kinda weird. I can plug two identical pairs of headphones up to this on an iPod, and both will get perfect stereo sound. Watching a YouTube video or anything like that goes the same way. Perfect stereo separation, just as advertised. I plug it into an audio program like Reaper, however, and the channels split. One headphone gets the left channel, the other gets the right. As of right now, I still have no idea why this keeps happening. If I ever figure it out, I'll try to let you know.So there you have it. Casual listening? Go ahead, buy it. Recording? That one may take some troubleshooting.
5	1375142400	This is a pretty simple product but the Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter works well. the shipping was fast and my ear-buds are thankful
4	1374883200	They are great use them all the time good buy for the price my friends can't believe the sound that comes out of them
3	1374796800	This item did it's job. It works well with my computer, however, it did not work with my iPod which was a slight disappointment.
5	1374796800	I use this almost every day to watch Netflix with my sister on my tablet and it works great and was very cheap.
5	1374710400	This splitter serves a small but very useful  purpose for the lowest price.Have not seen a case of lowered quality while using this product.It is very handy for using while travelling with my media devices, and I do not have to share one end of my ear phones with anyone anymore :)
4	1374624000	good splitter. allows both headphones to hear the same thing. does not split the headphones down left right. for that these are a good pair of splitters. the jack though is very thick and may not fit through your case. thats its only con
5	1374537600	Not much to review for this kind of product, but it does it's job perfectly. No loss of signal and each output has the exact amount of signal so it splits the signal very well, as expected from a Belkin product. The fact that it is two individual wires instead of a solid input is also very helpful with the extra lee-way room. Great buy
1	1374537600	Do not buy.I didn't expect much because of the cost.  Consider it a lesson learned.This is not a Belkin product - false advertising.The product doesn't make a good connection with headphones.  Both sets of headphones I tried with it had volume control and both if you fidgeted just right would get stereo at times.  Also, for some reason if you held down the call button the stereo would work.Not pleased at all, now I am buying a different product because this one does not do what I need it to do at all.
5	1374105600	Cheap, fast delivery, and gets the job done.  Helped hook up 2 speaker sets into one TV.  What else would you want?
5	1373932800	It works great! Now me and my son can watch a movie on my laptop! I wouldn't suggest any other product
5	1373760000	Manage to hook to speakers with clarity and it does the job intended. I would recommend and buy them again
5	1373673600	Just as advertised this adapter allows 2 connections to be made from one plug. We use it when traveling to plug in two headphones into one iPod
4	1373587200	My dual HP monitors both have speaker in them.  I wanted to use both sets, thus the splitter.  It works fine.
5	1373500800	It does what it needs to do and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. The construction is nice and I love how short it is so you don't have to worry about it tangling up or anything.It doesn't separate the sound like others have said and it arrived on time.
1	1373500800	Well, the title says it all. I received it in the mail yesterday. Plugged it in this morning and just tried it. I had the same experience as the other reviewers. Split audio between left and right channels. So thoroughly disappointed that this issue still persists.
3	1373414400	Tested it by plugging my speakers directly into my phone, and then through this cable. With the cable, I get a lot of static with the tiniest movement of the phone. The female ends don't seem staticky, but require a lot of force to connect.Also, the male end is.. um.. about twice the girth of the one shown in the photo, with octagonal shape. Looks odd attached to a small device like a phone, but not a big deal.Note: there is no mic channel on this, don't expect to be able to use your phone headset's mic!
5	1373414400	As expected. Works well.It has no moving parts, so no complications. The item needs to just pass the signals, which it does very well.
5	1373414400	Very simple device, so that our kids can listen to the iPad on headphones in the backseat, and my wife and I spared listening to Phineas and Ferb.  Fair price.  Solid construction.White is nice; we have had three black one before, but they get lost in dark corners of bags, seats, etc..
5	1373414400	Works great.  Item arrived as described within a reasonable amount of time.  Sound was good and even split, was still able to drown out the noisy airplane.
5	1373328000	I havent see any loss of audio quality with this headphone splitter, I use this with my Bose headphones as well as I have tried in my car. Good quality product. Happy with the purchase.
3	1373328000	They sent the wrong size and it wont work with my Ipad so no way to tell if works well or not...
5	1373241600	Exactly what it advertises it would do and what i wanted! No loss of sound! Great!! Quality Product!!Gold Plated splitters are the best!
5	1373241600	I got this so two of us could listen to things at the same time. It does that. It is not the crappy stuff you get with new dvd players. It's thicker and sturdier. I see it lasting a long time.
5	1373155200	thank you thank you thank ! been  looking else  where too could not find a even good one  now this works the best  and I can share it with others ! my Friends who can listen to my kind music with out bothering others!
4	1373155200	The product is exactly as promised... Arrived within the date promised..The price is great.. Does a good job just as the expensive cases.
5	1373155200	The speaker jack splitter works perfectly , Great price and I love the free shipping! I used this to connect computer to home stereo.
1	1373068800	This product made me really excited and then when I got it and it didn't work I was really disappointed! It made me soo upset!!
5	1373068800	It was a great product for the price.  It was used to let kids watch a portable dvd player.  Saved the day!
5	1372982400	Now the grandkids can all watch the same movie at the same time, without drowning our conversation out.  I love that two can hook up into one headphone jack!
5	1372809600	I give the Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter 5 stars because it works as advertised. Not much else to say about it.
5	1372809600	When the grandkids come to play &#34;Plants and Zombies&#34; on my computer they like to do it together, so with this splitter and two sets of headphones they both get to hear all the action. Has saved lots of squabbles over who gets to wear the earphones!
4	1372723200	Really like this product, No issues with the clarity and would recommend to anyone who would like to listen to your ipad, ipod, iphone with two headphones.
1	1372636800	The handle is thick and it does fit in the jack if the phone has a case. In my particular case it is SPIGEN SGP iPhone 4 Case iPhone 4S Case Modello Flexible SOFT TPU Case.
5	1372550400	could not believe the price.For less than $4.00 and the fact I have PRIME with no shipping or tax,It cannot be beat.Works great.Of course I'm no electronic nerd but it sounds good to me.My wife and I can both watch and hear films at the same time.I have found no problems what-so-ever.I use this on my kindle fire HD 7&#34;.
5	1372550400	Keeps separation! Use it with my surround rig works great. Best cable for this purpose, beats the $20 proformance wise.
5	1372464000	Does what it has to and is sturdy enough if you need to use it often. Its a little on the larger side, so I wouldnt recommend it if you need it for something small, like a iPod nano.
4	1372464000	Provides output to my speakers and headset. Works great. The sound quality is not affected by having two outputs at the same time.
1	1372464000	Only one of the ports worked, we bought it for our girls to watch a movie on a trip. Since only one port worked they fought the whole time.
5	1372464000	cheap price, works great. great headphone splitter. its been a couple of months and still works great up to now.
5	1372291200	This worked perfectly, just as described by seller.  I would purchase this again if needed.  I use this for my headphones or speaker and it works great.
4	1372291200	pros-it works as described. I use it to split my speakers and headset.-cheap pricecons-if they are both on, the sound varies back and forth depending on how much volume you are using on headset. What I do sometimes is just unplug the speakers if i want to use the headset exclusively and vice versa. otherwise, i would have to turn down the headset volume in order to get the speaker volume up.I would buy it again if I lost the one I am currently using.
5	1372204800	This works as expected. I was able to use dual speakers for my device. I would recommend to a friend.
5	1372118400	I was quite happy to find that unlike other splitters that I have purchased in the past, the amount of room between where the insert plug was located and where it split into two outlets was quite long, which gives more flexibility and makes it harder to damage.
5	1372118400	This is a very well made splitter at a very good price. It has a beefy male plug covering so it is easy to grab hold onto the plug to push in and pull out of the socket. Got another one for my son who lives in San Diego and he likes his also for the same reasons as mine.
5	1372118400	I use it to duplicate the signal from my headphone output on my keyboard; one to my headphone and other to the pc, so I could listen to the music while recording it without delays.
1	1372032000	This product did not work at all . Good thing I found the one I thought I lost. It may been bad luck .
5	1371859200	The Belkin Headphone Splitter is a good investment.  We use it on airplanes and kids use it in the car.  Recommend it highly.
1	1371686400	Received the wrong and defective item. The splitter is 10 inch long. The signal is unstable and requires twisting for establishing a solid signal. Very disappointed in Amamax.
4	1371686400	It is very helpful if you want to connect two headphones to a laptop so that you can share a audio/video on a laptop without disturbing the rest in the room. It is worth the price.
5	1371600000	My old splitter from the Shack broke since it always hangs off of the laptop.  This should work better since the splitter has wires putting less stress on the jack.  So far it's been several months and it's worked.
5	1371600000	Fast service and item as described.  These are perfect for our trip to London so we both can listen and watch movies from our new DVD player.  Highly recommend this seller
5	1371600000	use this for The Ihome speakers when at the beach,real handy and compact, I have them stored in a plastic case when I travel to the beach
1	1371513600	I bought this to split head-set and desktop speakers.Plugged it into my pc audio out, and plugged in my desktop speakers, it created an annoying audio common-mode noise.tried re-seating a few times still makes the common-mode noise. I went to Amazon returns and printed out a return label, and noticed that it was not prepaid It was shipped from a place called Amamax who emailed me to asked me to rate this product.its a $4.00 item and return shipping cost more then the item.
5	1371513600	Good product and deal. Does the job. My kidslve it when they have to watch a movie togheter using the headphones. Thanks
5	1371513600	the audio volume(decibels) does drop a little bit when using this splitter for 2 pairs of ear phones, This obviously is expected.I use these to share movies with a friend on my laptop on trips. I also use this as a connection to my speakers for my desktop so I also have a free slot to simply plug in my headphones without worrying about unplugging anything else. I dothis because my on-board audio broke, but the front slot did not.You can expect the audio decibels to cut in half, because the jack won't put out more. Don't use a ton of these to make a giant chain of audio splitters for like even 4 headphones because there are ohm resisters within any speaker, and the jack can only take so little before you blow it out. The more speakers you add, the less ohms exist, and too little or too many ohms and you break the jack or your headphones.
5	1371513600	Works great with Ipad's and allows 2 people to get audio from the same device which is great when watching movies or listening to audio. Highly Recommend.
5	1371427200	My son and I enjoy watching movies together on his laptop, but we often have trouble with the laptop speaker being loud enough. This was the perfect solution, and the sound was clear and loud enough.
4	1371427200	This splitter is fine. It has durable connections. The end to connect to my iPad with a cover is too large to fit. Works well on any port with some room around the entry.
5	1371340800	I split time between 3 pc's, two of witch are on a KVM switch and the other not. Having multiple inputs on monitor allows me to use 1 for all three. The splitter allows me to use the same speaker system on all three.
4	1371340800	I liked it and it works just fine, perhaps I expected a bit longer cable. Otherwise no problems, I recommend it.
5	1371081600	use it on a airplane for my wife and i to share listening to movies on my nook or listening to music on my phone
5	1371081600	Not too much to this.  I've got the splitter to get sound from my computer to both my computer speakers and my home entertainment center in another room.  Works great and nothing wrong with the sound coming out of either speaker set.
1	1370995200	I ordered six. They arrived from overseas in unmarked plastic bags. This added a few-day delay, but not an extraordinary delay. Nothing really identifying them as Belkin.The wires have a small diameter. Smaller than I would expect from the photo. Smaller than I'd like for durability. But if they just sit behind my computer to provide signal to both my amplified headphones and to my amplified speakers (my intended use), it's probably not an issue. I power one or the other, depending on whether my daughter is sleeping. (Kids are such angels when they sleep.)ONE STAR BAD: Four of the six I received swap the left and right channels on both the sockets. I tested this carefully - I'm an electrical engineer and known for not making statements without thoroughly checking my conclusions.The workaround was to plug two of the channel swapping cables in series . . . :-OOthers have stated other quality problems. Others have been perfectly happy.I suspect there is variable quality with this item, based on other reviews and my experience.
2	1370995200	I did not get a Belkin brand splitter from this seller. I was sent a splitter that is much chunkier than the one pictured, and it came in an unlabeled bag. It is not gold plated.
1	1370908800	Male end will not go into Kindle Fire when cover is on the Kindle, which is necessary to watch video. Female end will not accept standard apple head phone jack nor the bose headset. Basically, it is useless.
5	1370822400	I needed this product so i could hook up my surrond sound... Recomended if you have friends and want to share head phones
5	1370822400	I got the belkin packaged ones and they are the true stereo splitters I was expecting.  One thing I hadn't thought of and should have is that when splitting the audio you lose some volume.  Hopefully the device you buy these for has enough output to compensate.  My iPad had just enough at full volume for two people to watch a movie together and still hear it aboard a 727 in flight.Also be sure to use matching headphones.  If they don't at least have the same impedance one will be louder than the other.
4	1370736000	The splitter came in handy when my wife and I were listening to Rick Steves take us on a tour around the Acropolis in Greece, and a tour around Athens.
3	1370736000	Not a whole lot to say here. Bought an electronics accessory, it does its job. Construction is solid, sound quality is good. Well done.UPDATE: After only a few uses over the course of about a year, the soldered connections are beginning to give out and sound quality can be pretty bad. You have to play the fidgeting with the wire game all the time, which is really annoying. I usually like Belkin for these type of things, so maybe I just got a bad one. But be wary!
5	1370736000	The price is great. Great when traveling and sharing my IPad with my husband. It is small enough to put in one's pocket.
5	1370649600	I purchased this product to connect a home theater and my microcomponente at same time from my TV and it works perfectly. Great product
5	1370649600	The splitter works great and has great sound quality. I bought this to use it on my PC to be able to connect speakers and headphones in the same jack.
5	1370649600	Does what it is supposed to do. Able to connect two headphone jacks and listen to 1 device. I'd recommend this to a friend.
2	1370649600	It's good for the price, but sometimes the ports don't work very well. Sound comes out good on both headsets, but occasionally have to re-plug as the sound washes in and out
3	1370649600	So far the splitter works, but the connection to the radio is loose. If someone bumps into it, it falls out. Sometimes I tape it on. As far as the sound goes, the music loses a little quality, but for my purposes it's good enough. Two kids can listen to one radio.
4	1370476800	The only drawback is that one of the female 3.5 imputs doesn't work very well. sometimes it requieres to unplug your headphones and plug it back
4	1370476800	No complaints, works as a way for us to use two headphones so we can watch shows on our Roku 3. I have also used this product with a TRS adapter to listen to recorded audio for a podcast me and a buddy are creating.
5	1370390400	Great price but best of all,  it  let's both sets of speakers hear at the same  sound level,  very good product!!!!!!
4	1370390400	Enabled me to enjoy dual iHome stereo speaker setup with my iPad- great sound for such a small &#34;stereo.&#34; Great for places like your car (or desk) when you don't want to use headphones.
5	1370304000	This splitter has good sound and is great for travel.  Bought it to use on my Kindle Fire HD mainly during flights.  It is great for downloaded audio books or movies.
3	1370304000	I used this to split the audio from my iPad so my wife and I could watch a movie on the plane. I needed to gently twirl the connectors until we both got sound. I barely got it to work. This is going into the trash and I am going to find something else for our next trip.
4	1370217600	It works well. I did have problems  using my iPhone headphones with it because the volume was too low. Other than that it does what its supposed to do.
4	1370217600	Tried out the splitter, works great.  Now we can watch a video together with our head phones while traveling on the plane or in our hotel room.
4	1370131200	there is nothing more simple in the world of tech. if you need a audio splitter buy these simple as that.
5	1370044800	Splitters works well, not static if you adjust it.  sometimes when I plug it in, I can hear a small amount of statics, but if I twist the connection a little, the static disappears.I use this on my Mac Mini to split the audio to a set of Bose speaker and Bose headphone, so I don't have to keep on reaching to the back of the mini trying to switch out the audio port.  I just have to turn my headphone one and turn the speakers off.one problem with the splitter, Left and right audio are switchedI manage to correct this on my Bose speaker, by switching the left and right audio jack on the speaker itself, but there is nothing I can do with the same problem on the headphone.none the less, the item does the job, quality of the sound is descent, great buy for the quality and the price.
4	1370044800	It's purchase completed the task. Small and inexpensive, but it does the job. Now what I need is a good programmer. Thanks.
4	1369958400	I ordered this so that we could watch movies on my laptop without disturbing others.  The connections are a little tight, but I am pleased overall.
4	1369872000	If you want to use two sets of headphones with one device this is what you need.  The plastic around the plug is a little thick so it didn't fit easily with the otter box but it still works
4	1369872000	So my wife and daughter could enjoy a movie on an iPad at the same time I bought this splitter.  While some reviews expressed concern with volume differences I DID NOT experience this.  These splitters are made of quality materials and it effortlessly fits in a backpack or bag.Great product and great price.
5	1369785600	Lightweight and priced right.We keep this with our headsets for travel or just enjoyment at home.....Bought two, even!!  :&#62;)
1	1369699200	This splitter has different sound levels in your ears. This throws my entire hearing off. e.g. the right ear is about twice as loud as the left ear in my headphones and the person I am sharing with has the exact opposite problem. I know that this can be an issue because of the way that the wiring works, but that is ridiculous! Why would I even use it?!
3	1369699200	Small and easy to use: is there any better way to share your audio on a long trip? Concerning any sound complaints: I have none. This splitter seems to work as well as any other.
4	1369526400	This splitter does what it's supposed to and the output is excellent. However, I would have preferred a smaller/slimmer jack. The jack on this one does not fit into my Samsung GS3, so  I use a short extension cable with a slimmer jack.
5	1369353600	I was actually pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product. I would recommend that anyone looking for this item to surely get this. It is top notch!!!
4	1369353600	This product works very well. It works as advertised and it sounds great! I would certainly recommend buying this item!
1	1369353600	The connections inside the splitter are terrible, you have to have the wire in the perfect spot to make the music you listen to normal in each part of the split.
5	1369267200	This is exactly what I wanted and it was very cheap. I also don't hear any volume change when using this headphone splitter like some of the reviews mention.
5	1369267200	This does exactly what it is supposed to do. I purchased this brand because I am familiar with it. Would recommend.
5	1369267200	Bought this for a vacation as an add on item, good audio quality. Works exactly the way it is supposed to, so I am happy.
1	1369180800	I should have read the negative reviews before I bought this. I wanted to set up two different speaker sets from my computer. This is supposed to do that. But it did not. What it did was split the signal into left and right, and if you jiggled it and left it halfway unplugged, then it would produce the full signal. I made sure it was not my speakers or my speaker wires that were the problem. No, it was this thing. Then when I go to return it, I have to pay return shipping. For a defective item, that is a bogus policy. Don't buy it. I ended up buying another splitter from cablestogo, which also sells on Amazon, although I didn't see their splitter here. I got the 6ft one because the short one was out of stock, and it works great--the way this one was SUPPOSED to work.
4	1369180800	This is a great splitter.Pros:1) Great connection2) The headphones click in keeping the headphones attached to it even if it is lightly tugged3)extremely durableCons:1) My apple earpod's microphone an volume control don't work with this splitter attached to it2) it's a little bigger than it looks (about 9&#34;)
1	1369094400	I ordered five of these.  They came in generic packaging, no indication that they are Belkin (Belkin is pretty good about putting their name on their products!).  On all five sets the stereo is not right.  Using my Output balance on my computer(and I tried it on more than one computer), sliding it all the way to the right does what you would expect, I can only hear from the right side. But sliding all the way to the left increases the volume on the left side, but the sound is still basically centered. The effect of this is that there is improper balance from headphones.  I was about to edit a Garageband recording because I thought that the panning was set incorrectly.  Luckily I thought to listen without the splitter.I am very disappointed in these, especially since they're obviously not Belkin, and they don't work correctly.  I know they are inexpensive, and apparently I got what I paid for, but I thought I was getting a good deal on Belkin equipment, not a knock-off that doesn't work.
5	1369094400	I needed a way to split the audio signal between my PC speakers and the signal going to my FM transmitter.  This inexpensive splitter allows me to do just that without compromising sound quality.It automatically sends audio to my PC speakers and simultaneously sends a high quality signal to my FM transmitter.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.Before I had to plug the transmitter into one of the speakers, just like a headset, and it automatically muted the sound from the speakers. Not any more! Now I can listen to both my PC speakers and my FM Radios around the house.
5	1368921600	The Belkin 6" 3.5mm 1male to 2 female splitter sold by Amamax, on the Amazon.com site, is a great little product and just what I have been looking for. It is constructed of excellent materials, the cable is heavy and shielded to reduce noise and interference and the plug and jacks are heavy duty. I am very happy with this splitter, and I have come to know that with Belkin, Amamax, and Amazon, you can't go wrong.
4	1368921600	they work pretty good. I have like three to use many different systems at a time and they work well.
1	1368835200	Have tried this on both my Kindle Fire and my MacBook Pro and with different headphones and can't get stereo.
4	1368835200	My kids each usually have their own earphones/headphones because of their own devices - tablets, iPods and portable DVD players.  In the moments they actually are getting along, they sometimes want to watch the same thing, listen to the same music or hear what the other person is hearing.  It doesn't last long though when they have to share earphones (one person with the right ear and the other with the left ear).  I found that with the splitter, they still feel that they are listening to their own devices but they laugh at the same time, they sing the same song, and speak about what they're listening to without distracting me and their dad.  Something so small -- what a difference!
4	1368748800	the item was shipped ontime.  it's ok to use. It working fine. it's worth for your money. I would buy it again. If i need to.
1	1368662400	This doesn't even work for my headphones and besides that, this was supposed to be an add-on for what I really wanted but instead I got this without what I wanted.
5	1368662400	Love the device...it's a wonderful!  My wife and I watch movies together from our android phone while sharing fantastic ear splitting sound.
5	1368576000	I bought this so that I could use both my light up water speakers and generic computer speakers (w/sub) at the same time. Works great!
5	1368489600	I bought this so I can have two headphones plugged into my Ipod so my friend can listen to my music too.
5	1368403200	I am not sure what other fellow buyers are experiencing though for me this truly does split stereo sound. Very well made good quality. Thanks for having this. I used it for my home gym to split TV sound from one 3.55mm outlet to two of my workout machines. A must buy.Update Sep 09, 2013: Still working great.
3	1368403200	I haven't tested it out but the other reviews commented about the good audio quality. I mean, that's a prerequisite when you chose this item isn't it. Other than that, I guess its due to my ignorance but I didn't expect the cable to be so huge. Too big for my liking.  Otherwise, it would be great.
4	1368316800	Handy little thing. I didn't find compromises in quality of sound. I put it to use occasionally. Does it's job. Not much else to say.
5	1368316800	This was exactly what I was looking for to use with my iMac to split my headphones and my speakers. Can't beat the price!
5	1368316800	Worked great, my parents were happy with it. You can't beat the price! You should try this, you will not be disappointed.
5	1368316800	Did the job I needed. Small size ideal for an already crowded  tower unit. Ordered a second one after this one worked so well.
4	1368144000	Order arrived prompt and in new condition. My only trouble is that sometimes i have to unplug and replug my devices to get it to work. For the price. And effectiveness. I rate it a 4.
1	1368144000	I buy this splitter to connect two sets of speakers as there was only one output port. all this product do is make the output to my speakers weaker as i can barely hear a sound. what waste, thank goodness it was cheap.
5	1368057600	No problems with this item. Works perfectly. I would recommend this to all and its most deservingly a good five star rating.
1	1368057600	I use these a lot and to be honest I don't love them at all. I have to keep moving them around a lot for me and my fianc&eacute; to both be able to fully hear. They weren't expensive so I guess you get what you pay for but I would suggest buying a higher quality product.
5	1367971200	Does the job fine and works well.  I didn't get the loss on the one side that other people were talking about.  My wife and I are going to use this on our tablet on the airplane for a 6 hour flight!
5	1367798400	I bought these splitters to watch TV, listen to music or to play video games late at night so as not to disturb the children or my neighbors.  So far they work great.
5	1367798400	Excellent quality and now My wife and I can share the audio form her tablet while watching videos when we travel.
1	1367625600	The connections wont go all the way into the two female ends. I have tried two different male connection and both go about 3/4 of the way in. At first it wasn't an issue with sound quality but now the speaker volume is reduce by 1/2 and it only comes out of one of the two speakers.
5	1367625600	I was skeptical after reading some reviews saying that it didn't split audio into 2. Mine did not split left and right like many negative reviews I read.
5	1367366400	Good for share music, I bought it for a trip with my girlfriend, we can listen same music together, good
4	1367366400	The headphone splitter works well and it let us both watch movie and listen to it on the flight. There was no sound loss or degradation in quality when we used it.
5	1367366400	This is the perfect little splitter, a super good price that does the same job as more expensive models.  High Quality
2	1367280000	Bottom line up front: The product seemed to have a very poorly constructed contact inside, as the slightest wiggle would either disconnect it from the device (male end), or cause loud static.  I'm obviously unsure if this is representative of the product line, as I only bought one, but I won't be doing the return as the shipping would cost about as much as the product!  Thankfully, Amazon took care of it for me even though I bought it from a third-party merchant (via Amazon).  So I'm still quite happy with the service.Feature-wise, this would be a great product.  Perfect length, good price, lightweight.  I'll be buying a different brand though to do this task.
4	1367193600	It's simple. it looks like the picture, and so far it works fine for me. it's short in length though, just like the picture.
5	1367193600	JUST AS I EXPECTED FOR A BELDEN PRODUCT! GREAT QUALITY! SOLVED MY AUDIO SPLITTING PROBLEM RIGHT OFF, AND WITHOUT DROPPING THE OUTPUT LEVEL! THANKS BELDEN! J.F.F
5	1367193600	This product was used to connect two sets of headphones to one laptop for twins on an international flight.  It did not let me down.  Highly recommend.
4	1367107200	This works as intended. Share the audio with someone that comes out of whatever audio source that has a standard headphone jack. I haven't needed to use it too much, but it has been perfect for what I needed it for. Well, it has seemed to have a touchy connection at times, but not enough to drop it below 4 stars. Sometimes the audio cuts out a little, but if I move the jack around a little and find the right spot, it will be just fine. Belkin is a good quality brand and it shows enough in this product.
5	1367107200	Not quieter, keeps all sound information. :-) My boyfriend has monitor headphones and I got some cheap ones but he tells me that his music sounds the same with or without the splitter attached. Now I have a personal dj. :-D
4	1367020800	It worked very well you should get it. Good price too this is very practical if you are going on vacation
5	1366934400	I bought this so that I could use my tablet to watch a movie on a plane with another person.  It worked just fine.
5	1366848000	I use this splitter out from my computer, one side to a pair of headphones and one to a receiver.  It does the job well and at a low cost.  Very happy with the purchase and haven't noticed any loss of sound quality while using this splitter.
4	1366848000	plugs in nicely and splits the signal to two head sets. wish it was a little longer but thats what the ext cable is for i guess
3	1366675200	Come on! It's a cable, if it works and its low cost great, ya da, ya da, ya da, ya da.
5	1366675200	Works as advertised with my MacBook Pro and iPad. Great size for travel! Allows two users to connect and both get a full audio experience.
5	1366675200	Does exactly what it says it's going to do!  No audio degradation and no added hum from using this coupler/splitter.  Very effective!
4	1366588800	Works fine. It's a cable, so you don't have to expect too much. I bought 2, so I can mix 2 microphones in one and 2 speakephones in another one. I use it with my wife to chat together with other people on Skype.
5	1366588800	This product does exactly what it is supposed to. I use it on my laptop when I want to share music with my friends while we are studying in a coffee shop.
5	1366502400	words fine and its perfect for me and my friends thank you now we dont have to share our head phone or earphone
5	1366502400	Needed a splitter for a dvd player so both kids could watch a movie on it, and both use their head phones. Did the job, and only cost a couple bucks.
5	1366329600	great cable. even works as a female to female, which is amusing. doesn't reduce quality. If only i knew where it was.
5	1366243200	This splitter is was shipped to my in the expected time, it was cheap and surprise, well made.  I'd order another if I every need to.
5	1366243200	Not much to be said. This little guy does the trick perfectly and seems durable. At $2 it's hard to find a complaint.
5	1366156800	I use these when tutoring my students at the library.  It lets me listen in on what they hear so I can help them further.  It was a great buy.
5	1366156800	Its a splitter that allows me to not be tortured by my children fighting over a toy. Anything that makes my life easier is a win-win! Its cheap and I will never travel without it!
5	1366156800	Met all my expectation! Highly recommended. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
3	1366156800	I didn't expect the volume to diminish so much. My computer speakers on full volume are not loud at all.
5	1366156800	Perfect size for my Iphone using my Otterbox cover! Works life a charm! You will not be disappointed with this product.
4	1366070400	I bought this so that I can connect 2 sets of headphones or speakers through one output. It works perfectly and I had no trouble connecting anything. I'm not convinced the product I received is from Belkin though. The product I received looks very similar to the one on this page I ordered but it has minor differences. The first difference I noticed was that the product I received had longer cables then the one in the picture. The second difference I noticed was that the picture has kind of a golden color on the connectors and mine is silver. The third and final difference I noticed was on the single connection mine had a lot more lines on the input's cover than the picture has. However after thoroughly testing the product I can say I was quite satisfied with it even though I don't think it is the real thing. When plugging in one headphone on it there is no volume drop but when I plug in the second one there is a very slight, tiny, not really annoying volume drop on it. The sound was perfect even with both headphones plugged in I had no problems with static or distortions. I discovered that when I plug in a powered speaker like from my pc and I plug in headphones I had no volume drop so it seems that the volume only drops when whatever is plugged into it isn't powered. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to split audio from one source to two. I would also buy this product again if I need to.
5	1366070400	I recently tried this out while on vacation. I used it to connect both my son's and my headphones to my iPad so we could watch a movie on the plane. Worked very well and the sound was nice and clear.
5	1365984000	This splitter worked perfectly for our long flights, allowing us to share the iPad screen easily. It sounded like stereo was coming out correctly.
1	1365811200	The item is said to be a BELKIN speaker and headphone splitter.  It is not BELKIN.  It has no identification on it.  I have not tried it and since it is not worth returning,I'll just toss it away.  I am putting AmaMax on my DO NOT BUY list.UPDATE-Through Amazon's Marketplace rules I received a full refund with minimal effort.Thank You Amazon.
5	1365724800	I do not know how to put twenty more words on this product other than to say it does what it is suppose to do.
5	1365638400	simple effective works great costs little so it was a better deal than my local Radio Shack. shipped in a decent timeframe
5	1365638400	I dont know why people are saying that the sound doesnt work right?? It works awesome for me. Thank you..
5	1365552000	Crystal clear, I use it when I have people listen to the song I'm playing on the drums as I play and listen to it4 thumbs up amazing!!
5	1365465600	Worth the brand. Around $2 for Belkin. No distortion whatsoover.Note: Use similar type of headphones. Sound differs from headphone to headphone.
5	1365465600	I bought this cable to split out my speaker system. They work well. No loss in signal. Belkin make good products to use.  SW
5	1365292800	Works great! Exactly what I asked for, good quality, great price, fast delivery. I don't exactly like sharing in-ear earbuds, so using this works like a charm when you want to listen to music together! Perfect for those boring, long bus rides on field trips.
5	1365120000	This works good. I've been looking for one of these to use when I watch a  movie with a friend of listen to music with a friend with headphones. Good for the price!
5	1365120000	This is just what I needed to split between my PC speakers and headphones without having to switch chords all the time.
5	1365120000	This is great if you are going on a plane with two toddlers and one iPad. Just sit them next to each other.
5	1365120000	This item was purchased for my granddaughter, my daughter loves them. She uses for my granddaughter and her day care children!
5	1365033600	This splitter is very sturdy in construction. The wires are thick with strain reliefs at each connection. The total length of the 2 that I got is just shy of 7 inches from the tip. There is a solid positive click when plugged into, so a good connection is insured.Some reviewers have stated that it splits into 2 mono signals. I checked both of mine and they each deliver a clean, no loss, noiseless, stereo signal. All I can say is they either got defective splitters or as others have commented, the plugs were not pushed completely in, as it does take a solid push till you hear it click.It is also possible that some splitters that were purposely designed to split to right and left, or mono, were mixed in with the stereo splitters. Mine came in clear plastic bags with no labels, so this is entirely possible. And in my opinion, most likely, since how could almost 1/3 of the reviews be 1,2,or 3 star. This many people can't be wrong. Especially since mine are excellent quality with no fault to be found.*The picture shows a gold plated splitter, and mine are not. I believe you should get what the picture leads you to think you are getting.  If you got one that works as described, then it's still a great deal.
5	1364947200	me gusta el producto muy bueno, es un excelente producto que acabo de comprar. y me llego a tiempo. lo esperaba
5	1364860800	I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great quality splitter. The plugs fit securely and the cord is malleable but not cheap feeling. I have two of these and will purchase this one over the ones I have gotten in the past.
5	1364860800	This &#34;Y&#34; allows two cables or headphones to merge into one.  I find it very useful for connecting two sets of headphones/ear bods to my ROKU remote control.
5	1364860800	Good product with a good price. You could pay a lot more for a different brand, but I will probably lose this within a few months anyway, so why pay more?
5	1364774400	I bought the little speakers for his I Pod and thoughtthis would be perfect, for them and it is.  He just loves his speaker and thesplitter works great.
3	1364688000	the sound in both headphones is ok .... but i must turn the plug many times to adjust the volume
5	1364428800	this item is perfect and made well.  Us it with two headsets from a player, tablet or other device that has only one audio output port.
4	1364342400	This works and does what it was designed to do.However, the volume starts to drop for one side when the other has a higher volume.
5	1364342400	Great product. We are planning on using them on the plane so the kids can share a back of seat tv screen.
5	1364342400	the build quality for this splitter seams excellent.  the snap connecting into another 3.5 mm cord is very good and reassuring of the product. the connector area is very thick, like it is well protected.  if plugging into phone with case you may have difficulty although it does taper down in size.  for my uses it is perfect so solid 5 stars.fyi, sound quality and sound is not diminished at all
5	1364256000	perfect for a long drive or long flight with a friend. perfect price as well for what it does.  I recomend it
5	1364256000	Not much to say, it does what it advertises and Belkin doesn't try to rip you off with gold plated connectors and other nonsense.  At just over $2, you can't go wrong with this purchase!
5	1364169600	At $2.00, this is a much better price than the $8,00 price for a splitter at a local electronics store!I use it to provide surround sound from my TV for my family while at the same time sending the TV sound through  bluetooth to my Phonak hearing aids so I can turn up my hearing aid volume without sound-blasting my family.Paul LearnedHamilton, OH.
4	1364083200	I bought the speaker and headphone splitter to use in my classroom with a Leap Pad. I wanted two children to share the Leap Pad, and the splitter works wonderfully.
3	1363996800	These do work but are a bit thick so don't work well with my phone case/s so I have to use a cord extension to make it work. It took a long time for this to send and did not get here in the ETA window. All in all I will be using these but my advice is pick some up at Wal-mart or a Convenient Mart.
5	1363910400	I Love this product. Other reviewers are right, this splitter does loose volume when 2 headphones are connected, but who cares when you have a boring long flight ahead of you. My boyfriend and I watched movies together on my IPad3 with no problems!!!!!!!
5	1363910400	He is truly satisfied with this item b/c he got it for cheap and it is allsome it is exactly what he was looking for.
5	1363910400	Was hard to find but this is the specific adapter I needed to split the heahphone jack to 2 headphones
5	1363910400	Quality product at a good price!  I like that it is white and matches my white iPhone and head set.  Now you and a friend can listen to the same thing on your iPhone or other device and if like me yours is white and you would like it to match this is your accessory!
5	1363910400	Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter: Very handy item I use it all the time and very glad I found it.
2	1363824000	Advantage- It is cheap! Probably for few times use.Cons: I used it on my Ipad and 2 apple headphones.It doesn't fit very well and you have to play around a little bit at the connections, keep rotating the AUX input to be able to hear the audio in both headphone outlets. If you move even slightly, the connection is lost and you won't hear audio in both headphones. You have to rotate and tighten the AUX input connections again to find at what position you can hear the sound. It can go on for a while.
5	1363737600	This splitter has been used half a dozen or so times by the kids to use with a portable DVD player and we haven't had a problem.
5	1363737600	What can i say its a good splitter and a great price , worked like a charm and is still plugged in today . AAA +++++++
5	1363478400	Small Big advise. I use it with my mighty speakers and it is great to plug it to my iDevices.
5	1363392000	it is true stereo sound, its cheap, you can pick a color if it matterswhat else is there to say, what else can you complain about?
5	1363305600	this seems to be good quality.  shipped fast, in time for my vacation.  with all the hand held devices now, its awesome for sharing a movie on a plane, etc
4	1363219200	This cable works well, but the end that plugs into a phone is too fat, I had to cut it down with my knife to make it fit into my phone with its case.
5	1363219200	It looks and feels like a splitter other manufacturers try to copy. It functions as described. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
4	1363219200	Works as it should - I bought this to allow two connections to my amazon Kindle Fire when we travel - recently used this on a plane to watch a movie that was downloaded to the fire - worked well.Would recommend this to anyone else that has a need to have two connections.Brian W.
5	1363219200	Purchased these to go with our iPad and children's headphones so that our 3 and 4 year old could watch movies on an airplane. They worked perfectly!
5	1363132800	Product advertised as it says. Fast delivery of product. Fits well into laptop headphone jack. Prefered the splitter to be gold plated to prevent sound leakage. Great to share your music and movies with a friend or family member. I recommend this product to everyone.
5	1362960000	I needed a splitter for my ipad to watch with my wife and this works great.  It does exactlly what I expected and was reasonable priced.  If you in the market for a basic splitter than this is a great value.
5	1362873600	This splitter will come in handy when I need to use them for my electronic gear.... nice and sturdy ...
5	1362787200	I bought this to help a friend out.  They have speakers on their computer and then were given a cordless speaker for their house.  This worked perfect to allow them to have their music some through both sets!!
5	1362787200	What can I say it's a headphone splitter and it works as described.  Shipped fast. A+ + + + + +
1	1362700800	I received two of these. The first broke about a week after fist used. The second broke a week later.Both broke the same way: one or the other channel cut out when the cable is jiggled.Terrible quality 0 for 2
4	1362700800	I use this so both of our kids can listen to music or a movie at the same time.  Sound is slightly in and out on one channel.
5	1362614400	Bought this so my girls, if needed could share a movie. they sing along to gether whilst pugged in and love it.
1	1362528000	Worked for one day then died... I sent them back.  Sounded pretty good for one day though...Don't waste your money.
5	1362355200	The quality of the product is better than most cords I have bought through Amazon. No amount of jiggling caused a disturbance in the sound.I had expected there to be some volume drop. It seems logical since the signal is getting split between two devices and the splitter isn't exactly powered. However, that is not the case with this product.I guess my only complaint is that the company sent a really weird email asking me to write this."A 3/5 is equivalent to a negative 1/5" - AmaMax on Amazon store ratings.Bottom line: The product came on time and exceeds my expectations.
1	1362355200	The splitter does not work at all. From either jack on the splitter you do not hear any sounds. This is the worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon.
5	1362268800	I love this haedphone splitter. It works great and my wife and I love it. Now we don't have to share the same earphones any more!
4	1362182400	This item does exactly what it is supposed to do and it will come in handy whenever it is necessary.
5	1361923200	Not much to say, its a splitter and works like one. One great feature I will say is that cables "snap" into place and it holds tight. Great splitter!
2	1361923200	:(  I bought these for college and sadly I can't use them due to one of the sides not working.
4	1361923200	didnt have the belkin logo or wrapping but works accordingly, exactly what I needed for those long plane rides with the boyfriend!
1	1361750400	I bought it because it was cheap and I just want a splitter, but when I tried this sometimes one of the plugs just doesn't work I need to move it so it start working. I'm sure there are better out there and cheaper.I thought because if was belkin I was getting something descent but I was wrong
5	1361750400	Connectors fit securely, well worth the price. Can't say much else about it really - just make sure your device puts out enough power and you bring 2 pairs of phones! :)
5	1361664000	Husband and I used our headphones to watch a movie together on my iPad.  Very sturdy and worked great to connect separate headphones!
5	1361404800	I got several of these to use on a portable CS player for a visually impaired user. They are tough enough to endure frequent plugging/unplugging.
5	1361232000	Me and my wife were able to watch movies in peice on a trip with out desturbing other, or sharing headphones
5	1361232000	This splitter works great and allowed 3 of us to hear a movie on my ipad with our own headphones  (I have another one with volume control).
5	1361232000	These were a really cheap product and worked exactly like they were supposed to.  Now I can have 2 people listen to my movies!
5	1361232000	Phones connector snug.  Cable is not split all the way. No obvious degradation in audio quality. Using it so I can plug monitor and speakers in to PC?
2	1361145600	I have purchased these splitters a number of times and found that performance is random. Some units perform as expected and some will lose a channel or produce a mono output which can sometimes be corrected by plugging and un-plugging the connectors. On my last order for two of these splitter's, one worked fine and the other never did produce stereo output from one of the female connectors, even with one jack pulled slightly out which is not an ideal situation to provide uninterrupted performance.As I needed this product to perform as described I ended up going to Radio Shack to get one that worked correctly(which it did at more than twice the price) The main difference between the "Belkin" product and the Radio Shack product is gold plating which could improve sound quality but should not effect the ability to provide two stereo outputs.It would appear that quality control on the Belkin product could be improved.  At this time when I have a requirement for this connector I will be looking for a little better quality and possibly search for a vendor who provides this product with gold plating as this may be indicative of better manufacturing practices and quality control.On a more positive note, I have purchased a number of the Belkin Bluetooth receivers and found them to have much better sound quality than other Bluetooth receivers being offered.  Also the range on these receivers can be extended to almost twice the range if you remove the unnecessary weight ballast.
5	1361145600	I choose this rating cause its good when its just one phone when you have to headphones. I would recommend it to other people.
5	1360972800	It is a splitter. It splits it to two stereo channels like it is suppose to. You have to plug it in all of the way.
5	1360886400	The headphone splitter does exactly what it's supposed to. Takes a stereo signal (like your phone/mp3 player has) and splits it to your stereo headphones. Each set of headphones gets the full stereo signal.(Some splitters divide a stereo signal into the mono left right signals, this one does not)-cheap-relatively durable-the contacts are solid and noise free, even when rotating a plugMost importantly!- the male plug has an extended narrow ring which allows the plug to seat fully through thin cases or on irregular surfaces like an iPad in a smartcase(for audio techs searching, this is a  (1) 1/8" male TRS WYE to (2) 1/8" female TRS)
5	1360886400	I bought this in combination with the Califone Kids Stereo Headphones and it worked great. Grand kids used it on the plane and everything went well
2	1360800000	Has a buzzing noise and one of the lines doesn't makes the right speaker work. Was hoping these would help split the speakers for my tv and pc.
5	1360713600	I used this to split my kids portable dvd player output in the car so they can both listen to a movie and I don't have to hear it in front.  Works perfectly no problems and easy to use.
5	1360540800	you cant go wrong. alot of these splitters dont work so good, but these ones are great cause you can hear both speakers on both sets of headphones. great!!
5	1360454400	Please don't be all paranoid that the volume will decrease to a level that yu would notice. Buy good quality headphones/earphones like sennheizer, sony and bose and enjoy this splitter!
5	1360454400	This product works just like it says it will, and is easy to store. The price is nice too, so I give it 5 stars.
5	1360454400	It does just what it is designed for. I was skeptical at first on weather or not it would provide a good quality of music, but it exceeded my expectations
5	1360368000	They work perfectly just make sure your output deice sends out enough power to power all of the speakers you attach. In most cases splitting the output like that will decrease the volume of both of the objects receiving the signal.
5	1360281600	splits sound so you can send it to 2 sources. doesn't separate left from right which is great. make sure to buy an extender.
5	1360281600	Shipment arrived quickly. The quality is good.  The connection plugs fit easily but snugly.  Volume is good on both sides.
4	1360195200	I liked it as it looked good. I will have to use it for some time to give more details on this item.
5	1360108800	No matter how many devices you own, two kids will want to be on the same device at the same time.  Sometimes you actually want them to share a device to save a buck or two.  This splitter is the least expensive fight avoidance tool I have found.  We first used it on the airplane to share a seatback TV screen. I just permanently leave it attached to the oldest's headphones now so it's always handy.
4	1360108800	This helps when I want to hook up two single mini speakers or earphones to share my ipod, or music on my phone with my friend, etc.  No review needed I guess.
5	1359936000	Not much else to say, it splits audio as intended and is incredibly cheap for what you're getting. Would recommend
5	1359849600	Does exactly what it says. And no it doesnt split the channels. however it is a bit sensitive. like sometimes itll only play bass on one but spining the connection fixes it and it stays fixed.
5	1359763200	Whenever I need to use a headphone splitter, I realize I don't have one so I usually opt to just play the video out loud or share headphones which is inconvenient.  This headphone splitter works well.  I haven't used it as a splitter for speakers, but I think the cord is a little short to split 2 speakers.  You might as well only have one speaker if they are that close together.
5	1359763200	Don't let the cheap price deter you. These work well. I purchased this in order for two of us to watch a movie on my iPad while travel. Works great & would buy it again.
5	1359676800	Workes as it should. Price is low and I would recomend it. I will be ordering a few more for other family members.
5	1359504000	Bought this for long trips on an airplane so that two people could sit and watch one monitor, works great.
5	1359504000	I need more than one audio out from my desktop computer so that I could connect my speakers and a set of wireless headphones for night listening.This did the job and I am very pleased with this purchase.
5	1359504000	One output. Two output. Three output. Four. I have a pretty white cable that I will shove behind my speaker cabinet and ignore.
1	1359331200	when you plug in both, speakers and headphone, the speakers`  laudness automaticly going down !  NOT  RECOMMENDED ! Very low quality !
5	1359331200	I've only used this once. My wife and I were able to watch a movie on our ipad each with our own headphones receiving high volume good quality sound.
5	1359244800	The splitter works as it should.  My needs are simple and it splits the output from my laptop so I can hook up computer speakers and headphones at the same time, saving my wife the trouble of pounding on the floor above to turn my speakers down.
4	1359244800	From packaging and quality of materials used, to portability and flexibility; this is a great Belkin product for the price. Recommend it with No buyer's regret.
5	1359244800	This was great to have on an airplane or in the hotel room so my husband and I could both listen to a movie on my iPad while my daughter slept. Great purchase.
3	1359158400	I gave this splitter 3 stars because even though it works ok there is a lot of static in one of the output lines. It's difficult to hear anything when using it for music etc. Overall it's build quality is good, it doesn't really feel cheap. I probably wouldn't buy another one in the future unless I really needed one.
5	1359158400	This splitter is cheap and thus surprisingly well made. it was thick rubber that doesn't feel like if you bend it or accidentally pull it out with your headphones it would break.  The item arrived fast, and does exactly what its made to! now i can watch movies on my laptop, and if someone wants to join in we don't have to listen to the laptop quality sound!
5	1359072000	This headphone splitter is very useful for travel. it lets you share the audio if you only have one device. Its made of good quality material and not expensive. useful item.
5	1358985600	Great item, and is exactly as described!!  Would purchase this item again if needed, and would suggest it to anyone else looking for such an item!!!
5	1358985600	I was pleasantly surprised by the good quality and performance of the splitter with reasonalby priced ear-buds headphones used with my Laptop.  I would recommend this as a very good value item, at lower cost than one available in a local electronics store.
1	1358899200	It did not work. When I hooked up two headphones  one sounded ok and the other was all garbled.May be just bad item.
5	1358899200	Super cheap. My wife and I use it all the time to watch movie trailers on our phones. WE NO LONGER HAVE TO BUMP HEADS SHARING A HEADSET.
5	1358812800	This works exactly as described. The cables are relatively heavy-gauge and the insulation is a soft, durable rubbery texture. 100% recommended.
5	1358640000	Nice product, great price &#8212; better than Radio Shack's price. Gold coated and everything. Used it to record to my laptop.
5	1358467200	My nephews received these for Christmas and they are quite happy with them. I can't speak to specifics, but they are often hard to please with gifts & they are quite happy!
4	1358380800	cheap.works.easy.4 stars because sometimes you have to wiggle the connection to hear properly. You cant really complain too much for what its worth though.
5	1358380800	Exactly what you are looking for, dont hesitate or spend more money than you have to for a simple splitter
2	1358380800	Connection is touchy. Have to twist the plug in order to hear both ear pods sounds. I would've expected better from Belkin.
5	1358208000	So... Not really a lot to say here. It was inexpensive when I bought it, so that is nice.I've used it a few times to help locally record a podcast (as opposed to over Skype), thus split the incoming mic line, and it's functional, so no complaints.
5	1358208000	this works just as expected, I mainly use it for my kids to watch there movies and games on my Ipad. So now they both have there own set of headphones and I don't have to hear it. Fast shipping, great packaging, and a great price. Thank you!!!
3	1358121600	I bought these hoping they'd work with my classroom iPads, but the jack is too large for the Trident AMS iPad 2 case opening.  I also tried them with the iPad Kraken case, and they didn't fit on that one, either.  I sincerely wish either the makers of the cases would make their opening larger and/or Belkin and other audio cable companies would make their jacks smaller.
5	1358035200	Great sound quality (nice and crisp with deep base) from 2 dell sound bars. Very simple to hook up. EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!
5	1357862400	I travel to other states with someone always next to me, so we listen to audiobooks and music together from my iphone on two separate earphones, cause my car speakers are not working properly.
3	1357862400	I bought this product to split my computer's sound into two pairs of speakers. It plugs into my computer fine. But when I try to plug a speaker into it it, The speakers start buzzing. It does not do this to ear buds which is weird because the plugs for my speakers look exactly the same as the ear bud's. I don't know if this was just a one time occurrence or if it will happen too you, But it's not like it's a extremely dangerous risk. They're only a couple of bucks after all.-Edit: There's nothing wrong with the splitter, Just me. I wasn't pushing hard enough on the plug so that it popped.
5	1357862400	What I really like about this splitter is that it is nickle plated, which enhances conductivity and is it rare to find on audio equipment bought these days.
5	1357862400	THese are worth every penny - they are built tough and withstand a 7 yo and 9 yo fighting over the iPad.
5	1357862400	Finally!  I've purchased a variety of splitters to use with my iPhone so my wife and I could watch a video together. They all had the same problem... one set of headphones would work, and the other set of headphones would only play audio out of one ear.  The Belkin finally fixed this.  I can hear audio in stereo, with great volume levels, out of both sets of headphones.  Very happy with this.
5	1357776000	The splitter that came is even better than the one shown in the picture! The one I received is just a straight wire with the two output jacks joined together in a single rubber cover. The one shown in the picture has a &#34;Y&#34; shape and there is the risk of breaking it in half. The unit I received does not have that problem at all. Now I can plug in two earphones at the same time on my laptop. The sound is the same for both sides. One of the side is a little tight tough, so it can be hard to pull out sometimes.
5	1357776000	This allows my two girls to entertain themselves watching a move on the same tablet without me having to listen along.  Got to love peace and quiet when your driving down the interstate.
5	1357776000	The the product arrived exactly on time and I haven't encountered any errors since ordering it . I would definitely recumbent this product.
5	1357776000	It's a small well made short-corded white splitter, just realized that it is manufactured by Belkin. It splits. It is white. Performs as expected, no complains.
4	1357689600	Needed these for a plane trip where two headphones were used, and they worked exactly how they were supposed to be.
5	1357689600	I have 2 room mates here so I often use the splitter to play things for one of them. Usually the other is busy talking on skype or vent or teamspeak and has no interest or it will disturb the other who is sleeping. regardless of the situation this works very well for it's intended use. The Female sides lock in your headphones very tightly. you have to apply pressure to get them in and you'll hear a click when their in. The male side fits like any other headphones. so if you drop a mp3 (psp in my case) usually the splitter will come out before my headphones which is good because it's less strain on my headphones that way.
5	1357603200	Over my lifetime, I've owned two of these cables from Belkin. Don't know if they are the same exact model, but similar, nonetheless.The first one was good, but I ended up losing it. Used it in various places to split audio signal, or to put two 3.5mm inputs into one set of speakers. Worked decently for all that, although if I had to audio sources going into my speakers, it seemed to dull the audio volume, and the signal would always be louder on one side of the speakers. Not a huge problem.Bought another set, after I lost the first. This set is better, and no problems that the last set had!Recommend because its cheap, reliable, and it looks decent too!
5	1357603200	These are nice to have when kids have to share the same device, such as a Nook, Kindle or Ipad, lets more than one person watch a movie with headphones on.  Work great.
5	1357516800	Good quality connector, nice and sturdy with plenty of insulation. No sound distortion or interference that I can tell. To clarify, this plug duplicates the 3.5 mm jack, it does not split the left and right channels.
5	1357430400	This is very good quality and very cheap have seen this for over $10 in some stores good buy well worth 4 bucks.
5	1357257600	We purchased this splitter to use with our iPad 2 (no case, just a cover).  Works fine.  Also works with the iPhone 5 (with the AmazonBasics cover).  It maintains stereo sound for both users.
5	1357257600	Works great for plugging into my kids DVD players, now my husband and I don't have listen to kids movies in the car!
5	1357257600	I got this splitter so we can watch a movie on a tablet together and I can hear what he's hearing on the airplane.  It's also good to have with apps so if he's hollering at it I can know what's going on and help him out.They work just as described and it's a great deal for the price -- I highly recommend.
5	1357171200	My wife and I use this when we travel via airplane and want to watch a movie together on our iPad or Macbook Air.  Sound quality is fine and have not had any problems.  For the price, you can't go wrong.
5	1357171200	needed a headphone splitter for my holiday trip. worked perfectly with my ipad and my son and i were able to both watch movies together on the plane.
3	1357171200	Bought this before a couple trans-Atlantic flights and was a little disappointed.  The volume drop was very noticeable (possibly heightened by a noisy airplane cabin) and the connection had to be held in place for it to even work.  Rendered BOSE headphones into cheap ear buds.
4	1357171200	I personally used this splitter to have the speakers on my computer monitor and the free standing speakers play.Yup
5	1357084800	I bought this so my husband and I could watch a movie on the plane and this splitter worked perfectly.
5	1357084800	Can't beat it. Great splitter and does what it is supposed to. Nothing fancy. Works like a charm. I got 2 sets. One for inside and one for the outdoor patio TV and Xbox.
5	1356998400	I ordered this after unsatisfactory experiences with two competitors' products.  One was so poorly made that one headphone jack would slide right out.  The other didn't preserve correct stereo separation.There's no problem with the Belkin.  Both headphone jacks fit perfectly and both preserve stereo separation correctly on both outputs.  I've tested the Belkin with two sets of headphones connected simultaneously.  Both have correct stereo separation.
5	1356912000	great product, very easy to use, small in size so it's easy to carry around. sound quality remains intact, would recommend
5	1356912000	I purchased this so that my son and i could watch movies together on the plane. It worked really well and i didn't feel like much of the sound was lost while using it.
5	1356825600	I bought this to use on a trip I was taking! My spouse and I like to watch movies at the airport on our trips, however... my computer only offers one audio jack. For anyone who likes to watch movies together in this setting... you know that sharing a set of headphone is not a pleasant experience. Therefore... we decided to give this a try. And let me say... it was AMAZING! It was great being able to both watch a movie with our own headphones! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a movie or listen to music alongside someone else and not share headphones! This would also be a great product for kids or adults!
5	1356739200	Great product. We would buy it again and again. We have been very pleased with how well it works! Great!
5	1356739200	A buyer's only concern about this should be if it is legitimate or not.It is as described and arrived on time. If you are too lazy to go out to buy one, hit add to cart.
5	1356652800	Works well. Good for tablets to watch movies on while two persons are using headphones and not wanting to use the tablet speaker. We've had it for two weeks and it hasn't broke yet. Which in today's electronic accessories is pretty good, unfortunately.
5	1356652800	Awesome for two kids to listen at the same time... This way I dont have to hear it and they can both play and listen at the same time without bothering me.. lol..
5	1356566400	This item was shipped promptly, looks just like in the pic and works perfectly plus cheaper than in stores. Thanks!
3	1356393600	This device does what it says it will do. I returned home to find it irreparably damaged, but discovered it was my older brother's mistake. Easily replaced for just a dollar or two.
5	1356307200	Great price. Arrived early and useful item. Not really loud but serves it purpose to have a buddy hear with you.
3	1356220800	I really like this splitter.  Now my friend and I both can listen to our ipod without having to worry about the earbuds being pulled out of our ears.
5	1356220800	A very good item to have.  I have a couple sitting around at all times for several uses.  Whether it's for speakers, earphones, or just patching sounds to a recorder!
5	1356134400	Pretty straight forward. It splits 3.5mm jack two ways. M-FF connection. Pretty cheap, I'd buy them again if I had to.
5	1356134400	I purchased these to watch a DVD on my laptop with my son on a long airplane trip. I wanted to split the sound so that we could both wear headphones and not disturb anyone. They worked great.
5	1355961600	Needeed this so two investiggators could review EVP's and such at the same time for our paranormal group.  Having more than one person listen to something over and over takes out a lot of stuff that isn't paranormal and helps confirm stuff that may be.
5	1355961600	Got this so my parents would have something to use on the airplane so they don't have to take turns on the iPad. Works great.
4	1355961600	Pros:good connectioncontacts stick out enough from the rubber to allow for a good connectionsolid construction around contactsCons:thin insulation
5	1355875200	Worth the money if you need a splitter.  I've been using it every day for almost two months now and it has held up well!
4	1355875200	This product works as i expected but sometimes if you twist the wire it can distort the sound. I also have a fender amp (single speaker) that i was was trying to combine with my computer speakers. But when they are connected it takes out the left speaker on the computer speaker system. :/  oh well
5	1355788800	I'm happy I purchased a Belkin splitter over the others for the same price. It's quality for a low price. So far my kids have been using it with a clear sound. Thanks for the deal.
5	1355788800	My and my wife had to share one headphone set every time in an airplane, this splitter solve the problem, sound quality remains the same through both outputs, recommended.
4	1355788800	Works as advertised and sound is good even after splitting the audio. Looks like it will last a while. .
1	1355702400	I bought this splitter so that my wife and I could both listen to an audiobook while at the beach.  One side did not work.  I contacted the vendor, iFlash, Inc., but got no response.  I didn't bother shipping the defective $2.39 splitter back to them, but simply spent more money to buy one that works.  It is interesting that the accompanying order sheet asked me to post a positive review!  No usable product plus no service equals no positive review, iFlash.
5	1355702400	Bought this to go with the two iHome speakers I bought to hook up to our iPhones.  This works great.  Will probably also use it for my laptop as well.
5	1355616000	Good product to divide speakers no loss of balance or sound and very simple to use, I use it with my I pad and has met all my expectations.
4	1355443200	I bought it because i was going on a road trip with my family and wanted to share my music. it was ok. i had to play with it a bit. i probably use it some more just because i have it. the best "feature" was the price which is why i give it 4 stars.
5	1355443200	Decent price, does what it's supposed to do. I gave a MP3 player a little stereo effect .... it works
2	1355356800	First of all, I'd like to start by saying that this product does in fact work, however, it does not work well.When connecting earbuds or headphones to this splitter, you have to &#34;wiggle&#34; it a quite a bit until it gets in the correct orientation. The sound quality will be poor if you have it rotated the wrong way.I expect devices like this to be plug and play, I do not want to sit there and play with it for a minute before I can use it.
5	1355356800	Cheap price nice quality head phone splitter. The packaging looks old. I had no problems with the cable very good deal
5	1355184000	Works perfectly, splitting the sound between two audio cables. I have had not problems with it and is great for the price.
5	1355184000	This will come in handy with siblings or any 2 kids that want to watch the same video without driving their parents crazy!
5	1355097600	No issues at all. I use it on my android tablet to watch shows, splitting the audio for me and my wife, and it is plenty loud enough. We usually have the volume 1/2 to 2/3 the way up can hear it just fine.
5	1355097600	Excellent product. It arrived right and soon.  I reccomend it, Excellent product. It arrived right and soon.  I reccomend it
5	1355097600	Decent price. Does the job OK with my MP3 to split the sound between me and my baby in the belly.
5	1355011200	good quality, very usefull and is cheap !!! . . . . . . . . . . . .
5	1355011200	This is exactly what I was looking for! My friend and I always have to share a pair of headphones when we were listening to music until now
3	1354924800	I've only used these a few times after having them for a while. I've noticed when plugging in two pairs the sound quality changes and isn't as clear as it is without the splitter. They were inexpensive and do their job so I can overlook that aspect. If you really want a better sound quality from a splitter I would consider looking for another product. If you don't mind that then, for the price, this product will do well.
5	1354924800	Works flawlessly sound does not cut out and both ears of headphones work in this splitter would defiantly recommend this product
5	1354838400	two people can listen at the same time. It was real inexpensive to buy. It is light weight. whats not to like
5	1354752000	this is an outstanding thing, it serves its purpose and no issuse to speak of. Light weight and get the job done..
1	1354665600	not packaged ,open product or not Belkin, kills the volume control! don't waste your money on this product.not new as stated...
4	1354579200	in vehicle for bluetooth phone pickup.  Works fine and of good construction which Belkin is famous for. I find I can always depend on them for good quality cables and products.
3	1354579200	Does not work with ear buds / headphones w built-in microphones. May be OK with plain simple buds / headphones.
5	1354492800	When you use one speakers one headphone, they both are sound lower, and after i try i never used it.
4	1354492800	it splits a headphone jackso if you need to split a headphone jack-buy this.pretty practical. is what it is
5	1354492800	Works great, saved the day - just make sure you or your friend has a volume control on the headphones, my husband listened to movies at a higher volume then i did, but he could adjust it on his head phones so it all worked out.  But they make the keychain splitters now, so i'd be interested in trying one of those, that way its less 'cords'
5	1354320000	Just what I needed at a considerable price. Both ports worked without any noticeable quality loss. One two three four
4	1354233600	No need to pay 20 bucks for a splitter, this one works great and my wife can hit the treadmill while I hit the elliptical and still both listen to whatever is on.
5	1354147200	I got my splitter just today and I liked it. There is no difference in volume or stereo effects between listening to headphones with the splitter or without. You can safely buy this without doubts of  a drop in volume or that it will only be mono. And it looks decent on my iPad.I bought this so that my wife and I can watch a movie together on our iPad, even with our baby sleeping next to us. You could probably also use it if you want to use a multimedia system in a room and an additional set of wireless headphones if you are moving around the house.Disclaimer- I have not tried this on one of those 200 bucks headphones, so can't tell on the performance there.
5	1354147200	works great, good product. also works with earphones that have mic and clicker attached. highly recommend. great product, although they could have attached a little piece of plastic/rubber in the middle to keep the wire from spreading apart.
5	1354060800	I needed a splitter and read in a review to look for Belkin's splitter. It is quite cheap and does the job. I am currently connecting 2 computers to my stereo and everything works great. I was not looking for perfection or an amazing sound. Just wanted both connected so I can play both of them one after another without getting up to replace cables.
5	1354060800	If you're looking for something to share audio (MP3 player, iPad, etc) while preserving STEREO sound in BOTH sets of headphones, this is perfect.I use it primarily for flights, to watch a movie on a laptop/ipad with a companion so that we can both hear the audio.  Works perfectly, with full volume sound in BOTH ears of BOTH people.I previously tried the Monster version of this splitter which also worked, but the connections were loose and would not &#34;snap&#34; in securely.  No such problems here, having tried various sets of headphones which all plug into the splitter very securely.  Nice compact little splitter also stashes away easily in my headphone case.
5	1354060800	rmuy responsable  , excelente servicio ..  muy puntual... muy &uacute;til para compartir mi m&uacute;sica con mis amigos o pareja !
5	1353888000	This product works great in iPods, iPhones, computers, anywhere you'd want to split the audio for another set of ears.  Perfect for sharing the listening experience!  No sacrifice to the sound quality!
5	1353888000	This product is exactly what I needed for taking all my devices traveling with me. I wanted to be able to get quality speaker sound but use my headphones at the same time. This splitter is just what I needed.  Thanks AMAZON, you did it again with quality products like this.  I can take my STEREO sound everywhere and not disturb anyone else.JUSTMESD
5	1353542400	Product performed as intended.  Great for &#34;splitting&#34; source to multiple speakers. Would recommend this product to anyone who needs output split.
4	1353283200	Great for when you only have one music player and more than one person wanting to listen to something!!! Sound quality is goo from both connections!
3	1353196800	If you even twitch this cable ever so slightly, you will hear the static coming through your headphones. Not the greatest thing.
2	1352851200	windows 7 does not recognize this as an audio device there for it will not put out audio threw it.i bought this to be able to use my desktop speakers as well as my monitor build in speakers on my pc.does not work. not worth sending it back for $2.50
5	1352764800	I bought to use when my husband and I left for our trip up North. We used it to watch movies on our iPad. worked great and was so much easier than sharing headphones!
1	1352592000	yes it does what it  says.. you can use  two head phone at once but you cant hear the sound thats different story...
5	1352246400	Works exactly as specified and fairly cheap. Bought this so that my wife and I could watch shows in bed or on the plane via one iPad. Audio levels were pretty much identical as when I plugged in my headphones directly into the iPad. Connects easily and completely into socket.
5	1352246400	I like how flexible the splitter is. Easy maneuvering,easy plugging in. I do like the color, the splitter works well on my smartphone and my computer.I am happy with the purchase.Thank you
5	1351209600	Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter.  This item works as stated. It is a great buy for the price.  Stereo in both channels.  I would recommend it. Arrived on time.
5	1351036800	This is a high quality piece to have and it's very handy especially for a bus or a plane or showing the songs that you made to people while listening yourself!
5	1350864000	Its very nice. Specially, after connecting two headphones, the quality is still good which is cool. No waste of money...
5	1350691200	I'm a bit confused by some of the reviews. There may have been a critical design flaw years ago, but the model I received is completely fine. It splits one stereo input into two stereo outputs. Plain and simple.
4	1350691200	We bought this item to use with our iPad so we can watch movies together when traveling.  It worked great, as advertised.  Excellent price.  Perfect sound on both earphones.  No problems.
5	1350604800	I bought a couple of these and they all work awesome. I needed to have more than one outlet for earphones on my laptop, so I could listen and watch movies in the car with my friends and family, and with this product now I can.
3	1350345600	I was looking for an adapter that split the stereo signal into two separate monaural signals. I've since learned that the description for what I want usually refers to "tip and ring" outputs" - those types of splitters are hard to find.The description led me to believe it was what I wanted, but I should have read it more carefully. As a stereo splitter for attaching two headphones I suppose it would be fine.
5	1350345600	it works just fine, no glitches no nothing it transmits sound through both and really doesn't make any complications...I got one used but it was still in perfect working condition...the only thing is that is it would sometimes unplug itself but that rarely ever happens, it happened once or twice to me.
5	1350172800	First of all, the reviewer who gave this product 1 star because he thought it failed to preserve the stereo signal was dead wrong.  He must have received a different product (a stereo channel separator?) because I purchased two of these units and each female connector puts out the same perfect 2-channel stereo signal that goes into the male plug.  The male and female connectors are all standard mini-stereo, ie: 3.5 mm or 1/8 inch in diameter.  I leave this splitter plugged into my MP3 player at all times to prevent wear and tear on the MP3 player's built-in female mini connector, which would be difficult to replace.One more use for this product: turn it around and this splitter becomes a signal merger.  I have a Samsung Chromebook which has a single 3.5 mm input jack for audio headsets, combining the microphone input with the earphone output on a single jack.  All of my headsets had separate 3.5 mm plugs for earphones and microphone.  This splitter (when turned around into a merger) serves to merge the 2 headset lines into the single combined line with a 3.5 mm plug which is required for the Chromebook.
5	1349222400	Works exactly as expected, and as described. This item is good quality and works properly. What else can be said...if you wanna hook two pairs of headphones to one device? Done! If you want to output audio from one source to two others for recording through the 3.5mm port? Done Done!!
4	1348963200	There great came new in box. They work great. I use them to watch movies and on a long trip with family or friends.
1	1348704000	The splitter I received only output sound to one ear, not both.  This is supposed to be a stereo to stereo splitter, but what I got was a stereo to left ear splitter.
5	1348185600	When I first ordered this I sort of expected to get a cheap splitter in an envelope for this price but was pleasantly surprised with an OEM package.I hooked it to my computer connected the two sets of speakers and they work fine.  I didn't notice any drop in volume at all.
5	1348185600	The wife and I had a long plane ride and wanted to watch a movie on her Kindle but each have our own headphones.  This splitter was perfect and exactly what we wanted.
4	1347580800	My wife and I can now watch movies on her phone while each of us use our own earphones (as to not wake the baby).The sound comes in stereo to each of the earphones.  The splitter also seems sturdy.My head phones are made for an Iphone (Klipsch earphones) and has a mic. Ive noticed that if i plug them in all the way they don't work right.
5	1347494400	Works great!  I have not noticed a loss of sound due to split power, but I'm not trying to blow my eardrums out.  I would recommend.
3	1347494400	Works, but the female ports are quite stubborn.  Those who are experiencing problems getting stereo audio are probably not pushing in their connectors all the way into the ports.  Once they are in completely, stereo should be working.  It's still problematic though, as it is also difficult to pull the connector out of the ports once they've been pushed all the way in, so this would not be an ideal splitter for headphones as there's a possibility that you just might pull the jacket around the connector for your headphones off or even damage the connector permanently.  If you don't plan on inserting and removing connections to this splitter frequently though, it should be sufficient for your needs.  Just know that you're not paying for the best here.
5	1347408000	I use the product to join two different speak systems together. Zero problems with the product, will defiantly order again if needed in the future.
1	1347235200	Timely shipping but the product is useless. The female ends are too small and sometimes  the audio is inaudible in one of the channels. $3 down the drain.
5	1347235200	Super cheap! Nice Quality.. I ordered to split while on the plane.. works great nice quality. I ordered two, the other one I use d to split sound on the back of a desk top computer. Sound quality is excellent !
4	1346630400	The product does what it needs to do and it works well at it. I would recomend for people with girlfriends who don't like sharing earphones while listening to music together.
5	1346457600	I just got it and tested it. it works. the volume is not bad at all. I love this product.
5	1346371200	I use it to share my studio output monitors with a couple of people and it does the job its supposed to do. On occasions you will find that it suppresses the bass a little bit and also cuts off the higs a little early, but its worth the money. A very good buy.
5	1346371200	Read some other reviews that it split the audio from left to right but that was not my experience. It worked perfect for my trip so that my friend and I could listen to the same MP3 or Ipod. We used both and it worked great on both. Noise level was great. Highly recommend.
5	1346025600	It works very well, the price was extremely good!now i have to devices in one plug and it works! as expected
4	1345680000	I'm not wild about the white color, but it was cheaper than black for some reason.  Other than that, it's A-OK.
5	1345593600	Is very gud i tough the one speaker was hoing to sound more louder thn the other, but i hear both very good
5	1345507200	Works perfectly! There are times I find something online and want to share it with my husband and only have one headphone jack so only one of us can listen at a time. This fixes that problem! This one doesn't feel flimsy, it's a nice length about 8" long. It cost about a buck more than a cheaper one on Amazon but that one had an estimated delivery of 18-28 days. I got this one in about 5 days. Totally worth the extra $$. Thanks!!
5	1345507200	I received these 2 weeks ago.  They were used by my girls to watch DVDs during a 500+ mile car ride.  They worked as expected.  Both girls could hear left and right channels.  The volume probably did drop a little, but you are splitting the signal to 2 sets of headphones.  I opted to bring the 'over the ear' style headphones as opposed to ear buds to help drown out car and road noise.
2	1345420800	Worked perfectly for the first week after I bought it. Then I put it in a drawer for 4 months until I needed it again. The next time I went to use it, I found that the sound would cut out unless regularly to wiggled my headphone cord in the jack. Can't recommend it for longevity.
4	1344470400	Seems well built and solid, the plug fits well into iPhones and iPod Touches, even with cases on them. Both ends offer stereo sound. The female ends are sturdy and allow plenty of give to keep from dragging the iPod around every time someone moves, as opposed to the splitters that are one single unit.I did order two, and one of them has an annoying habit of cutting the sound completely from one female end, but twisting seems to restore the sound. I would likely return it if it wasn't a pain, and if it was the only one I had.  In any case, given the cost, its perfectly acceptable.
5	1344384000	I bought this so my kids could watch one tv instead of two on our flight for vacation.  Received exactly what is shown in the picture.  Worked well, both girls had great sound coming through their individual head sets.
1	1344297600	Dead On Arrival. One of the two female ports doesn't work at all. Tried with multiple sets of headphones. Will continue searching for other products...
5	1343865600	Great for use on trips when you have kids.Would recommend to anyone. Easy to use and attach to device. sound is clear.
5	1343692800	I bought this product to increase the number of audio outlets from my Vizio tv. Now I have 2 audio outlets instead of one. This product appears to be made very well and it works perfectly. I would recommend this product from this company.Carl
5	1343433600	When I bought it, it was $2.69, which kinda had me suspicious about the quality. It shipped really quick, and I plugged it into both my iPad 2 and my Macbook, and they work perfect! The sound is a bit lowered, but it's not very noticeable. Also, if you are hearing a mono sound, make sure you plug it in all the way! The first time I plugged in headphones, I was hearing a mono sound, but I realized I didn't plug them in all the way.
1	1343174400	I should have listened to the other reviews.  While I can occasionally obtain a stereo connection for both headphones from an iPad 2, the connection is unreliable and easily switches between mono and stereo depending upon the precise rotational and insertional alignment between the headphone's and splitter's connectors.  The alignment is very sensitive, rendering it nearly useless for the iPad.  As for connecting to my iPhone 4S, the splitter's male connector doesn't even remain in the iPhone - it practically falls out it is so loose.  I cannot get an audio signal for more than a second or two without it disconnecting altogether.  I would return it but it's not worth the hassle for a few bucks.  It's not even heavy enough to use as a paperweight, so it is even more useless.  I feel duped.
5	1342742400	This item is everything that it is said about it. This is a very good buy since I need one of these for my two speakers that  I have and it was a great buy.
5	1342569600	these work just fine! i haven't noticed any volume reduction on either side. the only "complaint" i have is that it turned out bigger than i expected (7 inches long) so when attached to my iPod nano, it looks like some robotic contraption. also, oddly enough... when one set of headphones are plugged in (with nothing playing), it sometimes turns into a microphone. like if you leave one bud in your ear the noise from the other bud is amplified. it's not a problem but just kind of funny. anyways, just a basic headphone splitter that does what it should do!
2	1342224000	There is disagreement about whether this splitter preserves stereo separation. In my case, it does not. I wish I'd been one of the luckier ones, but do you want a splitter that requires luck to work properly?
2	1342137600	Well, at first this seemed like a deal, but when the package arrived, they sent a no name, generic brand piece of crap, that wasn't even close to the specs of the belkin, it was corroded and looked like some Chinese made reject that was originally partially submerged in a floating ocean going storage container, well to say the least I flipped out!  I contacted the seller and they said it was a mistake, that someone must have grabbed the wrong item ( because they sell both) and then sent me the Belkin, which I have to say is real nice stuff, that came sealed and works great... SO,  my question is... Are they doing this to anyone else, and moreover, why in the hell are they even stocking the non working garbage they sent to me in the first place????  So, if you buy from this place, make sure it arrives in a sealed package that says BELKIN!!!  Otherwise, get ready to be pissed off!
5	1341964800	It arrived very promptly, and was exactly the thing for what I needed. What more can any one person ask?
1	1341619200	It cost $2 for a reason. I don't even use this product anymore because it is not reliable. I do not recommend this product if you plan on actually using it.
5	1341619200	Belkin headphone splitter was Exactly what I needed for my son & I to listen to my Kindle Fire and it was shipped fast
4	1341532800	This product works great as expected. It helps keep my sisters from fighting over the headphones while watching the same movie. Each gets to plug in their own headphones and watch the movie on the same screen. Great product!
5	1341446400	It came earlier then expected. A brand new item and works excellent. Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
5	1341446400	This product works great so far and is very handy.  The sound is good as I have been using this a few times when I needed it.  Worth the money!
5	1341360000	I am glad there is an item like this whwere you can use both speakers and headphones connected and grade off which one to use and also share two headphone to watch TV and movies.I recomend this product to anyone.
1	1341273600	Everything was fine until I plugged it into my device and then attempted to hook a pair of headphones into it which was difficult and these were just regular headphones that I never had a problem with.  Next thing I know is the sound sucks and when I attempted to use headphones again the sound was all screwed up.  DONT BUY THIS...dont know why but this could ruin your headphones.
4	1341187200	I purchased this item for use with my desktop computer (custom build), because the stereo I like to run my audio through has a broken headphone jack and so it was a pain to switch to headphones at night. I plugged it into the 2.1 jack in the back of my soundcard (bright green, for those of you who have similar computer parts) and plugged in my stero, an ancient panasonic stereo with great sound quality and my headphones, a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones.Works great! There is some volume loss along both channels, but it's negligent, because max volume with this splitter is still too loud on both channels. No discernible loss of quality or substantial line noise, either, so I'm completely happy!The only caveat (and this may just be unique to my system, every computer is different) is that it seems that hitting the headphones can produce some slight sound in the speakers. Nothing you would notice while sound is playing and not at all significantly loud (it's really quiet even at high volumes), and it doesn't seem that the headphones are acting as a mic, but just something to keep in mind.I'd definitely recommend these for anyone looking to split between headphones and a set of speakers!
5	1341014400	No complaints here. We use these daily on our car for the headrest portable DVD player we purchased on Amazon. With this splitter, both our boys can watch their shows in the car using 2 sets of headphones. I tested them out when we first purched the splitter and I didn't notice much of an issue with sound quality. I'd recommend this splitter.
1	1341014400	First off, the item I received is Belkin but looks nothing like this photo.Secondly, I purchased them for use on a trip that didn't happen, so, this stayed in my drawer, in the unopened pkg. for several months.  Have another trip coming up, found the pkg., opened it up and tried the splitter...DOESN'T WORK!  Sounds like your listening through a tin can!  TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY.
5	1340755200	This is a really good quality speaker/headphone splitter for the price. Have been using it every night for a week and there haven't been any problems yet.
1	1340668800	The item I got is different from the image. And the quality of the product is poor. There is no Belkin label on the cable, it looks like the product I got is fake.
5	1340668800	I have been wanting to listen to my ipod with both my hearing aid and cochlear implant, and someone online told me to get a splitter. So I thought I'd give this one a shot. Works great! I can use the Direct Connect cable with the implant processor, and the telecoil ear hook for the hearing aid, both plugged into the ipod at the same time. Amazing! I'm a happy camper now.
5	1340409600	There is not really a lot to say other than it works and is one of the cheapest out there.
3	1340409600	I have two different types of headphones plugged into it. If they get mixed up and are plugged into the wrong hole, one ear in each headphone doesn't work. But it works fine if we switch the plugs.
5	1340409600	Yep, makes the same exact sound you would hear with your original jack. Awesome for when you're hearing music with your friend for when you just want to lay back and listen to whatever you two want to hear. Especially when outside looking at nature; and listening to Explosions in the Sky :)
4	1340323200	I bought this splitter so that my husband and I could watch movies on our IPad together while traveling  The splitter does split the sound.  When we first tried using the splitter we must have put it too far into the IPad because one headphone could barely hear anything.  Luckily we had read some reviews and noticed other people had this problem so we had to pull the splitter slightly out of the IPad and then both headphones worked good.
4	1340236800	After I accidentally giving the wrong address and my package being returned, they contacted me to figure out where they should send it
5	1340236800	As advertised, works with 2 Sennheiser headphones so me and the wife can watch loud movies while the kids sleep... ftw.
5	1340150400	I got this to plug into my Bose system to split between my notebook and tv so I could either listen to the tv on the system or stream from my notebook and it works like a charm...by simply unplugging it from my notebook the tv takes over and plugging it back in the notebook takes over...simple, inexpensive and made well. Recommend if you need to split things into a one jack system.
1	1340064000	This item did not work right from the stzrt. I ended up buying another one from Radio Shack instead, and no problems (fromt that one).
5	1339632000	perfect fit exactly what i wanted. very secure fit as well even better than my headphones directly into the wire.
1	1339632000	I hate the fact i even had to give this a one star it doesnt work all this product is is junk please dont buy it your wasting your money it is JUNK!!!
4	1339545600	I bought this for my iPad so I can listen to music or watch movies and shows with my wife without having to share one earphone. It works great. The only issue I have with this is that the sound quality decreases just a bit and sometimes I have to plug in my earphones a certain way for it to start working. But it gets the job done so I'm satisfied.
5	1339459200	Saved my little stereo that I can't find for sale anywhere anymore. One speaker jack went out. I used this to multiply the remaining working one. Wouldn't normally review a 3 dollar item. This was worth the effort.
5	1339459200	I purchase the belkin speaker and headphones splitter, all i gotta say is THIS CABLE IS AWESOME!I'm even thinking of purchasing another one!5FIVE STAR!
4	1339372800	Received this product promptly although the S&H was much more than the actual splitter.  It works as mentioned in other reviews.
5	1339200000	The belkin speaker and headphone splitter is well made and not flimsy as compared to other similar splitters i bought earlier.  My wife and I are using it comfortably on my ipad2 with two different earphones without loss of sound quality to watch videos and listen to webcasts.
5	1339027200	This might be my shortest review ever...  It's a splitter.  I plugged it in.  I used two headsets.  It worked.  The end.
3	1338940800	The adapter works, but not perfect. Everything plugs in tight and there is a signal but the connection is not 100%. The main line works well, but the splitter plugs for the headphones have a crappy connection. Once plugged in the headphone plugs would have to be rotated within the connector to achieve a good sound signal. Otherwise the sound is not clear and somewhat tuned down. When you find the perfect position the signal is good. Works and cheap, but I expected better!I used in for a laptop watching a movie on a plane. Would have been happier if the connection worked well.The packaging does say Belkin, but sometimes I question these cheap products which are in many cases counterfeit fakes.
5	1338681600	This works great. Used it to share "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me" radio show via my Iphone while we drove to visit our folks. Worked perfectly. No problems with volume. I had to turn it down a bit. Great price too!
4	1338681600	I purchased the belkin speaker and headphone splitter for work as my previous one broke in less than a week. well this one I have been using for a few weeks now and no sight of wear and tear, very good product
4	1338076800	I want to say thanks to Amazon for doing the right thing. The splitter that I received from an outside vendor was a cheap good- for-nothing piece of crap.I wrote a review, and low and behold Amazon sent a replacement no questions asked.This time I received a Belkin splitter. I have found no fault with the genuine Belkin product, it is sturdy and the plugs fit perfectly. Sound is OK too.
4	1338076800	All in all, I've had worse splitters. Problem is when connecting something into both ports, the sound quality diminishes a bit; not much, but enough to bother me.
1	1337904000	When I'm using this splitter, the audio only comes out of one side. Going to see if i can have it replaced for free.
5	1337904000	It cost me almost nothing, works perfectly, and came the next day with Prime. The lady and I use it to listen to TED talks together on the bus ride home. Cute, right? I didn't pay anywhere near full price - let's just say I hope you didn't pay the MSRP.
5	1337644800	The Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter is a great product.  I use it so I can listen to the same music as someone else without making everyone around us listen too.
4	1337558400	After reading way too many reviews of headphone splitters, I was thoroughly confused.  There were as many bad reviews for expensive units as there were for cheap units.  I finally chose this less expensive (sub-five bucks) Belkin model and crossed my fingers.  It almost went back.There was no "click" when I inserted the headphone jacks, so I simply pushed them all the way in.  The trouble is that if you push the male headphone jacks too far into the Belkin's receiver, sound will only come through one ear.  Eventually I played with the unit enough to discover the secret.  Leave the jacks partially out and they should work fine, or good enough for four stars at least.  Hope this helps!
5	1337558400	delivered as promised.  guess this would have worked if it had been what I really needed.  It was the wrong size.  But hey, we can't get it right all the time. Right?
4	1336953600	I got this for my portable DVD player. It does diminishes volume which was a pain for my kids to hear the movie. But for the price it was good.
5	1336867200	Got this for my kids portable DVD player and it works great with no problems. Both sets of headphones stayed plugged in during the trip.
5	1336780800	This is such a simple and awesome product how can it get less that 5 stars? It does exactly what it is expected to o and nothing more. I use it between my camera and microphone to both record and monitor with a headset. Very useful!
5	1336521600	It is very good and useful, there was no distortion of sound in my case even when both the jacks were occupied.
5	1336348800	We bought these to watch TV shows on airplanes on my laptop. They worked perfectly! If they sound a bit funny at first, make sure its plugged all the way in. At first my husband's weren't working but I looked at the plug and realized that it needed to click in twice, not just once.
4	1336348800	Brought my direct from Amazon.  Packaging was a bit suspect (read cheap/glued together) as to if this was a legit Belkin product but I'll give it a benefit of the doubt, no spelling errors you usually find in the knockoffs. Though the model number on the packaging (P33600tt-A) turn up nothing on google.After a bit of testing I discovered the stereo output will only work if BOTH connected devices are stereo.  If one of the connected output devices are mono, then both outputs will become mono.  When I had a pair of stereo speakers and a single ear mono headset connected, the stereo speakers changed to mono output.  Quality seemed decent and it worked fine otherwise. Stereo also works fine if only one stereo device is connected.
5	1336176000	Worked with my iPad to use 2 sets of earphones. The price was so low and I got it in just a few days.
5	1336176000	This arrived punctually and worked with our headphones. Make sure all plugs are fully plugged in. Great to have on a trip where you both might want to listen to travel information while using the same device.
3	1336003200	Arrived fast but one of the outputs doesn't work really well. you have to tinker with it until you hear something.
5	1335916800	My wife and I travel a lot together.  We use this splitter to watch movies on our playbook and listen to music on our iPod.  Fits well and sound good.  sound volume drop is unnoticeable.
5	1335744000	I read not so good reviews after the item has been ordered and one time I made up my mind to cancel the order. But decided to give a try. I got the item whatever I saw on the website photo and fully functional , I did test stereo output on both the jacks and it is satisfactory. I ordered white , got the white color. But I am Not sure how long it will work since I have not done endurance test.
1	1335744000	Does not work well unless you find the exact sweet spot on twisting the plugs in the female jacks of this device. Otherwise I heard just a muted and muffled sound.My setup and purpose-  ipod and ipad to allow 2 kids to listen to music or watch movies on a plane.  Headphones were 2 brand new Beats Studio HD .  It didn't matter which plug and both headphones had problems.  Individually in the ipod and ipad, both headphones performed well.  I could not rely on the kids to hold the splitter in just the right position, so this product was useless to us.  If I buy another, I will choose something of better quality.
5	1335225600	Does exactly what it is supposed to do - splits a headphone line.Plug and socket are robust and the split lines long enough to run in different directions without worry about stressing the connection.
5	1335139200	I have neweded one of thse splitters for a long time and never want4ed to pay an outrageous price for such an inexpensive tool.The company is as specified and the product came in a timely manner and undamaged. Belkin is always a good line of products and I hope they always remain that way.. They are one of the oldest lines and I'd like them to go on for longer as a company. Thnk you for having a very reasonable price ont he item and for your expedient service...
5	1335052800	I ordered the Black ones but I got the white 1 instead but still looks nice and works great,nothing complain about.
1	1334707200	I purchased this splitter so my husband and I could watch movies together on my iPad while traveling. I wish I tested it before we left, because the sound quality was absolutely horrendous. The sound provided to one set of headphones was almost inaudible, even when the volume was turned all the way up. Of course, when turned all the way up it is too loud in the other set of headphones anyway. There was no balance whatsoever.This is definitely one of those, "You get what you pay for..." situations.These went straight into the trash. I couldn't even return them because it was over 30 days since I purchased them by the time I got home (we were traveling out of the country for several weeks). Even if I could return them it wasn't worth paying to ship them back.Just save your time and order a better splitter, or just throw $3.99 directly into the garbage.
4	1334102400	It's kind of hard to mess up headphone splitters... these work just fine. If you need a set, these will do the trick.
3	1333584000	The splitter certainly works, but if you have any decent pair of headphones you will hear static feedback when no audio is present (drives me insane, can't use the product for this reason).
5	1333584000	This product arrived and looks and works as advertized.  I had no problems with quality.  I use this thing almost every day.
5	1333411200	Bought for use with our iPad in order to hook up two pairs of headphones to the device to watch movies while travelling.We've only used it with the iPad but it's handy to have around.  SOmetimes would have issues making a solid audio connection between the headhpones and the input, however a little twist on the headphone jack to ensure a good conection solved the problem right away.
5	1333411200	Bought this because i only had one audio jack and needed to run two more speakers with my monitor's speaker. Everything works great. Simple. Cheap. No problems at all.
5	1333324800	I ordered this product and it was expected to be delivered by Thursday, but I got it on the Monday before instead.  I'm so impressed by the speed of delivery, the extremely cheap price of the product, and the quality!  I wanted to split the music from my computer between my amp and sound system and the sound wasn't impacted by the splitter!  Great product, amazing quality and even better price!
5	1332979200	Everyone is talking about using this for music, but I wanted to have phone conversations with distant family and not use the speakerphone.  I was not sure it would work, but it works great!  Sis-in-law said my wife and I sounded much clearer than with speakerphone, and we heard her loud and clear as well.  We were both on iPhone headsets sitting next to each other and there was no interference or feedback.
5	1332892800	Bought this to split headhone jack on tablet PC to connect two sets of headphones so my wife and I could watch movies while flying.  Works perfectly; free shipping; great deal.  Received item very fast.  Fantastic.
4	1332460800	Use this to connect a second audio cable to my computer. For my purposes it works well, and the price is pretty tough to beat. It is not well shielded, I notice a slight buzzing noise coming through my speakers when I have both plugs in use. The buzz is only noticeable when my speakers are in the top 10% of their volume range though. For all practical volumes I don't notice the noise, and to get rid of it all I have to do is unplug the cable I'm not using, but I got this so I wouldn't have to switch the cables every time I wanted to switch speakers.I did not notice any volume drop as mentioned in other reviews, but everything I hook into this has an external power source. If you use speakers that get their power through the audio cable I would expect a volume drop. Other reviews I read mentioned a loss of stereo sound, but I haven't noticed this. My speakers are still playing stereo music through this splitter.For the price I'd suggest buying these, they aren't perfect but do their job well.
5	1332288000	Great price, FAST FAST shipping!!! Amazon hits another homerun on this one. I am using it to split my computer speaker output to 2 seperate audio source inputs and I am very pleased . No sound distortion or crackling. I couldn't ask for anything more at this price point, hard to beat!
5	1331942400	Arrived quickly and as said, it does the job of allowing the use of a speaker and headphone. As some reviewers have pointed out, it will be softer since it's being split but that shouldn't be a problem for anyone unless they have really bad hearing impairments but that's what the headphones are for!
5	1331596800	I was a bit cautious about the product however it works exactly like advertised. It is a great value and is a good thing to have when traveling with my wife.  Splits the headphone output of an iPhone or iPod or iPad into two stereo outputs.  Does not impact volume or quality of soudn as far as I can tell.  Thanks - fantastic value.
4	1331596800	There is not a whole lot one can say about a device so simple.  It is compact, pliable, inexpensive, and works well.  Yep, that's what I needed!  This is a great option for portable devices such as DVD players, iPods / MP3 players, and the like when more than one person wants to use them simultaneously, but headphones are a must.... Just take care not to misplace it!
5	1331078400	At the time I bought these, Amazon had this splitter listed as two different "items" at two different prices. I needed to get two anyway, so I bought one of each as an experiment. The items that arrived were identical, and both look exactly like what is shown in the picture. Even the packaging was the same. So if you're seeing more than one, go with the least expensive.Both splitters have been great. These things just do exactly what they're supposed to. They're sturdily built, cheap, and still working flawlessly after months of daily use.
5	1330732800	The product is super inexpensive but it works well!! I bought it so my sister and I could listen to the same songs on our long rides. Don't hesitate to purchase it because of the price.
5	1330732800	I got this for use with iPad 2 in aGriffin Survivor, Extreme-duty case for iPad 2, BLACK, GB02480and the male end fits and all works great. The volume output didnt see to be affected enough to care (being split now).
5	1329523200	The Belkin headphone splitter has a lifetime warranty and is provides great audio to both outlets and I had no problems plugging in to iPad 2 or computers, etc.  Very good product at an amazing price!
5	1329264000	Just what I was looking for. Great price for the product. Useful and compatible for different handhelds and portables. Fast delivery. Item as descibed.
5	1328918400	I bought these for watching movies with my hubby on the airplane and they are great, simple to use, cheap and best of all, we could both hear and see the movie at the same time-I've also used these in stadiums while tuning in to the local sports channel...very good little gadget
1	1328054400	Don't buy this thing. Didn't work immediately upon opening the package. One side was OK, the other was weird and garble-y.
1	1327968000	I bought this product to use with my Astro MixAmp, my Xbox 360, and a pair of Beyerdynamic MMX300's for gaming. They are awful. The audio quality and volume are greatly diminished and there is NO SURROUND SOUND. It is worse than listening to a pair of Beats at full volume from 10 feet away.  (Beats are just bad, please don't say different. They just look cool)Do not buy this product. It is overpriced for what it is.
5	1327881600	I bought this thinking it was just going to be a little help for the price paid. I was wrong, this little thing has great clarity, I can hear perfectly with both sets of speakers, and when flipped around to allow two inputs into a set of speakers, it works just as well. This is definitely worth the money, and it's a great buy!
5	1327881600	my son needed it for his phone - says it works fine, just as expected. very reasonable price, good product
3	1327363200	The images here show a dongle style splitter with two separate cords.  What I received is a solid belkin splitter.  It's much more rigid and the wire gauges seem more suspect than the dongle that I expected.  Works as advertised, but not the same product as pictured.
5	1327104000	The Belkin splitter is straight yet flexible.  I was a little worried but once I plugged it into my iPod and tested it.  It worked just fine.  Granted, I really wanted the one pictured but I want happy and it is doing what I want it to do.  Thank you.1.24.2012Addendum:Today, I had to rotate the splitter because I didn't get any sound.  I am hoping it is my stereo outlet.  Just a heads up.
5	1326844800	Needed this splitter for my desktop so I didn't have to reach behind it every time I wanted to switch from my speakers to my headphone in my dorm room. Cheap, works, simple. I haven't noticed any issues with sound quality, although I have accidentally left the speakers on while wearing headphones!! XD
5	1326844800	Its not a whole lot to say about these this it was cheap but it worked. I used this in my home studio no drop in sound quality both me and my friend heard the same thing no problems im happy.
1	1326499200	This is not a genuine Belkin item, or at least it wasn't from the seller I purchased from (Bastexwireless).  Got a refund already.Here's what it does: it takes a stereo signal, dumps the right channel, replaces it with a copy of the left channel. AND IT'S LIKE THAT ON BOTH OUTPUT JACKS!There's nothing weird about the shape or size, and it all plugs in completely.
1	1326499200	This is not a genuine Belkin item, or at least it wasn't from the seller I purchased from.Here's what it does:  it takes a stereo signal, dumps the right channel, replaces it with a copy of the left channel.  AND ITS LIKE THAT ON BOTH OUTPUT JACKS!There's nothing weird about the shape or size, and it all plugs in completely, but totally screws up the audio channels.The NSI splitter I ordered from a different seller was very similar to this one, because it switched left/right channels.  It was an obvious fake item too, not like their standard stuff.I'm getting real tired of all these bootleg, knockoff, cheap imitation, counterfeit cables!  They're all being assembled in the dark!
2	1326499200	the audio works, but if u turn the 3.5 mm jack, the sound cuts off. kinda annoying. i ordered from Bastexwireless. very timely for shipping, but beware
3	1326412800	I finally tried it when my cousin and I wanted to hear the game I was playing when everyone else were talking loud. Although, there were some loss audio in terms of volume but I think it can be tweaked to have both in its own individualized sound. Also, we used it on the computer and that's because I play my PS3 on an 720p HD monitor connected to my eMachines computer. I bought an Amazon Basics HDMI to DVI cable to make it happen. Anywho, sound can be diverted in so many ways when it's connected to a computer, I didn't have time to figure out how to have us our own sound volume and preventing the loss in sound volume. All in all, this is a great cheap device and if anyone is looking for a good headphone splitter, you should get this.
1	1326326400	This is truly an awful product. It was delivered as pictured and on time, yet it does not work properly. It's almost as if I have to hit a sweet spot when I plug it in for it to operate. This is a horrible product. I would return it if the return shipping wouldn't cost so much. I guess that in this case you get what you pay for.
5	1326240000	Not much to say, It does what it said it would do and it was a great price.I use it on my work computer so I can plug in two sets of speakers to make a sort of surround sound.
5	1326240000	Does its job! Suuuuppperrrr cheap and worth it! No more splitting 1 headphone with someone else :) Great product and fast shipping.
5	1326240000	The Belkin F8V234 Speaker and Headphone Splitter works great!  I wanted a way to connect both a Tivoli tabletop radio (headphone jack to headphone jack) and an old pair of Jensen speakers via a receiver (RCA cable to headphone jack) to an Apple Airport Express (which has a headphone jack) so I could play digital stuff through good speakers.  The splitter works great.  Before I bought it I read a few reviews from people who used this to split the stereo output to two headphones (for instance, on road trips) and some (who noticed) complained of a volume or signal drop.  I was leery of this but figured I'd only have one output on at a time anyway.  After I got both stereos set up I turned them both on and found that even with volumes at around the 25% level, the signal was still clear and strong.  In short, I didn't experience the volume or signal drop.  I also realized the tiny Tivoli has as high quality sound as two old Jensens (but I digress...)I'm really glad I bought one of these because now I don't have to physically connect either my phone or laptop to the stereo systems anymore.  Further, I wasn't able to connect to my old stereos ever, so the sound quality has really improved.  I highly recommend getting this if you're thinking of connecting two stereo systems like I did.
5	1326153600	I would rate this product 100/100 because it gets the job done extremely well, and it is VERY durable. The minor setback is that it reduces volume about 5-10%. It's not too bad, however. It is very affordable and useful for sharing podcasts and music.
4	1325808000	Nothing fancy, but it get the job done! It works just fine. I would recommend this product. Not to mention it is very cheap!
5	1325721600	It's exactally what it's described as, a white 3.5mm input male to 2 3.5mm output female splitter. It is very tight, so I'm assuming that it will last quite a long time, so I'm satisfied with the product.
1	1325721600	These people show an item thats not even close to what they send. TOTAL RIP OFF. Buyers beware. Don't be fooled by cheap prices.
5	1325376000	Great headphone splitter, is made by Belkin so you can trust the quality.  This is much better than spending $10 for one at Wal-Mart.  No problems so far after very much use.
5	1325203200	Picked this product up for a trip with the kids. Came in very helpful. No more fighting about who gets the headphones. Would recommend them to anyone.
5	1325116800	When I was looking at the different earphone splitters that were advertised I came across this product. It was good for its price but I was hesitant to purchase it. There are a lot of mixed reviews but I soon came to the decisions to just get it. It turns out that it was better than I was expecting it to be. It is really good if you are just planning on sharing with one other person and works on your ipod and computer really well. I totally recommend this product for anyone who likes to watch movies on their computer or share their ipod with another person.
4	1324512000	When I received this item, I immediately tested it out. To my despair, the male 1/8 inch miniplug end (the plastic part) was far to wide to fit all the way into the audio jack on my iPhone because of my iPhone case. Although I fixed it by cutting away parts of the plastic, it took a lot of time and effort. You should be aware of this problem and how it may exist on your device. Other than that, the splitter worked perfectly fine in both ends.
4	1324425600	It does the job. I tried this on MacBook, iPhone4, ipod 4 and on a Dell PC. It works fine except that there is a drop in volume.
5	1324339200	I'm not an audiophile, just layperson who can recognize general audio quality.Before buying this product I was concerned about preserving stereo separation and decrease in volume.The stereo sound IS preserved and the drop in volume is not an issue either.The ridges are great, I'm probably harder on electronics than I should be and the ridges improve flexibility and keep the wires from shorting out.This product is cheap and I've been using it for months, I'm happy with it.
3	1324339200	I bought this cable for a recent trip so my wife and I could both listen to movies through our headphones on our Galaxy Tab. We initially had some trouble getting the cable to work properly. At first my wife would hear music while I would hear the voices. After playing with the cable for a little bit it ended up working and we were really grateful that we bought it.
5	1324252800	The item was very good and with it, I can listen to music with a friend, the quality is formidable
2	1323648000	Cheap product that works sometimes, often requires a little fudging with the cords to get the sound through. Great for occasional use but not reliable
5	1323648000	I'm no technician, and some of the reviews here made me quite skeptical of this piece of equipment . . . so for those of you out there who, like me, just want to know if these things work, they do.  They work perfectly.  I received mine (2 of them) today and promptly plugged them in to see if both ends of each splitter played full audio.  I have just the track to test this out; one with audio going back and forth between left and right channels.  Testing this out in every case, I could hear both left and right channels through my headphones, just as I would have hoped.  This tells me that the item is NOT simply channeling the left audio into one end and the right audio into the other end, but sending a "stereo" signal into both ends of the splitter.  Also, the plugs fit and "seat" nicely, so I'm confident there will be a good quality and consistant sound coming through when it's time to put them to good use.  Though the price is incredibly low, you can purchase with confidence!  Oh, and in case it sounds like I work for Belkin or for the company selling this product, nope, I just wanted to clarify the issue since I was so confused reading so many reviews saying two different things.  Now that I have mine, there's no confusion here!
5	1323561600	that was exactly what i ordered bro and great timing i received sooner than what i expected thank you a lot
4	1322956800	My wife and I used this splitter with two earphone sets with a kindle fire to watch a movie on a cross country plane ride.  It worked.  It did require a little twisting of the plug for one of the earphone sets immediately after it was inserted in the splitter to get stereo sound.  But, both earphone sets worked after that.
5	1322784000	Recently got a big subwoofer from Amazon...didn't know how I can set it up because the computer sound card won't work if you plug a speaker from the front and the sub in the back for me.  After lots of researching, I was going to buy a receiver for at least 95 dollars so everything gets hooked up.  Thanks to this 4 dollar item, both left and right side of the speaker gets the sound signal for my sound bar PLUS the subwoofer works beautifully.  My set up is this:HDMI from video card output of Desktop to HDTV3.5mm hole of the Sound bar---> 3.5mm to 3.5mm Y ---> one side of this Belkin splitter --> speaker output of computerSubwoofer---> 6 ft White + Red RCA to 3.5 mm Y splitter (my sub only has the white and red hole in it)---> 2nd side of Belkin splitterSelect the speakers as the default device under 'Sound' in control panel.
5	1322697600	Splits my audio port perfectly. No complaints. Gets the job done perfectly and the price is amazing. Recommended to anyone.
5	1322438400	Bought this to splity the audio from a computer so both daughters could watch a movie on car trips. Worth every penny!
5	1321315200	I bought these so my friends, sister, and I can listen to music on the bus wearing different headphones. The cord works perfectly and there is nothing wrong with it. Shipping was free and cheap. There isn't much more to say. :)
4	1321228800	I got what I ordered. It arrived on time. I am satisfied with the quality. No complaints. Best price I could find anywhere.
5	1320796800	I used this to connect to headphone sets to my laptop to watch a movie on an airplance. It was easy to use and worked great!
4	1320796800	This product does exactly what I wanted it to.  I honestly don't have anything bad to say about it.  If you want to plug in multiple headphones to one jack, this is the way to do it.  My girlfriend and I can listen to the same music when we study in coffee shops now, which is wonderful.  I recommend it.
5	1320624000	Product has come in handy when watching movies on a laptop computer or other handheld device. It also came with another pair headphones which was a good surprise. This thing helps a lot.
5	1320019200	The splitter works fine and does what it's supposed to do. Like previous reviews have said, the sound is diminished a bit in each set of headphones when two are plugged in, but hey, that's physics.
4	1320019200	wouldnt say its the best quality but what do you expect for under 5 bucks. I love them and use them all the time. Would recommend this product to someone who is looking for a cheap splitter that actually splits the line equally into both headphones
3	1319846400	This splitter works fine, but be aware it won't fit if you ned a 'slim' plug to fit in your iphone case or recessed jack.
1	1319068800	not even a full day of usage and already one of the female connections stopped working, heard a pop & now only one side works. BE WARNED OF THE BAD QUALITY.
5	1318550400	Again I have ordered several times from this dealer and always gotten what I order quickly and with no porblems what ever with the transaction or the products ordered. Highly recommended
5	1317513600	So I must say we were a bit nervous because this product was so cheap, but we LOVE it! It works great. It does not work with our cheap headphones though, I guess because they have poor sound quality to begin with. But we have a couple pairs of nice headphones and it really is like they are plugged directly in without the connector.
4	1317254400	The wires are good and sound pretty good. Quality can be a little better but I do recommend the wires. I use it to mix music on my MAC computer and they work pretty good. The only reason I give it a 4 stars is because the quality is not so great but like I said I recommend them specially for the price..
2	1316908800	I ordered three sets.  I have only tested one but on that one the sound quality is brassy and tinny compared to my earphones and one of the female connectors has a bad connection and is intermittent.
5	1316649600	This is a inexpensive simple device obviously, but it worked fine -- two sets of ear buds both had adequate volume.
1	1315267200	I bought this product assuming that the positive reviews would be correct and that the negative reviews were people who were mis-shipped the wrong item. I received a cord in the mail that looks identical to the one pictured and it does exactly what the negative reviews say it does. it doesn't split one audio source into two. it takes a 2 channel audio source and splits it into right and left channels. If you really need an extra connection and spot to lose audio quality to split your output into left and right channels for your receiver this will work wonders for you. if you are just trying to split an audio source into two duplicate connections steer clear of this as you will only wind up wasting your money.
5	1315094400	perfect for just your basic headphone splitting.  really good quality.  would recommend it, especially in comparison to the splitters that are not flexible.
4	1314835200	No issues with this splitter. When two devices are plugged into it, the volume will be decreased, as should be expected.Volume controls would have been nice, but they are not advertised, so should not be expected.
5	1314316800	Really nice product.No problems with it and it came very quickly,also sound quality was good.Overall i was greatly satisfied.Have i told you lately that i love u?
5	1313971200	This is an excellent utility.It does not reduce the sound quality. Though volume is reduced a little in case you use the internal battery powered music players, ipod etc.
1	1313625600	Doesn't work....only sends to one channel, which renders item useless....too bad im too lazy to return it, just want to let others know not to purchase
5	1312934400	This product is absolutely wonderful and does what it claims it will. My wife and I both have fairly good ear buds and there was no difference with or without the splitter. I tried each pair of ear buds individually. Then I used one from each headphone one each ear. No matter which ear bud I had the sound was excellent, and the same exact quality produced without the splitter. I will say that I am no expert on sound, so I am not saying that it will flawlessly split a high dollar sound system. I can only guarantee that I have respectable $50- $60 headphones and I did not hear a difference in sound quality.If you would like a headphone splitter don't waste your money on something else. It's cheap and works exceptionally.
2	1312329600	I bought this splitter because my new computer monitor didn't have a jack for headphones.  I plugged the splitter in the speaker jack on the back of the monitor and then plugged the speaker wire into one side of the splitter and my headphones into the other side.  It worked well for a couple days, but the headphone plug-in is now so loose in the splitter that the sound comes through the headphones and the computer speakers at the same time which makes the splitter useless to me.
5	1312329600	I bought this little headphone splitter so I could listen to music with my brother or parents on the plane or something.  I never liked doing it the old way, getting a regular earbud headphone and each getting one bud.  This product works well and it preserves stereo sound.  The music sounds just as good as it was with just one headphone plugged in.  And the best part is it's under $4.  I looked at one at Best Buy and it was a block one for $8.  I read that the block ones break eventually because they can't bend.  So getting something better for cheaper is great!  I'm pleased with this buy.
1	1312243200	The splitter works fine for the head-phones but couldn't get the microphone to work. It seems to be some contact issue with the splitter and the socket on my laptop. If I pull it out a tiny bit and hold it, I can get it to work faintly. Otherwise, there's no microphone function. I wish I had a solution for this. This one turned out to be useless.
4	1312243200	Audio volume is decreased when used, but that's expected. Often the volume isn't distributed evenly to both pairs of earbuds -- while one person needs to crank up the volume, the other is saying it's too loud. Overall, though, it gets the job done and it's great to be able to watch stuff on my computer with a friend, when earbuds are necessary. For the price, you can't really complain about what you get.
5	1311292800	I use this to split the sound between my living room and my patio.  Works exactly as expected.  Sound quality is excellent.  I cannot notice the difference in sound before and after connecting the splitter.
1	1310947200	tried to use this splitter with a Macbook pro - it failed to connect to the port properly.  I do not recommend this product for that reason.
5	1310688000	I bought this product because my brother rigged all the random speakers in his room to his computer using the belkin rockstar splitter. My needs were not as advanced and i just want to hook up my logitech speakers (see my review) and my ipod dock. The sound quality is nice and it is an all around good product.
5	1309824000	This is a great headphonne splitter. It doesn't take away as much sound when inserted 2 headphones. The price isn't big either worth the price. Great product, strongly recomend.
5	1309392000	This product is great, very flexible cord etc, and NO it does not turn stereo into mono, i use this with my computer, to plug in 4 speakers, 2 on each set, and it works great, its  almost as if im not using a splitter at all, no audio quality is lost, as i found on an RCA splitter. the video quality was worse when i split it, no audio quality appears lost with these, highly recommended.
1	1308960000	I recieved the headphone splitter and it was not as described.  It did not split the signal into two stereo outputs, instead it split the stereo into separate right and left outputs.  If two people want to listen then each set of headphones will only get one side of the stereo signal.  On a positive note, the seller quickly refunded my order and I didn't even have to send the product back.
3	1308873600	Since the day one the product it is not working well. I need to keep on adjusting one connector to listen to the sound. I bought this especially to watch movies by me and my wife so that my son wont get disturbed when he is sleeping.My both of the headphones are from Sony & Apple and they work superb when Iuse them independently.Overall i could say i am not much satisfied with this product.
3	1308355200	Overall simple and good but after a few hours of use the right channel of one of two connectors stopped working...Maybe I was just unlucky. Otherwise, it's small, flexible and practical. Sound quality not affected.
5	1308268800	After orderingProfessional Cable ST35-SPLIT Headphone Splitter - Blackwhich I thought would be a headphone splitter...it was not, it was a left/right channel splitter, I then ordered thisBelkin F8V234 Speaker and Headphone Splitterwhich is a headphone splitter. Instead of using the picture, I chose this Belkin F8V234 from it's product description and item/model number. Having looked up Belkin F8V234, it is, in fact, a headphone splitter. Still, from the reviews from both of the items I inserted links to seem to have mixed reviews as to what item is received. As for this Belkin F8V234 headphone splitter I received, it is exactly what I wanted and appears to be good (Belkin) quality and is working great splitting my music to two sets of earbuds...all without loss of volume or sound quality.7/15/11 UPDATE:I purchased a second one of this Belkin splitter and I, again, received the Belkin F8V234 stereo headphone splitter which is the product described, not pictured.THIS IS A STEREO EARBUD/HEADPHONE SPLITTER!
5	1308096000	I got 2 of these, one to connect 2 sets of speakers to my computer and the other to connect 2 sets of speakers to my tv. works great haven't had any problems at all
1	1306108800	Before you order this item be aware that the picture shown here in the product description is not the actual item shipped. Although it accomplishes the same result, it is a totally different product. If you want the item shown, and are willing to accept a black version, then consider ordering  the Belkin Y adaptor from Amazon instead:Belkin F8Z359tt06INCHP Y Adapter; Mini Stereo Plug. That's what I did. This item can be found on the Belkin website and what is pictured there is what is pictured here on the Amazon site. So, bottom line, what is shown is what should ship. I returned the original item to Amazon because it is definitely not what I wanted.
4	1306108800	It works well! It definitely does not look like the picture that is shown in the description.Instead of the plug splitting into two separate cords, it's one flexible cord about 2 inches long and has the headphone splitter unit at the end of it. That way no cords are tangling around. I like the design but beware it doesn't look like the picture shown.I'm not sure if it's my plug, but there has been a little static noise coming from my speakers. But I just unplug and plug it back in and everything will be fine. A sort of a nuisance but I cannot yet 100% attribute the static noise to the splitter.The cord is really flexible so you can bend it pretty much into any direction where you have enough space.I'd say if you are even slightly considering getting one, this one is the one to get.
1	1305763200	Instead of what you see on the picture, i receieved a stiff one that is long and splits at the end rather than the cords that split early on. GOing to try and send it back dunno if I can and considering the shipping cost more than the item, im not super pleased.
3	1305504000	This is a jack splitter, works fine, and though i do have a use for this (thus the 3 stars), this is not what i intended when i ordered it.What i was looking for was a 3.5mm to RCA Stereo Female Cable, which is what the picture details, this is not one of those, this is merely a jack splitter, which in itself is fine, however if your like me and aren't overly experienced in tech terminologies, you might look at the picture and purchase the wrong product like i did, so be aware of what this is.The product is 5 stars, however amazon get's 1 star for not showing the actual product, and thus the 3 stars.
1	1305072000	I have to say this is the worst audio splitter I've ever tried! Sounds like a tine can when connected to an iPad2. Product shipped was label with same part number, but does not look anything like the item pictured.
5	1303689600	This little thing gets the job done. I needed a splitter so my 3 children could listen to a movie on the portable DVD player for a long road trip, there were only 2 audio ports but with this there are now three. What a simple, excellent solution!
5	1303516800	I've only had the product about a month, but it's working as expected and performing fine.  I can now have both my computer's speaker combo and the transmitter for my wireless headphones plugged into the same audio jack on my computer, depending on my listening preference at any given moment.  (One of my computer's 2 audio jacks got messed up, that's why I needed to buy this product.)  Well worth the money spent, IMO.
1	1302652800	I was specifically looking for a left-right channel splitter, just like the picture; one regular stereo 3.5mm jack to two separate 3.5mm jacks - one red and one white, for the left and right channels.  Many reviewers complained about this cable only splitting the audio into the two separate channels, and that is exactly what I was looking for: a left-right splitter.I ordered this assuming I would receive the pictured product, the same one the reviewers were complaining about.  What I got was a simple stereo Y-splitter, which isn't what I needed or wanted to purchase.If this seller actually has any 3.5mm left-right splitters, I would love to know and would gladly purchase one.
5	1301961600	It splits the device to enable 2 sets of headphones.  It works, what else can I say.  Good construction good price.
5	1301875200	Your everyday simple Speaker to splitter. Belkin is a reliable product so everything should work as it should. And it'll last as well.
3	1301443200	I really needed this to share music with a friend.  After I plugged it in, it worked but was distorting the music.  I would consider a higher quality one but if you are looking for an inexpensive headphone splitter, this is OK for a gift or for just sharing music with a friend.
1	1301011200	The item is unusable as a splitter with 2 sets of stereo headphones - the white jack connects to left channel (tip) only and the red jack connects to right channel (ring) only.  Yet a careful look at the jacks provided shows they are stereo jacks.Frankly, I'm not sure what the application is intended to be...I'm unable to come up with any use for it, unless you're a couple who happen to be hearing-impaired in opposite ears.
1	1300924800	I ordered this thinking that i would get a splitter so that i could use two headphones for one jack. All the product did was split the audio into a left and right channel. I could only hear the left side of my headphone that was connected to the white side and vice versa.
4	1300924800	I too received all black, don't know if "newer model" (red/white) alleviates some of listed complaints.  Just a heads up, not a problem, haven't used yet.
5	1300665600	It does, in fact, maintain stereo separation in each female jack. The best part about it is that it actually holds on to my headphone jack more firmly than any other regular input. Also the volume attenuation isn't even that bad because I mainly use these with a stereo equipment with their own gain control/headphone amp; however, even without these things, the volume doesn't diminish too much. The wires are pretty thick and all of the connections are quite solid.
4	1300579200	I got this to split off the headphones/ear buds for a portable DVD player on flights. It works great and is easy to pack. Just make sure the headphones/ear buds are of the same sensitivity (i.e. 90dB). If not, one set will be louder than the other. For example, I have a cheap pair that came with my Sansa and my wife just prefers the ones that came with her iPod (which are terrible by the way) and she can barely hear anything while I'm laughing away at the movie. So, the Sansa ones are a lot louder than the iPod ones. Therefore, they have different sensitivity ratings and really are not compatible when used this way. If you buy this splitter I would suggest testing both sets of headphones/ear buds first.
5	1299888000	I bought two of these so I could use them together and get 3 people listening to music. Works great!
5	1299801600	Works like a charm. My old splitter from Radioshaft was extremely temperamental and gave me intermittent audio connection issues so this is a breath of fresh air.Like Alexander said, the picture is misleading, but only in color. It is, as stated, all black. I don't see why it would make a difference since this is a splitter, but if you are extremely particular about getting exactly what you see, you might not be so pleased.It isn't gold plated, but it's only $3. And to be honest, unless you've got a gold plated jack to connect to, you aren't benefiting from having a gold plated plug.
5	1299369600	i ordered it and it got here the next day it is red and black like in the picture its super sturdy looks very well built i would most definitely do business with them again
3	1297814400	The price should maybe be lower because the wires seem just average.  Some days i have to wiggle the jack for a second to get one side to work. But it is not that annoying and it might be the computer jack's fault, in which case i would say 4 stars not 3. I'ld buy it again just cause i did not see a better made one in the short time i looked on amazon.
5	1296950400	What can one say?  This is not exactly rocket guidance systems, it's basic hardware.  It works as it should, hooray!  It was reasonably priced and arrived on time as well.
5	1295136000	I had spliter thta came with haedphone extension and it was horriable. It had so much humming, but this is ok. I am not having any problem with it.
5	1294790400	This is just a quick review to say the stereo system is absolutely working and the sound quality is almost the same I had with my not-so-pricey ear-buds. I was almost thinking of not buying this because of that false 1-star review which apparently was most helpful. I don't know what kind of problem he/she had but I just tested it with Sony test video and it works.
5	1293062400	Works Great Now I Can Split The Audio On My Older Laptop With Just One Headphone Jack and Use Two Headsets To Share Movies With My Friends While Traveling!!!!
5	1292544000	This item does what it's supposed to do, and it does it well.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Being a college student, I don't want to bother my roommate while I'm watching a show or movie with my boyfriend, so we use the headphone splitter to be quiet.
5	1290729600	Bought the Belkin F8V234-WHT Speaker and Headphone Splitter on 8/19/2010 for $[...] (Super Saver Shipping) from Amazon; shipped USPS Priority Mail 8/23/10, and I received it 8/26/10.  Great turn-around on delivery from ordering - 1 week! Splitter works just great on our iPod and on our Sansa Fuze.  Maintains stereo separation between the channels also.  Great deal!
5	1285804800	No rocket science here - If you have one MP3 player and two people want to listen, this is what you need. I did not feel there was much volume loss when splitting the signal.
5	1284768000	This is a fantastic piece of audio equipment. Not only is it great for sharing audio with two headphones, but it's also great giving sound to both my computer speakers and the TV I have connected to my computer. I get a full, rich sound on both sets of speakers and in headphones.Definitely a must buy for people looking to share sound between 2 speakers or headsets.
5	1281657600	I was looking for a device so that my wife and I could use watching video on my new iPad while flying.  This works very well.  It is compact, and I detected no degradation of the sound.
5	1281484800	I used this adapter on my iPad during a flight and it worked great.Stereo sound is preserved, and I haven't noticed any reduction in volume or sound quality.It seems like it'll last a long time, unlike those really cheap ones you can find at Walmart or Radio Shack that break after a few uses.
4	1281139200	This is a great adapter, especially for the price.Sound quality is not lowered that I can tell, meaning not enough for most to care.It's about 7 1/2" long, with about 5" for the separate cord lengths. Not to big, not too small.HOWEVER, I use it for having both my Denon D2000 headphones and 2.1 desktop speakers hooked up to the same port. On my headphones, I notice no real difference. However, it cuts the volume on my desktop speakers by about half.My 2.1 system has a good 200watts, so it's interesting that it is able to limit them so greatly.. But oh well, for me it is easy enough to switch them out.For 3 bucks, this is a great devise.
5	1278806400	My problem was that I could not record streaming audio on my PC because Dell does not present the stereo mix as one of the recording device options. There are lots of free apps available for downloading streaming audio(to record internet radio for example - only where legal of course), but with many Dell PCs these apps dont work. So... I bought this belkin splitter for less than $4. I plugged the main splitter lead into the sound card out and the speaker cable into one of the splitters, and I plugged an audio cable from the other end of the splitter to the mic jack on the front of my pc. Bingo - now I can listen and record at the same time. Then I move the mp3 files to my kindle. There are many problems with playing said files on the kindle but still, it works.
1	1278460800	I bought this to unify my PS3 and computer sound cables into one to my sound system, so as to not have to change from one input to the other each time. Well than god it's dirt cheap cos this product is terrible. The sound quality degraded a lot and even the volume did weird things: with both inputs plugged in, the volume went down like by half, and just disconnecting one of them restored things to normal. Weird.If you're looking for good quality sound, stay away from this crap.
5	1271980800	This Belkin splitter perfectly split a stereo headphone jack into two stereo headphone jacks.  The sound is great, it appears well built, and all the connections are solid.  I can't ask for more.Note that the image above is incorrect.  The headphone splitter is actually all black, and looks much better for it.
1	1270598400	Like the previous reviewer, I received an all-black splitter.Every couple of days, I lose the left channel of my speakers. I have to fully unplug and replug the connector to the splitter to get the sound working again. I believe it's the splitter because this does not happen when I don't use the splitter.When it is working, it sounds fine, but I'm no audiophile. Oh, well. Three dollars.
4	1268784000	Splitter is great, but I meant to purchase a splitter that went in the other direction...  (i.e. two male 1/8" audio to one female 1/8" audio)Oh well.  This is great at what it does.
5	1265068800	Works great for splitting the audio from my laptop and for the dvd player for the motor-home. I liked it so much I bought two at the same time. (figure that out)
5	1263859200	Works wonderfully when my wife and I want to both watch a video on my iphone.  No complaints at all.
4	1262822400	not much to say about this splitter it does the job had not problems with it works like it should worth the money.
5	1250640000	I have had this product a couple of months now and it has been working great for Guitar Hero World Tour with two bass pedals.very inexpensive and works well.
4	1248480000	It worked as advertised. However, the one that I received was a different color (all black) instead of the one in the picture (black, red, white). I dislike it when sellers deliver something else other than what is actually in the advertised picture. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
5	1242086400	Well it's basically as pictured... a bit bigger in real life than you'd expect. Mine however, came colored black when I'm pretty sure the "WHT" part of the title means white. Doesn't matter tho, I'm not an iPod owner, black goes with my Zune just fine.
5	1237593600	Excellent product for the money.  I didn't know what to expect, and I was extremely pleased with how well it worked.
4	1220400000	As other reviewers have noted (and I've taken this into account for purchasing), the volume drops across both outputs since the signal is split -- not a big concern for me, but on some setups this may result in an unhappy amount of line noise when you have to crank source volumes to compensate.I use this because I have a stereo deck (with high-quality Sony MDR-V900s attached) and a Plantronics headset I use for recording video tutorials and such on my computer. I didn't want to actively have to toggle back-and-forth, since that'd impede my workflow: my use case is swapping between headsets quickly, and this Belkin splitter is a tidy little solution!
5	1216339200	works pretty well. unlike what the other review said, the audio is not mono, you just have to push the connector in. the splitter is a bit longer than i wanted (3in, but i wanted to use it with my laptop), but that's definitely better than it being too short.
5	1199836800	So to recap:Dirt cheapFlexibleextremely easy to useDiminishes volume?  Not too badly.DOES preserve stereo separation! I'm mixing a song right now through these splitters and while panning back and forth, my headphones respond as if the splitter weren't in at all.  It doesn't turn stereo to mono despite what that one guy said.  And yes, I've got two pairs of headphones plugged in.I discovered that if both sets of headphones plugged into the splitter aren't firmly plugged in, it will do the stereo to mono thing, but if you click them in properly, you're fine.

4	1176681600	I have used this for my ipod and my psp. I say its better for the ipod. The thought of a splitter for the psp is good, but i would like it if it didnt stick out. I'd recommend the ones that just have one dock instead of 2 wires.
1	1173312000	This device sums both channels and creates a mono version of whatever you are listening to, sending this new mono version to the two pairs of headphones.  Stereo separation is LOST.  If that doesn't bother you, buy it.  To me, it is essentially worthless due to this limitation.
5	1170720000	For the price, this is a great little gizmo. What I like most is that the connector is flexible. Most other splitters are rigid and bulky. Not so on this one. I use it with my iPod.
5	1169596800	I got these as my secondary splitters, but since my other ones haven't come in yet, I decided to use these.  While sitting on the bus with my friend, we were both able to listen to my ipod comfortably, and were able to sing together.  These work great, and turning up the volume is only needed if one person like the volume higher than the other person sets it.
5	1149984000	does the job and no complaints. These type of splitters are ideal because you don't have to worry about it breaking from bending. I purchased a splitter before that wasn't wired, just a solid unit, and it broke from bending too much.
5	1138406400	Diminishes volume for each set of headphones, but that is to be expected. Extremely easy to use. A great product!
