4	1405209600	Fabulously written - and full use of highlights thanks to Kindle. It's a page turner and perfect for my recent overseas flight. Most interesting is the psychological insights into the characters and the thought-provoking narrative on &#34;cool girls&#34;.
4	1405123200	A book with lots of twists and turns, It is told by Amy and her husband Nick. Each with their own story to tell. It is a good quick read. At one point I lost sleep as I was mentally going over the facts in my head so had to get up and read some more. Like others have said it is good until the end. The end is a little disappointing as it leaves more questions. I started to read this before I heard about a movie being made, It will make a great movie but do hope they fix the ending
4	1405036800	Loved this book! Keeps you guessing!
4	1405036800	Good easy holiday read - would recommend.
3	1404950400	The story starts out really slow and ends up being disappointing. The end is unexpected. The characters are unreal.
1	1404950400	good story, disappointing end.
4	1404864000	I thoroughly enjoyed the whole style of writing and the plot which was so unusual. I was totally unprepared for the ending. A jolly good read.
4	1404864000	The author must have had an amazing time weaving the plot. So many threads introduced,spun and cut, in order to wriggle us into a story with,frankly,horrible people. She gives a stark exhibition of the state of play in relationships. On many levels, she is right on the button but there are no redeeming characters.One thing is certain, no one  could have foreseen the various twists and turns. No one could have guessed the motives.Not to be read if you are feeling down in the dumps, but worth pursuing to the end.
4	1404777600	Great
3	1404777600	Clever, easy read.
5	1404691200	Have never really read much thrillers but I will definitely be reading more of the genre. Gillian Flynn is great
3	1404604800	Two years after the rest of the world started raving about Gone Girl (which even has its own Wikipedia page!), I've finally read it myself.And, well... I have to admit to being underwhelmed.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the novel and was keen to discover the oft-mentioned twists myself, but I suspect the hype led me to believe the book was going to be something astoundingly different. And amazing. My #meh-ness could also be because I've read a lot (and I mean A LOT) of similar books: thrillers in which husbands or wives disappear, leaving behind suspects and secrets.Indeed I recently previewed a novel in which - after following this poor beleaguered suspect throughout the novel - you actually discover at the end that she DID do it and (though she's actually very nice and quite likeable) she casually knocks off her husband at the end so he takes the blame for everything. And I did not see it coming. At all!For those who may not have yet read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, the plot centres around the disappearance of a woman and the plight of her less-concerned-than-he-should-be husband, when all clues point in his direction.Amy and Nick should be celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary when Amy goes missing. We know that things aren't quite right between the couple. The first part of the novel is narrated by Nick and he's obviously unhappy in the marriage though much is left unsaid. Unabashedly honest with we readers, he admits that he's lying consistently to the police but (at first) doesn't explain why.Nick is supported by Amy's parents who steadfastly (initially at least) believe that Nick would never hurt their daughter. His own twin sister is more suspicious of Nick's behaviour but their bond seems practically unbreakable.Amy, however, has a voice in this part of the novel as we're privy to chapters of a diary she's written over several years; and she tells the story of a couple - once madly in love but struggling after losing their jobs and undergoing big lifestyle changes. In the diary Amy documents Nick's increasingly aggressive behaviour and confesses to being afraid of her own husband.To the media and world at large Nick's guilt is obvious; however... we readers know to expect some twists and turns before the final pages.The negative reviews I've read talk about the central couple (Nick and Amy) as being unlikeable and therefore they've cared little about their fate. I actually quite liked Nick. He's far from perfect - very 'weak-willed' in some ways and just plain stupid about certain things - but I found his character very believable.The first part of the novel was very slow. Almost plodding. Perhaps it's because we know there'll be a plot twist coming, but (as I had other commitments) I had no problem putting the book aside and taking 3-4 nights to finish it. I'd kinda seen the first plot twist coming and I (initially) found that to be the most enjoyable part of the novel. What came next, however... was just too ridiculous for me to accept and I again grew frustrated. And... as for the ending. YUCK!I can see why the book appeals to many. Indeed it's got all of the key ingredients and (as mentioned above) I read A LOT of thrillers which are similar (disappearance of husband / wife / child / sister leaving behind obvious suspects plus a few unexpected turns of event) so it's a popular theme. For me however, Gone Girl really offered nothing new or different to afford its cult-like status.PS. I bought GG as part of a three-book purchase and despite my #meh-ness, I'm looking forward to reading Gillian Flynn's previous two novels.
1	1404518400	Quite peculiar and so very unbelievable. Just kept flicking pages to see if it improved but unfortunately it just didn't.
5	1404518400	A man, Nick, finds one day that his wife Amy has disappeared and he is soon suspected of murdering her.  This book is a subtle thriller that explores what can go wrong when two people who have been conditioned to pretend their whole lives try to make a life together.  When someone wears a mask for too long, there's a risk they'll become the mask.  While there might be an occasional flaw in this diamond, such as Nick's first person narrator sometimes holding back from the reader things he would be thinking, these don't diminish the power of this work.
5	1404518400	What a brilliant book!! Gillian Flynn writes in a way that makes it all seem so real and very frightening.
4	1404432000	Kept Me Interesred, Ending Was A Bit Different.
5	1404432000	An entertaining book. The characters develop in an intriguing way. Suspenseful story line.
4	1404432000	Great read - kept you really interested - great ending - still thinking about it.
4	1404345600	Interesting the way of story make me didn't want to put down kindo
5	1404259200	This was amazing
1	1404259200	I'd have given this zero stars, but the Amazon protocols don't permit it. I gave up after the fourth page. Gimmicky, badly written rubbish.
5	1404172800	Full of unexpected twists and turns. This book is very cleverly written.
4	1404172800	What an amazing book. I loved it. LOVED IT. It's the best book I have read in ages and I read a lot. A lot, people!I could not put it down, it truly captured me. Read it, please, please: buy it and read it. It's a must!!!The only thing that kept me from rating it with 5 stars was that the last bit was too much of twists. It looked like the writer knew she only had certain amount of chapters left and had to put all her ideas into it. But don't let that put you off, because the book is FAN-TAS-TIC.
5	1404000000	Couldn't put this down.  The ending wasn't quite what I WANTED to happen but I loved the story nonetheless.  A couple of screwed up characters!
4	1404000000	Ripper book.She was crazzzzzzyyyyyy.Mind twisting.Definitely kept me on my toes and made me swaps sides multiple times.
3	1403740800	A great strong well paced story let down by a weak anti-climactic and very disappointing ending! Is there a sequel perhaps to tidy the mess up?
4	1403654400	I really enjoyed this book.  It held my interest all the way through to the end.  But the ending was soon disappointing.
5	1403654400	I just loved this book and what a twist !!!!! seems like there is a sequel coming on . I got to then end and thought what really ?????? I didn't want it to end very clever ending !!!!
5	1403568000	This is my first 5 star review. I loved this book. I was going to bed early just to get a couple of hours read in before I went to sleep. Could not put it down. Just a minor thing was it dropped off a bit in places but soon picked up the pace again. The 2nd part is where all the action is.Despite what other reviewers have said about the ending I thought it was a prefect ending and the only way it could end. I will read her other books and look forward to the next ones.Don't hesitate - buy it and read it.
5	1403395200	I think this book would make a great movie. It really kept me interested and involved in the story. I was not happy with the ending though I don't want to spoil it for others reading this excellent book. I will watch out for other books by this author.
2	1403308800	I struggled with this bookThe premise was goodHowever the execution was poor, the story was predictable and actually stunk of a Hollywood scriptIt will make a good movie though
4	1403049600	This book has you examining your own relationships in all their grime and glory and thinking &#34;Yep, they got away with it&#34; right to the very end. Riveting stuff.
5	1403049600	very disappointed when the book finished it was great never saw what was coming.  would have liked a different ending i suppose... like nic getting a divorce or catching amy out in some way, no ' just desserts' there.
5	1403049600	Just brilliant! A fantastic, can't put down read - keen to read her other books now. Thank you Gillian Flynn!
2	1402704000	Am probably being generous giving this book 2 stars!  Interesting at times but an incredibly poor ending!!!  Would NOT recommend this book to anyone.
4	1402617600	Very clever and well written although the first few chapters were hard to get into. But the turn and twists will keep you guessing - well worth persisting to uncover a great weekend novel
3	1402617600	Very interesting book!~~Possible spoilers!!!Amy is not who she leads you to believe initially. A fascinating dive into a very strange and twisted mind. Wow! The ending was interesting.. not sure its what I would have done, in Nicks place, however I can see his reasoning.Overall very interesting book. Not one for the &#34;Favourites! I must read again and again....&#34; pile, but it held my attention to the end.
2	1402444800	Did not enjpy this novel.  Too long , Too drawn out. Too much focus on individuals.  Went almost straight to end
2	1402444800	I liked the way the story was told from both Amy and Nick's perspectives. At some point stopped being intriguing and just seemed over the top and of course, I hated the end.
5	1402444800	It's hard to put down this book once you start. You see yourself taking sides, only to switch a while later and then realise, you are being messed with. Enjoyed the nail biting plot, rounded, idosyncratic characters and a convoluted, gripping narration.
4	1402358400	I thought this started a bit slow, but I kept at it as I'd been told it was good. It's actually a lot more than just good. I'd highly recommend it. It's not really a thriller as its not fast paced, story is really worth reading though.
3	1402358400	While I can't say this is a bad book,I didn't enjoy it.The characters were real,plot also but it was not a pleasurableread.
1	1402012800	REASON I GAVE THIS ONE STAR IS BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST BORING BOOK I EVERREAD. IT WAS ABOUT NOTHING
3	1401840000	This was chosen as part of our book club. It was definitely an easy, somewhat engaging to read. It kept me turning the page because I just wanted it to end. I found it more on the disturbing, not quite entertaining.
5	1401753600	Very different but enjoyable ,look forward to reading more GIllian FLynn books and would a strongly recommend it to everyone.
5	1401753600	Its after a long time that I came across a book, that spoke to me from the first sentence itself. The book is written in a language that not only bring the characters to life but also involves you personally in the plot. Loved it absolutely
4	1401667200	By the end of this book, I felt the word 'creepy' would describe it best. The more you read the more you realise (near the last third of the book) that one of the main characters is a sociopath, in a way that just seeps into your bloodstream. A good writer has the ability to create a character that makes you feel so repelled. As an example Stephen King is Great at that.However, the first half of the book, for me, was a real struggle to get through.The writer spent a long time developing the situation & the characters, to the point where it was boring & hard to get into.
5	1401667200	This crime story gives a funny and grimly true image of life as a couple gone bad. You think you know what will happen... but then you don't!
4	1401580800	A book that keeps surprising you with all the kind of games a woman's (and man's) mind can play and how far someone can reach.
2	1401580800	I find myself very conflicted about this book and if I like it or not.  The two main characters weren't ones I felt I could attach or care about to any extent as both Nick and Amy were inherently unlikeable as people.  I am willing to concede that author may have been going for realism as her characters are all wonderfully flawed and the general appeal of Nick and Amy to those around them seems more built on their attractiveness and &#34;cool&#34; factor which raises interesting questions; in our media obsessed culture do we rely more on how people look and seem then in who they really are?  How are our personalities shaped by what's &#34;popular&#34; in popular culture?Ultimately though the characters ended up being so flawed that they just annoyed me!The novel itself kept an excellent pace and the twists did keep me hooked as I just wanted to know where the author was taking me.  The trial by media grossness?  The discovery of a body?  And that journey in and of itself was interesting, especially the light shone on the media circus and how if a story is picked up by national media that trial can be superfluous with witness and hanger on's talking to the media before the police, dolling out information when its the most sensational.  So I was there on the journey and enjoying the twists and then there was the ending!  Very disappointing and anti-climatic.Honestly it didn't seem worth the time I had taken to read the novel!
5	1401494400	An amazing, manipulating read.  Couldn't put it down. The characters are complex and constantly keep you guessing. I highly recommend this book.
5	1401408000	This is a superbly written book. When Amy goes missing from the family home the police naturally think Nick is guilty. Is he?Read the book, find out for yourselfI loved it because it was continually unexpected - I am very good at guessing plots and this one kept me wondering.Even now
4	1401321600	Mind blasting page turner. I loved Amy & Nick. No, I hated them. Oh, I fell in love with them again. No way, I detest them. Oh but I love them. Brilliant book. Brilliant characters. Gilliam Flynn, you rock, my girl.
5	1401321600	Gone Girl is one of the best books I've ever read. I found it almost impossible to predict the outcome - the dialogue flowed well, the plot was satisfyingly convoluted,and I had a hard job putting it down. A very refreshing change from the 'psycho serial killer 'genre that has metastasised into many areas of contemporary writing.
4	1401321600	Took awhile but persisted and was a very good read. Very interesting plot. Enjoyed the book after the first few chapters.
4	1401148800	The book had me captivated the whole time. It constantly took a series of twists that I couldn't predict. It was an extremely intense but captivating read. Nothing like I've ever read before, was a little scary at times!
4	1401062400	This is a smart psycho thriller. A story of dysfunctional couple in contemporary setting... The dark  thriller by gillian is full of smart wordsmithing. She keeps you guessing... Makes you turn back to check and ensures no threads are loose.Highly recommended.
5	1401062400	loved this book and the two main characters so strong and you want to keep reading to see what the outcome will be as their relationship is so strange.A very well written book with a brilliant ending (not predictable)Highly recommend this book and will look for more of her books in the future.
5	1401062400	I have to admit when I first started reading this book I found it hard to get into as I didn't like any of the characters, but still found myself siding with Amy. Then I became obsessed! I kept reading and reading and reading and the further I got into it the more I had to find out what happened. But then as I got closer to the end I started to get disappointed that it was going to end. Now that I have finished it though, the way it finished and the people involved, I believe there could always be another book (please!).You will not be disappointed in this one. So bloody good!
4	1400976000	Captivating - it keeps you guessing;  you can't put it down.  Loved the alternating chapter approach. I can highly recommend it.
1	1400803200	I could not be unhappier about how this book ended as well as the back and forth between the protagonist and antagonist.. ANNOYING!
4	1400630400	I really enjoyed this book, its a real page turner. I am going on holiday now so just had to download another of Gillians books!
4	1400544000	The story is about a marriage between a super amazing girl and a typical, self-centred, 'normal' man. Rather real are the marriage intricacies that are depicted. However, some of the writing could further harm the institution of marriage. The language is predominantly North American which is disturbing for the international reader.
4	1400457600	Great book, lots of twists!!! Really enjoyed both the content and the way it was written. Will be downloading more by Gillian Flynn
4	1400457600	Amazing - loved it. It was thrilling to read keeping the reader in suspense from the first page to the last
5	1400371200	I really loved this book. I was hooked right from the beginning and once half way......................all the twists and turns. I had to buy it in paper back to give it to someone who does not have a Kindle.
4	1400371200	Enjoyed it though the final chapter felt rushed and disappointing.Some of the rawness in the story was a little scary as it reminded me of my own relationship shortfalls
5	1400371200	I couldn't put it down ..... A well written, beautifully constructed, well paced, highly original, suspense laden  plot ..... intelligent, well drawn characters and lots of insight into contemporary issues  including economic downturns, unemployment, social media, relationships..... A modern masterpiece !
2	1400284800	couldnt get into this book at all. gave up after a few goes but lost interest pretty quickly, didnt grab me at all
1	1400198400	Have to say I was very disappointed with this book, bought it for the high reviews and did not like it at all . I put it down so many times not bothering to finish it. But read the rest on hols as finished other books. Could have been a better book but the plot and characters did not gel within the story ...
3	1400025600	Disappointed with ending. It could have been good, but it was unimaginative and flat, without the same power of the rest of the book.
5	1399939200	Easy style, great characters, great detail. Keeps you guessing to the last chapter. Look forward to reading her next book.
5	1399939200	The twists and turns were all indeed Mindblowing .Loved it.finished it at one go.wud reccommend it to all my friends
3	1399852800	Good book, I couldn't put it down. Altough the end was very disappointing, maybe because I'm a &#34;happy ending&#34; kind of girl.
5	1399852800	i read this book on hearing good reviews but not spoilers about it. It was the first book I have read in a long while that I could not put down. It gripped me from beginning to end. Loved it!
3	1399852800	It was interesting but I was disappointed with the ending :( However I liked a lot the psichology of the Characters and the narrative rhythm
5	1399593600	I really enjoyed this book, it was thought provoking. The main characters were both unlikable but I couldn't stop reading. I'm surprised she didn't take out her revenge on the two people at the cabins. I'm now looking forward to seeing the movie.
5	1399420800	A disturbing story with some awesome and exciting twists, I couldn't stop reading this, on top of the amazing story it was very well written.
5	1399334400	Fantastic twisting plot. I could barely keep up with the minds involved here never mind guess what might be coming. A great read
4	1399334400	Held captive from page one I just devoured this book.  And EVERYONE got their comeuppance! Just desserts for all of them!
5	1399248000	I couldn't put it down, it kept me on the edge of my seat. So many twists. I highly recommend it.
4	1399161600	This book actually lives up to the expectations of the excellent reviews it has received. First thriller that I've read and really enjoyed in a long time. Also, there is an interview with the author at the end which is worth a read. Highly recommended.
5	1399161600	The book took my breath away. The characters were completely unpredictable.. I never thought a person could go to such length to just ensure he/she wins
5	1399161600	Fantastic. I was guessing the whole way through.I will definitely be looking for more books by Gillian Flynn. Great read.
4	1399075200	Love the two points of view. Interesting how this will translate onto the big screen later this year. Ben affect and David Fischer good choice tho...
3	1398902400	A very slow start great middle disappointing ending...unique and interesting storylineInteresting to see what the other books are about?
1	1398816000	I looked forward to reading this.I wish I hadn't.There is not a likeable character amongst them. In fact, before I even found out what happened to her, I was hoping Amy *was* dead - which is a pretty extreme response to a literary character but she was THAT unlikeable. I stuck with it and got to the end and wanted to SCREAM. It made me physically react and not in a good way.I don't want to give away any plot lines but this was deeply unsatisfying, had very annoying characters and an infuriating ending.
4	1398816000	Too slow at beginning ,good twist later, and unexpected finish. Male character is depicted especially early onAs being very stupid but later is not
5	1398816000	It was a very interesting plot.  Kept me Ithrilled from the start.  It was a really good who sit it except kept one wondering I what really happened and what would happen next.  It certainly kept me thinking the whole way through.  A really good story.
4	1398729600	I found the book a bit hard to get into, and was just another husband/wife grudge fest, but by the time I was 1/5 into the book I realised it was a well thought out novel. It kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next and who was the bad person, wife, hubby or both. I liked it a lot. So much so that I bought Gillian Flynns' other novel &#34; Sharp Objects&#34;. Another book I would recommend by this author.
5	1398729600	This is a fascinating story. Its starts off as a garden variety 'whodunnit', but then evolves into a fascinating battle of the minds, with fascinating underlying psychology. It gets you thinking about the dark side potential of your neigbour, your spouse and even yourself. What are the lengths that you will go to to get what you want in life? It is cleverly written and a great read.
4	1398729600	I liked this book. The twists are very entertaining and keeps you turning the pages.The end is a bit blunt for my liking, but I suppose it leaves open a world of possible endings.
3	1398729600	Twists and turns at every corner...Page turning to the very end...Re-defines the fine line between love and hate
5	1398643200	Gone Girl is a very well written novel with a novel approach to dealing with the juxtaposed characters. Excellent plot and well researched
5	1398470400	Loved this book, just when you think you know where it's going it surprises you. Lots of twists and turns. Couldn't put it down
4	1398384000	Gone Girl is an intriguing thriller and allegorical commentary on the dysfunction of relationships in modern society. Flynn elegantly unravels her characters with every page leaving the reader guessing throughout the novel. Don't be fooled - this is no predictable Who-Dunnit.
3	1398384000	It's hard to like a book when you don't really like the characters. I found it quite exciting in the middle and liked the set-up of the plot but by the end, I lost patience with them both. What a strange ending!
4	1398384000	This book is a real page turner. Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer ,she has a knack at getting you gripped although the summing up of the story,tying all the loose ends together is the author's weak point.What could have been one of my best reads was really let down with the last chapter..Had all the ingredients for a smash hit.
3	1398384000	Very well written....but way too dysfunctional for me, which is kind of what I had assumed before I read it...but glad that I did.
5	1398297600	Gone Girl written by Gillian Flynn is an interesting thriller based on an unusual theme. The book is based on commitment. Gillian uses marrage as the commitment which forms the backdrop of the story. Told in a span of few months, the story starts on the fifth wedding anniversary of Nick and Amy. The couple has known each other for more than 5 years but they have been married only for 5 years. A perfect marriage for outsiders, all is not well in the paradise.When Nick reaches his workplace on the fifth anniversary of his wedding, little does he know what is in store for him. He is not a big planner. So he hasn't bought the gifts for his wife. Soon, he realizes his wife is missing. Like all missing women cases, the husband is naturally the suspect. To make matters worse, there are many inconsistencies in Nick's behaviour on that particular day which makes him the suspect for the cops. Is Nick guilty? If he is not what happened to Amy? We find this out as the story progresses.The book stands out for mainly for the narrative style. The story is told from both Nick's and Amy's perspectives. We get to see the man's side and woman's side in the same story. This is much better than a third party narration or first person narration. Marriage brings two people closer. But does it make sane or insane? In the modern times where the emphasis on self, does living together with another person drives people mad? Is it true that a person is different during courting period - tolerant to mistakes and imperfection - and the chord of restraint is broken a few days after living together. Gillian makes us ask these question while reading the book. Finally, since the story flip flops between Nick's and Amy's perspective, their character and flaws are shown to us in layers.Take up this book if you are interested in thrillers. You can also read this if you are interested in reading about complex relationships.
5	1398297600	Wonderful and very clever build up!Quite an extraordinary story was made out of an event which albeit difficult emotionally is not unusual !
2	1398297600	I began with high hopes as I read the sample, and then bought the book, but after a while I became bored and restless with the incredibly slow pace. I also never really connected with the characters - I know they were 'writing' the chapters, so no unbiased narrative, but it all seemed unreal. The writing was good - so 2 stars, but I gave up.
4	1398297600	I enjoyed this book but after having been a huge Jodi Picoult fan, I think I expected more.  The story was there but the bite wasn't quite as sharp.  I would recommend it but as you can see, four stars rather than five.
3	1398297600	Gone Girl is about a disintegrating marriage and the thin line between love and hate.  Amy, the unhappy and bitter wife goes missing on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary. Nick, her husband,  who is strangely calm about the whole situation is the prime suspect.This book was an incredible disappointment. Maybe I expected too much after reading review after review about a great plot twist. The writing is good in most parts especially in the first part of the book but good writing can't save this book from weak characterization. All the characters speak in the same bitter and angry voice which makes for bland and boring reading.I will give Flynn credit for painting a frightening picture of a woman scorned and for showing realistically how quickly a seemingly loved-up couple can become each other's worst nightmare. A warning to all readers though - don't believe the hype!
4	1398211200	Slower starter but great ending.. Definitely worth the read. It won't disappoint, excellent twist, good suspension and an excellent finish
5	1398211200	Initially I found it a bit difficult to get into this book, but am so glad I perservered past the first couple of chapters.  I was totally hooked on the characters and twists to the story.  Will be reading more by this author for sure
3	1398211200	Very slow going .  Did improved as it continued.  The writing was very unsophisticated.  Disappointing and hard to believe ending.
4	1398124800	I enjoyed this story right from the start.  It's one of those books that has a twist right at the end.  Must read!!!
5	1398038400	the story is a duel narrative of husband Nick Dunne and wife, Amy Elliot, the progeny of a successful rich east coast couple. the story swaps between Nick and Amy narrating from their point of view. it's very well written and impossible to put down.
4	1397952000	Very gripping story.  Excellent authorial control of a huge amount of factual detail.  Flynn's talent is unquestionable.  I am sure that book groups will latch onto it enthusiastically.  Once or twice the darkness palled for me.
5	1397952000	It's pretty rare that a book with so much hype lives up to it's reputation but this one absolutely did. Wow! What a book. The twists and turns had me reading this book in hours. Flynn so masterfully narrates the novel from both a male and female perspective with such plausibility and skill it had me thinking about my husband and marriage thought the book. This book is gritty, dark completely believable. Definitely worth a read. Will be reading her other books too.
3	1397606400	I enjoyed the flow of the novel, but having a content page at the beginning killed the suspense somewhat.  This may not exist in the Paperback edition but it does on the Kindle.  Enjoyable without being great.
5	1397520000	There are so many  &#8220;Oh, Noooo&#8221; moments, and  &#8220;why, why, why??&#8221; moments while reading this.Started bit slow for me but more you read more you hooked into it.If you like the twists, unpredictable story, this is the book for you.Highly recommended.
5	1397433600	After being told that this book was not a good one to read, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Yes the characters are despicable and have no redeeming features but that did not take away from my enjoyment in the reading of it.
5	1397174400	Loved the book! The main character - so devious, and all the characters were well constructed.  I can't wait for the movie.
4	1397088000	What a roller coaster the author puts his readers through. First you love the characters then you loathe them.Very well written and hard to put down.
4	1396915200	Good writing, great twist right in the middle. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would certainly recommend it. Now, need to buy her previous books ;)
1	1396915200	Weird story, with unbelievable characters. Tried to finish it but just skip read the last half. Not recommended at all.
2	1396828800	The end was an anti climax I felt that the author could not think of an ending so just did &#34;any old thing&#34;
5	1396828800	I'm at an age where I don't finish books if I'm not hooked - there is too much to do in life without wasting time on a mediocre book.  I finished &#34;Gone Girl' in two days, putting everything else on hold. Both main characters are entirely believable and the reader changes position as the 'true' story unfolds.  A fantastic read.
4	1396742400	Slow building and initially without direction,but gathers pace from midway and subsequently achieves the stage of not being able to put the book down.
4	1396656000	Well written, page-turning, faced paced mystery with lots of unexpected twists and turns, however I was letdown by the ending. It really frustrated me to have such a brilliant first half or a story to be rushed through with a somewhat empty conclusion that has left me with mixed feelings of the story overall.
3	1396396800	It's a page-turner, but the book's premise becomes somewhat forced toward the end. Good read for the beach or a rainy weekend.
4	1396310400	It was a good chance to understand woman as normal man who have overlooked relationship between man and womanGood book!!!!
4	1396310400	Such an imaginative story that you really don't know what is going to happen nextReally enjoyed the diary method to tell the story from both sides
4	1396310400	A solid page turner and much more interesting than the first few chapters make out. Great for a weekend read.
5	1396137600	It is a pleasure to read an interesting, complex plot which is so well written.The characters are complex but fleshed out in a manner with which I could emphasise.
4	1396051200	Enjoyed the suspense as this story unfolded. I also liked the nastiness of both the characters in the marriage and how they tried to justify their actions and behaviour.
3	1395964800	I was really disappointed with the ending, the 2nd half of the book had my attention but then it just went down hill in the end, very disappointing
4	1395878400	I enjoyed hearing both sides of the story.  Both Nick and Amy get it wrong, for all the wrong reasons.
3	1395878400	So I get that the first half of the book is setting you up for a twist but I was bored and thinking, I've read this plot before. Second half is stellar though. So if you can meander through the front, it is worth the effort. Biding is interesting/thought provokng
4	1395532800	This is the first book I've read by this Author.  I did find the story a little difficult to get into for the first third of the book - too much back and forth between the current events and the wife's version of the past. And I became a bit tired of the little quizzes in the diary.  However, once the momentum of the story started to gain pace and the plot took some surprising twists and turns, well, I just couldn't put the book aside.  I was stunned at the book's conclusion and applaud the lack of 'happy ever after' ending and not having all the loose ends of the story tidied away.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will certainly seek out other books by this Author.  Would I recommend this book?  Absolutely.
4	1395446400	Good book, well written with twists and turns to keep you interested.Well worth reading and I really liked the ending
2	1395446400	Story line was  original but stylistically challenged.  Little sophistication in expression and choice of vocabulary.  Some sections of description became tedious and I skipped through them:  unnecessary fillers to plot development.  However, I did enjoy it. Would I recommend it?  Perhaps.
5	1395446400	A very good read to get you out of your world and into a completely pshyco one! I loved not knowing what was coming - it was a real thrill to go one way then the next then back again. Really enjoyed it.
5	1395360000	I kept being blindsided by unexpected turns of events. Just when you think you are starting to know the mind of the two main characters, they keep surprising you. Quite the page turner!
5	1395360000	I found this story constantly engaging with high interest.  The story develops in unexpected ways always moving on to a new slant. The characters are not admirable and quite fallible.  Unusual in that it took time to develop the personalities who remained a mixture of good and bad characteristics.  I will look for other books by this author.
1	1395273600	I wanted to like this book - I love stories in this genre, the writing style was very good. Several friends raved about it, but it just didn't do it for me - I found it very predictable & couldn't make it to the end.
5	1395273600	I Could not put this book down. It is brilliantly written. The plot is so well thought out it's amazing.
2	1395187200	A good story line spoilt by being far too long winded..I &#34;fast read&#34; so could find how all problems solved.
5	1395187200	This book started a bit slowly, but by 30 pages in, it is un-put-downable.Very interesting characters who narrate their lives unreliable, leading to fascinating and unforeseen plot twists.Great stuff!
4	1395187200	I enjoyed the book a lot.  It is an interesting and complicated plot that kept you guessing till the end.
4	1395187200	the book had a really strong forst act, a mind bending second one and a real wtf-just-happened (not in a good way) thir one. &#60;the plot is tigh and the twists are mostly cool and very well presented. but when it came to a fullfilling resolution... well, it really fell short. I felt like watching one of those films where instead of giving closure to the characters, they just set up a sequel(s) (not even necessary) thus disminishing the great story we just read. For that I can't give it the five stars. closure... it needed closure. Hope the film changes this- but it still is s thrilling read. judge for yourself
5	1395187200	Cleverly written, well built characters and a great story with depth, dark humor and a lot of twists. It never gets boring and although it is not completely realistic it never gets ridiculous. Flynn is a great contemporary writer who manages to create believable, three-dimensional characters. Absolutely recommendable for people in relationships!
5	1395187200	Interesting style.alternate chaptering adds volume and depth to the story.Unlikeable characters at every layer and they progress to more uncomfortable level.
3	1395187200	Liked the first part of d book ... Second part onwards it get murky n repetitive ... The end is weird ...
1	1395187200	Thought it was a great start, hooked me in but then it got tedious and unbelievable. Very silly, disappointing  and fulfilling ending.
4	1395014400	It was good... A thinker of a book very relatable, definitely kept me intrigued. Had an intense like and dislike for both the main characters which was interesting
5	1394928000	I thought that this was well written and catching story that surprised me few time through.... Couldn't stop reading. Definitely recommended reading.
4	1394755200	Great entertainment and certainly to be recommended for in flight reading.The plots are intriguing & you can't wait to turn the pages.
5	1394668800	Thoroughly enjoyed the ride.I don't want to reveal anything to spoil it for others, and so will just recommend you read it yourself.
5	1394668800	'Gone Girl' is like a whirlwind that picks up the reader, plunges him/her into the depths of empathy and then raises them into anger and frustration and finally places the reader at  the top of the cliff of uncertainty at the end. Certainly there should be a sequel to this as one novel in this plot and of this caliber of crazy simply isn't enough. This suspense/thriller truly keeps the reader on the edge at all times and it was with great sadness that I completed this novel. This one is definitely a keeper!
5	1394582400	I liked the dual part btw the diary and the real story. Whenever I thought that I now knew how the story might end, the story turned another corner and took a new direction. I can only highly recommend to read this book.
5	1394409600	Totally addictive, believable story, keeps you guessing. I'd highly recommend this book to both male and female readers, can't imagine anyone not enjoying it
1	1394409600	this book is just awful,so much so that I am convinced that the good reviews are part of a PR strategy and fake.
4	1393804800	I had trouble getting into this story, but once in I was hooked.  It kept me guessing to the end.
4	1393804800	You start to think you have it all figured out and then out of the blue the plot changes course!
4	1393718400	It took quite a while to get into it, but continued and by the second half couldn't put it down. Not usually a fiction reader, but would recommend this one.
3	1393718400	The book started really well in that I was drawn into the wanting to read more. Interesting characters and storyline. But then it just turned into just another  book with a mad psycho murdering woman. It's been done before!
4	1393545600	You have to admire Gillian Flynn&#8217;s skill. This complex, clever tale is expertly crafted with brilliant, unexpected twists. A real compulsive page turner!The first part sets the scene, gently coaxing us in.The second part is high octane. Daring, exciting and dangerous&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.unravelling to deranged.The third part is evil and sinister.  A deathly mating dance as Amy encircles her prey.So reading Gone Girl is like courting a sociopath really. In the end you come away feeling disturbed; manipulated and tainted with the poison that is Amy. Why did we allow ourselves to be subject to this unconscionable malice and evil?Read it superficially as a fantastic thriller. Think any more and it becomes, as Gillian Flynn herself said, &#8220;dark and nasty&#8221;.
1	1393545600	Yes, I am baffled. What on earth makes this book a best seller? I found the book to be bland, actually halfway between bland and BLAND.  The writing style has the feel of... &#34;it was a good tele-movie, so lets re-produce it into a book format&#34;.  The characters are empty, they have no warmth and are entirely one dimensional, purely created for the short few weeks that they are need in this plot. Just a bunch of typical CSI/SVU-like scenes strung together.The plot/twist is unique, and credit to the author for stringing all together in the 'he said - she said' format. that works well.Unfortunately not my taste, maybe it stands out in the crime fiction genre, but so what.  I'm glad I purchased it in the kindle format, it is not a book you would call a collectable and display on the shelf.
1	1393372800	I had to read this for book club. While I acknowledge that it is well written, the sheer evil and language in this book really unsettled me, would not read again or recommend.
2	1393200000	Ms Flynn's 'Dark Places' was a great book ruined by a terrible ending; 'Gone Girl' is an enjoyable book let down by an unconvincing, rather silly ending. The first few chapters of this book are completely misleading as to where it's going and what it will become. If you hate it initially, and think it poorly written, stick with it: it improves as you progress and there's a good reason for the annoying early tone. The characters and story were just about credible, if very far-fetched, but the ending, in trying to be clever, was actually quite foolish. This novel is, in many ways, nothing more than the violent fulfilment of a militant feminist fantasy. Unusual view of justice in that an errant husband is thoroughly punished for his transgressions while a murderer gets off scot-free!  Interesting - and insulting- take on what men want from a 'perfect' partner; are the real men in Ms Flynn's life that shallow and simple, that devoid of any real feelings for or empathy with the opposite sex? To say nothing of selfish and self-serving? Even the 'hero' resents and fears women, and the whole 'bitch' motif running through the book may well cast a light on the author's view of how the average man sees women. Also revealing as to what she feels women want in a perfect partner; a man to pamper and pet and run around after them, to have no interests or thoughts beyond pleasing them, and to act forever like a lovesick teenager...whether you feel that way or not! But it must be the right man, and for God's sake don't let any possessiveness colour your worship or you will have your throat cut. There's a grain of truth in both of these views, of course, but only grains; they're pretty simplistic and reveal only small facets of larger and more complex wholes. Also a bit insulting to women and what they want from a relationship; yes, all women want to be petted and cosseted and adored (and obeyed!) but this is only one facet of the female psyche, and certainly not the dominant one. A bit juvenile in its view of male-female relationships and overall a step backwards from the nearly-brilliant Dark Places.
4	1393200000	A really gripping read, definitely deserves all the praise that it has attracted recently. A very smart novel, but does lose the pacing a bit near the end.
4	1393113600	I loved the way this book was written. It's very readable and it keeps you guessing. It's a definite whodunnit. The twists were also unexpected. It's the most interesting book I have read in a while.
5	1392940800	Loved the book immensely, but I must say I was a tad disappointed with the ending, won't say anymore as I don't want to spoil it for anyone, it was an awesome book!  Loved Dark Places too.
1	1392940800	I have never read such a sick book and struggled all the way through - the author's mind must be completely addled to think up such rubbish.
5	1392854400	Love the twists and turns Of the story and hated the narciccistic characters. I have recommended to all my friends and can't wait to read it again and discuss with my book club.
5	1392854400	This is a great mystery/romance which has a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming but which worked very well. Fascinating and complex central characters with interesting ( and quirky ) back story.I didn't like the ending but am prepared to forgive that as the rest of the book was a compelling and interesting read.
4	1392768000	Choose a4star rating because I could not put it down after nearly giving up after the first few chapters!A clever woven psychological thriller.
4	1392681600	I'd like to start my reviews stating that I'm a 35 year old male from Germany (english isn't my first language), so others might be able to relate.I bought this book as a kindle daily deal because it was cheap, the story sounded interesting and it had good reviews. I forgot about it until I heard on the radio that the book was made into a movie which is coming out soon, so I decided to read it before it comes out. The story is told by the two main characters, Amy and Nick, who each have their own &#34;version&#34;. The plot is very interesting with lots of twists and turns. At one time I looked up the movie at IMDB and from then on, I could only see Ben Affleck as Nick, which wasn't that bad. I liked everything but the ending. The ending seemed a bit rushed but all in all it was an enjoyable read. If the ending was better/different, I would have given it 5 stars.
5	1392508800	This is a brilliantly written, brilliantly plotted book that made me want to never finish reading it! I hope the author will revisit this couple in ten years and give us another insight into the tortured, twisted mind-games that can be played within the institution of 'Marriage'. I cannot recommend this book highly enough and urge anyone who wants a 'book that will grab them' to give this one a chance. Hopefully you will  experience shock, awe and fascination in equal portions!
4	1392508800	I found this book to be one that was a real page turner.  I wanted to read the next chapter to see if there was any clue and when I had turned enough pages to find the real perpetrator of  the crime I was stunned.  I could highly recommend this book to anyone interested in twists and turns and a surprize element.
3	1392508800	I bought this book ages ago, started to read it but it capture me. After months of reading novels I loved and decided to try again. This is a exhausting book. It took me so long to read..the chapters feel never ending and the story line has been so &#34;stretched&#34;. Amy is one crazy bitch - Gillian Flynn has an incredible imagination, I'll give her that much... It was a distraction, good read..not for me..
3	1392422400	Had me engrossed and wondering what was going to happen for the first half of book. The second half of book went on and on with nothing new happening. Ending was very disappointing.
5	1392336000	I could not stop reading it.  I was so intrigued & just wanted to know what twist was going to be next.  The ending was the final twist - recommend it highly!!!
5	1392336000	Makes you think how well you know those closest to you... Do you at all? First encounter with author's amazing
5	1392336000	After this book I began taking reading seriously again, rather than occasionally dipping! It gripped me, like books used to in my childhood, but also satisfied my needs for innovation, character-plausibility, and mature prose. All three of Flynn's books grab you by the throat and do not let go until you have read the last page: this is a result not only of plot, but startling images and incisive social observation. This one is good; in opinion though, the other two are even better.
5	1392076800	Great book. A real page turner, kept me on my toes the entire read. Best book I've read in a while!
4	1391990400	A book with unusual twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the graphic and explicit language and descriptions. A bit much for my taste, hence the four stars. I loved the build up and how one's liking for the characters changes throughout the book.
4	1391904000	Loved it! Will defiantly pick up her other two books. Keep them coming. Also will look forward to seeing this on the big screen. Cheers x
5	1391731200	Loved the story from both point of views. Amazing Amy is very scary. I highly recommend the book to all readers,
5	1391644800	This book is a must read, brilliantly written, keeps you guessing,  could not put it down! I was not one for thrillers-but I am now! Fantastic read.
4	1391644800	Kept you on your toes and always had a new twist. Characters not especially likeable . Nothing else to add at present
4	1391558400	I enjoyed reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34; as I usually do with Psychological thrillers. I don't worry too much about accuracies or inconsistencies and generally am happy to forgetReality and move into a different imaginary world when I read fiction.Part 1 I found a bit slow and it took me a week to read it. At the end I was convinced that Nick was a nasty piece of work the way he treated his nice wife Amy. Part 2 I find that Amy is really a lot worse than Nick. Part 3 brought it together for a fitting conclusion. The novel gained pace and interest in parts 2 and 3 which took me less than a week to read.The writing style was excellent and appropriate to the genre in my view. The alternate narrative/ diary, narrative/narrative of the two partners kept me interested by providing information and questions at the same time. Nick's story about his trip to the beach, for example, raised more questions than it gave answers. The story kept building with sudden dramatic and scary twists.Some of the things I take away from the novel. Speculation of what can happen when parents exploit their children as Amy's parents did in using her life as a money making concern for &#34;Amazing Amy&#34;. Speculation of how upper middle class childhood can turn one into a sociopath like Amy suffering from affluenza.. How partners in a marriage try to change the other rather than just accepting them as they are. A common feature of a lot of marriages.. How people role-play for others such as Amy the &#34;cool girl&#34; not turning Nick into a &#34;dancing monkey&#34;.. How beta males behave in relationships. Nick was seeking a girl friend that just liked him as a man, an authority figure like a teacher to look up to without looking deeper. Another visit, although in the form of a novel, to two parts of the world I really appreciate New York and the Mississippi river.All in all I give it 4 stars but suspect the movie (coming out later this year) might be a better form for this story than a book.
5	1391385600	An excellent psychological thriller. I particularly liked reading the story in both of the main characters own words.  Amy is certainly psychotic and Nick comes across so real.. and I wanted to shake some sense into him at times!I felt like I was really living both of their stories of the events.  The story unfolded gradually and kept me mesmorised for more details after every read.  I couldn't put it down!A bit disappointed in the ending.  I would have liked to see one of the characters showing some strength without giving it away.A wonderful read.  Will hope that anything else by Gillian Flynn is as good.
3	1391299200	This is a crazy novel! So crazy I'm still trying to work out whether I enjoyed it or not! If you want manipulation of one marital partner's mind by another - and the reverse - then you've got it here in trumps.
4	1391299200	Great summer holiday read, very entertaining. A good few twists to keep it interesting. Highly recommend.  Keep it away from kids though!
4	1391212800	I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last!  Gone Girl is a true page turner (I read the second half in one sitting - finally switching my kindle off at 5am), it's both funny - and at times chilling - in equal measure.Gillian Flynn writes both male and female voices convincingly and has a gift for challenging the reader's first impressions of a character. The book takes the reader on an emotional journey while the journey of the characters - as the world in which the they exist evolves from one that is straightforward and black and white to a more compelling and truthful story full of shades of grey (and not in the S&M; sense of the phrase) - forces the reader to rethink their initial judgements and the direction of their own moral compass.In short, Gone Girl is a fun read but with a depth that will appeal to those who want more than a good holiday page turner.
4	1391126400	Gone Girl!  A slow, wandering, almost aimless start in New York.  &#34;Then one day the 'phone rang .......it was Nick's sister&#34; chaos followed for a number of chapters which included The Global Financial Crisis, Three of the main characters lost their jobs,,Nick and Amy move to Missouri, the town is very depressed and in financial crisis, shopping malls closed and people getting out, Nick's father has dementia, Nick's mother dies and despite the depression they buy a bar!Anyone who can get out of Missouri has already left, empty houses, empty streets and shops.This was perhaps the low point of the book. Then, the enormous intrigue and deception begins to unfold, indeed gains momentum - I could not stop reading.  What a web of deception, planned to the last detail. and, most of it credible. Depending on you imagination.My reflections: A wonderful feminist twist, a female villain. For decades women have been the &#34;victim&#34; of cheating husbands, ruthless corporate boards and colleagues. Victims of inequality, guilt ridden! What a twist! A woman as the VICTOR - rather than than the victim.  Loved it.  Marla
5	1391126400	Great story. Hard to put down once you have started it. It's interesting the way your perception of the characters change as the storyline unfolds. This book would make an excellent gift for girlfriends, siblings, mothers, or mothers in law. It inspires a lot of discussion while you are reading and when you have finished it.
5	1391040000	I had recently read Gillian Flynn's other novel Dark Places and enjoyed it thoroughly. When I heard that David Fincher was making a film version of Gone Girl I dived in. This is a really clever, razor sharp thriller that turns the screws and around the 3/4 point turns the whole thing on its head. I loved both central characters and hated them too. A very satisfying read and highly recommended
5	1391040000	Brilliant book , kept me enthralled until the end , I didn't know which character to support , kept changing my mind all the way through.Thoroughly enjoyed this book .
3	1390953600	It was a bit of a mixed bag, just when you thought as something, another thing would happen to change your mind.  But overall, pretty slow.
4	1390867200	This book was a great read. At times it drops off but it pulls you straight back in again and your captured in it!
5	1390867200	I never read this genre, but the reviews were so good that I felt obligated to give it a go. Given that the film is in production, I knew it was going to be interesting. Not disappointed, this book is the perfect combination of intrigue and literally jaw-dropping moments. It is now 2am, and I can sleep finally.
4	1390867200	Compelling, but a seriously shit ending because it gave me the shits. But would love to see the movie with a different ending.
4	1390435200	Gone Girl is clever, maybe too clever.The point of view characters are smart &#8211; smart ironic, rather than emotionally intelligent. The plot contains lots of twists and turns, most of which I foresaw, apart from those toward the end. By then the narrative had stretched so far into incredulity as it struggled to conform to the demands of the plot &#8211; rather than illuminating the lives of the characters &#8211; I was no longer engaged emotionally. But I was curious to see how it would wind up.It&#8217;s compelling to read and I&#8217;m on record as saying I enjoy this kind of book. In its favour, it has a lot to say about gender politics, the impact of popular culture on the way we think of ourselves and others, the roles we play and how we seek to manage others&#8217; perceptions of us. But its self-conscious irony is wearing: like the characters, Flynn appears to enjoy being self-consciously derivative.Mostly, the book reminds me more of playing a game than reading. Fun in a &#8220;can&#8217;t take my eyes off the accident as we pass&#8221; kind of way. It doesn&#8217;t make me want to rush out and read more of Flynn&#8217;s work, but when I&#8217;m in the mood for another suspense or thriller I just may.
3	1390435200	The characters infuriated me, couldn't believe how either treated the other! Not the greatest book I've read but was thrilling enough to keep turning the pages.I am looking forward to the movie for comparison.
5	1390435200	Excellent book couldn't put it down. Extremely enjoyable and kept me guessing to the end. Would highly recommend this book.
4	1390435200	I loved the twists and turns of this story. It was a thoroughly enjoyable read! Highly recommend it to others
5	1390435200	Fantastic read, would recommend to anyone, a real thriller, but not gruesome which means that it is well written and not having to rely on other things to hold it together. Loved it!!!!
5	1390176000	Crazy, funny, wild, hectic, freaky and addictive all at once!!!! Cant wait to start the next book!!!! Wouldve loved two or 3 different endings though to spice things up
5	1390176000	Loved the book though if I had written it I would have ended it differently. The end was too far fetched in today's investigation systems. I would have put Amy Dunn away for life without parole. I am sure most readers felt the same way.Hoping to watch the movie which it seems has a different ending......  I may be right with my criticism
4	1390089600	This excellent who done it had me guessing to the end. I loved how all the little ends all tied together. Very cleverly written.
5	1390089600	Gone Girl has humour, romance, mystery and intrigue.Such an interesting perspective that kept me turning pages, couldn't put it down.
5	1390089600	Brilliant - Loved this book, looking forward to seeing the movie now! Will be checking out Gillian Flynns other books now.
2	1390089600	I bought this book as I seen it advertised. It just wasnt my kind ofbook. Very slow to take off.  Disappointing end
4	1390003200	This is a great, easy and interesting read.  I got hooked on the characters and wanted to see how the story would pan out.  I was disappointed in the end but really, I don't know how else it could all wrap up.  If you're after a good holiday read, this one is great.
4	1389744000	I found the book kept me spell bound all the way through, it is an easy read with enough suspense to keep your attention.
5	1389657600	Absolutely loved it! Couldnt put it down! Twists and turns everywhere! Would highly recommend to everyone to have a read and get lost  in it! :-)
5	1389484800	A little slow getting started but great twist in the story to get you into it again. Its a great read!!
5	1389398400	I found gone girl to be compelling and surprising. Really couldn't put this book down. Worth the hype it has been getting.
5	1389398400	Amazing book. Pulls you in by the first chapter, and throws twists and turns at you until the deciding page.After being victim to so many poor reads that have a high star rating on amazing (cue Divergent, 50 Shades of Grey) I am please to say that the reviews on here are correct.This book deserves 5 stars and no less. Some people say they were unhappy with the ending, but it was unpredictable and I loved it.Do not miss this!
3	1389139200	Quite hard to get going but once in one waits for a different story to unfold.Unusual, but I would have enjoyed a more dramatic ending.
5	1389139200	The characters are very well drawn. You get insight into their weaknesses, yet have sympathy for them. The riveting plot builds, and builds, and builds - full of subtle twists and turns. Besides the main story-line, the book also tells of the dynamic between a married couple who start off madly in love and the way this love gradually sours. A really interesting tale of the ever-changing dynamics within a relationship. I could not put it down! I was intrigued by this dark tale, compelled to find out it's conclusion!
3	1389139200	Interesting turn of events easy to read hard to put down feel you get to really know the characters as real people
3	1389139200	really enjoyed the journey but hated the destination.  How anyone would put up with that behaviour,even for the sake of their child, is beyond me so I was disappointed with the ending.  However great plotting, I could not put it down.
2	1389052800	Found this took too long to get interesting. Finished it only for my Book club! Not sure if I would recommend it.
3	1389052800	It was a good read. There was a twist in the story that was not expected. I liked how the story ended.
4	1389052800	This a one of those unputdownables that keep you thinking what happens next even when life (or sleep) intervenes and you have to put it down for a bit. It starts one way and ends another .. You never know what to think next because as soon as you form an opinion something happens to flip the situation on its head !
4	1388966400	An interesting look into the mind of a very disturbed woman who is smart enough to get her own way no matter what it takes! Her husband was never a match for the cunning she demonstrates.
5	1388966400	Great holiday read really enjoyed it lots of twists and an absolute page turner. Can't wait to read her other books now!
4	1388880000	Great book with plenty of twists and turns - you will never pick the ending!!Only negative - it could have been shorter!!
5	1388880000	I loved this book. One of the best psychological thrillers I've read. Very clever, great writing and lots of twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. Not only was this incredibly well plotted, the characters were well developed and interesting. I did find the ending surprising and struggled with whether it was plausible but decided that it could be in the world of Amy and Nick and their enmeshed relationship. And I liked that it wasn't predictable. Highly recommended.
4	1388880000	The story was so full of twists and turns and kept me wondering who was the prson I trusted most.
3	1388793600	Engrossing read but what a disturbing scary ending !! So dark. Unbelievable. I should think we have more freedom as human beings. In this a day and age.
4	1388707200	Good story line with interesting characters. It kept you engaged throughout. Ending could have been better as it was a little predictable.
5	1388707200	I read this last Summer and couldn't put it down.  A really great read, good twists and keeps u hooked throughout.
1	1388361600	I was recommended this book and thought I would like it but it's absolutely rubbish. Rubbish writing, rubbish ending. Skipped a lot of the early sections as the writing was awful. It became more fast paced and easier to read and I thought... Here we go. But there are so many holes In the story and the ending is so anticlimactic. I feel it's a genuine waste of my time.
5	1388102400	Right from the very start I was hooked by Gone Girl and as is the way with a good mystery, you can never assume that you know where it's going because it's filled with twists and turns that will keep you moving from one page to the next. Gillian Flynn has a great writing style and her characters are perfectly and realistically twisted. A real page turner.
4	1387843200	Well written page turner with unexpected twists every time you think you've figured it out.  Lagged a little in the middle before it grabbed me again for a run to an unexpected ending
2	1387584000	At first I liked the book, the way I was led to see the protagonists in a different light in each chapter depending on whose side of the story I was reading, but in the end both characters just turn out to be psychopaths and the story is just another creepy and sick one. I think it is an easy way out for a writer, since psychopaths are crazy and do not need to be believable anymore.
5	1387152000	This is such a well written book with several twists & turns.I read it in three days & then immediately downloaded Gillian Flynn's previous two books.I would thoroughly recommend it as a great holiday read.
4	1386979200	Thrillers are not particularly well written usually. This one is quite good. No horrible stylistic bumps. No crashing cleches. The plot is a bit contrived and one is left wondering if certain events and decisions were not completely believable. But, the effect is chilling.  But give your partner a hug and have a long think about how lucky you are. The book may make you question your marriage. Wonderfully, the plot turns in exactly the wrong place in a balanced rivitting way that tightens the plot considerably, at the point that most books are spreading at the seams and showing their stuffing. This one recalibrates and jumps up a gear. Even when you can see the end, somehow it does not annoy. Even when the adrenaline begins drop and the plot drifts, its fine.I would not give it the rapturous reviews it gets but you won't be disgusted. This is not one of those ecstatically reviewed thrillers that makes you swear you will never read another.
5	1386806400	Very good writing, goes deeply into characters and personalities, intrigue at the most, a very good book, but not if you are in a depressed state
4	1386633600	Brilliant twists and turns make this book hard to put down. The story is fast paced and told in a radically different manner. It is really enjoyable to see an erring husband getting his just punishment until things turn.
3	1386633600	Loved the book - very well written. Don't want to give it away but I was really disappointed by the ending. Will not read again.
1	1386547200	Usually I read the reviews on Amazon before I buy and how I wish I had done it this time, but on a friends recommendation and swayed by ts best seller status I bought it on a whim. I hated it, the characters were quite ubelievable and really awful people saying horrible things about  and to each other to no real point,.  It is  badly written and I couldn't be bothered to finish it as it just a beastly book.
1	1386547200	I thought it shallow. The best thing was the depiction of a town in recession. The charactisation was distorted to accomodate the plot.
2	1386460800	Ths book was highly recommended to me. Unfortunately I have found it very slow and at times boring. Very disappointed.
5	1386374400	I found this book gripping and unexpected. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a couple of days... recommended!!
4	1386288000	My first read of a Gillian Flynn novel and now I'll try another. Excellent well thought out and well written. Highly recommend it. The language is colourful but once you get over that it's terrific.
1	1386288000	It was a silly. Book. Maybe this is where it wants the fifteen words so I will add another few to see if it goes this time.
5	1386201600	I found this book gripping and intriguing.  I found the ending didn't tie things up as nicely as I had hoped.
4	1386201600	OK, this was almost a great book. The writing sparkles, the plot is brilliant. It gets you in early, and grabs you by the throat, and makes you not want to sleep until you&#8217;ve finished. And you&#8217;re thinking, wow, this is a great book. Then you get to the end.Yes, when you read a great book the end is sad, because it had to end. But this time, the end was sad, because it was just a letdown. Not up to the standard of the rest of the book. Just not satisfying. I don&#8217;t do plot spoilers. So, not another word. Except, for the greatness that went before the poor ending, 4 stars.
4	1386115200	Early in this book I thought it was going to be very predictable.  Wrong! The plot has layer after layer of subtlety,keeping you guessing.Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer.
5	1386028800	These characters are all too real, all too damaged. Interesting to see where the plot leads. Heavy focus on the lead characters.
5	1385942400	Well written and thought provoking. Interesting and surprising plot. A little bit on the dark side- but that's only my personal impression.
2	1385942400	Sorry I know most of my friends have read  it and loved it I got board couldn't wait till I finished it
5	1385683200	Brilliant, it kept me interested to the last page and this is not something which usually happens.  The whole book was excellent and I would highly recommend it.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you turning the pages.
5	1385510400	Absolutely brilliant read!  Amazing story line that held my attention from start to finish.  A real page-turner!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I could not wait to see how it would turn out.
4	1385424000	A great book with excellent characters.  Twists and turns the whole way which keep you guessing.  I highly recommend it.
5	1385337600	Reading within a minute. I was recommended this book so I went straight to amazon prices are great and the delivery is immediate I love it
4	1385251200	I really enjoyed this book, it was an intriguing holiday read.  None of the characters are very likeable which is a nice change.  While it slows a little in the middle - stick with it!
1	1385078400	Stupid story. The plot and the story telling was jumping from the two main characters. There was far too much digressing from the story line. It was the worst put together story telling I have read.
4	1385078400	I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the main character fascinating. The characters in the book were brought to life and I think the author was at pains to make sure that the reader understood the psychology behind the actions of all of them. The plot was interesting and unfolded well. i appreciate that some bad language was needed to enforce the personalities but I  think the author should appreciate that sometimes less is more, and the swearing would have had more impact if it was not so abundant- shame, because it stopped me giving five stars.
4	1384819200	Wow! What a twister - there is no picking this plot. Really enjoyed the style of writing and look forward to reading other titles by Gillian Flynn.
5	1384560000	I never saw the cover of this before reading so never saw the &#34;Thriller of the year&#34; stamp - regardless of this it sure was thrilling!My opinion of the characters jumped around as the story evolved and left me turning pages well past midnight.Clever writing like this is such a pleasure and the characters bought me into their emotions and lives.Please read this book if you like intrigue and mystery with a twist yet a good ole story along the way
5	1384387200	Captivating, complex mystery....Love, lies, mystery, intrigue and deceit - this book has everything. It's amazing the lengths people will go to for love....HIghly recommended!
5	1384387200	Great book, I read it on my week off in a couple of days throughly enjoyed it, will be looking to get more of her books.
5	1384387200	This is one of the most original books I've ever read! The characters warrant little sympathy but are utterly compelling. I never guessed at the twists and turns that it takes and I loved the surprises. Gillian Flynn is my new favourite author and I hope the movie adaption of &#34;Gone Girl&#34; does this justice.
4	1384387200	A thoroughly sinister psychological thriller about 2 very unlovely people. I thought it was very well written, very readable maybe a bit long.
5	1384387200	Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn has introduced me to an author I find inspirational and whose skill in the craft of storytelling is awe inspiring.  At every turn of the page I was pulled into the world of her multi-layered characters and given a room by room tour of the spaces inside their heads.  I am a huge fan of character based fiction and for that reason Gone Girl was a great read for me.The situation within the novel, and the thing that is Amy and Nick&#8217;s relationship, which itself becomes something of a character within the story, is rather relatable.  It appeals to that ever present question tumbling around inside the minds of anyone in a serious relationship, &#8220;What is going on inside this persons head?&#8221;  Flynn deftly manipulates and conquers this simple question into an epic adventure through this fictional liaison.  I certainly won&#8217;t get into the plot at all; I will only say I found it very engaging.The standout character is definitely Amy.  Flynn has eloquently captured the essence of her lead female character&#8217;s internal monologue, the way her thoughts are processed, feelings dissected and important pieces of information filed away for use at a poignant time in the future.  Flynn, in an often too close for comfort manner, illustrates the pivotal difference between the internal processing of the female mind verses its male counterpart.While there are several very clever elements within this piece of fiction, there are a couple that stood out to me which I can discuss without revealing the plot.  As I mentioned above Flynn presents an interesting image of the male vs. female take on the same relationship.  What I found interesting was the way Flynn uses her secondary female characters.  While each of them are well crafted and serve their purposes in the chain of events, none of them shine quite as bright as Amy, which is a great tool for accentuating the bold aspects of her character.I also appreciated the writing about writing elements within the story.  Amy&#8217;s diary is very effective as a plot device and was worked into the story in a very crafty way.  The fact that the character of Amy in Gone Girl is actually the inspiration for the character of Amazing Amy, a heroine of a collection of children&#8217;s books within the novel, is another indication of Flynn&#8217;s ingenious fiction writing.This is a smart and wily story with several surprises and exquisitely imagined characters.  I truly had a lot of fun reading Gone Girl and several times throughout felt like I was listening in on a great piece of juicy gossip!  So for all you Book Gossips out there &#8211; this is a must read!
1	1384214400	I personally did not enjoy this book at all , it took over half of the book to get into it & the ending was such a let down.Unfortunately it came highly recommended & I was really disappointed.
5	1383696000	Great story, well written and a good page turner. Worth the read but shame the ending was a bit off.
5	1383696000	I really enjoyed this story. loved the characters, even though they were so unlikeable. At times predicatable but some great clever twists!!
5	1383436800	Loved this thriller in the vein of another favourite author Patricia Highsmith. The novel was smart with twists and turns and grey - not black and white. Well writtenA. I now await her next novel. I have now read all 3 she has written and find they get better and better.
1	1383436800	I am half way through book but so far very very slow. Not the easiest book to pick up and read
4	1383436800	It was hard to like either character in this book.  There are two sides to every story and in this book they're both bad.
5	1383264000	An interesting plot and believable characters. The storyline surprised me, and I read the book in one go. Highly recommended!
4	1383264000	Typical Flynn. Her second best after dark places. Really captures the wobbly psychologies of normal people. The characters aren't your typical goodie-gooders; Real, drastically flawed.
3	1383091200	I was keen to read this New York Times best seller, and finally downloaded it from Amazon. It started well but towards the end the author does not seem to have the heart to make it a crime thriller. The writing just meanders and at the end the reader is left wondering what happened.
2	1383091200	Personally didn't like the writers style and found it difficult to become absorbed in it. Really had to push myself to even finish it
5	1382918400	Absolutely brilliant. Fabulously written.  had me on the edge of my seat the whole time... Could not stop reading. Wanted more.
4	1382918400	I am shocked by a lot of the negative reviews on this book. I was also very annoyed by the choice of ending but I don't think that should detract from what was otherwise a great read.The twists and turns are genuinely good and mostly unexpected. It is very rare that a big twist can feel natural and geniune in a book without being telegraphed or overdone. It was very subtle in places.As many have stated the ending is a huge dissapointment. Of the six or seven endings that I could imagine this choice was definetly the weakest. I would also say that it is rare that I read a book that almost every character can be hated but I genuinely disliked almost everyone in the book (save for a few lesser characters). It creates a weird sensation of not being sure who you want to win the day.Read it.
5	1382832000	Very clever and intriguing the whole way through. Easy to pick up and put down over a holiday. Would recommend.
4	1382832000	The first part took a while to get into as it was setting the scene but I enjoyed it, particularly as I was really starting to feel for Nick. The second part blew me away - and the ending was so cleverly frustrating. It created a great discussion in my book club.
5	1382745600	Brilliantly written with both angles examined.  The story slowly unfolds to reveal deficiencies of both the husband and wife.  Initially the book comes across as anti marriage but later it describes how the couple both get what they were after or not .....
5	1382745600	It was a very good thriller. I couldn't put it down. Definite page turner and awesome ending. I really can't wait to reader other books by this author.
3	1382572800	This was the kind of book I read just to get to the end, to find out. Some good twists and turns but I didn't like any of the characters, and that made it hard to connect with the story. It is a memorable read however.
5	1382486400	Buy it you will be awesome at the end!  Not a fast pace reading more than a slow motion situation but thrilling!
3	1382400000	A good story,  but had an unusual ending, not a bad or strange one,  just different and very thought provoking
4	1382400000	a few twists and turns and good characters. I really enjoyed it. Would love a follow up with the same people.
3	1382227200	Not my kind of book, but there were a number of good twists and turns which I didn't expect. Well written, with interesting psychological insight.
4	1382227200	THis book sucked me in from the start and kept me guessing the whole way through.  I didn't really like either of the main characters but I cared enough about them to want to know what would happen to them.
1	1382227200	Don't know what all the fuss was about. This is a silly book. Chick lit at its facile worst. Don't waste your money or time.
3	1382140800	I choose this novel based on such positive reviews. Although intriguing initially, the plot was fairly predictable and the ending actually a damp squid. Disappointing. Actually, there is no end and the reader is left frustrated. I began to get increasingly irritated with the characters portrayed. If you are expecting a great conclusion to this thriller then you will be disappointed.
2	1382054400	A well written, great story line with interesting characters but what a 'let down' at the end.  Maybe a Gone Girl book 2?
5	1382054400	Not sure I was crazy about the way this book ended.. but I couldn't put this book down. Gripping reading!
5	1382054400	It's the middle of the night right now - I honestly couldn't put it down.What a story, and beautifully written! I feel even now as if I was the public that they were talking to, believing one story, then switched completely and believing the other. I enjoyed it immensely and am sorry it had to end!
4	1381968000	I liked this book, but felt that it missed out on being a great book.  There were large sections of the book that just don't add anything to the storyline.  Then as the book is reaching the end it feels like the book needs a few extra chapters to round out the story.  The book ends very quickly which is quite disappointing and dissatisfying.The characters are quite horrible people that you just can't manage to like, but you do end up hoping that they get what is coming to them.
3	1381968000	Thought it took a while for the story to get going, was halfway through before I started to enjoy the book. Felt the ending was a a bit of anti climax.
5	1381968000	Brilliant. Unexpected. Twists, turns and terrific planning and toying. Intrigue builds through exceptional character development. Best read in a long time. Devious and devastatingly addictive.
5	1381968000	Love the phone case it fits perfect doesn't look cheaply made it arrived on time so glad I got it
5	1381968000	What a fantastic novel!A great book has left its mark - I can't shake the characters or storyline even though Ive just finished.I need some more books by Flynn stat!!
5	1381795200	This book surprised me at every turn.  I didn't pick the end either...always a good book.  An unpredictable page turner.
5	1381708800	Read the first two chapters and was hooked. The characters, the setting and the narration is sharp and get you by the throat right till the very end.
5	1381708800	After a difficult start (I found it hard to get into this book at first) I was soon swept away and could not stop. Gone Girl is such a clever mix of love, deceit and cunning that you can't help but keep reading. I couldn't put this book down in he end. Can't wait for the movie...Ben Affleck as Nick is simply Perfect!
5	1381622400	This is a real page turner.  The method of writing one chapter from the point of view of the husband and the next from the point of view of the missing wife really works for this story.  My empathy for one of the characters (not giving anything away here!) became so strong that I was just desperate for justice to be served.  I strongly recommend this psychological thriller.
1	1381622400	This was a great read until the last few chapters and then this book almost felt like the author gave up and just did a unthought sappy ending. Will never recommend
4	1381622400	(minor spoilers)Amy goes missing on her fifth marriage anniversary, and as the police start investigating, suspicion begins to zero in on her husband, Nick. There are signs of a struggle in their house, overturned furniture that looks like it was overturned after the fact, broken glass, and later the police even find evidence of a sloppily cleaned-up blood stain in the house. Nick lies to the police, one lie after another, to cover up for the fact that his marriage with Amy had been on the rocks for some time. Things get worse when Nick's sister, Go (Margo), finds that he has also been having an affair with one of his students for over a year. Amy had, it seems, made one last attempt to resuscitate their marriage by leaving several clues in the form of letters, like she used to do, on the eve of their marriage anniversary. Nick figures these clues out, one after the other, but they bring him or the police no closer to cracking the case. Circumstantial evidence mounts and the rising evidence of a motive all point to Nick. Then there is the huge life insurance policy that would accrue to Nick in the event of Amy's death.Nick is a writer who had been laid off and had moved from New York to a North Carthage - a small town in Missouri by the Mississippi River. Amy had not been too happy with the move. She had been a New York girl, daughter to parents who were the picture-perfect ideal of a loving couple and doting parents, and also the authors of a successful series of books titled "Amazing Amy".The plot unfolds through two alternating first-person narratives - one is Nick's, and the other is Amy's, told through a diary she kept over the years. The diary tells of a doting husband who began to unravel as his career skidded off the rails. It tells of a loving wife increasingly scared of her husband.As all good thrillers go, there is a major twist in the tale in this one also. While the ending will leave most people wanting to tear their hair out in frustration, the rest of the book proceeds at a fast clip, the plot unravels as the reader goes through the pages, and later the loose ends are begun to be tied up in the latter half. The characters are sharply etched, though not really fully fleshed out, and in some ways behave in predictable and mostly one-dimensional ways. In a short caper of this kind, perhaps more depth is not needed. Most of the props and characters that make an appearance in the novel are put to use later in the plot - a sine qua non for a good thriller.A mostly enjoyable caper with a couple of twists in the tale make it a mostly satisfying read.
5	1381449600	Brilliant. Kept me up two nights in a row. Amazing Amy needs no other adjectives. Read this book the soonest you can.
3	1381449600	The toooooooooooo amazing Amy - I could not believe that she managed to get away with the murder as far as the Police were concerned.  Makes one think about the likelihood of identity theft in todays dealing online.
5	1381449600	Unusual story with strong female character. Compulsive reading with good twists and manipulation Would try another book from  same author.
1	1381449600	I realize, that this book is waste of my time after 1/4 of this book. In this book is nothing, what can I catch it and read to the end. I donnot understand, that this book is the bestseller.
1	1381449600	I didn't like the book at all only got to read a few chapters and deleted it too pages about nothing.
3	1381190400	Kept my interest throughout the book, and enjoyed the twists in the story, though found the ending a little too far fetched.
4	1381190400	Was engrossed right up until the end.  As much as I enjoyed the rollercoaster ride, the ending left me a little disappointed. It felt a little like a two part TV series and I was left with the to be continued....
1	1381190400	A book full of really unlikable characters who you really don't care what happens to any of them. If you want to know what happens just read the 2nd last chapter.
3	1381104000	I guess the problem with reading reviews before hand is the expectations of a book, and that is what happened to me with this.  Everyone promised an interesting surprising twist, so when it came, i wasn't so surprised.  A good enjoyable read, and its nice to see a female character with this amount of depth, and not typical characterization.
5	1381104000	I read this book with curiosity after reading some of the other reviews. It takes a while to get going, but then it is one surprise after another and keeps you wondering what is coming next. Many have criticized the ending, but I found it was in character with  the way Amy lead her make-believe-life. All in all I enjoyed the story and found it hard to put down once I got into it. A good read!
4	1380931200	Riveting reading and totally unexpected.  A mysterious story that had an uncanny ending.  Had me in from the start to the end and I am not usually a mystery kind of reader.
3	1380931200	Spoiler Alert:Begining was intriguing. I couldn't put it down. Very disappointed with the way it ended. Is there a sequel?
1	1380844800	My first book by this author. I didn't take to the story at all. I didn't like the chosen background. I could not recommend this book as a worthwhile read to anyone. I could not wait to delete it from my Kindle.There were some commendable qualities in the characters - the understandable anxiety of parents for the ill health of a child, the loyalty and trust of an old friend.The topic itself was a turn off for me. Such interference with nature seemed gross.I would not like to read another Gillian Flynn book.
2	1380844800	I found this book to be tedious for the first half. It got interesting for a while there in the middle and I will admit in nearly threw up my own heart when the big twist unfolded. As a whole though I have to say this book was a disappointment. The writing style lacked oomph and I found it difficult to like or connect with any of the characters. I despised the ending and was left feeling extremely grumpy when it was over. Read if you must but I would happily take back the time I spent reading this book.
3	1380758400	The story was good, but reading the people's mundane thought processes was boring and tedious. This was my first book by Gillian Flynn, and I wouldn't read another one.
3	1380672000	The characters became too two-dimentional as the story unfolded. The ending lost momentum and became an anti-climax, perhaps because i don't understand the american psyche.
1	1380672000	I thought it was shallow and very poorly written .. I had great expectations and was looking forward to a gripping escape ., I can't believe this had such good reviews and sold so well ?
5	1380585600	By far the best book I have read this year and I read a lot of books!Gillian Flynn leads you on a journey with her two main characters that lulls you into thinking that this is just another psychological thriller like any other until she drops in the jaw-dropping twist half way through that is like no other I have read. Absolute class and exactly what you want from a book in this genre of writing.Superbly written, insightful and very clever this is the must-read book of the year.
3	1380585600	Two-hundred pages in, this book had me on the edge of my seat, I couldn't put it down. Such inventive twists, such psychological cleverness.But then half way through, it became too much: too many details, too many detours, too much repetition.And then the ending just petered out. A real disappointment.With a final surprising twist ending, it could have been the best book of the decade. So sorry it wasn't.
4	1380585600	Very interesting the way the story unfolds - the twister smack in the middle ( actually couple of twisters)The ending I have mixed feelings about but it wasn't what I expectedA good gripping read about a marriage gone wrong nd it's consequences
4	1380585600	Good book. Storyline was intriguing and maintained my interest throughout. I would recommend this book to any of my friends.
5	1380412800	Very innovative and successful writing style, a great book full of excellent and completely real characters - definitely worth reading.
1	1380412800	I didnt like it at all - I hate American-writing, I should have looked into it a little more before I purchased it!  Obviously very modern American language, I only read a couple of chapters, thought the language quite disgusting. Not even worth the one star I had to give it!
3	1380412800	Good book but it felt a. It unfinished for me at the end. Kept me interested the whole way through
1	1380412800	This book came highly recommended and i found it so predictable and boring. i wanted to stop reading after 30 pages, but was encouraged to continue and still felt completely deflated when i finally finished reading. It took me very long to read because i did not enjoy it and in my opinion a never to read again. Has put me off the author too. don't waste your time.
3	1380326400	This book was a real page turner but overall not as enjoyable as it should have been. The main reason for this is that I found both main characters to be beyond the realm of possibility and the ending to be highly unsuitable. To me this was a very depressing and fanciful ending. this Gone Girl is too far GONE!
3	1380240000	I tried the sample first and was really hooked ..... and for 3/4 of the book I could hardly wait to get back to it.  The storyline is unique .... but it dragged on at the end and then I got sceptical.  The book should have been tied up and finished earlier: it started to become unbelievable.
3	1380240000	I enjoyed the first half to three quarters immensely and found it well written and gripping.. The remainder slipped too much into melodrama for me.
4	1380067200	Personally I enjoyed this read, it had a good pace and I enjoyed the dark personalities featured.You find yourself backing both protagonists at different parts of the adventure, but overall neither of the characters are particularly likable.The ending could have been a little more definitive, but I can understand the authors reasoning.
5	1380067200	This book really is un put downable! Quite dark, but brilliant. Loved the changing between characters, loved jpw you were kept guessing right to the end.
5	1380067200	Good for long distance flights . Long hours at the airport ( As you HAVE to finish ) ! What else is needed to say !?
5	1380067200	Amazing! Really loved it. Had a book hangover for days. Looking forward to reading more of Gillian's books. Do yourself a favor and read it.
2	1379980800	I expected great things from this book, and what I got were two profoundly unlikeable characters playing out a psychodrama that was very much telegraphed. I read to the end to see what happened...again, predictable and somewhat dull. Finally, while I realise the book is written by a woman, it is full of misogynist tropes about manipulation and deception into marriage and pregnancy.  The only redeeming feature of this book is that it was well written.
3	1379894400	The  book  was  gripping.  and good  reading  but  in  the  end  not  true  psycologically  and  very  far fetched.I  could  spend  my  time  better  with  a  more  worthwhule  book
4	1379894400	This has had much hype, and the premise is interesting. The first half of the book goes well, providing two perspectives on 'what has happened'. The halfway twist is also quite clever (although slightly predictable). However after that, the female protagonist does some things (I cant plot spoil and mention them) that do not fit her personality or previous behaviour at all, and render the 'believability' difficult. Not bad, but ultimately a touch disappointing.
3	1379808000	I found this book at a bit tedious & I flicked through some pages. However the plot was very clever & I found that I needed to read to the end to uncover the truth.
3	1379721600	This was a book group read. It made for an interesting conversation! It's a well written and crafted story but ultimately disappointing in its conclusion. Read this book if you don't mind disliking every single  character and don't need a happy ending.
2	1379721600	I did not enjoy one page of the book. I found it disjointed and unpleasant actually.Would not recommend it to anyone.
3	1379635200	The beginning was good but it dragged on and became a bit far fetched. at least it ended on a good note - i.e. left you wondering
4	1379548800	I read one review which said - 'read it and stay single'.  I agree!Well written little number with many and unexpected twists and turns .
5	1379548800	It just got better and better.  Quite chilling in parts.  Really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.  Will definitely look at her others.
4	1379548800	A good read, and I didn't really want it to finish, but I didn't like the ending much.  That said, I will read her other books
4	1379462400	Heard various friends raving about this book so HAD to buy it. Found it hard to put down, reasonably well written, excellent story although somewhat far fetched still enjoyed it.
1	1379289600	I don't know what it is about me and &#34;blockbuster&#34; books-but this one failed to grab me ( I was one of only a few in my circle not to get into the 50 shades, twilight and Harry Potter ones either!). I just didn't get it-I didn't care about the characters at all and struggled to finish the book. If asked to sum it up in one word-meh!
5	1379203200	Great read with lots of twists and turns  Hard to put it down and really gets the brain thinking as to 'what is actually going on'!
4	1379203200	This book really drags you in. It is very clever with unexpected twists and turns. The audio book from audible is also very good.
4	1379203200	very contraversial feelings and thoughts!your read this book and think &#34;ok, now all is clear&#34; and all a sudden everything change to opposite- good hero becomes bad and vise versa!  and dont expect classic happy end))
4	1379116800	A great read.but finished up disliking both characters.they definitely deserved each other.still an unfinished story.they could not have a happy ending.
3	1379116800	Terrific psychological thriller. Enjoyed the cat and mouse game with the reader in the first half of the book. Not so keen on the ending though.
4	1378771200	Right from the start I couldn't put it down! It wasn't predictable at all. Even though I didn't get the ending I was hoping for it was still great!
5	1378684800	Original in style and form. Wonderful characters that you totally believe in, alternatively loving and hating them. time well spent.
5	1378684800	Dont read reviews about a poor ending! The ending rocks!!!!The characters, the susspense and the mystery all rock!!!Just get the book and read it!!!
3	1378598400	I had heard and read so much about this book that it was a real let-down. dont see what all the fuss is about.
4	1378598400	I thought the story was excellent. It was fresh and new. However the script used to paint the atmosphere and background of the story was a bit like going the long way round. I felt that it needed tightening quite a lot. However having said that, the writer certainly has got hold of  the nasties that lurk in most of us and aired them blatantly, which takes recognition, firstly, and secondly, a lot of courage. I came away with feeling quite frightened about how the 'need' in our beings can play such an uncontrollable role. It certainly made an impression.
5	1378425600	Couldn't put it down just kept wanting to know what Amy would do next.  Would recommend to all my friends.
5	1378425600	This is one of the best thrillers I have ever read . It is credible , realistically disturbing and unpredictable . A very &#34;out of the box&#34; thriller . The author makes some disturbingly honest and thought provoking observations on marriage . A most memorable read !
5	1378425600	The best thriller I've read all year!  It was so good I went online and bought her first book which I'm currently readying (and loving too).
2	1378339200	Although I do love Giliian Flynns way of describing the characters and making me feel that I've really got to know them - I just think her stories takes turns that are not credible and that I don't agree with. the story would benefit from having been half as long, I found it long winding.
4	1378339200	Gone Girl was an easy-to-read page turner, but executed with a sophisticated and very skilful literary style. I thought I was a fairly canny reader, but I fell into all the author's traps and false leads. The only reason I did not rate this as a 5-star is my frustration with the protagonist, Nick, and his inability to either know his own mind or take action when it seemed so clear what he needed to do. Perhaps that was all intentional, but I nevertheless wanted to give him a good kick at times!
4	1378339200	The first 90% of the book was well-written and engaging. I really liked perspective of the two main characters off-set in time. I found both sides very easy to relate to and believable. The last few chapters of the book did have the same depth and interest as the first 90% of the book.
4	1378339200	The plot goes very well in the begining, but in the finals chapters I think that the author could do better.
5	1378252800	I really enjoy the story line wasnt so keen on the way it ended , was left abit in the air one can only sumise how their lives would have turned out , but enjoy all the twists....
4	1378166400	I thought this was a great read and I was surprised by some of the twists and turns the story took.  I was very disappointed in the ending though - I felt the author should have come down on one side or the other.
5	1378166400	I read all three books in order, and this one was just unbelievably great! I finished it in a weekend! I just couldn't put it down! You really hate and love both characters and you just wish them on each other. Reading the &#34;diary&#34; amy and &#34;real amy&#34; was so good i actually wanted to kick myself for feeling bad for her!!! Gyllian flynn has definitely become one of my favorites!!!
5	1378166400	This book is a good quick read.. you can not guess what is coming next. A good picture of a strange situation. Not too deep really but keeps you interested. A good holiday read.
4	1378166400	The story was different to my normal choice of books. It piqued my interest because of the approach it took to a relationship between the two main characters. I became caught up in trying to work out actually what was going on! I did not like the characters very much but at the same time I was fascinated and had to keep reading. There were particular aspects of the book that struck a chord with me as the book unfolded. The question ' How much do we really know about the person we live with  ?' It  made me think about my relationship and others I know. It was thought provoking. As the story built to its climax I found aspects of it terrifying. I believe that there is an assumption in society, in general, that if you have done nothing wrong in life that contravenes the law, you will not be a suspect or assumed guilty by the police. However, as recent high profile cases have proven in the UK and this story explores, beware that assumption and its consequences.  A thriller that challenges and explores the minds of the the two main characters which , although not likeable in my opinion, I found i had to read to the end to find out what happens. For me a surprise, even though I kept picking up clues that did sign post me to the conclusion. A Tad long in places but I am glad I kept reading! A good read.
3	1378166400	i really liked this book, until the end. easy read. and i liked the twists and turns.  i liked the format. but i was completely let down by the ending.  so many ways this book could have ended and that's it?!?!  eh, what a let down.
1	1378080000	Started with high expectations struggled through till last chapter. Just words on paper characters superficial and one dimensional.Not unlike watching a 3D movie with out the special glasses. How this book became a best seller is a mystery,more intriguing  than the novel.
5	1378080000	Wow, this book really kept me guessing. Thinking back on it now I still get a chill up my spine!Page turner!
3	1378080000	The author developed her characters so well I could identify with them, but towards the end of the book it seems like she ran out of steam and the ending really let me down.
2	1378080000	I did not connect with the characters, they felt manufactured. I feel the marketing strategy seduced me into buying the book. A disappointing read.
4	1378080000	This book had me in a love hate relationship with the book. I found aspects of it rather beleaguered and slow, but it did not ever lose the plot. Clever twist in the end leaves you on the edge, but an abrupt end left me wanting to conclude the story....maybe we all want fairy tale endings and that is half the intrigue of the story, the 'bones' are there but the story is definitely not fairy tale! A good read hard to put down.
4	1377993600	The book engaged my curiosity from the beginning and continued to provide plenty of room for the imagination to consider various options and scenarios for 'the crime' as it moved along.  The characters reflections and insights on their relationship were believable and added depth to a mystery plot. A very enjoyable read.
3	1377993600	I like the choice of words and the way the writer leads you in a way you never actually who the killer is. However, by 60% of the book it becomes a bit repetitive.
5	1377907200	Unexpected and switching plot, great writing, after a while impossible to put down. A different kind of genre: crime meets marriage counseling. If you like twisted and morbid stories, and /or is interested in the dynamics of a relationship, you will like this one.
5	1377907200	Once I got into this story, I could not put it down.  Amazing!!!!! Excuse the pun.  Very clever story line.
5	1377907200	I would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship....it might prevent pitfalls. Or simply scare them out of it.Great as a supense story and very cleverly played out with masses of insight in human emotions.
3	1377820800	I found the book hard to get into. However once I identified myself with characters I found it easier to read
5	1377820800	The author starts off slowly, and almost mundanely, with a narrator reading from her diary. Before you are even aware of it, you find yourself being drawn into a black hole of totally unexpected twists and turns, growing darker and more menacing throughout, until you realize it's a thriller you're reading, and you have no idea where it's going. You only know you must find out, and so you can't put the book down.Fabulous writing; author has total control of her subject matter and language (the intricate and complicated plot she contrived plot is dazzling).Only reservation is that I felt the ending was disappointing, didn't work for me at all. It just didn't follow, not logical. Still, totally worth reading.
3	1377820800	It was one of those books that you could put down - not binding at all. And I did not like the ending
4	1377820800	I was hooked from the first chapter.  It is a real page turner. The book was full of surprises where you change your opinion of both of the major characters and whom you believe.  I do not agree with Amy's blame of her parents for her personality etc.  The middle chapters when she is first missing did not ring true to Amy's character considering all she had done in the past.I did not like the ending of the book where it left you up in the air.  You have to decide for yourself the outcome.  Is this possibly left open ended for a sequel?  However the book was very enjoyable and I highly recommend it.
3	1377734400	I really enjoyed this novel until a bit past the halfway point, at which it moved in a direction that bordered on the silly. I kept thinking, now it's a bit too much. The book also became predictable, with a predictable ending, and one that was not very interesting given the very interesting buildup in the first half of the novel. Gillian Flynn can write, and her characters are complex, intriguing, unpredictable and human. Nick and Amy seem to have a good marriage, but as Nick finds out over time, they did not. Amy, being the charming sociopath she is, has a photographic memory for all the slights and mistakes Nick has made when dealing with her, and believe me, they are not very few in her view of things. And since she is the jury and judge, she can mete out his punishment as well. I found myself thinking at one point, Ms. Flynn must have experienced a relationship like this in order to write the hate involved so well. Or perhaps not. I guess it's possible to fantasize about punishing a significant other in the way that Amy punishes Nick; but you'd really have to be off the wall to act on the fantasies. When I got to the point in the novel where I understood what Amy was really all about, I thought, just let them get a divorce, it would be easier. Please just get a divorce and spare us. But Ms. Flynn lets Amy answer that question for us, and the answer is no. Amy is not about divorce. Nick thinks along those lines, but Amy has a plan to get him to toe the line and keep him bound to her forever. I was hoping for a different ending, one that was easier to explain, one that was less bizarre. Strangely enough, despite the inexplicable and bizarre ending, it really was predictable and a letdown.
3	1377734400	See my headline i.e  it was quite interesting, enthrauling  and engaging....then it really got drawn out! I suppose so does marriage!!!
5	1377734400	Very different, very real.........  Could be you and your loving husband.......  looking into the minds of people, especially you and your husband........
4	1377734400	Initially I didn't like this book as I found it way too introspective and frankly very slow. There were many times when I almost decided not to waste my time with a story I just couldn't get into, then wham! It totally takes off and it went from will I ditch this book to not being able to put it down.Lots of twists and turns making it so interesting.
3	1377734400	Not sure 're this one.  Although I could not put it down toward end.  Story did not end the way I expected but characters are good, especially Amy.
4	1377648000	If the measure of a novel is how well you might remember it, say, five years from now ... Then Gone Girl will earn high stars from me for that reason alone.The tale of true love trailing off into nothingness under the strain of real life and serial  disappointment, is eloquently told by Gillian Flynn. This is not your average thriller and the first person voice used to allow the reader into the strange world the protagonists make for themselves is a very effective story telling tool. Nick and Amy are utterly believable, they embark on romance with determination, creating for the audience a magic world so intriguing that it becomes increasingly difficult, with the flick of each page, to put the book down. I was riveted from the start.When the mystery begins, it is a suspenseful thing with a mind of its own, and you the reader, will want to get inside that mind. The whodunit aspect is smartly handled and I doubt that there are many who will guess in advance, not that, that is the premise for the book. Indeed, we are allowed into the secret well before the story has run its course. This is a work about a twisted personality, a one off, an unfathomable lunatic. That said, the controversial elements inherent in the plot that have riled the feathers of many good feminists, are not, in my humble opinion, worthy of ballooning--this is a tale about a special type of crazy, rather than gender-stereotype-crazy. I do not want to spoil the story for the reader, so I'll leave this aspect there. The plot is very sharp; the author has woven 'cunning, clever and quirky'  thickly through every tiny strand of the tale. Be prepared for an unusual and wickedly entertaining story that might leave you chilled to the bone.
5	1377561600	Easy read with fascinating twists that grips the reader from the start.Leaves one questioning whether intact we do create our own morality.
5	1377561600	The best book I  have read in a long time. The reader starts with one opinion and then finds they were wrong. The character development and story line are very cleverly crafted giving the reader lots to think about and constantly questioning their own opinion.
4	1377475200	I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't wait to find out what happened to Amazing Amy. Was she gone or not? I can't say much about the story without giving away the plot. Her husband gets a call in work, on their wedding anniversary, to say that their cat is out on the road and the door to their house is open. He goes home and his wife Amy is gone. The story goes back to when they first met and right up to date. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I found the ending a bit disappointing.
5	1377475200	Perfectly woven plot, just when you think you know what's next there is a twist.  could  not put it down
4	1377388800	Amy and Nick are married for five years, but there is not much harmony left. All of a sudden, Amy is missing. And from there, a more and more surprising and devious plot develops, cleverly and elegantly put together by a very talented writer.It is difficult to talk about the plot without risking spoilers. So let's say this: It is not a conventional thriller. There are twists and totally surprising developments, we are getting manipulated and are lied to by both protagonists. It's not only a thriller, the book is also about unconventional truths about love and marriage. Sadly, the ending is a disappointment. Best not to expect too much from it and just enjoy the reading of the novel as such.The book is always straightforward and readable, but maybe there are a few digressions too many. I can't help but feeling that nowadays thriller writers feel the need to expand their books to 600 pages when 400 would have done just as well. That's stupid, because it automatically weakens the suspense.Gillian Flynn really deconstructed love and marriage here a lot, so I have a suggestion for readers who would like to read a (shorter) crime novel which is thrilling, full of dark humor and lets you believe in love again:Heads Off (A Lisa Becker Mystery).
5	1377388800	Flynn takes you into the confidence of each character before revealing the flaws and how that character has fooled you so that the book sets up so many layers of intrigue.  On the surface there's a missing wife. Beneath is manipulation, disguise, obsessive parenting, the illusion of perfection and a haunting feeling the the people closest to you may not be what they seem. Structurally superb.
4	1377302400	Gone girl is a very good thriller full of twists and cliff-hangers. You never know what will be the next surprise and certainly do not expect what will happen! Brilliant!
4	1377302400	A very well written book with a suspenseful plot. Keeps you reading until the end. Starts off slow, but changes suddenly
1	1377302400	Enjoyed reading it but found the ending pathetically thin n abrupt! Don't think Gillian Flynn is my kind of author. I gave it one star and that is with alot of grace!
5	1377216000	Man oh man this book was very compelling...looking at others a little differently at the moment, the power of some people's minds!
4	1377129600	Thought this was good but a bit slow to get going and I didn't like the ending - it was soooooo unexpected
5	1377129600	This book was recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I value, and she did not disappoint me.This is an excellently and cleverly told story of a girl gone missing. As the time progresses since her mysterious disappearance we read parallel to the husband's story the diary of said gone girl.As the diary entries progress we get a better idea of what has happened.Brilliant: Characters, pace, plot - everything.
5	1377043200	Wow.  Wow.  Wow.Holy mother of God... or should that be holy mother of all things evil?  It has been a few days since I finished Gone Girl and I am still in a state of... what exactly I have no idea.  Anger?  Shock?  Acceptance?I have no idea how I am going to write this review."My mother had always told her kids: if you're about to do something, and you want to know if it's a bad idea, imagine seeing it printed in the paper for all the world to see."There is so little detail that I can go into in regards to the actual plot, as I refuse to give any of it away.  I'm sure this will not be the first review you will have read about Gone Girl, and probably not the last.  But, I want to stress how important it is that you stay with this book.What do I mean by that?  Well, the first half has been quoted as being a little on the boring side.  I have to admit that I never felt that way... while I reading it.  But when the story completely exploded at just over the 50% mark it is a non-stop roller coaster ride till the very end.  So in retrospect, I can now look back at the first 50% and agree that yes, in comparison it was much slower.  However, the first half is a requirement.  You must get to know these characters.  You would never have been able to get to where you are emotionally at the start of Part Two if there was never a Part One."Love makes you want to be a better man.  But maybe love, real love, also gives you permission to just be the man you are."And what about the ending?  You will feel manipulated once you finished.  You will sit and stare at the final paragraph, you will want to throw the book, and or your reading device at the closest wall.  You will sit and stew over all of what you have read, wondering how things got to that final paragraph.  Then you will find yourself smiling.  Why?  Heck, you won't even know why... because I sure didn't.  I wanted to be angry, I wanted to scream, but in the end all I could do was smile.  To be fair it was probably one of those crazed, psycho killer smiles, but to be honest I would expect no other kind of smile after reading Gone Girl."There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold."So yeah, this is a strange review to have written but I just refuse to spoil anything.  My only suggestion to you is READ THIS BOOK.  There is a film being made, which at the time of this review says will be out in 2015.  I have to say, I think this will translate perfectly on the big screen.  They are filming the movie in a small river town in Missouri, not too far from where I was born and grew up in Southern Illinois.  Be it this review, other reviews, the film due out a bit later... whatever it is that helps you to decide to read this book, just please choose to read this book.  You will not be disappointed."Friends see most of each other's flaws.  Spouses see every awful last bit."ChristineRainy Day Reads
4	1377043200	My first Gillian Flynn book. I thought that the format was very clever - alternating and contrasting 'his and hers' diary entries. Each chapter brought a new twist to the plot which maintained the interest right to the climax. A very good read.
4	1377043200	found the book to have been written well with a interesting plot line would recommend this writer to others and have brought some more of her books to read
5	1377043200	Very, very skilfully plotted! I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet, so I won't say more than that the author is extremely clever at misleading the reader. However, I am not entirely sure that the ending is quite convincing.
4	1376956800	Thiw wasd a fascinating read. If you would like to know more about the art of manipulating your surroundings this book is a must read. I found it interesting and inspiring to be drawn into this wicked mind that orchestrates each and everyone and creates a scanario and calling it 'the truth'.
5	1376956800	A twisted tale of manipulation and extremes, this book made me change my thoughts about the characters continuously.  Relationships can be complex but Nick and Amy have outdone us all!
2	1376956800	I read it without ever really been trap by the story. I guess the plot seemed to linger unnecessarily in some parts without a real reason.
3	1376870400	I stopped reading this book towards the end. It actually started to irritate me. Finally just finished it and have to say that I found it moderately entertaining. The first half of the book was a page turner.
4	1376870400	Very frightening - the ultimate manipulations. Clever and unpredicatable. You were not sure which way it was going to go at any time.
3	1376870400	Heard so much about this book and read it on holidays but it was just okay- most other people seem to like it better than me
3	1376870400	This is a book which I find difficult to make my mind up about.  It was very slow to start and it was about half way through before it began to pick up speed and interest me. There are two main characters in the book and I'm afraid I couldn't entirely believe in either of them.  Nick struck me as a bit wet.  For someone in the position of having been a successful man, he seems to lose his way entirely after losing his job.  Amy, duplicitous Amy - maybe such a person could exist - but I doubt it.  It was a step too far for me.  I could see how her upbringing and the strange relationship with her parents could be damaging but without giving the game away, I can't explain what I found so unconvincing about her.The writing was crisp and engaging and I wish the story had been a little more convincing.  To me, it was an over-egged pudding.  I read this for my local book group and on the whole enjoyed the experience.  I felt the ending was rather nothing.  Pity.
5	1376784000	I so enjoyed the story and the changes of viewpoint on each chapter (character).  It had me going til the end
5	1376784000	Spoiler alertAmy is the biggest twitch I have come across in a book in a very long time.She uses, abuses and is a true psychopath being the poster child of dysfunctional in any DSMIV in the world.The time she takes, the trouble she goes to, the extent of her hate.  I loved it all.The reason I loved it is due to the fact that this is NOT a perfect woman.  She takes on role's - The Daughter.The Wife.  The Friend etc but she is none of these.  She is a selfish self absorbed twit.  One I really hoped would bite the dust.The ending was both brilliant as well as deeply disturbing.A brilliant book indeed and one I am very glad a friend pushed me to read.WaAr
4	1376697600	Unusuall characterisation in that its difficult to really feel for the main characters but is a very good read all the same.
4	1376611200	A fascinating story told with humour, sensitivity and meticulous detail.  Exciting twists which left the reader vascillating about their alliance to one or other party.  A difficult plot to finish ...
4	1376611200	I like books that are unpredictable, where it is difficult to figure out where the story is heading. But many authors make the mistake of writing stories that are impossible to predict. If an outcome comes as a surprise for each and every reader, then there is no satisfaction in trying to figure out where the story is heading and reading becomesutterly pointless. I like books that are predictable. Because then as the story unfolds I am able to think &#34;yes, just as I thought, but I bet most people are surprised right about here&#34;.This book has solved this conundrum in an elegant way. The first part of the book hints at several different possible outcomes. The reviews all say that &#34;you won't believe the plot twist that happens next&#34;, which gives me some extra satisfaction in thinking that yeah, that was one of the developments I had on my mental list of possibilities. The story is unpredictable for most people, and still predictable but not certain for some people. I like that in a book.However, the ending chapters seems to be a bit forced, as if the author had difficulties tying up the loose ends in a good way. And on top of that I would personally have preferred a different ending. So I will only give it a weak 4.
3	1376524800	Great read until ending which I found to be a bit of an anti climaxWell written but would not read again
5	1376524800	Wow, what a great read, it started a little slow but when it got going I could not put it down. So different to anything else I have read and I have been raving about it to anyone that will listen.
3	1376524800	Enjoyed book. characters were very interesting. Good read. Disappointed with the ending. Not sure if I would recommend it 3 stars
4	1376438400	Gone Girl is a fascinating example of the phrase "two sides to every story". A good read with many twists to keep you interested throughout.
5	1376438400	I couldn't put this book down due to the twists and turns in the storyline.  I enjoyed the fact that it changed viewpoint from chapter to chapter.  It played with your sympathies and opinions.  It was fast paced and well written with interesting observations on life and relationships which led to enthusiastic and varied discussion in our book group.
5	1376352000	This one would make a great little mini series. I'll be surprised if I don't see it on TV at some point. The twist was good and unexpected. I found it a good read.
5	1376352000	My sister recommended this as a great read.  She wasn't exaggerating.  This book is a winner.  The writing is flawless.  It's a slightly slow starter, but once you get going, this is a page turner.  It's been hailed by mid to high-brow readers and the only thing I cannot understand, is the low-star rating given by some of the reviewers.  This author is going to soar.  Excellent!
1	1376352000	This book is very slow and ridiculous and a terrible ending  I will not be reading any of Gillian's other books
4	1376265600	I enjoyed the book but was disappointed at the ending a little too far fetched - a little like an american tv show
4	1376265600	This book made me change the way I perceived the characters all the time. It was full of twists and turns and after feeling empathy for each of the characters at some point, by the end I wasn't sure I liked either of them!Cleverly crafted.
4	1376179200	A great holiday read. Fast paced, entertaining and keeps you in suspense beautifully. Modern and scary in a 'what can actually happen' kind of way.
3	1376179200	I was gripped by this story from page one, and could not put it down. The author has created an incredibly convoluted tale with great skill, though I was a bit surprised at some of the twists and turns. However, the reasons for those became apparent in the final chapters. The characters are not at all attractive, apart form Margot. She has a social compass. The ending for me was somewhat infuriating, but gave me food for thought. Read it and enjoy the ride.
5	1376179200	Up to about the 20% complete point I really didn't know if I was going to finish or not but it turned around and I can honestly say it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time! I didn't see the ending coming at all [I hate when I can], it really is an outstanding book, I'm just sorry I'm finished!
3	1376179200	I remember my English teacher saying that every good story will have a beginning, a middle and an end. Sounds simple enough right? This book had me hooked. I loved the beginning, then the middle was even better and I stayed up late to find out what was going to happen at the end.. I had a few theories but nope! was so disappointed with the ended that when I looked at the book as a whole..it just wasn't that good. it had so much promise but just failed on the follow through.
4	1376179200	I was reading this book lazily with a few pages every day till I hit a point where I just couldn't keep it down. I finished more than half the book in one sitting as it involves you completely. You are in the head of the two main characters or they are in your head! It is a very well written thriller that doesn't fail to surprise you till the very end.
5	1376179200	I LOVED this book.  Things are not always as they seem and this book is a brilliant example of that.  If it were up to me, I would have changed the ending, but even so, brilliant book.Just when you think you have it all sorted...bam. New development.Do yourself a favour. Read it. Now.
4	1376179200	A book of two halves and an interesting ending that challenges the reader. Very clever writing. I couldn't put it down once I started.  Definitely recommend this book.
5	1376092800	This book left me reeling at the innovative talent of Gillian Flynn. On compleation of the novel I searched what else she had written and immediately downloaded all. Ms Flynn is a writer of immense talent. This is on the edge of your seat reading, I had no idea where it was going, which was very unusual for me as I have a jaded palate for whodunits. This was something else altogether and a fantastic read.
3	1376006400	There was a lot of build up and twists and turns, but felt that the ending was disappointingFelt let down by the ending as there was no resolution to the problem
5	1376006400	Gripping story -could not put it down from the moment I started reading. Engaging, entertaining & most unpredictable. A great read!
5	1376006400	Let me start my review with how the ending made me feel when I finished this book a few hours ago. I felt overwhelmed, shocked, satisfied, afraid, and awed. If I was told to sum up this book in one sentence only, it would be this: hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. None, zero, zilch, nada, nothing.Gone Girl is a complex read, but nothing overly complicated. Don't expect to walk away from it unaffected, though. No matter what your gender or what relationship experiences you've had in life - good or bad - you're going to experience a myriad of emotions while reading this novel and relating to these characters in one way or another. It's impossible not to feel something for either or both of them. Depending on your own current or previous experience with a life partner, you're going to pick a side in this book. However hard I tried to understand both these characters and feel compassion for them, I just couldn't. I picked the one who in my opinion was the victim through all that happens in this story, and stuck with that character to the end. Although I have to admit, it wasn't always easy.And here's something else you should know: this book will mess with your mind. It starts out real slow telling you how Nick and Amy met, how they fell in love, and what their relationship was like those first few glorious years. It was such a slow beginning, in my head I had already given it a three-star rating, because I was a little bored with all the theatrics and the giddiness of a new couple who viewed the world and their new relationship through rose-tinted lenses. Around twenty percent into the book, when things pointed to Nick (the husband) as the culprit in his wife, Amy's disappearance, did I get interested enough to continue reading on. Almost halfway into the book, I was completely hooked. Was Amy murdered? Was she kidnapped? Did she run away? Where the heck is Amy, and why is Nick so evasive? I'm sure I had it all figured out.But THEN...Then the author goes, surprise! Whatever you thought you knew? With whomever you think your loyalties lie? Whichever direction you think this is going? You haven't seen anything yet. Folks, I was - as the author had intended - shocked to the core. I didn't see it coming. I never had a clue (even though I thought I did). All the mushy stuff at the start actually had a purpose...as I discovered during the rest of the story. To have created such psychologically intricate minds, such messed-up characters; such vindictive and manipulative personalities, is inarguably the work of a genius mind. A very insightful one at that. Honestly, sometimes it was so emotionally exhausting trying to stay a step ahead, I just had to put the book down and take a breather. But in the blink of an eye, I was reading again. Staying awake until the early hours of the morning, reading in the car, sneaking a peek while at the office, using every opportunity available to get tangled up in the war-zone of the Dunne's nuclear marriage.Gone Girl is not an easy book to read, but every minute spent reading it, makes it worthwhile at the end. The writing is superb, the plot absolutely exceptional and very cleverly done, and the characters flawed, self-righteous, terrifying - a watercolor of the darkest parts of the human mind. This book is a treasure trove of debatable topics perfect as a book club read. I recommend it to everyone over the age of eighteen, no matter what your genre of preference.
1	1376006400	I gave up on this book.  Too slow moving and introspective.  I didn't like the any of the characters.  I know its made best seller lists ... why is a complete mystery to me.
5	1375833600	I absolutely loved this book. Not the type of book I would normally reading but this one has got me wanting to read more like this. There were many unexpected twists that were expertly woven to keep me reading and reading.
5	1375574400	This was my kind of book, keeps you awake and makes you want to keep turning the page. Captivating, emotional and a tear jerker.
3	1375574400	Once I started i couldn't stop reading!  but I was very disappointed because the ending didn't make a lot of sense which upset me a bit. Nevertheless I still recommend it.
5	1375488000	What a messed up book but an absolute page turner with twists and turns all the way through. Nicely written
5	1375401600	A real page turner - very intelligently written psychological thriller with just the right balance of pop culture.I couldn't put it down!
4	1375401600	Very good read. Unusual style of writing. Took me some time to get used to it. Would give i 5 stars, except for the ending. I found it very disappointing
3	1375401600	I was disappointed in the ending after a promising start to the story.  It is the only book by that author I have read and I would not buy another.
4	1375401600	it draws you in to keep reading, but they are two sick people.I had no idea how it was going to end and it had me racing to the finish.
4	1375401600	Very different, slow to get going but once your into it, it was hard to put down. Lot's of twists and turns and incredibility that someone could be so deceptive and manipulative!
3	1375401600	I am very pleased that I read Gone Girl, although I must confess about a third of the way through I was seriously bored by it and thought it very predictable. I only stuck with it as it is being read by my Book Club. I'm glad I did as about half way through a really clever twist emerges and from then onwards it becomes a page turner.
5	1375315200	Not characters you really 'like' but wasn't able to put it down all the same.  Wonder what they are up to now ...
4	1375228800	Husband Nick and wife Amy are both nutters. Their crazy obsessed love,hate relationship twists and turns through bizarre and outrageous situations. You have to stop for a break just to try and process how mental these two are. But like the characters,you go back for more.
1	1375228800	If there was an option for a minus star then that's what I would give this book.  It doesn't even deserve a half a star.  We chose this book at book club because of the big hype around it as to what a fantastic thriller it was.  Whoever decided that this book was a thriller needs to look up the definition of thriller.  I was utterly disappointed. As were the rest of book club.  What a load of tripe.  This book doesn't deserve to be published!  The editor and publisher need to find a different occupation because they clearly don't know a good book from a bad one!!!
4	1375228800	It starts very slowly and makes you wonder what all the hype is about. It takes off about 1/3 into the book and follows some wonderful twists and turns. The ending was very disappointing and I felt let down by it
5	1375228800	Gillian Flynn&#8217;s Gone Girl is a remarkable literary achievement.It draws you into the intricacies of what constitutes a troubled marriage, but in compiling a delicious &#8216;he said-she said&#8217; Flynn has also brought to relief the pop idiosyncrasies that make her fiction and America such a delight. The reference to the economic bust, the ham-fisted move from New York City to Missouri, the hunky small-town hubby versus the urbane bitch, dysfunctional families on both ends &#8211; all merge to create a page-turner that will have you up until dawn.Without spoiling it for readers, if you haven&#8217;t read Gillian Flynn this is the book you ought to pick up first. And yes, I&#8217;ve downloaded Dark Places on my Kindle too and that&#8217;s equally engrossing.
4	1375228800	Good story but sad.  The author did a good job switching from 1 character to the other.  Very slow start though. It got more and more interesting towards the end and you can not tell what was going to happen at the end so be prepared to stay awake and reading all night to know the end.
2	1375142400	Started off well, dragged, and then disappointed. I was expecting a more exciting ending and in parts found I really struggled to keep reading. I liked the narrative - was different, but both a friend and I agreed it was a flat ending.
4	1375056000	Really well written, keep me intrigued right till the end. The characters were interesting, and kept me interested to find the conclusion of the tangled web....
5	1375056000	I nearly gave up on this book in the first chapter but am glad that I did not as it is a brilliant book. Very cleverly written and lots of twists. Would highly recommend it. the ending is very unpredictable.
4	1375056000	liked the main characters, engaging for the most part - did'nt like the ending - will make a great movie,
5	1374969600	A look at the nature of marital relationships and the mind of a psychopath; how this impacts on their lives and all those around them.
4	1374969600	Fantastic plot, read it in 2 days, slightly disappointed with the ending felt it was a bit rushed, but still a great read.
3	1374969600	I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, as I was glued to the pages. However there were a lot of twists in this book, which made the overall read feel inauthentic.
5	1374969600	I enjoyed this book and the way it was told. The characters have such depth. I went on to read Gillian Flynn's Dark places following this one, I liked the style of writing and the set up of the plot.
4	1374883200	A good page turner with lots of twist and surprises. The tension and interest was maintained through the book and the surprises kept coming, right to the end. A compelling and well written read. I can just see this being made into a movie.
5	1374796800	Just what one needs on vacation. Twists and turned in unexpected ways all the way through. And leaves you with a most uneasy kind of feeling in the end.
1	1374796800	Typical 'boy band' style writing. The story is so unbelievable and you can recognize that the author is making it up as she is going along. I am tired of these generic books, typical of the Grey series without the porn.
3	1374710400	This book is very well written and sucks you in to see what happens next. I must admit I didn't love the last few chapters and the ending, but that's just me! Still highly recommend.
4	1374710400	Adults playing games of revenge. The start and body of the book was good reading. However when it turned out to be serious, no one was held accountable. Almost like childish pranks from a wife who thinks she is not getting enough attention and goes too far to punish her husband.
1	1374624000	Oh my god did I struggle with this.. I was told there was a great twist so that kept me reading but I soon realized it wasn't that great!! I won't even start on the absolutely stupid ending that had me wondering what the hell any1 would get from reading this book
4	1374537600	Great story on story told by him and her - just shows how people's views of their lives and times and so affected by their backgrounds.  Loved the twist in the tail.  An honest look at the difficulty of maintaining a long relationship.
1	1374537600	The &#34;diary&#34; style was not my cup of tea at all, and the characters seemed to have little by way of redeeming features.
4	1374451200	The gradually demise of a marriage, gives way to this crime thriller where the wife suddenly disappears and the husband appears as the prime suspect. A criminal investigation ensuesHusband and wife give shape to the tale every other chapter from beginning to end giving the reader their feelings, as the story moves onIt is great the way it was written, using simple words, paying close attention to tiny details of the characters' attitudes and interactions among them and with their surroundingsGood twists and turns, at the end of some chapters situations are crafted to surprise the reader and uptick suspenseBut not only is a crime thriller, the author takes her time throughout the story to have her say about what love and marriage involvesIt is up to the reader to judge the ending and reach conclusions
3	1374451200	I was really expecting an exciting, gripping story - what I got was somewhat different.  The story was rather disjoined and although initially sympathetic to the main female character, I disliked her more and more as I read.
3	1374451200	The first part of the book is pretty slow, but then Part 2 things begin to get interesting, as Amy's mind begins to work.  Part 3 you think is going to be it.....but IT never comes.  I was extremely let down with the ending.  What a waste of my finger swiping... I like it dark and twisted as much as the next person, but this turned into a very anticlimactic ending.
3	1374451200	Its okay very readable but a bit confusing. I felt that both the main  characters needed a good hard slap!!!!!!!!
2	1374451200	If you're looking for a good read to make you fall asleep at night, it'll do the trick. Short chapters, not much thought or imagination required.
2	1374451200	I downloaded Gone Girl onto my kindle, opened it and started reading. Halfway through the &#34;first&#34; chapter I noticed that the kindle was showing that I was 52% of the way through the book. I assumed that it was just an error and continued reading. Finished the &#34;first&#34; chapter and started to doubt that what I had read actually was the first chapter, so showed it to a friend who had already finished the book. Turns out I had read the first chapter of the SECOND part of the book! Thanks Kindle!! I've continued to read it , but already knowing what happens in the second part of the book has obviously removed a LOT of the &#34;suspense&#34; or otherwise. If you put this book on your kindle - you have been warned - make sure it brings you to the start of the book and not the middle!!!
5	1374364800	The American dream goes sourAmy & Nick are two cool New Yorkers, working in dream jobs, being paid to write. Amy is a Cool Girl and the heroine for a succession of best selling books written by her parents. Who wouldn't envy them? And then the economy falls apart and "the once plentiful herds of magazine writers would continue to be culled - by the Internet, by the recession, by the American public". So sadly for Nick and Amy they both get made redundant and soon they can no longer afford to pay the mortgage on their trendy Brooklyn townhouse. Life can be cruel for losers in the City That Never Sleeps and the couple are forced to sell up, and retreat to somewhere affordable - in this case, back to Nick's Midwest home town, in nowheresville, Missouri.Despite their money worries, Nick has to find a way of making a living so borrows off Amy's inheritance to open a bar, as playing barkeep is something that he's always dreamed of doing.  But pretty soon Nick and Amy are arguing over money and once couples start doing that, it's a sign that love don't live there any more and all that's left then is the division of the spoils. Hardly the stuff of young love's dream, is it?Told from the point of view of both Nick and Amy, Gone Girl, is a psychological thriller, a War of the Roses for the 21st century. It is the tale of love gone toxic in a world where even the malls have closed down.  The big question at the heart of this book though is just who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist as by the end of the novel you may be none the wiser.This is writer Gillian Flynn's third novel. An experienced journalist, she is an assured writer and has done a particularly fine job with the characterisations of both Nick and Amy.  Nobody in Gone Girl is let off the hook, even Amy's parasitic parents who have made a living out of creating a perfect Amy for public consumption. It's no wonder that the film rights were snapped up so quickly as one this is for sure, Gone Girl is a book for its time, a cynical take on the reality of shattered hopes and dreams for one particular Generation X couple.
1	1374192000	Slow moving and convoluted.  Hated it.  Never finished.  There was no desire to find out where the wife went,  Refund?
4	1374192000	writing so good, story line so unusual, characters well drawn, and conclusion .. could only be that conclusion and satisfactory.
3	1374105600	Found this hard to put down but disappointed as it developed ( or didn't). I felt she got half way through and then decided on a few twists and overdid it!
4	1374105600	The characters fluctuated in their assessment of the dire situation they found  themselves in. This kept the book alive and riveting from beginning to end as each character redefined him or her self . I found the language and dialogue harsh, but this did suit the text.
4	1374105600	Good, a bit bizarre towards the end. It says I'm 13 words short to submit this review so by typing this now I'm not.Good nite all.
3	1374019200	Found this hard to get into but eventually got into and found it hard to put down.  Felt that the language in the book wasn't always necessary.
2	1374019200	moved slowly this mystery thriller come physco story.Enjoyed Girl with Dragon tattoo much better.However it is still written well and keeps you alert with your attemps to work out the plot etc.
4	1373932800	Well written, was hard to put the book down. Not the typical ending which I didn't like but that's just me, I like a little predictability
5	1373932800	Good book with lots of twists and turns.  Women will like this book.  I wanted it to continue.  Worth the money.
5	1373932800	This was my first attempt at a Gillian Flynn novel and it was worth every cent. I was enthralled from beginning till end. It only happens so often in life that you accidentally come across a work of fiction that touches your psyche in such an indelible way. Great job Gillian. I can't wait to read your next novel, please hurry up and write it!
5	1373932800	unbelievable story your kept guessing till the very end. amazing book would recommend to anyone. twists throughout and always trying to second guess whats going to happen. cant wait for the film. most definitely an adddictive read. 5 stars
3	1373846400	Though the book caught my attention I didn't like it much. Found the plot to be very twisted. Very different style of writing. I'd recommend to give it a pass.
2	1373846400	Badly written. All those brackets. I actually gave it back and took it off the kindle. The story was good .
4	1373760000	I was absorbed by this very clever story. Also appalled at how I kept changing sides. I wanted the book to end differently but was amazed at how it did end. What a great read. Wasn't so keen on the bad language though.
4	1373760000	Not much depth or brilliant writing. A simple mystery fit to be read on a plane journey. What makes it a best seller?
5	1373760000	This book keeps you guessing at every turn so you keep reading to try and figure out what is going on. Great take on relationships and the power of words.
3	1373587200	The first half of the book was very well written, the characters were three-dimensional, the prose fluid and the plot was cleverly laid out.  The ending, however (particularly the final quarter of the book) felt shallow and hasty.The initial structure of the plot was so well crafted that an anticipation was created for a stunning, intelligent ending.  This, however, was not the case.  Some readers may also have ethical issues with the way the ending was developed.
4	1373500800	This started out as a predictable thriller - the familiar tale of a man suspected for the dissappearance of his wife, and the story of their marriage. The first part of the book is quite engaging but the secon part is the one that turns the whole story around. Very well written, although I found some of the story lines in the second part somehow unbelievable.
5	1373500800	As you read you question and go over the clues in your mind and try and predict the outcome.  The questions are:  Is anyone as they seem to be?  As innocent or as guilty?  Is anyone likeable or without an agenda?  A clever story of love and hate.
2	1373414400	This book confused me a little.  I found it quite drawn out, especially for the first half of the book and I found the switching from the present to the future quite frustrating.  The book wasn't bad as I managed to finish it but it wasn't great either
5	1373414400	Expect the unexpected! Great story, reminds me of 'we need to talk about Kevin' if u liked that, you'll like this!
5	1373414400	Has been long time I last read a novel that was so hard putting on the table. Really entertaining and surprising
3	1373414400	Quite a few twists and turns but pretty unbelievable, I managed to finish it but more from stubborness than being enthralled..
4	1373414400	I both loved and hated this book in turn. I really hope that people like Amy do not really exist, I did not like her, even though at first I could not see where the story was going, I nursed a deep suspicion about Amy . Nick seems at the very least odd, disconnected, entitled, and emotionally stunted. I wonder if the situation as developed by the author could have been possible if Nick had been more connected, more aware of the difficulties he created for himself. It is a mad. Crazy story, peopled by characters I hope I will never encounter. However, I will read Gillian Flynn again. She is a master.
4	1373328000	First half was very suspenseful and very well-written. Interest and suspense petered out towards the end... Does make you think about whether you REALLY know the person you married!
5	1373241600	The pace just didn't quit with this book. Be prepared not to get anything else done once you pick it up.
4	1373241600	This book was an emotional roller coaster and kept me on the edge of my seat with it's twists and turns.  It is very well written and is one of those books you can't stop thinking about after you've finished it.  Excellent!!!
3	1373241600	Not a bad read but I really didn't like any of the 2 main characters very much, in the end I wasn't blathered what happened to either of them
3	1373241600	This was a good read, but its really not all its hyped up to be.  It starts off really well, but the ending could have been so much better.  think it will be better as a movie.
5	1373155200	such a great way to write, it really keeps you guessing right to the end. I was enthralled and totally caught up in it. marvellous read.
5	1373155200	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and could not put it down.interesting having the story told by 2 individuals with different view to the issues.
4	1373155200	Wow, that's all I can say.  I love the story that peeled away like layers of an onion.  Gripping, real page-turner stuff with lots of twists, some you never saw coming.  But the ending?  Oh Ms Flynn what happened to the ending, there was no justice and it sort of fizzled out.  Very unsatisfactory ending, but super read all the same.
4	1373155200	This book is certainly full of twists and turns and is a good read, its very clever and different!  not really deserving of No 1 best seller .
5	1373155200	Loved this book from the beginning, so cleverly thought out and brilliantly written. Plot was extremely unusual with twists and turns throughout!
5	1373068800	The girl who 'went' was just such an interesting character. I'd say more for fear of spoilers. I stayed up really late reading it. I thought the characters were really well developed and original, and the plot was engrossing.
3	1373068800	I read so many rave reviews that I somehow expected more than what I got. Amazing Amy turns into Annoying Amy by the end of the book. I wasn't really concerned at that point. She became a big nasty character, and I just stopped feeling for her or Nick.
5	1372896000	Loved the unexpected twists and turns.  You are kept guessing most of the time.  Impossible to put down - read it in one day
3	1372896000	Difficult to get into at first, then I was absolutely rivetted and enjoyed the main body of the book. I had saved the last few pages and was looking forward to seeing who might get their 'just desserts'... or... would the truth come out publicly. I know we don't expect a predictable ending... but the finish of this book left me feeling flat... and a bit cheated. I would not recommend it.
4	1372809600	This book was a pleasant surprise. So many twists and turns and you could never guess what was coming next! A good introduction to Gillian Flynn novels.
5	1372809600	Well worth a read. To start I didn't think it was for me but once into it I couldn't put it down!Enjoy
4	1372809600	Gone Girl took me to some dark places.  Those clever and intricately woven tale stretches the imagination. Without giving away any plot, I can tell you that at different times you will despise the characters in this book.  You will also at times feel very sorry for them, and switch from favouring one to the other.  Trust me, read it and get taken for a ride..
4	1372723200	Thought that the story was all over and realised I was only halfway through the book. There were so many unexpected twists and turns that I couldn't stop reading it.
1	1372723200	I hated this book; the characters are not well developed and are not in the slightest way, believable.  Despite reviews that said I would be surprised at the outcome, I was not.  The plot development is slow and laborious, it is clumsily written and could do with some thorough editing. I could go on by why waste my time?
5	1372723200	The authors dexterity speaking in the different characters voices made the book particularly readable for me and difficult to put down until the end.
5	1372723200	I haven't read a book like this ever. Twisting, turning, frightening , it's hard to find words.Read it. Now
4	1372723200	I enjoyed the writing style, diary like. Both Nick and Amy's personality deficiencies were believable. Amy was totally detached and lacked any empathy. I have meet some self absorbed people like Amy so I found her manipulation believable. To a degree she was created by her parents.The ending was chilling, I have found myself drifting back to the conclusion, Nicks knows!!
4	1372723200	Good thriller, would hold your attention, there is obviously a sequal on the way..Thought the author could have gone into the relationship with her parents more, and definately though the other 'victims' of her behaviour could be brought into the story more... .
4	1372636800	A good read.Lots of interesting twists.The characters were really vivid and I felt sympathy for the main character.
4	1372636800	really enjoyed the book untill the ending, thought it was stupid actually, unrealistic to say the least, pity as book was very readable.
4	1372636800	Even if the endoing could have been better, this book took a hold of me for quite some time. I loved some of the turns in the plot. Good summer reading.
5	1372550400	Gillian  Flynn  is a  very  talented  writer,  im  still reading this book  so  i can't  pass sentence  yet. I  will  say, though,  its an  incredible  book  so  far, i love the way  she  turns  the story  right  around  and ....plays  the  reader.....in  a  good way  of course. I  will  buy  any  book she writes  i  think :)
3	1372550400	I enjoyed this book, but the central characters Amy and Nick are both very unlikable ... Scary though, and so unbelievable it is believable. Like the way Flynn makes the Missouri setting a character as well.
2	1372550400	Boring and I don't look forward to picking it up. Have force myself to complete it.i don't like he main character
4	1372550400	since I started the book I could not put it down untill I finished it. I really needed to know what would happen next and I dreaded it at the same time!
3	1372464000	A good thriller in the style Patricia Highsmith, though not as original in concept. Perfect book to read for holidays.
5	1372464000	couldn't put it down even though with each page I got more worried about how dreadful human nature can be!  Had to reach the end in the hopes that there would be some solace in it - ie they were freaks, there was some explanation to put my mind at ease... read it and find out - it's worth it!
5	1372377600	A romance gone curly! Who to like and who to be horrified by? It twists and turns like a twisty-turny thing.
4	1372377600	This book freaked me out. Lots of twists and turns. Great holiday read if you'd like to keep your mind engaged a bit.
1	1372291200	I though this was a really stupid book.  It made no sense to me and it took me ages to get through it.
4	1372204800	Wasn't sure to begin with but the story sucked me in and I had to find out what happened.  There was something unsettling about the story and I found the characters frustrating at times.  I did enjoy the story though and I think it was the way the story was written that I didn't like?
3	1372204800	Easy read, but not 'thriller of the year'. Starts strong, ends less so. A little bit too wacky for me.
5	1372204800	This is a good holiday read, the book is well written with a quirky storyline, it was hard to put down , which is a compliment . Highly recommend this for a really enjoyable read
3	1372118400	I don't usually read fiction, but as this book had been rated so highly I thought I'd give it a go.  I could have done without the bad language and vulgarisms.  The plot was very contrived and the character development suffered as a result.  I plodded my way through it, but it wasn't worth the effort.
3	1371945600	The story was very unique and a little creepy but enjoyable. I wonder if people have actually been in these positions before.
5	1371945600	Started off not liking this but was very soon hooked and couldn't put it down. A satisfactorily twisted ending. Excellent.
4	1371945600	This novel kept me engrossed, lots of twists and turns that kept me guessing how it would all end. A good read not a great one.
4	1371945600	found the characters quite engaging.  loved the fact the whole story was told from both angles. great twist near the end!!  would recommend as  a good holiday read.
3	1371945600	Okay, but would not recommend to anyone. I was disappointed as it was a recommendation from an aquaintance.Could have done better things with my time!
1	1371772800	The characters are two dimensional and don't come across as real. The writing is just OK. The plot is unbelievable.
4	1371686400	A rollercoaster ride.  Just when you think you've got it worked out, you're suddenly caring more about the other person.  Really good read
5	1371686400	It was full of suspense and the characters were intriguing with everyday weaknesses, strengths and flaws that we all have, but with offbeat personality issues that kept you guessing.
3	1371686400	I enjoyed this book at the start, but gradually felt less and less sure of the way the story was going. Eventually, I found myself skimming the last few chapters and just wanted it to finish.
4	1371686400	Although the book started a bit slowly, it was a very exciting read and soon I couldn't put it down!
4	1371686400	it was an interesting read. It really gives a look a good look at how people can manipulate situations and other people.
5	1371686400	As a newcomer to author Gillian Flynn, I was captivated from the first sentence. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read her other books now.
5	1371686400	As a rule, I tend to avoide psychological thrillers. Unfortunately, Gone Girl kept coming up in conversations with people and when I finally read it, I loved it! It's really well written, has a clever plot and kept surprising me. Well done, Gillian Flynn - I'll be looking for more from you in the future!
5	1371513600	I didn't like the characters - they leave an almost bitter taste in your mouth, but I loved the story.Gillian Flynn did a brilliant job - I was in suspense from chapter to chapter and almost wanted to race through to the end and reveal the truth!I can't recall having read anything similar to Gone Girl before- it's unique style is deserved of all the attention the book has been receiving.
1	1371513600	I can't believe I spent my time reading this book. It is sick, so many stories and she finishes unpunished and no one can prove she is crazy!?
4	1371427200	How Gillian Flynn was able to construct this story line left me wondering for ages. I could not believe the premeditated deception that unravelled in this 'couldn't put down' novel. I loved her modern, snappy style of the writing and all the cooky characters that emerged as the story was told. Great fun to read!
5	1371427200	Great book, funny and smart. With lots of twists, unpredictable ending (really, you'd never guess how it ends even after the first half, believe me on that). It just soaks you in. And I'm not a big thriller fun, quite opposite. I'd never go for thriller normally, its a bit shallow.  But not this one. Totally worth it!
4	1371427200	Well written,gets the reader in from the beginning, an author I will read more of ,lots of plot twists in this novel
5	1371340800	Reading Amy's journal entries give you a chance to get to know a truly multi-faceted character. What you see...is NOT what you get!
5	1371340800	I enjoyed the unexpected twists in the plot especially as presented by the stories of the different characters and how they evolved and added dramatic traits to their personalities. The best part is the extrodinary marital relationship and the way it assumed dark and obsessive hues. Highly recommended!
4	1371340800	Enjoyed reading this fast paced story with its psychological sub-plots.  Characters were very believable and the ending leaving me wondering.
5	1371254400	Loved it.  Truly did - it was one of those books that has you thinking about it constantly, and you find yourself telling people, "I'm reading this book.  It's driving me crazy because I want to find out what happens and instead I have to do normal life things!"Nick's wife is missing and everyone thinks he did it.  He hints that he did it.  But did he ACTUALLY do it?  He doesn't say!  So can you be sure?  But surely he did it.  Did he?  ARGH!When the second half of the book kicks in, it adds even more tension and is a brilliant story development.I know some people have complained that it has 'the worst ending ever', and while I agree that it all wrapped up rather quickly compared to the slow burn of the rest of the story, it was a good, creative ending.  I think people like their favourite character to 'win' and feel disappointed when something else happens.  I like it when something else happens!  Otherwise, you've read the whole book knowing how it would end.I loved the fact that it was easy and simple to read with the odd unfamiliar word thrown in - had me using the dictionary function on my Kindle a few times.
5	1371254400	A book that you can picture from page one. Two characters that are opposite but that you like them both. A book everyone should read.
1	1371254400	Sorry didn't enjoy, didn't finish, it was too boring for me, obviously not my type of book, but others do/did enjoy
5	1371168000	Couldn't wait to get to the end. Interesting portrayal of women's versus men's emotions.I kept changing allegiances. Good read.
5	1371168000	Really enjoyed this book.  A great thriller with a twist in the tale.  Would recommend to anyone.  Have since read both Ms Flynn's other books and highly recommend them also.  Wonderful writer with different slant on things.
5	1371081600	really enjoyed this book, i don't usually like these stories but I found myself not able to put it down & I will definately be reading more by this author
3	1371081600	Not read her before, but will again, an interesting twist to a regular who dunnit. Liked her writing style, not too complex to overly detailed.
4	1370995200	Gillian Flynn's book is a different take on romance, mystery, crime, while incorporating all of those elements. A good, absorbing read.
5	1370995200	Amazingly crafted page turner which kept me riveted until the last word.  The characters were believable and the observations made about the nature of relationships was most thought provoking. Highly recommended
4	1370908800	My schedule does not allow me to read as much I would love. I am, therefore, extremely particular about devoting my time to a book that doesn't intrigue and pull me in from the very first page.This one is a great page turner. It had me up all night.
5	1370822400	Deservedly popular, this book is a genuine page turner. Glynn is at the top of her game with engaging characters, original prose and a great plot. Read it... It won't disappoint.
4	1370822400	really engaging and clever story mostly, was a bit too far fetched but still enjoyable..unsatisfying ending I thought but others may be fine with it
4	1370822400	Very entertaining. Finished in record time. First person shooter has a new meaning. I'll get my wife to read it next.
2	1370822400	The strangest story I have ever read. The plot is a good one if predictable. I knew where it was going from an early stage, it really is pretty obvious, and was drawn in to see how it would unfold. However, it was long drawn out and descends into the ridiculous. The build of evidence, the degree of insane obsession, and the general overload in manipulation all just sent me shaking my head. As for the ending, well many have slated that and I am with them. Shades of Misery. Overall don't go there. Its disturbing and frustrating. I have to wonder where it came from.
5	1370736000	Really enjoyed the pace of the book and the fact we were kept guessing. Would recommend for an excellent holiday read
2	1370736000	Started strong, good premise but rapidly degenerated into artless, contrived and clunky. Too much exposition and explanation for the intelligent reader. Definitely overrated.
4	1370649600	A dark story about a relationship that has fallen apart. But who is the saint and who is the sinner? Gillian Flynn is an accomplished wordsmith who has crafted this mystery and suspense story with an admirable attention to plot and to detail. Having said that, if you like every aspect of a mystery to stand up to critical analysis, you may need to suspend your analytical tendencies as regards the robustness of some parts of the resolution of the story.I stayed up for five hours last night to finish it, so it qualifies as a page turner on my scale. You know from the outset that Flynn is playing with your expectations, yet she still surprises you at (almost) every turn.The story is told in alternating chapters from the POV of Nick, the husband, and Amy, the wife. A golden couple that have fallen, it seems, on hard times. The focus of the story is Amy's sudden and unexplained disappearance, with signs of foul play that point unerringly at Nick. But is Amy dead, and is Nick really a killer?I loved the book; my only suggestion to Mrs Flynn would be that she draws out the denouement. The book could, and in my opinion should, have ended earlier and more dramatically. Maybe she has a sequel in mind...
5	1370649600	Twists and turns all over the place. It kept me page turning into the night. I could read it again.
4	1370563200	Read this on holidays it was a great read but a little predictable and the ending a little far fetched
3	1370390400	The story started really well and found that I couldn't put it down until I got to a certain point. Was reading it at the same time as a friend and she finished it a day before me and she willed me to finish it to discuss. The first 80% of the book was riveting but how it finished it really disappointed me. Despite this I might give the author another chance as the majority of the book and the initial plot was very well constructed. One couldn't guess the ending but I certainly found that the ending let down the book. It was almost like she had gotten tired of the intrigue and gave it some sort of an ending just to get rid of the manuscript.
5	1370304000	Gillian Flynn's latest novel Gone Girl was a gripping psychological roller coaster from start to finish. A cleverly crafted profile of narcissistic obsession and entanglement. You need to set aside a weekend because you won't be able to put this book down. Brilliant!
3	1370304000	The book starts well but as the plot unravels one starts to lose interest. The end is not so satisfying.
5	1370304000	It took me 2 days to figure out if I like that book or not and on the end I decided to change my ratting from 3* to 5*. I really enjoy reading it and can ensure you that you can not predict how this story will end up.
5	1370217600	I read this book in three sittings as I hated to put it down.  At first it seems straight forward; a woman goes missing and her frantic husband calls the police. After that there is a roller coaster ride when everyone reveals themselves to be entirely different from they had first seemed. There are a lot of themes in this book but that would give away the story line. Read it and I'd love to discuss it with other readers!
3	1370131200	It is certainly a different story line but very long and I had to keep reading to see how the author would finish the novel. It's quite clever how she put the novel together but it is a bit of an epic tale. For me its was a bit long and I found the characterst annoying and not very likeable. I concluded they deserved one another.
4	1370131200	This book was very well written. The author kept you on your toes throughout! It had very unusual twists. I particularly liked the end. It definitely was a different take on the psychological novel!!
3	1370131200	This book was okay, nothing great, wouldn't encourage me to read any more of the authors books. The ending was useless also.
3	1370044800	Too much on characters and too little on plot.  Very difficult to get into and only became interesting halfway through.
5	1370044800	A slow, unassuming beginning careering into a white-knuckled, butt-clenching ride and a comforting, yet uneasy landing that makes you yearn to go back to the beginning.
5	1370044800	I loved this book. It was clever and surprising. I am looking forward to reading Gillian's other books and she is now on my favourite authors list.
5	1370044800	What a thriller!  I really enjoyed reading this book, and trying to figure out what was really going on when you got different stories from each person.  Kept me interested until the very end.
4	1370044800	Generally well constructed to keep you guessing, firstly about what happened then about what's going to happen. I liked the fact that the police weren't depicted as either stupid or super human powers of detection. There were a couple of inconsistencies early on that I suppose we could put down to the main character having a vivid imagination if it wasn't for the fact they were key to where the author wanted to take us. That makes them the equivalent of a co-incidence a poor writer uses to get out of a plot hole - either that or the character has psychic powers!
5	1369958400	This book is the truest depiction of a sociopath that i have ever come across in fiction. Be prepared to read throughout the night
5	1369785600	This book was brilliant, little bit slow to start with and then it just got better and better.I was totally blown away as to how  a person can write a story that shows how both men and women can be manipulated  in a relationship by first love and then fear.Reminded me of a Susan Sloan book i read years ago called An Isolated Incident.
4	1369785600	Well written, exciting book - love the way the plot turns - just when the reader is starting to think everything seemed a little predictable and slow .. recommended.
3	1369785600	I found this book just okay - disappointed as having heard a lot about it prior to reading was expecting a much better read.B Murray
4	1369785600	Book Club read. I enjoyed reading this because the characters turn out to have many layers to their personalities. The twists and turns are unexpected, the planned out detail for any future outcome is clever.
5	1369785600	This was really hard to put down.i dont normally read these types of books, but the characters were really interesting
5	1369785600	The author seems to understand very well how men and women think.  The many twists and turns ofthe plot make this book addictive - one just cannot wait to find out what's nextI was a teeny bit disappointed with the ending, but a Five Star book it definitely is
5	1369699200	From the beginning, this book is a gripping and thrilling read. Entirely unpredicatable with some very clever twists. One of the best books I've read in a while!
4	1369699200	this is a fast paced book with gripping story.  I found the ending a bit disappointing. Good light holiday reading.
5	1369699200	Just when you think you have it figured out, it changes and then it does again. Keeps you in suspense until the end, well worth the read.
4	1369612800	This story was great but the end was a huge anti-climax for me. First half of the book portrayed two characters, one sensitive and loving, the other weak and pathetic. Second half we saw two very different characters emerging. The plot was ingenious, could not have guessed anything that was going to happen next and just couldn't put the book down. Unfortunately once Desi re-appeared on the scene it  began to get a bit unrealistic.  By the last few chapters I was realising the ending was not going to tie up any loose ends and I felt a bit like the character Go who was crying and saying &#34;It's not meant to be like this&#34;. Most of the book was about one character masquerading as something they were not but by the end both characters were playing that game and it was a bit like watching actors in a play. I was disappointed that someone who could write such a great book could end it so pathetically. It's was like she suddenly got tired of writing and had to finish it off in a hurry.
4	1369526400	Good read - recommend to other book clubs.  Will watch out for others by this author. Also enjoyed the Nicci Frenc (Freda Klein series)
3	1369526400	Gripping thriller , reasonably well written , dissapointing ending and was not thought provoking .good book for a long train or plane trip
5	1369526400	I liked this book very much.  It's well written around a simple plot with a great deal of detail and colmplex execution.
4	1369526400	I really enjoyed reading Gone Girl. The story flows, the characters are interesting and there is an element of suspense which works well. My only reservation relates to the ending which lacks credibility and was disappointing.
5	1369440000	This is one of the best books I have ever read. Really different story line that gets you in so you want more and more. Loved the characters and the story is great and complex and not predictable at all. Makes you want to read anything this author writes. Loved it!!
5	1369440000	This story twists and turns every few pages,All characters well defined and believable.Keeps you guessing right to the end.
5	1369440000	I read her last year&#8217;s great success Gone Girl first, and I&#8217;ve been tracing her backward. I&#8217;ve done Dark Places, now in the middle of Sharp Objects. Gone Girl is her best so far. This is the most sophisticated one and highly entertaining. But her compelling storytelling talent is obvious from the first, Sharp Objects. You can see her signature.
4	1369440000	I too very much enjoyed this book though am not sure I liked how it all came together at the end... I love books that keep me wanting to read when I'm not and this fit the bill but the ending was disappointing... though having said that, not sure what ending I might have been happy with...  Still, it's a good read and would recommend... just may need to find me a book club so can discuss the ending with others!Also - did I notice a typo on my Kindle - Dopey vs Money?
4	1369267200	First the book was predictable.  I figured out pretty soon she had not been murdered. I was surprisingly sad that Greta and Jeff stole her money.  I actually felt sorry for Amy.  At the end of the novel, my thoughts ....  &#34;These two people, especially Nick are absolutely ..... up&#34;.  Amy has an excuse, she is mad.  Nick is quite sane and making crappy unsafe decisions.
2	1369267200	This is the first book I have read by Gillian Flynn and found it a hard read as the story kept swaping between Nick and Amys version of what happend, several times I was going to give up but I persisted hoping it would get better. Just when you think its getting interesting its the end and I have to say its the crappiest ending I have ever read. Maybe there is or will be a sequel to finish it!
5	1369180800	Brilliant read keeps you guessing all through couldn't put it down real page turner, if you like thrillers this is the book for you!
5	1369180800	Impossible to let down. Well written. Gripping. AND the story stays tight until the end (which is oh so rare in this genre, with this much of adrenaline going on throughout the story)If you miss the feeling picking a book and spending the night reading it because you can't stop until you're done, Gone Girl is waiting for you. Read it last week and have recommended it to over 10 people since. It's a no-brainer.
3	1369180800	I now know why I read so little fiction and stick mainly to non-fiction.Long, drawn out and goes no where for the first half of the book.  The ending is completely ridiculous and I'm surprised she found someone to publish this book with such a poor culmination of this story. Some parts were cleverly thought out and I will give the author her dues for that, but on the whole it was a waste of my time and money!
4	1369180800	I would recommend this book as an ideal holiday read. It's not too demanding and, once you get engrossed in it, you will stay with it to the end. Unfortunately I really didn't like the main two characters. They are both thoroughly unpleasant. You can get this book covered in suncream and sand and once you have finished it you definitely won't bother bringing it home. But you will finish it, just to find out what happens and how the author will resolve the convoluted plot.
4	1368921600	Loved, loved, loved the writing in this cleverly composed book. Raised on cop shows and a diet of Disney I wanted my fairy tale ending, with the villain getting their just desserts. It mostly delivered, despite my initial shock I found I reflected about life in general and found it fairly true to. Despite being denied access to my expectations I totally rate this novel for its smart character construction, the journey the reader goes on with the 'protagonist'( have to use the term loosely, there are no heroes here). Enjoy!
5	1368921600	I read this while on holiday and it's a mark of the plotting and writing that I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel room so I could keep going. It's got an excellent, tense plot and two characters that you oscillate between liking and hating, feeling sympathy for, and feeling they are getting what they deserve. Really well-written and I can't wait to read more of this author's work.
5	1368748800	I was specifically looking for a &#34;book club&#34; book so I did some online research and Gone Girl kept coming up. I took a punt...and was not disappointed! A very contemporary dramatic thriller, Gone Girl ticks a lot of boxes for me. The two main flawed characters draw you in. Does contain swearing though, just saying, in case anyone is easily offended.
5	1368576000	this story is twisted in all manners. The players/plot/extras are all drawn into a complex web of lies and avoidance. excellent read
4	1368576000	ReviewI enjoyed reading Gone Girl because I've never read anything like it before. The narrators cant be trusted - but you realise this only at the end.
1	1368489600	I was really looking forward to a good thriller, after it getting massive reviews in the papers as well!! I don t know what ye are reading but this particular read was dreadful! Very badly written! Almost amateur!!!
5	1368489600	This is the first book that I have read by Gillian Flynn but have subsequently bought her other two books. She is the master of the sick mind and twist in the tail, you can't believe that there could be people out there that are like the characters in her books.
5	1368489600	This is one excellent read. Gillian Flynn is a very clever author.  I loved how the story was wrote from the perspective of both the main characters and right up to the end I was guessing the outcome.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book.  Excellent.
4	1368489600	This book has quite a few controversial reviews. I found it brilliant! The ending is perfect, if you look at the deeper meaning! The book was highly recommended to me, and at first I couldn't say why. But then, as they say, the plot thickened, and I couldn't put it down. Interesting read to say the least!
4	1368489600	this book was a good read and kept me guessing, enjoyed it to the end. would definitely recommend it to friends and family
5	1368489600	This book kept you reading, wanting to find out more. Alot of twists in there that kept you guessing. Not a book I would of normally read, but so glad i did. You will enjoy this book.
4	1368489600	I was not overly impressed with the ending but I was engorssed for the whole time reading the story and enjoyed it so much I have now downloaded another of Gillian Flynn's books.
5	1368403200	Really enjoyed the book.  THought the plot amazing and really had you thinking until the last page, which came as a surprise. A thriller with a difference as not your usual &#34;who done it&#34;.
5	1368403200	This is a must . brilliant and it grips you from start to finish. I AM NOW DOWNLOADING ANY BOOKS FROM THIS WONDERFUL AUTHOR
3	1368316800	This book has some great twists and turns. Gets a little slow in places but all and all a decent read... Give it a go.
5	1368316800	Loved this book! Couldn't stop reading, its a big page turner! The ending did disappoint but brilliant storyline, great characters and very well written. Flynn's best book by far.
4	1368230400	Love the twists and turns in this book, never a dull moment, the book gripped me until the last page
5	1368230400	Really enjoyed this book kept me turning the pages, very good story, liked the way it ended too, you wanted it to keep going to find out what was going to happen next!!
5	1368230400	Leaves you thinking right to the very end, lots of twists and turns where you don't know what it going to happen next.
5	1368144000	Great book, the best that I have read in a long time, kept me guessing right to the end. I couldn't put it down!
1	1368144000	The two people at the centre of this story of deceit are both Horrible and deserve each other.There is an absence of morality which is disturbing .I do not enjoy reading about such unredeemed nastiness
4	1368144000	A girl and boy marry, live a typical fun life, but when they become unemployed,and move to the boys home town, their personalities change and live becomes mayhem.Crazy people doing crazy things. A slow start, but then the thriller part starts!! A good read
4	1368144000	Very good. A fascinating plot and good characterisation. My only criticism is that the style of writing was sometimes strange
1	1368057600	A waste if your time if you read it.  Unbelievable characters especially Amy.  Poorly written, dumb ending, so save yourself time by not bothering to read it.  If you are sceptical about my opinion of the book, scroll towards the end of Amazons reviews, where Amazon have conviently put the many one star reviews.I also surmise that the number of reviews (1,500 approx) indicates how many people are angry they wasted their hard earned money on such trash.  Gillian, you should not be proud of this one.
4	1368057600	I had read some mixed reviews about this book, and must say, that I am glad that I don't usually pay too much attention to reviews...This book is addictive, to the point that I was hiding my kindle under paperwork on my desk at work just so that I could keep reading...I thought that I had the plot picked pretty early in the piece, it became apparent pretty quick, that while I was somewhat right, I was also very wrong in where this story was headed!!!
3	1367798400	An interesting story with lots of twists & turns, quite dark & disturbing at times, finished it, but wouldn't recommend it or read it again.
5	1367798400	So enjoyable with such a twist. Could not put the book down.A book for everyone. I will certainly read more from this author
5	1367798400	A truly well written thriller.  I came into it without knowing much of the story, so I was I really taken aback by the twists and turns.  It is well crafted, the characters are believable and the voices well executed.  It surely made me pass the time, all of the few it took me to read it.  I just could not put it down.  A great read.
3	1367625600	I spent quite a bit of time feeling a disconnect between the story I thought was happening- and the story I was reading.Clever 'twist' - not sure if I woudl read it again.
5	1367625600	Gillian Flynn captivates her audience with her fascinating ability to weave polt and situations to a whole new level. The best novel I have read in a very long time
2	1367539200	Very disappointed with this book could not make head or tails with the story and just seemed to go on about nothing with a stupid ending.  Would not recommend this book to anyone
3	1367539200	Very good topic, and well explored, but I was very disappointed with the ending.  It stumbled to the finish.  I kept thinking it was the end and then there was more and a bit more.
2	1367539200	The end is bad...so bad. I was happy until the third part of the book, after that chapter I think the book became in a bad book.
4	1367452800	Frustrating at times but great tale of  twists and turns ,hard to like the characters but feel I got to know them well
5	1367452800	WOW! Once you think you have these characters all figured out - they take you by surprise...I truly recommend this one :)
5	1367366400	I was sucked in straight away...I love books like this that you stay up until 2am reading even though the alarm clock is set for 6am!! Written fantastically, with such depth of character and story line!! I didn't want it to end!
4	1367280000	Easy read, actually found it hard to put down at times. A great book to relax and unwind, no thinking required. Some great twists.
4	1367280000	A little slow and self-indulgent at first, then the big whammy. The prose was more entertaining than rivetting for a thriller.  The bi-narrative was refreshing and kept the story rolling like a great swell that we hoped was pushing to a crashing break.  For me it never came, but I felt better for reading this book.  This deserves a sequel, firstly because the story demands it, and secondly, because I want more.
4	1367280000	The writer does a good job of making the reader interested in two fairly unlikeable people.  Great character portrayal and enough twists to make you question the conclusions you've already reached.  Setting of a decaying American town also convincing.  But don't read the book if you're feeling depressed about relationships in general - it's a very cynical read!!!
2	1367193600	I try to avoid reading bestsellers because I get disappointed most of the times. I give the author some credit for the way she decided to narrate the story, showing us Nick's and Amy's point of views throughout the story.However, I think the there were so many things in the book that sounded as copies to me. The case of Amy's parents writing a series of books about their daughter and becoming famous, for example, is just like the case of Brenda's parents in the series Six Feet Under. Moreover, Nick's sister is just like Debra Morgan, Dexter Morgan's sister, these two characters are very similar.I also didn't like Nick, I thought he is too plain, pathetic and hen-pecked. He is apathetic, doesn't have any attitude towards the things that happen during the book. What really got me was the lack of punishment in the story, it seems the police didn't really care, didn't really investigate the crimes in the story.And to finish, I just hated the end. The book started well, it had a good climax torwards the end, but then it seems the author lost the train of thought at the end of story. The end of the book is really frustating, disappointing and nonsense.
4	1367107200	This is a fantastic read and for anyone that's likes suspense thrillers with plenty of twists this is the book for you. It is written in a different style with flash backs from the primary characters that will leave you guessing until the very end. A great read
5	1367107200	One of the best books I have read recently. Kept me spellbound until the end - and I very much enjoy Gillian Flynn's style of writing.Fantastic  !!!
4	1367020800	The phrase 'God made them and matched them' comes to mind.  They each tell their story so sympathetically that your emotions about the other swing between extremes.At the end you cease to have any sympathy except for their unfortunate expected baby.  Your feeling is, &#34;God, don't they deserve one another!&#34;The story-telling is very clever and the convolutions of the narrative keep you on the edge of your chair.I'm old-fashioned enough to want the good to win out.  But there aren't any good people so you are left with a jaded feeling of having spent too much of your precious time involved with these nasty people.
5	1367020800	I love Gillian's writing.  This book keeps you on the edge.  She certainly has done her research on Borderline Personalities, and writes with great insight.  I am now reading her other books.  Wonderful  writer.
4	1366848000	Anyone who loves a great innovative thriller. Kept me gasping whole way through. Loved it.Anything else by this author?
4	1366848000	Amy Dunne disappears on her fifth wedding anniversary. Naturally the police suspect her husband, Nick of being involved. Both Nick and Amy are very convincing liars. He is also a cheat and Amy is a manipulative, narcissistic sociopath. Neither of them are very likeable. This is a dark, fast paced thriller except for the ending. The book just petered out to an unsatisfactory finish. That said I did enjoy it. It is full of plenty of twists and turns and I am looking forward to reading this authors's other novels.
5	1366848000	From start to finish I read this book in one day I could not put it down I was reading it while cooking dinner while eating it I just wanted to know what happen this is one of the best books I have ever read
5	1366761600	Excellent read. The suspense builds very expertly and I found it to be a page page turner. It is very well written and gripping and I have no problem recommending it to others
5	1366761600	I loved this book, very hard to put down.  The writer is very clever the way she feeds you the characters personalities.Just when you think you have grasped who they are, they begin to change.  I have not read anything quite like it before.  I am quite good at guessing outcomes but not with this book.  I have not enjoyed a book this much since I read &#34;before I go to sleep&#34; by s.j watson.
1	1366761600	Thought it had potential to be a great story but it ended so badly I regretted even reading it ... Worst book I've read in a while !
5	1366761600	A deliciously clever read that teaches you just how little you know a person. My favourite book of 2012. I cant wait for what she does next.
4	1366761600	An unusual and un-put-downable book.  Took me by surprise and then kept me enthralled throughout.  I never knew what was coming next.  Loved it except for the end. I didn't really get it so I found it disappointing.  It may work if the author writes a sequel.
4	1366675200	I really enjoyed this book. Very clever characterisations which keep you guessing on the 'who dunnit' all the way through. Lots of twists and turns that are unexpected and very clever plot that isn't so complicated you lose the plot. Would highly recommend
3	1366588800	The book started off great, but became predictable. Worth a read though although it seemed to drag on at times.
4	1366502400	It was a really good read with lots of twists and turns along the way which are unexpected, including the ending.
5	1366502400	one of my favourite books I've read for a long time. I was obsessed by it. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it. It was the first thing I thought about when i woke up in the morning. I had to have a break from reading after I finished it because it was so intense and so awesome. Didn't like the ending, just because it wasn't what I wanted to happen, but it's still amazeballs.
4	1366502400	The story is told by two different perspectives, that makes it really interesting. Didn't love the ending but it is a book that entertains.
4	1366502400	I liked it  very much. It is recomendable for a n enjoy reading. I will read it again!!!!  Great writing.
5	1366416000	I could not put this book down.  With tricks and plot turns that have the most synical of readers gasping with shock.  Totally gripping.  This had me hugging my husband and thanking God we are so normal!
5	1366416000	This book explores what the consequences are of being a criminal in a connected world. I can't wait to see the movie.
2	1366416000	While suspenseful in sections and with a constantly twisting plot, the main characters are not likeable and you become even more estranged from them as the novel progresses.
3	1366329600	A really engrossing first half of the book, but the writer plays all the story's cards too early and the momentum completely dissolves once the major twists are revealed and never quite recovers.  A clever premise but the ending was completely preposterous!
3	1366329600	I liked it until I knew they would get back together again and then I found it disappointing as I really did not like the character of the female in the story.
2	1366329600	I thought Gone Girl was poorly written and found both main characters to be weak and rather unlikeable. I think they deserved each other. I found the narration by each protagonist  taking turns, rather annoying though I have enjoyed this technique in other books. The ending was also quite unrealistic. A.E
4	1366243200	I was a bit surprised by the ending- it certainly made me think and is a change from the typical American fairytale ending
4	1366243200	I was recommended Gone Girl by a friend, and after seeing multiple people reading this book on the tube I decided I would have to purchase it.Gone Girl was a gripping read that had you intrigued the whole way along. The author is very clever and it is evident she knew every element of her Book, it felt very well thought out.I loved the characters and particularly enjoyed reading Amy's diary, a very smart woman indeed!Defintely worth reading but perhaps not overly memorable.
3	1366243200	I had heard rave reviews about this book. I kept waiting for it to enthrall me. Good plot a little dull.
4	1366156800	Definitely not what I was expecting. Full of riveting twists and turns that keep you reading and reading. Can relationships really be this toxic? Is there some of this in all of us?
5	1366156800	Loved it, all the twists, I kept trying to figure it out and my theories would be shot down, but great read.
5	1366156800	An intriguing story about how the human mind can have so many ways of seeing things.  Lots of twists and turns.
1	1366070400	Half way through I thought .. I'm hooked please don't end badly.. every part of this page turner gave promise to a brilliant end and not an obvious end cause there were so many ways it could of gone... I even thought oh there must be a follow up book.... is there?????? No just a bad bad end.. what a pity :(
4	1365984000	Almost concurrent stories of Amy and Nick.The police think that Amy has been murdered and possibly by her husband - but has she or has she YET.A great read, full of unexpected twists and turns.
5	1365897600	Loved the clarity of writing and story was fast paced - enjoyed every minute of the book.  Is there a sequel in there somewhere and certainly a  movie.
4	1365897600	It very good would get a book again from her. Its exciting and it would keep you thinking the whole way through the book.
4	1365897600	Quickly draws you into this engrossing story and keep me guessing until the end -  a few too many leaps of faith for me though  - I  think the ending is impausible
3	1365897600	The plot became somewhat predictable and contrived, so that it was hard to believe in the characters, and the extremes of the wife's plotting everything down to the last detail.
4	1365897600	It took my so long to get hooked into this book...but I did....eventually. I felt it could be abbreviated a bit earlier on to keep the momentum going.
4	1365811200	I loved the author's writing style. She knows how to lay on the suspense. I loved the twists as well. However, after being possessed by this novel over a few days, the ending was a huge anticlimax. I thought the last few chapters were way unrealistic. Maybe I missed character traits early on that would explain this. A great read though for those who enjoy thrills. It will get under your skin.
2	1365811200	Some What One Dimensional:I found the charters to be shallow and the story to be drawn out with too much attempt to build interesting personalities. They were just not that believable, really &#8220;amazing Amy&#8221; and &#8220;perfect Nick&#8221;, they were both far from it, what they were, egotistical and neurotic!  I just could not buy it as this was label as a thriller! Good thing I had time to spare for reading this month.
4	1365724800	Clever plotting and sharp well observed prose. Acerbic style did get somewhat wearisome toward the end by which point I was beginning to lose interest in the characters
1	1365724800	Excruciatingly awful to read, completely unbelievable characters. I couldn't finish it it was too terrible..... From the other reviews I'm glad I didn't waste any more time reading this.
1	1365724800	An oft used adage is if you are not captivated in the first 45 pages then forget it. 90 pages on I was still very bored with the back and forth opinions of trivia,and this is noted as a thriller?
2	1365724800	I read this book because it was up to win a prize against Hilary Mantel- a writer whom I admire very much. I also like mysteries and murders. 'Gone Girl' is a fast, frightening ride and the prose style is clever, witty and original. It appeals to female anxieties on many levels so has compelling themes to drive the plot. Because the story is told from the opposing points of the two protagonists and some of these are later revealed to be fictional constructs, it has more twists and turns than an edge of your seat thriller. I wanted to like this... I really did, but could not empathise with the main characters who were narcissistic, childish and cruel. The reasons for their weaknesses were not adequately backed up in the story and the ending was unsatisfying. Why is it that we want to believe that underneath every pretty girl lurks a bunny boiler?  I think Flynn is a talent and I am happy for her success... let's hope she has the opportunity to use her powers for good. This isn't.
5	1365638400	Gillian Flynn is definitively a breath of fresh air. Even though I am not totally satisfied with the ending, I have given it five stars because of her likeable lingo, her great storybuilding and highly believable characters (sic! - you need to read to the book to understand that reference...).
5	1365465600	Excellent thriller. I read it in only 3 days! Could not put it down. Very well resolved at the end. 100% recommended!
4	1365465600	Really enjoyed this thriller, particularly the different twists and turns the story kept taking. The characters really come to life.  I thought the ending was disappointing.
5	1365465600	Brilliantly written with so many twists and turns. Keeps you on the edge of your seat with fantasically unlikeable main characters! this is definitely a 'must read'. Depicts the ugliest parts of the human psyche and yet we are rooting for one of these people by the end. a real psychological drama. Concentrate hard as you read though because there are so many small yet important details. Don't want to give away too much of the story but begins with a husband discovering the disappearance of his wife but this is so much more than a 'whodunnit'. By the end we do not know who is good and who is evil. Can't wait to read this author's other works
5	1365465600	What an awesome book - just wanted to keep reading. So many unexpected twists and turns and had a love hate relationship with the 2 main characters. Would never have picked the ending.  Highly recommend.
4	1365465600	A great story with a twist or two.It keeps the readers interest the whole way through although I was slightly disappointed with the end.
5	1365465600	Thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I found the ending slightly disappointing. I loved the way the author switched from the man's to the woman's voice in alternating chapters and how she used this device in the first half to alternate between the present (man's voice) and the past (woman's diary).She cleverly moved our sympathies from one to the other as the story progressed
3	1365465600	Very well written - I had to read to the end but it seemed to be about two people both with &#34;issues&#34;.  It left a nasty taste in my mouth.
5	1365465600	There`s no shortage of crime/thriller novels in Norway where I live, in the matter of fact, after the success of Nesb and others, it`s pretty much what everybody write nowadays.Honestly, there`s a limit to how many alcoholic/outsider cop/detectives I can take, chasing psycopathic, perverted murderers around, in this dark and cold socialdemocratic country of ours(or Sweden). But after reading a glorious review by author Ingvar Ambjrnsen, whose praise do not come easily, I decided to give it a go.When I got started I couldn`t put it down, and read it through in one haul.It`s clever structure, richness in detail, and comment on a wide variety of topics of everyday life, childhood, marriage, financial crisis and more place Mrs Flynn up there with the best authors of crime Scandinavia has to offer.I have read some criticism on Gone Girls ending, but I think it`s great, and makes for an even more chillng read.I look forward to read whatever Mrs.Flynn is up to next.
5	1365465600	Believe the hype people, this book is brilliant - it has more turns than a food processor! I give it two thumbs up, three if I had three thumbs.
3	1365465600	clever story line, some well described characters.The story  twisted and turned within the format of the novel which incidently did not lend itself to Kindle comfort. I felt it ran out of steam in a predictable way at the end.
5	1365465600	Best I've read in ages..!  Have immediately downloaded Gillian Flynn's two earlier novels - gotta love Amazon Kindel for making it too easy to read great books..!
5	1365465600	Wonderful read for those who like murder mysteries.This is the first book I have read from this author and I just couldn't put it down.It was so cleverly crafted that  I had no idea even  in the last few pages how it was going to  turn out .The main characters take it in turns to give their account of events right through the book  which was an effective technique in leading the reader up many dead ends.Enjoy
3	1365465600	We're a group of Champagne sippers and book reviewers! We were divided on our scoring but generally enjoyed the 'page turning' story. I was disappointed with all the hype about the book and watching the continued 'top' ranking - I was expecting more and unlike my fellow reviewers guessed the twists in the tale. Lots of 7/10s, a 5 from me and a sad 2/10 - the flip-flop character chapters were annoying. Sadly no-one liked the ending. The big discussion - who would play Amy & Nick in the Movie?
5	1365379200	Flynn does an excellent job of changing the narrative each chapter to keep you reading. A classic mystery thriller romance
4	1365292800	This is quite a lot more than your usual whoddunit. It's more of a &#34;whydoneit.&#34; It's consistently intelligent and well written, and perfectly paced, with welcome dashes of humour. I found some psychological  implausibilities and a few characters I would rather have seen a bit more of towards the end -the twin sister I think, is left thematically stranded, maybe because a second part has been planned and strands needed to be left hanging? In any case, you won't regret giving it a go. Love turns to hate, brilliance turns nasty, charming turns sinister... It's a lot of fun!
4	1365292800	Full of intrigue and very gripping. A book that's very hard to put down. Very cleverly written. Recommended to all but may appeal more to females
5	1365120000	This was one of those books that can be hard to put down - wanted to keep reading which I did when I could.Great characters with plenty of psychological twists. Very cleverly written.
1	1365033600	I found this book to be long winded and both far fetched and predictable.It dragged on and on and the ending was dreadful. Give your readers a bit more substance.
4	1365033600	Really enjoyed the book, a good read with unexpected turns. Will be looking for more Gillian Flynn books in future.
4	1365033600	An intense and frightening insight into the mind of a woman scorned. The story will grip you until the very last page.
3	1365033600	I found the book quite boring, at least the in first half. The story is stretched out far to thin.
4	1364947200	Kept me riveted until the last page and then ....  I am still dwelling on Nick and Amy and where they are now. I sometimes wonder if they are so very different from any other couple.
4	1364947200	Kept me intrigued for most of the book but lost me toward the end. It became a bit unreal at the end.
5	1364947200	The book was published in Norwegian recently and got very good reviews,so i ordered it from You to read it in The original language
5	1364947200	This book was simply great fun and intriguing.The plot is original and interesting. It twists and turns in both predictable and unpredictable directions.Well written, got me hooked from the very beginning.I'd higly recomend this if you're looking for a crime novel that challenges the genare (a bit).
3	1364860800	This was an interesting book that delves deep into the psyche of the two main characters. I did struggle to like either one to be honest but it did keep my interest and it was an easy read.
3	1364860800	I found it disjointed and I did not like the theme. While I like thrillers this one did not keep me engaged.
3	1364860800	I was ready to give this four stars and recommend it to all my friends, but I was so disappointed by the ending.  It was a huge anticlimax that was neither here nor there.  Very disappointing.
4	1364774400	Great page turner, love the twists and complex plot - although the ending is very frustrating! Would recommend to others.
3	1364774400	I'm not too keen on books that are written in 2 different accounts of the story.The ending was a disappointment.
5	1364774400	It is written in such a different way,so it does grab your attention.It is written from the husband's perspective and from the Gone Girls point of view also. So the mystery unfolds,is she gone and what had happened.It is all there . I loved it .
5	1364688000	One of the best murder mystery plots ever! I loved the way Gillian Flynn writes - she get's your interest entirely
4	1364688000	Very slow to start, but don't give up it is worth it. lots of twists that you do not see coming
4	1364688000	It was not the best book of the year but it was a good reflection of American life.  I guess you could  call it a light read.
5	1364688000	The plot was well crafted and kept me guessing, but the best part was the character development which managed to capture and portray an extreme version of modern marriage extremely well.  I haven't read any more of Flynn's work but I now plan to.
5	1364688000	The best book I have read in a long time. Possibly ever? I read a lot of books. All types of books. None of them as good as this.
3	1364515200	It took me  two or three chapters  to tune into the &#34;voice&#34; Very Gen Y.I was then intrigued. By the end of the book I wished she had had a better editor and also ended it better.A few unbelievable &#34;holes&#34; in the plot but overall quite a good read. Bet there is a sequel coming.
5	1364428800	Gillian Flynn is a true master of mystery. This book keeps you wondering until the very end. Full of unexpected twists and turns. Loved it!
4	1364428800	I read this book because it is on New York Times bestseller list and had good reviews on amazon.com. I did like it. The format chosen by the author of writing a chapter each in first person by the leading man and the woman characters made interesting reading.The story line was good and held my interest till the end. In fact it is written as a thriller and it is intense and gripping. Hard to put it down. However, there were some parts and events which looked unlikely and for the same reason, I did not like the ending.It ended like in a movie. Still I will recommend it to any one who is looking for a good ,interesting book of fiction.Shyam Suri, India
4	1364428800	I enjoyed this book as the story line twists and turns with your emotions as the characters develop. Trying to work out what had happened, I enjoyed it to the last page.
4	1364428800	Great book, interesting twists and turns.  unexpected happenings throughout the book.  Well written by an author I have never heard of.  Look forward to next book
4	1364428800	This book was great! It started off a bit slow but not boring - kept me on the edch of my seat and ended with such a twist!
4	1364342400	This book has rceived much publicity about the story of a female lead, who by the end of the story, appears to be quite disordered. I felt what ws done well in this novel, was the authors ability for the couple to appear similar to any couple that you may come across in day to day interactions, however the old addage of 'you never know what happens behind closed dorrs' resonates very loud and clear. The male character i found I did not have much time for and ultimately he ws a pawn in his wife's dangrous and deadly game. I know many people hated the ending, however for me it was only fitting, tha two people of such narcissistic qualities would want to create something that would love them without question, even for a little while......
5	1364342400	Very enjoyable book but didn't like the ending . You want justice and not capitulation at the end but it doesn't always work like that.
5	1364169600	Great book, such twists and turns! It has provoked much discussion - everyone who read it enjoyed it, and has recommended it
5	1364169600	I haven't enjoyed so much a book in a long time. It's very well written, the story grabs you since the beginning, it never stops amazing you, it's one of those books you will like to continue reading!!
2	1364169600	I was expecting more suspense and suspected the outcome quite early on and was a little disappointed that I was right. Not really the thriller of the year for me.
3	1364169600	i thought the beginning was very poorly written.  The story was strange, I got bored with it and fed up with the characters.
5	1364083200	Gone girl is an imaginative thrill seeker with ideas that capture the mind and make you think twice about what happens when relationships fizzle out.
5	1364083200	I never knew what was coming next with this book, kept me in suspense right until the end of the book....
3	1364083200	Whilst the book kept my interest throughout, being quite a page-turner, I felt a bit disappointed and unnerved by the ending.
3	1364083200	This book is a missing persons drama intertwined with a commentary on the marriage of the main characters.The introduction outlines the characters well, and sets the scene for the missing person. As the book progressed, I found it difficult to like the characters and therefore lost interest. I finished the book, but was left pondering the amount of narcissism and selfishness of the characters. I felt the the tightly constructed writing lost its way at a bit past the halfway point. Interesting, but three stars only for me.
4	1363996800	I found the story very enjoyable until three quarters through as it kept the pace and then I felt the story line fell off.
5	1363996800	A great author, luv her style of writing captivating maintains your interest throughout the book have purchased three more of her books not disappointed yet.
1	1363910400	A horrible story line with detestable characters, everyone in my book club hated it and would not recommend it to anyone
3	1363824000	Took me about 3 chapters to get into it - nearly put it down as a 'not for me book'.  However, persisted and after getting into it found it to be a 'cannot put it down' book - curious to find out what the real truth was in the story.  Then I found the ending to be a bit dissapointing/believable. Enjoyed it, but would I recommend it to friends?!!!
5	1363737600	Brilliant plot!  I must say that I am sure God has gifted authors to come up with such good stories.  I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good read.
5	1363737600	WOW...... what a great book. Unbelievable how things can turn out.Just goes to show people are not what they seem........its a shame sometimes
2	1363737600	None of the characters is particularly likeable, the plot feels like it is based on too many stretches of the imagination.  I couldn't wait to get to the end just so I could stop reading it.  A shame because it started quite promisingly.
4	1363737600	Gone girl is a very well written and riveting novel, in the crime fiction mould, but offering much more. It explores interesting and sometimes challenging ideas about relationship and power. It also makes the reader question their character allegiances. The ending was a little disappointing.
4	1363651200	This book is a great read.  The reader is held in suspense and is is unlikely to guess the outcome.I found the first half of the book a lot better than the second half.  I was a bit disappointed by the ending.Nonetheless I would recommend this book, you cannot fail but to form opinions about the two main characters and not only that but to change those self same opinions as the book progresses!
5	1363651200	sooo cunning and devious, I can't imagine having to function at that level! A variety of selfish people are portrayed brilliantly
3	1363651200	This was a fast paced story. I found none of the characters admirable or likeable. Very far fetched. Kept me interested but too over the top & poor ending.
4	1363564800	Thought this was fascinating. One's perspective and loyalties to the two main characters fluctuates continually throughout the book. Guaranteed you will want to finish the book ASAP to see how it climaxed
5	1363478400	This book reminded a little of Barbara Vine's work. A psychological thriller that leaves you really wondering about human nature. While the central protagonist, Amy, can seem a little far-fetched on occasions the author manages to make her, and her relationship with Nick, quite understandable some-how. Through out the book it was easy for the reader to understand the nature of their relationship despite the extraordinary circumstances.The author changes voice effortlessly, skipping from Amy to Nick and back again with clever cross references and enough mismatches to get the reader asking questions before they are answered.I think this is a brilliant piece of writing and thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended.
4	1363392000	I think you shoud be able to give star ratings and a few words about a book wihtout further detials in order for the review to be submitted
5	1363305600	I loved this book as much for the twists and turns as I did for the psychological insights into a relationship gone wrong, and the differences between the sexes in terms of attitudes to a relationship. I'll definitely be buying all of Gillian Flynn's other books as a result.
3	1363219200	It was an intriguing story,but I was not impressed with the writing style.I thought that the ending was unsatisfying.To sum up, it did not match the hype.
5	1363219200	At last, an unpredictable story line! This book held my interest 'til the very end. Well written and intelligently planned out. This is a great read.
2	1363219200	It didn't hold my attention at all. I kept putting it down and forgetting what I had last read. Didn't finish it and wouldn't try to go back to it at all.
4	1363219200	A nice twist in the middle. I kept waiting for a double bluff or two but I guess since I carried on waiting til the very end the story managed to keep me unsure and moving with it regardless.
2	1363219200	I bought this book because I had read some excellent reviews. In my opinion the test of a good book is that you can't wait to go back to it. Very soon I realised I simply didn't WANT to go back to it. Frankly I was bored. Nevertheless I did persevere but when I was just over half way through I gave it up entirely.Frankly I thought the language was pretty foul and I take no pleasure in reading books like this when there are so many other excellent choices to be made.Many other folk obviously did enjoy the book but for me it was simply a waste of money.
5	1363219200	I loved this book, it kept me intrigued the whole way through, couldn't put it down, thoroughly recommend it and have to all
5	1363219200	I loved reading this novel. Very entertaining, clever, addictive and well written. I couldn't put it down. And I really missed the characters, after the end.
4	1363219200	I really enjoyed this novel and found it very engrossing. It was the first novel I read this year and the first on my Kindle, so it was a great start. The two sharing the narrative voice was great, and the plot was really well done. I love a good mystery and this was very different from many, making it even more enjoyable. It seems like chick lit on the surface, but is so much more. I have recommended it to many people.
4	1363219200	Really unique loved it. The story was full of plot twists and turns keeping you guessing right until the very last page.
5	1363132800	Very well written as both characters were built up. You are always guessing and not sure whose side to take and then the ending just adds a whole climax in itself. The kind of book I struggled to put down at night!
4	1363132800	Love the twists and turns.  Lost me a bit at the end because I wasn't sure how true it ran but a great entertaining read!
4	1363132800	I can't understand how anyone can make up a story as convoluted as this one, but Gillian Flynn has done just that. It is really difficult to understand what has happened and how in this story, which keeps you hooked in and reading to find out what happens.
5	1363046400	Really enjoyed this book - its a complete page turner and held my attention totally throughout.  Ending was a little disappointing but probably necessary considering the plot line.
3	1362960000	I struggled to finnish this book, it did pick up near the end though, the characters were all very unlikable so it was difficult to connect with anyone.
5	1362960000	The story was very surprising and I was engaged from the first page. At first I tought this was a ordinary love story, then it took a twist, and I could hardly do anything else before I had finished the book.
4	1362960000	I was hooked by this book from the first few pages....the ending was such a let down, I was very disappointed.
4	1362873600	Unfortunately the term 'easy read' usually denotes dross or carries an innate assumption that it will appeal to a partially brain-dead reader. I mean, though, that it's 'easy' because it scans so well: the interest factor is high, it's not a formulaic style,plus it contains both humour and sharp ideas.The humour is character driven. The male lead role has a good line in self aware and self-deprecating home truths about himself. The 'heroine' of the story, conversely, has a magic eye for deliciously scathing summations of the flaws she perceives in those around her. Very smart and presented in a manner that misleads the reader from initial assumptions as they pursue the crisp gait of the story. Sort of read a body feels lucky to kick back with
4	1362873600	Very entertaining and engaging from beginning to end. Now I am ready for more of his books. Any suggestions for me?
5	1362873600	Throughout this novel there are so many 'gasp' moments as the story unfolds its brilliant!  Such a fantastic concept and I think the ending was perfect.
5	1362787200	I Couldn't put it down The plot and the story told from both characters point with a great twist ending
3	1362787200	I was expecting a thriller that kept me guessing to the last page. Not true! A good read but I was disappointed after the rave reviews. Sure, the plot took many twists and turns, but I was left wishing that it could just be over. Maybe less would've been more?
5	1362614400	One of the best books I've read in a very long time - could not put it down! The twists and turns had me hooked from the first page.
5	1362528000	This is a great read and the archetypal page-turner!  There are implausibilities in the telling of the tale, the characters aren't that likable but you still want to know what happens next and how things pan out in the end.  The denouement is probably disappointing but maybe not illogical.  Plenty of fodder here for a book club!
5	1362528000	really enjoyed this book...not was i was expecting! I loved Amy's side of the story even though she is nuts! Nick was an interesting character as I was mixed in my opinion of him...
4	1362528000	Very surprising! Changed point of view once or twice, easy to read and makes you keep reading it until its over
5	1362441600	WOW!!  Excellent writing, fantastic storytelling. Part of me was appalled the other part had me laughing out loud [no mean feat!Writing that operates on many levels, the hollowing out of American society post financial crash, who is each individual in a marriage, who is acting for whose benefit and an absolute dissection of deviousness..... Brilliant!. Gillian  Flynn... keep writing.
3	1362355200	This book is a mystery for me. At first you think the husband is a killer! Then you are confront with a very crazy wife who plan everything! Soo she is crazy but the worst part he stays with her! I think is is too much fiction
5	1362268800	I really enjoyed this book. I bought its kindle version.It was the 1st book I have ever read from this author, and as I found it so interesting, I'm now reading another tittle from the same writer:  Sharp objects
1	1362268800	I was looking forward to reading this book; but I couldn't wait to finish it by the time I was only half-way through.  It started out okay with the author's development of the character, Amy, a spoilt, rich girl who felt she needed to put up a facade in order to be accepted by the smart set and then had difficulty keeping  up this fake persona  once she had married the man she wanted.  We then saw  her husband's discovery of this deception and his subsequent decline.  After that it all got quite ridiculous and totally unbelievable - I wasn't able to relate to any of the characters  -  the married couple were both horrible, scheming people who deserved each other.  The ending was very lame!  It was as though the author couldn't work out how to finish the story so she let them both "live happily ever after" which was really weird, seeing as the whole book was about their intense hatred for each other!  Didn't add up.  Can't recommend this one at all!
3	1362268800	Great story, bad ending. You want a little more justice and are left wanting just one more chapter, one last twist.
5	1362096000	I don't normally read thrillers but I had to read this one as I felt completely out of the loop when people kept asking me if I had read it. Glad to say it completely lived up to its reputation and was one of the most original and intriguing books I have read for a while. The story of a dysfunctional marriage Gone Girl shows us just how messed up most of us really are but don't probably show it. In this book we see the consequences of what happens when people show their true colours. There were also lots of subtle but very clever lines scattered throughout the book that made me feel that Gone Girl was much more than just a thriller, it is a social commentary. Would love to be able to write something like this myself, that appeals to everyone but is so much more than another page turner.
4	1362009600	I really enjoyed this novel.As an avid reader I'm always hoping ,the book I'm starting will be one of those delights the Un putdownable one.Story takes lots of twists and turns,keeps you entralled to the last page
4	1362009600	The book started off really well, got even better near the middle, but at the end I felt the author lost interest.  It was like the author was thinking of the next book and just decided to finish this one off as quickly as possible.  I am glad I read it though as I really enjoyed the first 85% of the book, and I do like how well the author writes.
5	1361923200	I loved this book. the twists and turns were fantastic and I admire the author for keeping you guessing right to the very end....
5	1361923200	The book moves along with great twists and turns and keeps you interested all the way to the end. The end leaves a little to be desired and there are moments when credulity is required but who cares?
3	1361836800	I couldn't wait to read this book but I have to say maybe I was expecting too much.  It was a good read but not as good as people were going on about!!
3	1361836800	This was a great story of intrigue and twists.  Kept my attention - enjoyed the escapisim.  Highly recommend this story.
4	1361750400	Yes I really enjoyed reading this book loved I the twists it kept me well engrossed. I read this book in a week and half
3	1361577600	Bought this basically because it has been on the best seller liter for so long. Waste of money, didn't care for it at all. Characters unlike able, too much back and forth of narrating characters. Just not my cup of tea......
5	1361491200	Powerful and brilliantly written. Not all in the book club loved it, although most did. All agreed it was worthy as a book club book. Lots of discussion.
5	1361491200	Really loved it, couldn`t but it down for two days. Suggest it to people who like thrillers and surprising endings :)
2	1361404800	Was a very different book and i could not get into it,it chopped and changed each paragraph from one writter to another i ended up giving up half way through
5	1361404800	I found Gone Girl well written and well paced.I wanted to keep reading because I needed to know the ending.It was interesting to read a book that was a little bit unusual and wherethe characters weren't all good or all bad.
5	1361404800	Great read, couldn't put it down. Went back and read her first two books which were also great reads. Can't wait for her next one.
5	1361404800	This book was a real page turner. It's not the kind of book I would ever dream of reading, but I really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend that you read it!
4	1361404800	This book was slow to start then was &#34;couldn't put down&#34;: but I hated the ending. It was recommended by family members and they unfortunately agree with me.
4	1361404800	Very interesting book.i thoroughly enjoyed the authors description, insight and roundness of the characters even though they were both rather cunning and not too pleasant. Some of it was implausible though, as to how far she went, mutilating herself etc.not very realistic.
5	1361318400	Twist and turns, exciting, clever.  Big surprise near the end.  I loved it. Look forward to reading more of Gillian Flynn.
4	1361145600	Brilliant! The story starts of in one direction but the tables turn half way through. Think I would have preferred a different ending, but a good read none the less :)
3	1361145600	Probably not as good as her previous books which I have not read.  I read this after reading a review.  I think it should have said to read the others first to get the most out of the book.
5	1361145600	Great thriller kept me guessing until the end.  Gripping and very well written.  I can whole heartedly recommend this boook
2	1361145600	I was disappointed in this book - the twist in the middle was ruined by the long-winded and muddled way in which the author dragged the story out. The concept and plot was strong, but the story itself was poorly constructed.
5	1361145600	This was the first book that I've read in a long time that I literally couldn't put down.Would recommend to readers who have enjoyed Mary Higgins Clark's best novels as the pace, suspense and mystery in Gone Girl reminded me a lot of her style.
3	1361059200	I had high hopes of enjoying this book but it was very disappointing, it could have been great with a better writer telling the story, it had plenty of scope to be a really good edge of your seat book, but it was predictable, and silly in places, don't waste your money on this one , a thriller with a good ending it is not
2	1361059200	Being a huge John Grisham and Lisa Gardner fan, when a friend of mine suggested this book I immediately bought it as I had just finished reading Lisa gardener's Catch Me (which is excellent, by the way). I honestly feel like I've wasted my time with this book.The beginning was somewhat interesting, but towards the end it seems as if the writer didn't know how to finish the story, where to take the characters. When I read the last sentence (which by the time I didn't know was the last sentence), I turned the page to make sure there wasn't another chapter!I don't recommend this book, unless you enjoy being left to your imagination. There are several more interesting books out there.
4	1361059200	Amy disappears on the morning of her fifth wedding anniversary and her husband Nick is soon the only suspect. Told from the viewpoint of both Amy and Nick in alternating chapters, the story unfolds as two very different perspectives of the same tale. Of course the reader suspects what is revealed about mid way through the book. My initial reaction when the revelation was made was disappointment as I thought the story would taper off from there. However, instead of losing steam the story kicks into high gear and keeps the reader engrossed.My only complaint is the ending. I felt the ending was slightly contrived and not at all in keeping with the characters. Throughout the mystery, the characters remain true to their personality and then all of a sudden at the end of the book the story is neatly wrapped up in a few chapters with completely uncharacteristic behaviour from all parties.Mystery novels can be predictable, but in Gone Girl the author succeeds in putting a refreshing spin on the case of a missing woman. Its well worth the read but be prepared for an anti-climatic ending.
4	1360800000	After I got into the flow of the book, it was difficult to put it down. Has elements of novelty in writing style. Great suspense thriller, and the characters are not everyday people one encounters!
5	1360800000	Great read.  I enjoyed the structure of the book. Good character development. Nice twist in the plot. Can't wait to read the next of series!
3	1360800000	Gone Girl started well and I got quite absorbed in the whole plot, however by the middle I was thinking "these two people are so irritating" - I suppose by the end I justified it by saying to myself "it was just as well they were married to each other because they deserved each other".A book that I couldn't put down because I wanted to know the final outcome, however the ending left a lot to be desired.I expect I need to read another of her books to find out if (for me) all her books have irritating characters.
4	1360713600	Thought it was going to be a &#34;girly&#34; book, however great read.Loved the character depth and how your feelings for them change so dramatically
5	1360713600	This book is nothing like I have ever read before! An absolutely riveting book, that kept me glued from start to finish. I was taken through a spiral of emotions and was completely drawn it.An outstanding plot and fascinating characters. Very cleverly written, and hugely thought provoking.Disappointing ending though &#61516;
3	1360627200	Really good storyline, very fast read, I couldn't put it down. Soooo disappointed in the ending, not sure what I was expecting but that wasn't it.
3	1360627200	I nearly trashed this book after only a couple of chapters but I persisted and read on. However, it eventually sucked me in like quicksand, actually more like slowsand as the storyline tends to plod along. Personally, I think there's too much detail in Amy's Diary and not enough action. Still as the saying goes...'revenge is a dish best served cold' and if your up for a revenge plodder, this one's for you.The second part of the book: quickened up and became a little more exciting as the two opposing parties went their own ways. Highly unlikely that Amy wouldn't have been recognised hanging out in a downtown motel for ages irrespective of her disguise. Who knows, people tend to see only what they want to see!The final part of the book: the pseudo rescue and being held against her will, followed by Amy's revenge and return to a husband who'd guessed the truth but had to live with it, scary.Slow, scary outcome and definitely not a trash can job.Can't give it more than three stars given its extremely slow start.
3	1360540800	When i started reading this book, i wondered where it was going. Boy meets girl, both writers, ordinary middle class life, and i thought, I read it all before. I was told to keep reading by others who has read it before me and the point would come to light. After the first few chapters it did! I was hooked into it immediatly. Seems he's not such a nice guy at all, particullary according to his wife, who is called &#34;amazing Amy&#34;. She is high maintanence and her revenge is going to be the most amazing thing ever! Sure enough it is. He finds himself in a nasty situation, so that he has to beg forgivness from Amy, so she can rescue him. Good interesting, detailed, stories of things that had happened in the past in their lives that blend in well with the story. Gripping reading till almost the end. I was waiting for some sort of justice to be done to the real villan in the story, only to have it fall flat.
3	1360540800	This book was okay, I found there were too many explanations of everything and sometimes too difficult to follow...I guessed pretty early on the plot and was desperately disappointed with the ending....
4	1360454400	Liked this one. Different take on things - interesting the way the story unfolds. Dark and engaging generally. But a very easy read. Enjoyed it!
4	1360368000	This captivated me. I found it hard to put down. It kept me guessing right to the end. Great read thank you Gillian Flynn.
5	1360368000	This is a really clever story that will grip from the first page..The characters are  unusual to say the least!It  moves at a pace but the ending was a little bit of a let down.This doesn't take from the overall enjoyment of the story.a must read!
5	1360281600	Sharp, well-written, full of suspense. A warped and disturbing tale. I wanted a different ending or a sequel. Couldn't put it down.
5	1360281600	I have never read Gillian Flynn before and really enjoyed this book, quite a page turner, written from both sides of the marriage. It will create doubt and keep you guessing.  Good enough for me to purchase another of her books, hope it's as good as this one
5	1360281600	Not much I can say, except I love, love LOVED it!!! Time to start reading more Gillian Flynn I think!!! :D
5	1360281600	This book has become one of my all time favourites. It was unpredictable with lots of suspense. I read it in one sitting. If you like a modern thriller this one's for you.
4	1360281600	Beware, after the first few chapters you may be consumed by this book and unable to focus on much else!  It is well put together and really hooked me.
3	1360281600	It does keep one hooked, I felt it has ended up with a cliff hanger, as if there is going to be a sequel. I hope so, otherwise the end was quite an anticlimax.
4	1360195200	It was good .. quite gripping - thought the ending was a bit weak though.would read more of Gillian Flynn
4	1360195200	really good mystery, and an interesting way of writing it with sections in the two different voices, the two main characters, kept me guessing for ages, but I thought the ending really let the rest of the book down, can't say more as I don't want to be a spoiler, and to be honest I don't quite know how else it could have ended, but it did seem like a let down
2	1360108800	Gone Girl - found this very slow to start - I had to put it down after first couple of chapters
5	1360108800	Absolutely loved this from the moment The Sure Thing reference appears (product of my generation). The writing is assured, the he-said she-said device excellently executed and the story compelling. The protagonist is definitely one of the creepiest I have encountered in a long time.
4	1360108800	Gone Girl definately got better as I progressed through the book. The first third was a bit mundane but well worth sticking with theis novel. The ending leaves the question wide open
5	1360108800	This book was fabulous. Easy to read, compelling story that just got you so sucked in..I was turning the pages in eager anticipation....Cannot recommend this book enough...brilliant  !!!
4	1360108800	I read it during my long travels and I have enjoyed the book. Although it is quite predictable, it still kept my attention.
3	1360022400	Great twists and turns.  I enjoyed this book.  A three star for me means definately worth reading but I wouldn't rave about it.  Most books I read would fall into this catagory.
5	1360022400	I had read the reviews on this book and it was a good as everyone said.  Loved the twists and turns.
3	1360022400	Kind of finished up where it started off. Not one of the best books I have read. I'd give it two and a half stars.
3	1360022400	Slightly gripping at times but poor characters and very disappointing ending. Probably would be enjoyed by someone looking for easy non-challenging read.
4	1360022400	This is a great page turner. There are twists and turns and the reader is never sure what is real. The story may become slightly too convoluted as it contrives a little too hard to twist and then twist again. A surprising insight - well for a non-American - is the desperation and desolation that the recession has caused for many ordinary Americans.
4	1359849600	The sample gives you no idea for what you are in for. The story twists and turns and if you go along for the ride it is enjoyable escapism at its best.
4	1359849600	Great story, interesting characters and beautifully written. Would definitely recommend it - couldn't put it down! Will be keen to read others by this author.
5	1359849600	I mean, of course Buy it. The book introduced me into a dark world of "damaged" people that caught me totally off-guard. Abandon all hope, ye who read it, SERIOUS MINDF***S expected.Why the "DO NOT READ"? Although I am a experienced reader, I was given the sensibility to empathize with the protagonists of the stories I read, AND I ALMOST GOT NIGHTMARES FROM THESE ONES!(PS: Amazing book, BTW!)
4	1359849600	I enjoyed this book while on holiday. It was a good but sometimes strange read but certainly kept the reader intrigued.
5	1359849600	Great story. I had no idea what would happen next as all was making sense - but then realised I was only 50% through the story. Nothing too suspenseful though - still semi-lighthearted.
4	1359763200	An absorbing account of a brilliant but twisted mind and the wreckage left in its wake. The husband is a likeable character for whom you can feel sympathy - after a time. The plot keeps you on your toes and helps you to suspend your disbelief. Most enjoyable.
5	1359590400	Amazing book - I'm a wimp with suspense however it was not scary just fascinating, fast paced & keeps you guessing!  Clever - looking forward to seeing the movie!
3	1359590400	It is a real page-turner, true, but it has a lazy ending, the characters are, to a singleton, unlikable and there's a grubbiness and vulgarity about the whole enterprise.  Doubtless the movie is coming, however, and Ms Flynn will become the next Stephen King.  She says of this book that, &#34;I wanted to explore the geography of intimacy&#34;.  By 'explore' she seems to mean 'write about'.  Explorations imply discoveries and I saw none here.  A good read on a long plane trip, but no more than that.
5	1359590400	After the first couple of chapters, I could not put this book down, and its been a long while since I have read a book that was this compelling.  There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns.  I really could not predict what was going to happen next.  I am in a book club and I believe this has been everyone's favorite book so far.  Unfortunately I did not get the fairy tale end that I wanted.  But then again, the ending was unexpected, so I had to keep reading to find out how everything was going to develop.  I am hoping she is setting her fans up for a sequel and would LOVE to see this book made into a movie.
4	1359504000	I found the second half more gripping and whereas I did enjoy this read I didn't find it a blockbusting page turner like most do
5	1359504000	The material is so fresh and interesting and the story unfolds without flagging. Clearly a great deal of thought went into the planning of the book. People are very complex and as they get older they get more so. I found the unveiling of the personalities of the characters under the stress of the situation fascinating. I can highly recommend the book to anybody who likes a good mystery story.
5	1359331200	This was a real page turner. It was one of those rare books which i couldn't put down and at the same time, i didn't want it to end and so I'd force myself to slow down and pause every now and then. My only criticism was the ending. I didnt like it at all. It didnt make sense after everything that had happened for the story to end like Gillian Flyn chose to end it!
4	1359331200	I found Gone Girl to be a great read. Very captivating although i was a little disappointed with the final twist in the book
5	1359331200	In one word "Brilliant". I was looking for a unputdownable book and read about it on the Amazon list. What a find. Beautifully constructed plot and characters. Love to hate them and in the end don't know who to sympathise with! Keeps you guessing (though I guessed a bit:)) Lyrical at times especially its take on soulmates and single child. And what a take on marriage! A great book for any thriller buff. Actually a must try for anyone. Read it in a day flat. That good. Though the end could have been shorter. Dragged a bit.
5	1359244800	Excellent read had be gripped from beginning to end. Would highly recommend this book. Gillian Flynn writes wonderfully keep you gripped to the story.
4	1359072000	Hard to put down. Really enjoyed this. First time reading this author and loved her style of writing. A very different take on the general thriller. Read!
4	1359072000	I really enjoyed this book - it kept me in suspense until the end - which came too soon! Would recommend it. I must say that many of the review give too much away of the story and might spoil it.
5	1358985600	Absolutely enthralling......could not put it down!!!Truly, one of the best books I have ever read-!!!I'm going to read it again.....
3	1358985600	The story itself is very well written and it is an interesting plot. But I found the characters to be quite disturbing
4	1358899200	This book really held my attention and was great read, the main characters were essentially unlikeable, this usually puts me off but I held out to the end as the writing was really good. I'm not sure I would recommend it.
4	1358899200	Great idea, great plot, well written, tautly paced, then as the revelations begin, the story loses its way. Credibility is blown, and the ironic outcome doesn't seem to fit the rest of the book. Having said that, I mostly liked it and will try another of Gillian Flynn's novels. I'd also add the caveat that of my own books, three are mysteries with thriller elements, and Gone Girl is better than at least two of them!
5	1358812800	...........then look no further. This is an excellent story that results in a gripping thriller. Read this before they make the movie.
4	1358726400	I liked the style of combining the diary of was very good characters with the story line, also the suspense was excellent
3	1358726400	Yes I am male and over 70 so I should have been more choosey with my selection.I read it all fairly quickly. Not really me.
3	1358726400	The first half of this book was a five-star effort for me. I really couldn't put it down and I read it late into the night because, unlike many other thrillers, it wasn't obvious which way it was going to go. It was so interesting the way the financial crisis was reflected in Nick and Amy's personal downfall. When the mystery about what really happened to Amy is solved in the second part of the book it lost a little bit of momentum but it was still a very good read. The way the author made me completely change my perspective and sympathies towards the main characters was brilliantly done. As it continued though I started to see a few holes. It's hard to talk about this book without giving away plot details so if you haven't read it before please stop reading now.I couldn't buy the fact that a girl like Amy would ever come up with a plan that involved her own suicide, no matter how desperately she wanted revenge on Nick. All she really had to do was leave Nick and reclaim the bar to destroy his life. Someone that narcissistic and ego-driven would not even contemplate killing herself in my opinion, because in her eyes it would be the ultimate defeat. I had real trouble buying this aspect of the story and it got worse.Amy turned into a caricature rather than a real person and the book changed from a gritty, realistic thriller to something much less interesting. Why did Amy have to be such an over-the-top sociopath who somehow managed to hide this from her husband and everyone else except her victims for so long? Why did Desi have to be such a complete weirdo who  decorated his lake house for her despite the fact that he hadn't seen her in twenty years? It would have been very easy to portray both these characters more realistically, and in taking this direction much of the tension was lost for me.I appreciate the way the author portrayed the media frenzy that takes place around the disappearances/murder of attractive, rich, white women, but it all started to feel very rushed as it reached its conclusion, and the ending was truly disappointing. It's a shame because I thought I was going to love this book so much, but it was worth reading for the enjoyment I got out of the fist two thirds at least.
4	1358726400	Gone Girl Really enjoyed the relationship issues, the surprises and the cross genre of the novel. A very different mystery
4	1358640000	Lots of twists and turns that never stop, it keeps you guessing to the very end, this is a great read
5	1358467200	This is a very clever and insightful look into the perils of marriage and the darker unknown sides of peoples psyches. The author has an uncanny ability to understand how people think within relationships. It's both amusing and dark, the best book I've read in years!
5	1358467200	I will be purchasing another one of Gillian Flynn's books as she is a brilliant writer.  This is the first time I have bothered to write a review on any book.  I give it 5 + stars!
4	1358380800	This book kept me in suspense throughout the whole book.  There were many twists and turns that had me thinking the outcome only to change my mind many times.  I couldnt put the book down and even at the end I was left wondering.
4	1358294400	I enjoyed the fact that the main characters weren't very likeable, like in Alex Gorringe'sJust Me Myself I, and equally well-written.  A well-crafted thriller.
3	1358208000	Could not put thee book down but the twist in the end left me slightly confused I ended up rushing through overall the book is a good read
4	1358208000	The 'did he?' 'did she?' questions don't stop until the last page of this unlikely thriller.  I say  'unlikely' only because it starts out as a very average-feeling tale of the Oprah's Book Club type ... but there's a reason for that!Amy and Nick have recently moved to Carthage, Missouri from New York.  The downturn in their careers is followed by a dissatisfaction with each other, and then Amy goes missing!  I'll say no more about the plot except that it kept me guessing.
5	1358121600	I really enjoyed this read. It was gripping and I found I often could not put this book down. This book is well written and really worth a read. I recommend it!
5	1358121600	Incredible book, yo literally can't stop reading since page one!. Excellent story, and very unexpected!You've got to read it!!!!
5	1358121600	Really enjoyed this book .Very imaginative story ,wonderfully well paced ,I will be looking for more Gillian Flynn books . A little disappointed by the ending ,but accept the plot was so marvellous and suspense so well maintained that it was hard to find any other ending .
5	1358035200	Well written and easy to read. The plot was very clever and the characters were portrayed so well. Definitely recommend.
4	1358035200	From the moment go we are intrigued by the relationship between the &#34;ideal&#34; couple, Ken and Barbie. No, they are not really called that ... But may very well have been, so perfect and lacking in standout features they seem to be. At first. But, then the wife disappears, and it becomes slowly but chillingly clear: things are not so cool in the world of Nick and Amy Dunne.I read this on my iPad, but had it been pages, I think they would have been set alight by the sheer force of this edgy thriller. Not a dull moment anywhere, and just when you think you've figured it out, Gillian Flynn brings another twisted turn to the plot.Wonderful -- Ms Flynn seems to up the stakes with every book she writes.But perhaps the ending could've been stronger? It seems to kind of end just because it has to. Or is it just me who wanted more!
4	1358035200	Jennifer Byrne mentioned this on the book show.  She said that it was not suitable for panel discussion due to spoiler alerts.  Ditto.  Just do yourself a favour and read it!
4	1357948800	I liked they way it was written, It kept me interested to the very end...I was still guessing when it did end.
5	1357862400	A great story, plays with your sympathies for the two characters.A very clever way of telling a story, thanks.
2	1357689600	Some things aren't like they seem. A psychological thriller in the enth degree, Flynn has her story and characters down pat. The dialogue is snappy and quick, and I was amazed at how it flowed. Very dissapointed with how the story ends.
5	1357689600	This was my recommendation for our bookclub when it first came out. We all loved it - you can never predict how it will end and a book where no one really liked any of the characters!
4	1357603200	I never read a book in a weekend... but, it was such a page turner... that I didin't put it down until I was finished!I normally read reviews before buying a book so I knew the ending was not going to be great, so it wasn't a surprise... but... I guess you alway expect more... a must read!
5	1357516800	This book kept coming up on my recommended list and so I finally gave it a go...I was hooked from start to finish. I thought I had it all figured out about a quarter of the way through the book and then it completely threw me.All of the characters are completely unlikeable but you become addicted to them nevertheless.A well thought out book - perhaps unrealistic in many senses but it keeps you turning the pages.The ending was a let down for me, but when I really thought about it I did not want either of them to end up happy so it was apt in some ways.
5	1357516800	A very clever novel. Parallel narratives of a twisted marriage that tie together in an amazing conclusion.Well worth a read.
5	1357430400	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book,in fact one of my best reads of 2012.I look forward to any new books by the author.
1	1357257600	This book came highly recommended and, to say the least, it left me incredibly dissatisfied and disappointed. The plot was so basic and predictable I continued reading in the hope it might get better. It didn't. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5	1357257600	Am intrigued with Gillian's writing ability.  She has a young and interesting style.  The book is well written and I will buy other books by this author.  I am glad I purchased it to try as finding new and exciting authors is always a coup.
4	1357257600	This book is full of all twists and turns....I LOVED IT!!!!It's one of those books where it just sticks with you long after you read it. The characters of the novel are flawed but you love them in spite that.I was slightly disappointed with the ending though
5	1357171200	Excellent book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Lots of twists to keep the reader guessing.  Highly recommended to readers who like a &#34;clever plot&#34;.
5	1357084800	Since I have read this book, I often think about it. It was very clever and rivetting right to the end
4	1357084800	Gone Girl is the story of Amy and Nick Dunne, a married couple of five years. Both of them, after having lost their jobs in New York, had to move back to Nick's home town to take care of Nick's sick parents. Amy mysteriously disappears on their fifth anniversary and Nick seems the prime suspect. However, as the plot unfolds, new secrets about the victim and the supposed perpetrator are revealed, literally turning the plot upside down.Full of twists and turns and a couple of "Shawshank Redemption Moments", I was not able to put it down once I started. Told from point of views of both Nick and Amy, and following a non-linear narrative, it is a very intelligently structured fiction. A well written book with really interesting characters - especially Amy's (In her own words, Gillian specializes in difficult characters - damaged, disturbed, or downright nasty and Amy is a perfect example)On the face of it, Gone Girl is a whodunit thriller set against the backdrop of a broken marriage. Peel off this layer and you will find that this is truly a story about relationships - a noir love story between a narcissist husband and a physco wife.The novel is being adapted to a movie by 20th century fox. Eagerly looking forward.PS: The book has some dark moments and a good amount of foul language.Thanks,Ashutosh[...]
3	1357084800	I enjoyed the beginning of the book, the way it kept me enthralled, great imagination but coming to the end it started getting ludicrous & of course I was disappointed with the ending
4	1356998400	Great read.. Not my usual Choice of subject but had to read it as everyone else was!.. Only downside was I read in three sittings.. Not long enough!Definitely recommend
5	1356912000	Trapped me from the first two chapters. Had never come across such a writing concept before.The story set-up and the writing style make this intriguing book hard to put down!
4	1356825600	A most unusual read, Very transfixing and enjoyable. Look forward to more Gillian Glynn work in the near future. Amen!
5	1356739200	A fantastic read... i couldnt put it down... not your usual 'who dunnit' novel... i enjoyed the changing narrators and their perspectives....definitely a great read.
4	1356739200	This book kept me entertained - even though I'd stupidly read enough spoilers here not to be too surprised by the plot twist, there was enough intrigue to keep me engaged til the end. Yes, I agree, these are not people you'd want to be friends with, but boy, they certainly deserve each other... So it's true love. Kinda.
4	1356652800	Very clever and interesting thriller with an unexpected twist in the middle. It also explores the human psyche and asks the question, just how much do we know ourselves and others? A real page turner I read it every spare moment I had over Christmas. Interesting ending. I would recommend it highly.
5	1356566400	I started reading the book and thought, this is going to be just another murder mystery which I will enjoy reading but will not remember after a few days. But as the story progressed and plot within a plot kept unraveling, it was impossible to put the book down. Without saying too much and giving away too much, I would like to say, you will keep thinking about the characters of this story long after you finish reading it. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery thrillers.
5	1356566400	Excellent book,really loved it.the suspense all the way through was brilliant:-) I would definitely recommend this book.well done billion .
4	1356480000	The plot twists were surprising and exciting. The characters were different and I loved that the female protagonist avoided most writing cliches. The first time I read this author, have now read 2 of her other books (that are also good).
1	1356480000	The polt had many twists but I didn't like how the characters jump around from past to present expecting the reader to be dragged along (unwillingly at times) through the backstory.
4	1356307200	I was very apprehensive about buying this book after reading all the 1 star reviews that complained about the ending. I enjoyed the book, right up to, what I thought, was the last chapter, and it did disappoint me. Until I turned the page to what was actually the last chapter.Those who complained obviously didn't &#34;get it&#34; at all.
5	1356048000	I loved this book. A story about a husband and wife who cannot trust each other. Due to the switching narrator the reader experiences the same feelings as those characters, who is telling the truth? Difficult to put down.
5	1355961600	This is a fantastic read! Just make sure you stick it out all the way to the end. It took me a couple of months to read the first half, a couple of days to read the second.
2	1355875200	Just about suitable for the beach--well-written but trite. Hopeless unbelievable ending. No. 1 on the best-seller list? Who's paying whom?
5	1355184000	Full of suspense - couldn't put it down. Interesting take on a marriage that was once filled with love and went a bit sour.
5	1354924800	Gone Girls has a plot of slap-in-your-face twists and turns. Just when you are beginning to think that you understand the characters, the next section flips your presumptions head over heels. Gillian Flynn plays with the reader. Her wonderful understanding and exploration of male and female quirks, vulnerabilities, manipulations and 'gender-anger' underline the cleverness of the plot as well as her writing skill. One is left disliking all the characters equally - an interesting result which should be used more frequently. Who says protagonists should be likable?
5	1354838400	great observations on the human condition, macabre but frighteningly still believable.don't read it in bed with your partner though
5	1354838400	There is wonderful writing here--but we all need to shout loud until Amazon pays its fair share of corporation tax. I really enjoyed this author's earlier books and if you did, why don't you log in and leave 10 more reviews like this today. It shouldn't just be people who can't afford a team of tax specialists who pay their fair share of tax. Sign that cheque or forever lose my respect and the respect, no doubt, of this very fine author.Amazon was happy to take your money, but is trying every trick in the book to avoid paying its dues back. This has got to stop.Amazon avoids UK taxes by reporting European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit, which allows it to pay a rate of less than 12% on foreign profits last year--less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. The company's United Kingdom website reported a turnover of 207m for 2011, but its tax bill was just 1.8m.This is not illegal. Just damn immoral.The other option, of course, is to visit a book shop.
4	1354665600	Interesting story with a couple of nice twists.  Would recommend as it was the type of book you did not want to put down.
5	1354492800	Found this book completely intriguing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plot which I found to be rather unusual but which absorbed me totally. Found the characters very interesting and quite complex. Would recommend it to people who enjoy suspense and intrigue.
4	1354406400	Kept me reading to the end, a well written and well thought out story of obsession and human nature frailties
4	1354320000	Well written semi-thriller, this book kept me hooked.  Certainly when you start on the journey, the end you get is no what you would expect.  Don't ruin it for yourself, just trust the star ratings and go forth and read the book.
5	1354060800	This was a real surprise for me, and not the kind of novel I usually read.  I couldn't put it down - intelligent and sharp with a psychological edge, the plot twisting and turning among the red herrings.  It is a story without a hero, full of flawed, but interesting, characters.  I was hooked in the first couple of chapters, the author's pessimistic (realistic?) view of modern marriage and relationships, and Amy's descriptions of 'perfection in the female relationship role', in her invented diary, was classic for me!!  I will definitely be looking out for more Gillian Flynn.
4	1354060800	First book in a long time that I would really describe as a 'page-turner'. Was completely drawn in and HAD to find out what would happen next!
4	1353888000	I thoroughly enjoyed this book was unable to put it down as the plot changed constantly.  I loved the way it was written and the pace certainly kept me wanting to devour chapter by chapter to see what happened next.
5	1353715200	Fantastic book from start to finish. couldnt put it down and wish it never ended! i would definitely recommend this book!
4	1353628800	This was a real page turner - loved being on the edge of my seat with so many twists too!
1	1353369600	I really tried to read this book, but I could not bear how awful each of the characters were and how awful they were to each other - they deserved every awful thing that happened to them. I stopped reading it. Life is too short to read awful books like this
5	1353369600	Gone Girl is a psychological study of a husband and wife, each writing from their own perspective (i.e. in the first person).  It turns out that what they write is not always quite what happened or what happened at all.  The mystery is more about what is real and what is staged than about who did what to whom.I think it's brilliantly done.  A book you won't forget in a hurry!
3	1353110400	A book you didn't want to put down, what happens next? Clever twist to the story with your emotions, loyalty  and opinions of the characters constantly changing.  The ending however left me really annoyed, although a clever ending, I guess I wanted a happy ever after ending, which probably was neither realistic or possible.  However thouroughly enjoyed the read.
5	1352419200	This is an excellent book. Very cleverly written and writing from multiple perspectives adds another dimension that both progresses the story and builds the suspense
3	1352073600	It was an absorbing read, but in review it was quite far fetched and the main characters were not credible. I think it could have ended more appropriately.
4	1351209600	This novel keeps you page turning.  It is about a dysfunctional married couple and the murder of the wife.  Some strange dysfunctional others, like parents and friends and just others.  The author should keep better company!!But then she is Irish and at least we Irish are happy dysfuntionals.You feel the depressed atmosphere of Carthage and the areas around it.  Does this have an effect on people?  The Mighty Miss flows through the novel and is ever present.The construction of the novel works very well eventhough I originally felt it wouldn't.This is more than an ordinary thriller; it deals with people and how we cope.  The differnces between men and women, while greatly exaggerated in the novel, makes you think about relationships. I could see this novel being used to train people in counselling and understanding of human relations.You have seen couples like this; they are addicted to each others faults as if "my faults don't seem too bad when I see yours up close"I hear Ms R. Widderspoon has bought the film rights.  Smart girl!!  Not just a pretty face.  I look forward to the film.
5	1351123200	A thrilling page turner with lots of twists and turns along the way. A great read and hard to put down.
5	1351036800	Loved it! Would recommend it to anyone wanting to read an unusual thriller, written in a unique and engaging style.
3	1351036800	Originally when I read the book summary I thought it had a lot of promise.  Within the first 50 pages I found I didn't like the main female protanginist and the further I read into the novel the story line became more far fetched.  I read the book on kindle and found myself skipping through chapters and unable to complete reading the last third of the book.  I've preferred other Gillian Flynn books more.
4	1350950400	Gillian Flynn is a genius, this story is totally the work of brilliance, it is crazy and yet so believable. Somehow the characters can be related to people I know and that is scary!
3	1350950400	Girl Gone was an interesting book, very cleverly written but a bit drawn out in places. Ending was a bit far fetched.An average read.
5	1350864000	I liked this book from the beginning to the end... which shocked me greatly.I would recommended it to those interested in a light mystery reading.
4	1350777600	It's obvious the author has been involved in a relationship in which trust Is gradually lost . A scary depiction  that shows you that you never really know another person  the way you think you do. Fast moving and well written.
5	1350691200	Do not buy this book unless you have the time to read it because ONCE YOU START YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. It is a fascinating, compelling read and drew you deep and dangerously into the story and the characters. The story starts off with one wife missing .... but pages later after mystery, intrigue and also sorts of twists and turns you begin to wonder "what is really going on" and of course, the rest is history, you need to finish that book as quickly as possible!!
4	1350432000	So, having written a thrillerThe Defectorthat got hammered (by some) for its ending, I now find myself in the same position. Gone Girl started brilliantly, and then 'jumped the shark'.I'm not going to rehash the plot, or spoil what's still a great book, but know this before you start it... your final enjoyment will depend on whether Gillian Flynn can keep you suspending disbelief to the last page - and sadly, for me she didn't.Judging by the reviews, others went with her and accepted Amy's er.. extravagant solution to a problem, and her and Nick's final stand-off - but I just didn't believe that Amy could do that, and that there wasn't another way out for Nick. Sorry.Now you'll have to read it to find out what the hell I'm talking about!
1	1350000000	I read this book for my book club and found it to be written in an unlikeable style, with an increasingly implausible plot. I found it difficult to connect with any of the characters, their behaviour seemed unconvincing and I felt detached from them. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book, however others in my book club enjoyed it.
4	1349913600	What a great read!!  Who cares if it had a few loose ends.  I couldn't put it down. The author must have an incredible mind to have come up with this plot. It was discussed at my book club last night and every-one had finshed the book even though it was not their usual type of book.  It created great discussion, which is a test of a good book for a club read.Overall - brilliant!!
4	1349827200	I thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn until the last few pages when I was left a bit empty by the ending. It's such a pity such an excellent book ended on a bit of an anti-climax. I'd like to try one of Gillian Flynn's other books to see how it compares.
3	1349654400	I was annoyed that I was not able to walk away from this miserable story. Neither of the protagonists is in the least bit likeable  nor sympathetic.  Nevertheless the narrative is so carefully wound with sudden twists that I had to keep on reading.  Maybe it is meant to be satirical....
5	1349568000	Brilliantly written mystery love-story. Full of surprises, it starts as one story, changes its tone, then changes it again. Written through the eys of both the wife and husband, we begin to wonder who the guilty party really is? It is very hard to put down this book, not only for its suspenseful plot-line but for Gillian Flynn's poetry of words. She also manages to tap into some brilliant home truths about relationships and gender battles. The only thing that bothered me with this page-turning thriller of twisty shocks, was the disappointing fizzle of an end. Nontheless, fabulous read and I would definitely read more of Flynn's work.
4	1349481600	The author's ability to describe different viewpoints was excellent. The book kept me riveted right through.  I look forward to reading her next book.
3	1349481600	Enjoyed the read with the twists and turns. Felt sorry for the husband in the end!He got punished more than he deserved....A sequel perhaps?
4	1349481600	This is a well written thriller about the marriage of a seriously crazy girl and her unsuspecting husband. The plot has plenty of twists and the suspense is maintained throughout. It will keep you up at night reading and offers some good insights into personality. It is better than most thrillers and offers a few surprises. Definitely worth reading.
3	1349308800	Reviews for this book kept popping up, in magazines and newspapers, it sounded fascinating, and I was ready for a good read.BUT I struggled with this book from start to finish. I was disappointed with the he said/she said style, with each chapter, giving each others version of their story. I found it frustrating. I was waiting for a third party to step in and take over the story, so it would flow consistantly instead of back and forth.
4	1348444800	I liked the book, although it was not my favorite read.  Flynn does know how to maintain the reader's interest most of the time, but sometimes the rythm becomes too slow.
5	1348444800	This popped up on my recommendations and after trying a sample I had to keep going, it has twist after twist, and I don't want to give anything away or it'll ruin it - the characters are incredibly well written and the story sucks you in, your allegiance swings from one character to the next and the relationships are psychologically believable.  Well worth the read.
3	1348358400	Gone Girl was the kind of book I couldn't put down. Curiosity kept me going, as I needed to know more about the characters and desperately needed to know whodunit.  Always love a twist in a plot and this one delivers.  Recommended
4	1348358400	Great read - a really interesting take on a crime thriller. The way the book is written keeps you awake, and wanting to read more. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller read.
5	1348272000	I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is very well written.  Lots of twists, turns and unexpected events.  Kept me on the edge of my seat!
4	1348185600	Loved this book. It contained real twists and turns and kept me guessing until the end. Amazing how warped human nature can be!
4	1348185600	This book gripped me from the start and I was totally taken with the emotional roller coaster. Only downside is I cannot discuss book with anyone who has not read it!
3	1348099200	Very interesting story once I got used to the differing points of view which were a little confusing initially. Nick had his opportunity but didn't take advantage of it. Amy's character was chilling, a master manipulator. The ending left a bit to be desired. Certainly well written, a psychological thriller.
4	1347408000	This book was so different from the start, an absolute page turner. I was so impressed - that is until the end, so disappointing. I was sorry I read it. Who would ever end a book like that!!!!1
4	1347321600	I really enjoyed this cleverly written book that kept me guessing to the end, and it doesn't have a typical ending.
4	1347235200	I really enjoyed this book it was a v good read. The characters were great and the plot was intriguing! Ending was a little disappointing but it's always hard to round up after a big climax. Definetly worth reading!
4	1347148800	Loved this book.  It was tightly written and witty with a few interesting twists here and there.  The characters were fleshed out.  A real page-turner, that kept me reading well into the night.  So many entertaining novels are poorly written pulp.  Gone Girl was an entertaining well written novel.
3	1347062400	Started quite slowly, then by midway, I was really enjoying the book....but I really didn't like the end.  I like endings to be one way or the other, this was not...
5	1346976000	Purchased based on a very favourable review in 'The Australian', it completely lived up to the crit.  Apart from the interesting complexity of the story, including the multiple view points and differing time frames (don't be put off), the writing is very fine indeed.  I'd thoroughy recommend Gone Girl to any discerning reader.
2	1346976000	The book was much too long.  It was like reading a who dunnit, badly written piece of fiction.The only reason I finished the book is that I never put down a book halfway through hoping thatsomething will change.
4	1346976000	I found this book a little difficult to get into, but once past the first couple of chapters it was hard to put down. The book was well written, and had an ending I wasn't expecting.
3	1346889600	I found the characters very irritating but once you start reading you cant stop as you have to see how it ends
5	1346889600	I was recommended this by a friend and all I can say is: THANKS! This was an incredibly clever, suspenseful page-turner and I urge any fans of thrillers to read it right now - you won't regret it.
1	1346889600	A disappointing read and denouement. I expected more than some Fatal Attraction sophistry. It gets you in  and then it drags and drags on. Then it chicken's out into a "literary" finish. Sad really - how good writers give into University Reconstructive critics from the avant-garde faculty.  They always approve of the type of books that people don't want to read, ie -dense allegory. Yuk
5	1346889600	I loved the fact that I was cheering him and cursing her one minute and doing the exact opposite in the next chapter.  Some really interesting insights into how (seemingly)perfect love can sour slowly over time.  I was worried towards the last just how the author would or could wrap this up without the obvious ending but it was perfect in the end. Highly recommend.
5	1346889600	Gone Girl was an  excellent read. The first few diary entries I found a bit tedious and confusing, however, this is only a minor complaint. Written in the style of one chapter about Nick and the next about Amy, it made for very interesting reading, keeps you wanting to know what happens next to both characters.Throughtout the book your feelings for both characters change from dislike to like, back again to dislike, then feeling sorry for him or her, in the end you dont know who to dislike more, Nick or Amy!!!!  Very clever writing.An excellent read, keeps you wanting to read on, no matter what's happening around you, just to find out what happens in the next chapter and how the story ends.....but that's the worst thing about a good book.....the end.....then you have to find another good book to follow!!!
5	1346889600	This is the first novel I've read in years where I didn't see the twist coming. It had me second guessing with every turn of the page. Complicated characters, I had a love hate relationship with them all, and couldn't put it down.
5	1346630400	A twisty tale where you initially feel sorry for the wife whose husband is having an affair, after they move out of Manhatten and back to his home town. But all is not as it first appears...Brilliantly written to make you identify and empathise alternately with each main character, as they tell their own version of the same story. An almost believeable plot that just gets better and better. Set aside heaps of time so you can really enjoy this psychopathic thriller! Not just a "chick flick"! Highly recommended.
1	1346630400	This novel was so full of four letter words that I could not finish it.A good story spoilt , why books these days are so full of foul language when there are so many adjectives the writer could use instead. Very disappointed in this book.
4	1345161600	A spell binding book with many twists and turns and leaving one with the feeling that the protagonists deserve each other!
5	1345161600	I absolutely loved this book, it kept me enthralled from start to finish.  There were surprises around every corner, which i love in a book.  It was written so well and an absolute pleasure to read, just started another of Gillian Flynn's books, hopefully i will love it as much as i did, Gone Girl !!!
5	1345075200	Luckily it was a weekend when I started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, because after a few chapters I could not just put it down - all of Sunday went by in Gone Girl's world.This is a great crime fiction, though a very original take on the genre.  So many sudden and unexpected changes, the characters well drawn, and increasingly less likeable as you get to know them - sorting their opinions of themselves from reality was one of the challenges and delights of this book.You will find no spoilers in this review ... just a recommendation for a great read!
5	1344816000	This book went wayyyy beyond my expectations. All I can say is you must read this book. You will not pick what happens next. Completely twisted, edge of the couch exciting, and very satisfying!
2	1344124800	This book started so well and then became one of the silliest and most implausible books I've read in many years. I only finished it in the hope the author would redeem herself and steer the story as well as she had in the first half. Sadly not.
5	1343606400	I found the book refreshingly different from others in the genre. A great read. The plot is fast moving and unexpected.
3	1343174400	Thiis book could have been really brilliant.  For half of it , it is.  Then the plot has to evolve yet again and again to a pretty unrealistic end.Still good but so much promise at the beginning was lost.
4	1342915200	Thoroughly enjoyed the book and couldn't spare a moment to savour it as I was too intrigued to find out what happened and what was going to happen next. Loved the style of writing, could picture the characters and the scenery. What a great read.
4	1342569600	Gone Girl: A NovelThis book was gripping from page one.  It was interesting following the relationship from the perspective of both characters in the novel.This is defenitley not a predictable read, which makes the book that much more enjoyable.Can't wait to read more Gillian Flynn books.
3	1342569600	I love to read-  but I do not want to read something that leaves me so disappointed and depressed in the end-would not pass it around to friends.
3	1340755200	found myself racing through this book with excitement .... only to find a flat and lacklustre ending. did the author run out of time on deadline or simply get bored?!
4	1340496000	There's nothing quite like a good crime novel every now and then and "Gone Girl" most certainly did not disappoint! It was a nail-biting, edge of my seat, gripping thriller from start to finish. It is a book in which the author very skillfully weaves the story between the characters and plot. The story is told from the point of view of the two main characters, Nick and Amy. I was wondering who exactly were these characters? Were they exactly what they seemed at first or did they have secret, hidden depths?The tension and drama in the book slowly builds, before reaching its final and very surprising crescendo.I found "Gone Girl" to be a compelling read. It was well-written and thought-provoking. This is the first book that I've read by Gillian Flynn and I've already added her other books to my ever-expanding "to be read" pile!
1	1340409600	poorly written with a lazy ending. do not waste your time on this ordinary book. the plot was interesting enough to get me to the end but the let down was disappointing. one of the worst books that i have ever read.
1	1339804800	Having read Dark Places, I was really looking forward to Gone Girl Gone. What can I say...I hated it. This novel represents everything I loathe in the crime genre - increasingly unbelievable plot turns, unforgivably cliched characters (Tanner Bolt, really??), unlikely motivations and actions, a heavy reliance on convenient coincidence...need I go on? This is a far less accomplished piece of writing than Dark Places and I cannot recommend it. There is nothing new, clever or compelling here, fellow readers. One star, at best.
5	1339027200	this is book for people who love to read.  i dont mean a nice packaged story i mean really read.  you cant skim pages and the plot unfolds and unfolds and unfolds... you have no favourites - no heroines - no heroes - you just have a gripping, interesting, surprising and at times darkly funny read.  it is very "wordy" with great descriptions and intricate plots that weave themselves along.ive read dark places and also thoroughly enjoyed it. i was expecting this to be in a similar vein but its very fresh and new and a different kind of plot... its a modern day war of the roses with serious psychological warfare and the portrayal of the characters was brilliant. This must have taken a very long time to put together - with all the nuances and plots within plots nothing was forgotten, everything tied together eventually - she didnt miss a trick.gillian you are just what the market needs right now.. so many authors are churning out these neatly packaged one or two twists books that you sometimes feel you are reading the same story with the names and places changed and I feel patronised by the fact that many feel like an ABC of crime writing.  Gone Girl made me feel like the author really respects the minds of  her readers and gives a book worthy of our money and our time and i for one will be waiting very impatiently for her next book.Thank you for a brilliant story.. i loved it.
