5	1404864000	very good
5	1404864000	Had this over a year and it still works great for the price and would recommend this product
5	1404864000	love, love, this case! great buy and a lot better than the $100 keyboard case I had been using.
3	1404864000	I like this product..the shipping on it is way too much money!!
5	1404864000	Awesome item.  I have been using this case for over a year now, and still is in perfect condition.  Very well made.
4	1404864000	Nice cover at a good price.  The only thing I do not like is that the boarder around the screen makes it hard to initiate commands at the upper left of the screen.
5	1404864000	So I've had this iPad cover ever since November of 2013, and I only know that from my amazon account lol. Anyways, I absolutely LOVE this product. It's been on my iPad since day one, and let me tell you, I've dropped my iPad mini probably about a hundred times from different heights, angles, and everything. I'm a little clumsy with my stuff, but I'm so so thankful for this iPad cover. There's no battle scars, scuffs, nothing on my iPad. Whenever I take it out to clean it, there's only dust and stuff on the back, things that I can just wipe off and it just leaves my iPad looking brand spanking new! The only downside of this cover is that the velvety part of the cover, which is only on the inside part can get a little dirty after heavy usage. But cleaning it is pretty easy, just get soap, a little water, and a toothbrush and it looks new again! I don't know if that's the proper way to clean it but it worked for me! And I've done this about twice in the time ive had it. So I strongly recommend getting this cover over anything else!
5	1404777600	Very happy with this product
5	1404777600	great product
1	1404777600	:(
5	1404691200	Good quality
5	1404691200	I bought it for my wife and she really love it. We're glad we order it. She loves the color.
2	1404432000	Appeared to have fully firm top instead of one that is floppy, insecure.Disappointed.
5	1404432000	Exactly what I wanted...
5	1404432000	A really great accessory for an exceptionally good price.
5	1404345600	This case works great!
1	1404345600	Magnets didn't work at all; you couldn't hold the case upside down without the cover coming off. Stylus worked for a little while but eventually stopped registering and was useless.
5	1404345600	Really enjoying the cases. fits well, wearing well
5	1404259200	This is exactly as pictured and has been a good case
5	1404172800	nice keep it up
5	1404172800	Everything ok
4	1404086400	Work great and the price is right.
5	1404000000	Very satisfied with these product, good price, good quality, and quick delivery
5	1403913600	Read reviews about this cover before buying for my new iPad Mini Retina, it came fast and fits like a glove! The stylus included isn't a cheapie light weight one and works wonderful except it does leave smudges on the screen. I love watching movies in bed to go to sleep and the elastic handle on this cover is nice and tight.
4	1403740800	Love the cover. Will purchase another, very disappointed greatly with what this company called a stylus pen. They replaced it witha scriber pen.
5	1403740800	Love..love&#8230;love the color!!  Just as described and pretty good quality!Holds the mini iPad very nicely.  It's nice and light, easy to use. andlove the way its able to be held by the elastic holder.
4	1403654400	I like it.
4	1403568000	This product arrived fast and works just a promised.  I really like the way that it automatically wakes up the iPad when you open the cover.  The purple color is rich and looks even better than the photo. The extras in this design are very functional (the card slots, the hand strap and the stylus).  It fits the tablet like a glove.  I would give it five stars except that sometimes the edges cover a part of the screen where you need to touch to operate.  This is a minor issue and doesn't happen very often. Other than that, I am very pleased with this product would recommend it to others.
5	1403481600	I love my case  it protects my iPad mini and I love the color I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5	1403481600	Fantastic! Well made and designed with auto-off on shutting to save battery life. It really holds the iPad secure and I like the hand hold for presenting. To top it off, the free stylus prevents smudges/fingerprints from messing up the screen. The photos really don't do it justice - it's better in real life! Only one comment: What is the little part used for that is below the card slots? For the price, you can't go wrong!
4	1403481600	I like this product allot.  My previous cover never seems to stay stable when set up.  Push too hard and it fell over.  This stand holds the ipad securely without falling over.  i do really like the hand strap too.  Only negative is the slot that you put the tab into on the back is a little tight and I wonder how it will fair over time.  That's the only negative I see but also can't think of a better way to have it work.  Nice material and it  wakes and sleeps quickly.
5	1403481600	The cover fit great and the color was what I expected. It was a very quick delivery. The price was great.
5	1403395200	Excellent iPad mini with retina case. Good leather. Love the bonus having a stylus. Love the little room on the cover for small credit card case or a business card case.
4	1403395200	I searched and ended up buying what my son has and recommended.I liked:1.  It's very functional, most important to me2.  Liked the color3.  Price was great4.  I'm using the "pen" tho I didn't think I would.I didn't like:1.  when you open, it's beige suede like fabric.  It can't be washed so I think it will soil easily.I'd recommend it as it's so functional.
5	1403308800	Works well. Great  price. Don't really know why there is a pen included. I  just use to protect my iPad.
5	1403308800	Works well.  Very nice to the touch !  Very pleased with this cover.  Nice value and quality. The purple is pretty
4	1403136000	Just perfect for my needs.  Leather is quality. Hand strap is so useful.  Would recommend to those with iPad mini2 without hesitation
5	1403049600	Would recommend.  The material is looks like real leather and looks very expensive.  I love this itema would definately recommend it.
1	1403049600	Bulky and does not lock the screen when closed. There is a pen that comes with it - why would you want a pen near your iPa? Not worth the money.
5	1402963200	I purchased this case after hearing about how nice it is and I am very glad I did.It is a very functional case that offers great protection for my tablet
5	1402963200	Perect for daily use like playing games and reading.  Great quality and love the stylus that came with the package.  Definitely recommend!
4	1402876800	the case was not really what i expected. I wish that strap worked in my right hand but it doesn't. If you put the iPad in upside down the stylus/pen is upside down and the magnetic lid/lock doesn't work.Otherwise, its a very well-constructed case. Good quality leather and the stylus is amazing as well. It's very easy to take the ipad out and the stand works very well.
5	1402704000	Good deal.  I love the color and it is well made.  Very happy with my purchase. Thanks for the great product,
3	1402704000	Cover Comes with cheap pen that fell apart after 1 day Should be of better quality The comapany should replace at no ost to me
5	1402704000	Wow am I impressed with this case! I got it fast thanks to amazon prime and I was very surprised by how good the build quality is for the price. I don't have any issue with the cover going over the screen it's a perfect fit. Velcro that holds the ipad in place is great and keeps it very secure. For the price I would recommend this case it is a great starter case. Stylus works great and the hand grip for portrait viewing is very convenient.
5	1402704000	I bought this for my husband and have noticed--and been told--it's a pretty great case. Attractive, practical, and simple in design. The &#34;handle&#34; feature is especially nice. Not to mention quite reasonably priced.
1	1402704000	Heavy, bulky, heavy!! Its too much. After a month, bought another from different company.Thought I would like better protection, its just to heavy and reading with it became a work out on my forearm.
5	1402617600	I bought a similar one in Staples only I couldn't get the card board to bend and hold up my IPad. Oh and it didn't have  a cover, just a back. This one holds it up steady with one try and I love the handle and it goes into a sleep mode when I shut the lid. Its perfect.
5	1402617600	This is a fantastic case, especially for the price.  It holds the iPad securely and has ample protection.  Has many features for standing, etc, and has handy pen/stylus and holder, business card slots, and other useful features.  Love this case, it's sturdy yet light weight, just a great case.
5	1402531200	I have this cover since 2013 and today the cover still like new. The quality of the cover it's really good. I recommend it 100%.
3	1402531200	This cover certainly fits well, which is my number 1 requirement.  Cover sometimes bends wrong when standing it up and if you're not careful, it will fall over before you realize that it needs to be adjusted to stand up correctly.
5	1402444800	fits the ipad mini like a glove!, perfect protection and style for the ipad mini.  I think this is a great product!
5	1402358400	Great product.  Easy to set up and use.  Apple has improved on their automated set up procedures.The  color provided by Retina is great.  Support at the store level is also very good.
4	1402185600	I loved this case because of the fact that the front screen of my ipad is fully covered on the edges. Unlike the other cases, they only covered the corners which made me feel it's not fully secure. It felt sturdy and secured when using the strap.The 2 cons I just had to say about this:-The back stand can easily detach when touched or hit by something. Although this applied to every ipad cases, this case had a less simpler way to set up the back stand so I expected to be more firm.-Using using your ipad in landscape mode with this made it very difficult to access control center. I usually pull the cover from the screen to access it until I had enough of it and used my cydia app, activator, to create a command that accessed it another way.
5	1402099200	These little handy cases for your many iPads are a dream. It is so great to be in that have something where you can hold a couple credit cards taking mini iPad with you and be able to conduct your daily life's business on such a convenient scale. I could not do without these things matter what.
5	1402099200	The quantity of this product looks great and it's comfortable to use. No complaint.The quantity of this product looks great and it's comfortable to use. No complaint.
5	1402099200	Just what I wanted.  Has met all my expectations.  Completely satisfied.  Received when promised in good condition. the end.good bye
3	1402012800	I'm pretty satisfied with this product. The only thing I wish I thought about before buying the case is that the case interferes with your ability to access the &#34;control center&#34; (swiping up) when using the iPad mini in landscape mode.
5	1401926400	A perfect case for the ipad mini at a great price point!!!! Solid construction and good protection!! Love this case!!! And it comes with a really nice pen that is also included!
5	1401753600	I BOUGHT THIS AND DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SUCH A QUALITY HOLDER FOR MY MINI IPAD. WONDERFUL ITEM, AND WILL BE BACK TO BUY ANOTHER, IF THIS ONE WEARS OUT. USE ON PATROL DAILY FOR RADIO LOGS. THANKS..
5	1401580800	i love this color and fit perfect, love the pen that came with it. i will recomended and  will purchase more in future
5	1401494400	This fits nicely to my daughter's Mini ipad. I has protected it and the quality is good, I recommend it for the mini ipad
3	1401494400	For the price it is fairly good. When the iPad is in the case however, the edges of the cover overlap one side of the screen or the other.
4	1401408000	As much as I love Otterbox, I found their iPad case a bit heavy and since I was buying the mini, I wanted something I could hold and read. This case does the job and it's a good price. Love the baby blue color.
5	1401408000	Great Case, Snug, Secure and Quality Looking and Feeling. I got this for my mom's iPad mini and she loves it. It feels super protected and works just like the pictures show. Great product.
3	1401321600	Too heavy, just bought the iPad Air for the weight factor.  I put this case on and it weighs it down.
5	1401235200	For the price and the functionality, can't beat this case. I like the strap on the back which makes it easier to hold the mini.
4	1401235200	Bought it to hold a mini iPad I received as a gift. Works very well and I like it. The color is pretty and fit the iPad snugly. I love it because it doesn't show dirt easily. It also does not get dirty easily. I'd recommend this to anyone who is need of an iPad cover. I really love it!!!
5	1401235200	This case works wonderfully. It is easy to handle and has protected my iPad Air from cracking many times already.
2	1401235200	It didn't fit my iPad Mini...so I guess I'll use it for something else...Case seems nice and sturdy...too bad it was about 1 inch too small for my ipad to actually fit into it. Off to the Apple store I go !
5	1401148800	I recently purchased this for my hubby, and he really likes it.  This is the second time purchasing a case from i-Blason for my iPad through Amazon, and the case is still going strong after about two years, putting my iPad to sleep when I close it, and waking it up when I open it.  Highly recommended.
4	1401062400	I have had the case now for  a little less then a year, it is holding up pretty well. I'm pretty rough with  my iPad, and it has protected it. I like the slots for the credit card. The only thing that would make this product better is if it had more than one height levels, other then the two it already has. Overall really good product.
4	1401062400	Good value protects my I pad easy to use and durable.  Would recommend for any one with a I Pad.
5	1400976000	Well made, good quality does the job. I also have a I-Balson for my IPad, both wear very good and protect your investment
5	1400889600	The I-Blason Applie iPad Air over is a great buy.  I looked at several stores and could not fine what I was looking for.  This online product looks great and fits its description.  Great color selection!
5	1400889600	THIS IS THE SECOND ONE THAT I HAVE ORDERED LIKE THIS AND MY OLD ONE LASTED ME ABOUT 2 1/2 YEARS
4	1400889600	Newbie iPad mini owner so I knew nothing about cases. I knew I wanted a black leather magnetic case that slid in the compartment without paying a lot. This is nice and feels good. No complaints. Purchased for $13.95 with free shipping.
2	1400889600	I know I was buying a knock off but I expected it to at least stay up when in the easel position.  Never worked right. Never stayed up.  Waited too long but I should have returned it.  Now I use the ipad for the kids more often so have to look for another one.
5	1400803200	Best cover every for the ipad mini color is great and bright fits just right over the mini ipad great job well done
5	1400803200	Bought it for a friend who is crazy about pink. She absolutely loves it. The business card holder was an extra bonus. We'll worth the price.
1	1400716800	I am so disappointed. This item is not returnable or refundable even though they sent me the wrong thing. I ordered the cover for the iPad Air, and they send me the pad for the iPad Mini. Be super careful to see if they are sending you the item you ordered. I am so disappointed.
5	1400716800	Love he color, love that it had inserts for u to put ur credit card or notes inside and it comes with a usable pen and the end is a rubber tip so u can use it like a finger to tap away on ur mini so u won't get finger marks all over the screen. Or if u have fat fingers that rubber pen comes in handy. And the flip to make it stand on its own, super sturdy. I recommended to my sorority sisters and they lived it so much hey bought a few for their friends and family too.
5	1400716800	I love to watch movies while I am lying in bed, but my neck and shoulder would get tired after holding my iPad for a while.  I got this i-BLASON case, thinking the strap would ease the tension on my neck, arm and shoulder while lying in bed watching movies, and I was right.  This is a sturdy little case, made very well, and the auto-wake/sleep works perfectly.  The strap is very sturdy as well, and the stylus was a nice added bonus!
4	1400630400	I love this cover.  The only thing I don't like is that the top left hand side is a little too clunky and it is difficult to click on the screen that has items on the far left.  I also have not been able to stand it upright.  For the price, it does what you need it to do.  The screen locks as soon as you close the cover. It isn't that flimsy and it is comfortable to hold.
5	1400630400	it fits very well and the carry handle is a real plus offers great protection for my tablet very pleased with my purchase
5	1400544000	This is a wonderful iPad case.  It is very easy to use for a stand and to use so you can hold the iPad with one hand.  While it does not provide the protection of an Otterbox or other heavyweight case, it is very functional and fashionable.
5	1400544000	This is great product, for the price and for its construction. Looks great without any added weight to the ipad air.
4	1400544000	I can honestly say I have seen almost all the options for low-range iPad cases. The materials are high-quality and the case holds the iPad securely without adding too much bulky the auto wake feature is a must and the magnet helps the case shut firmly. The stand isn't ideal--I prefer some grooves in the cover to vary my stand height, but this design doesn't allow for it. Overall, this is the case to get if you want to protect your $500 purchase, have a stand, and do so without adding too much bulk to your slim little iPad.
5	1400457600	I'm very pleased with this purchase. The quality of the product is superb! It does everything it is supposed to do. I have zero complaints.
5	1400284800	I have two of these black and pink and they are great cases.  I have a fill size iPad with a Apple case and I would take this case over that case any day.
5	1400284800	I bought this cover for my son. It is sturdy, beautiful and gets compliments ALL the time! The cover is versatile and has multiple ways to handle it like the pictures show you. Beats the apple store and mall ipad cover options in every way. Best value for money. Easily the best cover out there and the price makes it unbeatable.
5	1400284800	This has lasted me a long time. A very practical item, glad I purchased it. Will purchase it again, thanky thanky.! I was surprised that this was a sturdy item...it wasn't crappy.
5	1400284800	I bought this case in purple after my Roocase broke. I would have to say it is not as deep a purple as I was hoping, but I have gotten used to the shade of purple- and I do like it. The case feels good in my hands and feels sturdy and protective for my iPad Mini. It is a high quality case. I don't need the credit card slots or the pen slot. The things I wish were different are: I wish the stylus pen holder was on top instead of on the side, I wish the area around the main round button left a bit more room for my finger, and I wish that the case was just a bit more streamlined around the edges. I love that it has a strap, which was a determining factor in my choosing this particular case. Actually I was only looking for a case with a strap. All this being said, and with nothing being perfect in life, I do really like this case and I am happy with it each time I use my iPad Mini. I would buy it again. :)
5	1400112000	Works we'll for me.  Please with every aspect of this case. Would have love it in a deeper shade of purple.
4	1400025600	Pretty neat case for the prize, comes with a pen/stylus which is pretty useless unless you're into using that(stylus).  Outside cover creased on first hour of use, and is a little too flimsy for my taste. Overall product is 4/5 stars. You get what you pay for.
5	1400025600	I tend to research before making a purchase, and I read many reviews before making a decision. With that said, IAM very happy with this purchase. I chose the black for its universal compatibility to all my accessories. The texture and look is elegant, the inside suede-look feels nice also and It fits my iPad Air perfectly. It was important that I had a pen holder and and the elastic hand grip and this case fills that; the stylus pen included is a nice touch yet I already decided on Musemee Notier V2 as my go to pen and stylus. The iPad side tend to slack down from the weight when you are holding it vertically with the elastic hand grip, I remedied that with a black grip hair band; not enough to take a star off, just FYI.
5	1400025600	I enjoy my new Apple iPad Mini Case. Fits perfectly and easier to carry and most of all, it is very light. Great price too!
5	1399939200	This is the best ipad cover .  It is very well made , fine materials and the magnet closes the ipad just perfectly. It was very well packed and delivered .
5	1399939200	There are so many great reviews here, as this is the best ipad mini cover I have used.The price is very good.It fits perfect. The magnetic cover works perfect and its tight, does not open.You can use the handle while working on the ipad. or it can stand.The stylist/pen I love..I'm a women with medium nails, and my nails would get in the way..but not when I use the Stylist.The cover looks, and feels like leather..( hubby has the leather , can't tell the difference)This is not big and bulky. It fits in my purse, and I do not wear big purses..Two thumbs up.
4	1399852800	Arrived quickly. Arrived as was described in the details. Works great, just what was needed for iPad mini's. Good quality!
5	1399852800	I love this item great it's held up with a 13 year old autistic boy. Protected the iPad great service
5	1399852800	I love the color purple and this is a good color. The cover is handy, protects my iPad and I love the stylist holder on the side. On the air plan its nice to have my credit card handy.
5	1399766400	Not wanting to spend &#34;brand A's&#34; price for a cover for my new iPad, I found this great  item on Amazon for a lot less.  The details are well thought out, the color choices are good, and the quality is better than expected.  My favorite moment was getting a compliment from the clerk at the &#34;A&#34; store.  When I told him the price, the look on his face was very amusing.
4	1399593600	Love it and it everyday with my I pad air. Made well. Fits good. With lid shut off which shuts off power when closed.
1	1399593600	This thing has no protective abilities at all and is impossible to take out. I think I should use sciccors to cut it off.
5	1399507200	This is the perfect cover for my iPad mini!  Quality construction, great to have the attached pen loop and comes with a cute little pen/sylus, although I've replaced that with my own stylus which I prefer. Sleep and wake function works perfectly and helps to save battery, and the ability to prop it at an angle is handy, although I generally use it in my hand.  the raised edge (due to the thickness of the material) does make it a bit difficult at times for the touch feature to be &#34;read&#34; at the very outside edges of the screen, but this has rarely been a problem.  Great price for a high-quality and great-looking protective cover!
4	1399507200	Unlike other iPad covers, this one is definitely not cheap-looking. Good quality material and love the color. It comes with a pen and a pen holder, both VERY handy during trips when you're not caring a purse.
5	1399420800	I didn't care for the pen and styllus.  The pen ran out of ink and skipped.  The quality of it was not good.  Howver, a different type of styllus works well with it.  I love the ease of use.  I read, and read, and read.  It is so quick it makes me impatient with my office PC.  ;)
5	1399248000	Absolutely love this I-blason case for my IPad Air.  It is a perfect fit, and I love the bright green color.  It also allows for much more comfortable reading of my Kindle books, thanks to the nice strap on the back ( when in the opened position).
5	1399248000	This Case works great and I live the soft blue color! Stylus - pen combo is very durable. Does not make my iPad any heavier than my previous case.
5	1399248000	I have similar one with keyboard  but it's little bit feel heavy  when I want to use on my knee for surfing.  So I have this now.  Feel  lighter and  hold little bit easier with handle band (because I feel it's little bit loose)  I like able to hold pen too.  One thing I don,t care but different from this picture is other side of cover is gray  not pink !!!!
5	1399161600	Wonderful, sturdy, durable.  Love the cardholder slots for when I don't need a purse but my license and a credit card!  Love the pen holder as well.  Please make this in bling!  With rhinestones/Crystal designs!!!
4	1399075200	This is a solid leather cover, and good value for the money.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cover doesn't stand very well. It could be because the leather is new and stiff, but the areas where it is supposed to fold and create a stand does not form the necessary shape. With time, it might break-in and be OK.
4	1399075200	Its a well finished product and holds my ipad air perfectly. Slots are well designed. It feels durable too and after a few months of use it still has not shown wear and tear. The only problem for me is that it has a single viewing anle and not multiple positions. but it still works for me.
4	1398988800	Product arrived and looks just as pictured. It is very convenient, easy to hold and also stylish. Glad I ordered it.
4	1398902400	I like having this cover because it has the handle on the back for holding and a built-in stylus holder, which can sometimes get in the way of the buttons on the side.  It makes my iPad air very heavy.  I got the sir. Excuse of the slim, light weight.  I might as well have a regular iPad with this cover.
3	1398816000	It is a good cover and will protect your ipad mini but it doesn't look very snazzy. It looks like a little diary book.Like they say you get what you pay for..
3	1398816000	I bought it for the hand strap.  That works fine.  The problem I have is with the tab on the back which holds the flap in place.  It makes for an often unstable desk stand.
5	1398729600	This is a wonderful cover. I was scared it wouldn't be because of the price but it's so great. My parents ended up buying themselves one too after seeing ours
5	1398729600	All I wanted it to be.  Perfect for my use. Like the color, as I can see it from across the room
5	1398729600	This case is thin, lightweight and easy to use. Love that it has a holder for the stylus. The hand strap makes it so easy to hold while taking pictures.
5	1398729600	This case is very nice. Of course I love the hot pink color! It's very soft & flexible, yet sturdy enough to stand up & support  the IPad.  I take my IPAD with me a lot so it's very protective. I would highly recommend this product.
4	1398643200	I bought this case because I wanted a case where my mini could be removed quickly to mount in the car and had a strap to make it more secure to hold when taking the mini shopping.  The case arrived quickly and is exactly as described.  The mini slides easily into the case and is securely held.  The hand strap helps secure when hold in the hand.  The case includes a place for a stylus.  I don't use the stylus that came with the case, because I have a lynktec true glide apex which fits perfectly.  I like the ease in which the ipad mini can be inserted and removed from this case.  Very happy with my purchase.
5	1398643200	I'm writing this review just after few weeks of use, therefore I cannot comment on the durability of the product itself.I believe this case offers a suitable protection for my iPad. Compared to other brands it may looks less sturdy, but it has the features I was looking for. Just make sure you tighten the velcro strap inside to get precise alignment of the case openings with the iPad.I like the Auto Wake/Sleep. The stylus is an ink-ball pen on one side (not for handwriting on the iPad as I mistakenly thought).Happy camper so far.
5	1398643200	I am so glad that I purchased this cover for my I Pad Mini. Just this past weekend I dropped it on the floor twice and didn't even phase it. I recommend you purchase this cover, it is the best purchase for the price.
5	1398556800	better quality than i expected and feels nice in the hand. will protect the ipad from drops not to far from ground
5	1398556800	I bought this case w/o any research, my ipad was on its way and spending $50 for an apple case didn't make sense.  This has been a great little investment for easy use of my ipad air
5	1398556800	Its is good to use. I loved it. I recommened it to anyone who wanna purchase this product. Thank you.
5	1398556800	It fit my mini with retina display perfectly.  Good quality.  Awesome buy.  The price was so worth the purchase .
5	1398297600	I really like this Mini iPad case - great, bright pink color, fit the iPad well, can access all ports and buttons easily, and works just as described. Only time will tell how it holds up with greater use.
4	1398211200	I love this case it's perfect! Stylish, black leather, snug fit, and of course sexy! I had read reviews prior to buying this case and read that it would take sometime for the stand to sit correctly,  but my case stood up perfectly the 1st time and has every time since.4 stars and not 5, only because when you fold the cover back if you don't hold it with your left hand in the strap the cover doesn't stay attached to the backside, &#34;Hey I-Blason, 1 word, magnets, and you'd get 5 stars from me&#34;I do recommend this case and the price is more than reasonable. Make sure to buy the I-Blason screen protectors very easy application and great look.
5	1398211200	This case has everything, holds up well.  Seriously, I couldn't be happier with this product.  I would recommend it to everyone!
5	1398211200	I got this form my little one - she loves pink. The tablet fits well and she brings this everywhere. I has held strong so far and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lite case for their Ipad mini.
5	1398124800	It fit perfectly.  Doesn't make the device too heavy.  Not bulky at all.  Love it.  Would definitely recommend it for anyone.
5	1398124800	Great purchase. Love this case and color. Fits iPad Air perfectly.  Flexible yet protective. Like the hand strap and stand positioning. Works well. My case was soft grey in the inside, instead of the pink as pictured. The only thing that would make this case better would be an elastic band to hold back flap up while in open position. Good product for price!
5	1398038400	LOVE IT, LOVE IT , LOVE IT. I have 2 of  ipad air and i got this case for each one. I use ipad for my business and i am constantly on it. It has a nice handle and you dont have to worry about dropping it. Case is soft to the touch and very cushiony. Once you close it it would put it to sleep and save on you battery.I dont think its a realy leather but quality is good.
2	1398038400	I returned this item because the stylus loop wouldn't hold any of the sizes I have.  It was too small of a loop.
5	1398038400	I was scared the quality would not be the best due to the low price. I was pleasantly surprised. The stylus/pen is awesome and is a really nice pen to write with as well.
3	1398038400	This product works as advertised. There is some issues with the standing features, but overall, it works and looks good.
5	1398038400	Excellent . Looks great, and fits like a glove. My wife loves it for her mini I -pad. For the money you can't find a better deal for this kind of quality. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend to all.
4	1397952000	I am very pleased with my black i-BLASON iPad Air Case. I use my iPad Air everyday for business. I would definitely recommend to a friend and would purchase again.ProsThe very best thing is the stylus. No more missed keyboard keys and no more smudgy screen!The case looks very polished and it is very well made. Not a single scratch yet and I take it everywhere.My iPad is held firmly in place and doesn't shift around. There is a velcro strap that holds the iPad in place has room for adjustment. As long as you fasten it snuggly it will not shift loosely around as reported in other reviews.The stand puts my iPad at the perfect angle to access at my work desk.I use the pocket for my business cards, its really handy when working with clients.The very best thing is the stylus. No more missed keyboard keys and no more smudgy screen!I do feel my iPad is safely protected from drops and scratches.ConsThe hand strap is pretty pointless. The case cover is loose in the back and just flops around with your hand in the strap.It does add weight to the iPad Air. However, I don't believe there is a functional case out there yet that offers this level of protection that weighs less. I do feel my iPad is safely protected from drops and scratches.OverallFor the price, you can't beat it. I highly recommend this product.
5	1397952000	We've used this type of cover on our other iPads but they were made by another company. When I learned our favorite company didn't make a cover for a mini I took a chance on this one. I am NOT disappointed! It is well made, handsome, and provides the protection we require.
5	1397865600	This cover works every way that was mentioned. Looks good and feels good. I can't think of anything to improve.
5	1397865600	I love this case!  I can fold it back to skype, and the protection for my screen is invaluable.  I definitely recommend it.
2	1397779200	It seems to have been corrected since, however the description claimed 'PU leather' when I ordered this. I would not order synthetic leather! This is very cheap quality and smells horrible!
5	1397692800	He loves this. It's sturdy too for his 4 year old daughter to handle. It is sturdy and closes nicely.
5	1397606400	I like the construction, the on/off feature, and the protection it gives my new iPad mini! I can't imagine using the iPad without it.
5	1397606400	I like the auto sleep and the holder for the stylus as well as the foldable case for standing it up.Unlike the case I bought at an office supply store for my Kindle which holds the device in with 4 elastic pcs. in the corners, the mini fits into a frame so it doesn't slide around.
5	1397606400	I've been very happy with this case, it fits the mini well and the sleep/wake function works perfectly.  The pen/stylus is a nice bonus, and the strap is helpful as well.
2	1397520000	Angle of incline appears a lot better on the image displayed. Nothing close in realty.If all you want is a good looking case and you will  lay your mini ipad almost flat on a surface then BINGO! Ended up getting a firm case with a built-in Bluetooth keyboard. Despite a few keys that do not sync it works great like a mini net-book when I  have use for the key board.
5	1397520000	This cover its great very easy to handle and it covers it great. Nice price very cheap for great cover
4	1397520000	My wife likes it.  It's both a good cover and protector. I examined it and found that the IPad fits snugly in the case without being hard to insert. All the essential buttons and lens' are uncovered and usable. When the cover is used as a stand in the horizontal position, it is quite stable. When used in the vertical position, it is unstable. This is not a problem since, in the preferred manner, it is not used in this position, anyway. The hand-hold strap in back is a nice touch. It allows you to safely hold and operate the IPad when standing or sitting without having table or desk-top support. The soft felt inner surface protects against scratches to the face. The outer cover is a sturdy leather or leather look alike. Stitching is uniform and matches the colors of the back and inner covers. Overall, a quality case!
3	1397520000	Wish it tipped the I pad up more, doesn't help much. The bent part needs to be deeper so it stands up higher
5	1397520000	One of the best place to shop is Amazon.  I really like my cover and specially the price.  I am sure they have better one there but the most important thing for me is that my mini is protected
5	1397520000	Very very good case. Love it. Very easy to use and my Ipad is safe. Will recommend to everyone. Good
4	1397347200	This is just what I needed for my classroom.  I case I could walk around with that has a hand strap so that I don't have to worry about dropping the iPad.  The case fits fine as well.  The only issue is when you have the tablet in landscape and you want to swipe up from the bottom to get the control panel.  I have to pull the case back a bit, but I think that would be the same with any case.  I like the &#34;credit card&#34; pockets.  I am able to use it to put notes in.  Overall it was just what I was looking for and at a great price.
5	1397260800	Good. Product quality is as expected.  Easy to hold at hand..The purple is the one I was hoping for. So satisfied with my purchase.
4	1397260800	The fit is good and it has provided fall protection on to ceramic from about four feet. There was a faint odor when first opened, but went away I a day or two. The only reason I did not give five stars is that in landscape mode it is difficult to activate the control screen. You have to pull back the edge of the case. I think this would be an issue with any case this style. Works fine in portrait. All device ports, buttons etc. are in the right place. I have given it heavy use for a month and it looks good. Magnetic lock working.
3	1397174400	It's alright. The stylus is cheap and you have to use it directly 90 degrees from the mini iPad otherwise it won't work. The slit for the hand doesn't really help much. Once you try to use it, the cover is flimsy so doesn't support well. Kinda wished I got another case.
5	1397088000	Perfect for the iPad. comfortable . It feels secure.. resistant to dirt and just as expected.  I would  recommended. .
4	1397001600	Looks great, feels great - highly recommend! I especially like the &#34;strap&#34; for holding it up like a book. Also, there's just enough of a &#34;texture&#34; to make it easy to grasp and carry around without worrying about dropping it. The only thing that would make it 5 star worthy would be to have two 'notches' for increased angles when propped open.
5	1397001600	The price and quality is unbeatable.  I'm pretty content.  The extra features make it really stand out against the competition.  This will be great for showing my customers our product catalog.  It is also extremely light and the stylus bonus makes this deal all the more attractive!
4	1397001600	So far I really like the case and can't complain. Not crazy about the stylus but that's irrelevant. Great price and exactly what I needed. Happy with my purchase!
5	1396828800	We've had this cover for a little over 8 months and it has served us well. It has done a great job protecting our iPad and looks great:)
5	1396656000	Very protective, very sturdy, and very high quality. It's exactly what I wanted. Even the felt like inner liner is holding up and showing no dirt.  great product.
3	1396656000	I like this case and it is well made. I just find myself not wanting to use it because it when the case is opened and your hand is in the holder the ipad is too heavy for the case and it slips down. It is hard to explain but basically the case needs something to secure it open to the back of the ipad so that it can be held without slipping.
5	1396656000	This case is really nice.  It protects the iPad but is not bulky.  I like that it has a handle too.
5	1396569600	I am so glad I bought this. The price was great. The color was true. The quality is wonderful. Very happy with my purchase.
5	1396569600	This is the perfect case for my iPad Mini. The quality is good and the design is better. The loop to slip your hand in to hold it really helps and when you close the lid it puts the unit into sleep mode.
5	1396483200	It is the best thing ever, with the pen along with the pointer it's just awesome, thank you very much
3	1396483200	It sometimes doesn't stay standing.  The case protects the ipad air well, but now I will buy another one that is designed differently. It has two or three &#34;grooves&#34; for selection of how you want it to stand.  My sister has one, so now I will spend money on the better one.
5	1396396800	This is a beautiful case.  Looks very professional and price is great. The case fits my IPad mini perfectly and all the cut outs are in the right place.
5	1396396800	Nice leather case to the iPad for protection and handling. The hand strap is a nice touch to have the secure feel of control when moving around.
4	1396310400	It was Ok and worked fairly well for the price, I used it for awhile and have since purchased a better quality one, but for the money it worked.
5	1396224000	Item has a snug fit and looks good.  The handgrip comes in handy.  The stylus is functional.  Would buy again
5	1396051200	Fits my iPad Mini like a glove. The only thing I wasn't happy with was the stylus pen that came with didn't write..
3	1396051200	THIS IS OK FOR THE MINI APPLE IPAD BUT THE PRICE WASN'T GOOD DEAL AT ALL. I COULDN'T RETURN LAST TIME BECAUSE THE COST OF SHIPPING IT BACK TO SELLER. IT DOESN'T NOT STAND UP WELL KEEP FALLEN OFF.
5	1395964800	Having owned an iPhone for years I was not disappointed with the retina version of the mini ipad.  Easy to use, fast, and great screen
5	1395878400	Very nice case and really holds the IPad well.  No way it's going to slip out of this case, even if you have the opening to the bottom.  Love the color.  Hope the case will wear well.  Seems like it will.  What I really liked is that the inside material didn't smell like with some cases I've bought.  Overall, good buy.  And so much more reasonably priced than going to one of the electronic stores.
5	1395878400	This case fit my mini perfectly. It's very nice and works great. I recommend this case, it's perfect protection without being too bulky and a fantastic price.
5	1395878400	Good quality case. Works perfect for my Ipad mini. All the holes line up in the right place. The stylus pen works well. Would buy again
5	1395792000	I bought this cover as a replacement cover for my iPad Air. I really didn't want to spend another fortune on a cover.  Found this and thought I would give it a try. The price was right and I loved the color.  It even comes with a pen stylus that fits handily onto the pad.  Cover is light weight but has a nice sturdy construction.  A good deal for the price.
4	1395705600	This cover is exactly what I was looking for to protect my new iPad Air. The color is vibrant and the material is strong and sturdy. There is a convenient stylus holder on the side and I like the handle on the back. The stand isn't great, but that's not a big enough negative to prevent me from buying another one. I really like the stylus pen, especially because it has a smaller tip - unfortunately, the tip split after about 4 months of use and the pen does not have a replaceable tip, so it had to be discarded. I would give this product a 5 star rating if the included stylus had the option of replacing the tip. I love the cover!
5	1395532800	Really like the look and feel of the leatherette cover. The option to stand it up and view is ok with me. But iPAD MINI is a hands on device.  Like the stylus/pen. Never used a stylus before, but have found it better than my fat fingers.
5	1395532800	It is the perfect pink color I wanted, price was good. It shipped fast. It's less than a year old, i use it multiple times daily and it is holding up. I would buy a new one when this one gets too dirty.
5	1395532800	Nice features.  Feels solid (if not terribly padded).  Great fit for new mini.  And so far is withstanding use by a rambunctious 9 year old.
5	1395446400	I bought this case around Christmas time (the same time I bought the iPad Mini w/Retina Display) and I was skeptical at first, seeing how this case was at least $40 cheaper than similar cases I saw in big box stores. When I got it, I was pleasantly surprised how sturdy and how it was really made of leather! No smells, no offsetting holes for inputs, plus my Mini fitted perfectly in it. I've had it four months and had to take it out of its case only once.From what I've read in the reviews, there were concerns about scratches and discoloring. I got a black iPad and I got the matching Black i-Blason case, and so far my iPad looks good as new still.I highly recommend this case. It is well worth the money.
5	1395446400	I wasn't sure with the low price how nice this cover would be, I am pleasantly surprised!+ + Materials are quality and color are professional looking.- negatives are - no screen protector and the retaining piece that holds in upright position slips out, it should be longer or have Velcro.Overall better than expected, worth the money.
5	1395446400	I haven' t used it as this is served as a gift to my daughter and as requested by her. So far it looks like perfect and workmanship is excellent.
5	1395360000	Very good case, especially I liked stylus that was in the package. Also the leather has a very good quality
5	1395273600	I own several iPad covers but absolutely love this one for it's ease of use and attached stylus (which I use a lot).  It's also lighter weight and not as bulky, so it fits more comfortably in a purse.
5	1395273600	This cover meets my requirements of protection and ease of use.  The handle was a question for me until I determined it was to help in taking photos by holding the cover away from the lens.Great cover!
4	1395273600	Just what I wanted.... Fits and stands very wellDownside..... Not flawless.... A lil mis shaped and not cut out properly
4	1395187200	I just received my i-BLASON iPad mini Smart Cover Case yesterday. Overall, I like this product, If I had not read prior reviews, I wouldn't have figured out that there is a velcro enclosure that you have to unsecure to slip the iPad mini in. I could see that posing a problem for consumers. Also, the color of the product I received is not as light pink as it is in the picture. However, I do like that I can slip my hand in the strap to hold the case/iPad mini. This product was a good purchase and I would probably recommend it to others.
5	1395187200	I love the cover! It's so durable & sturdy, plus the lime green color is great. However, the stylus pen broke right away. The tip literally came unscrewed (and I wasn't even using that end of the pen!). I couldn't get it back together again, and so I ended up throwing it out and buying a set of new stylus pens thatseem to be of a much better quality.
5	1395187200	Fits iPad mini perfectly. Makes it a lot easier to hold for long periods of time. Durable and wake/sleep cover is a nice touch.
5	1395100800	I really like this case. My boyfriend, daughter and I use this on a daily basis. It has taken a good beating but still looks great. The stand has been holding up great.
4	1395100800	Loved this but had to return it because it did not fit in my lab coat pocket.  I loved the handle and the protection provided.
4	1395100800	Doesn't hold the iPad very well in the more upright position.  Love the stylus and holder.  While not specific to this product, I would like to see a hole in the cover for the camera lens so when the cover is folded back the lens remains unobstructed.
1	1395014400	Case is alright. Because of the magnetic cover it was always turning off my iPad while I was using it.  I ended up purchasing something else.
3	1395014400	Had to make the hole bigger for the camera.  It's a little floppy looking but it protects the IPad & that's all I was concerned about.
1	1394928000	This cover was not a good fit for my Mini. I was not happy with the angles available. I liked the having the stylus with it, but it was not comfortable for me to use.  I think it is a good case, just not for me.
4	1394755200	This item is decent for the price. It is my first i pad so accessories are new to me. I like the strap for holding the ipad. It's a little unsteady for using as shown in picture.I am sure there are better products for a higher price but for now this works for me.
2	1394755200	I was finding it difficult to charge the IPAD. The case was big and loose, it was covering the start button area.
5	1394668800	Great quality, good fit, and I love the pen holder, hand hold, and business card holder. I didn't think I would use the card holder, but it's very nice to stick a card with your information in there, at least you stand a chance of getting a lost iPad back! I would buy this again!
5	1394668800	It is a sturdy case. Definitely gonna protect  my mini!! The color is also very cute and is true to the photo
5	1394582400	This is a real value for the money.  It costs more than 50 bucks for a similar one in Best Buy. Am happy with it.
3	1394582400	The case has a good quality. However, auto wake/sleep feature is not working. I am a little disappointed. Anyway, I decide to keep it.
4	1394496000	This case is okay and it will do what it is advertised to do.  We ended up getting a different case for our sales people.
5	1394496000	I love this case!  It is soft, yet durable.  The purple one I purchased was a bit darker than the picture showed and I love it even more.  I am really enjoying my purchase.
5	1394496000	This is my favorite Case.  I use ipads in my job with teachers, and have seen a variety of cases....I plan to find one of these for the larger size ipad, as it is the best I have found!
5	1394496000	We've been using this for a while and it has stood up to the test of time and use. Would buy again
5	1394496000	I upgraded from an iPad 1 to the iPad Air and I needed a new protective case for when I take it with me away from home.  I saw the i-BLASON case and read the reviews and decided to get it.  When I received it I thought it would be like my old one for the iPad original but I was wrong.  I was surprised to find that it has a velcro strip on the fold over hold in flap that holds it in firmly.  I was also pleased with the  Auto-Awake feature that brings the screen on when I open the case.  I also like the stylus/pen that accompanied the case because the stylus actually works great.  I bought one for my old iPad but it didn't work worth a hoot.  I actually can't think of anything negative about this case.  It's definately worth the reasonable price.
5	1394496000	I have been extremely pleased with how well this case was made, especially for the price.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for daily protection for  their iPad.
5	1394409600	Very nice case and gives great protection! It is a great fit for the iPad mini.  I would recommend this if you have a young child who drops things frequently.
5	1394323200	The case fits very snug on the ipad mini, and very secure. Color is true to image, and the stylus is pretty good quality as well. All in all an amazing case, especially for the price point.i would like to point out though that the elastic is a bit wobbly, at least for my tiny hands. But nothing too horrible.
4	1394323200	These where purchased for work, to hold the Ipads for the doctors in our office.  They seem to be holding up well with daily use.  The stylus is a great addition along with the strap to hold easily and show patients image results.
5	1394323200	So I didn't mean to order this.  I have the ipad mini not the air.  So the only complaint I have is that you have to be very careful to make sure you have selected the correct item.  Within the one page there are buttons to push to select color and size I thought for sure I had clicked the mini button but it either switch back or didn't fully switch???  So I got this one on accident.That being said:  My friend has the full size Ipad and took this so I didn't have to send back.  She really likes it.  Seems to be really good quality.  We were please with that.
3	1394064000	Not the best case I have ever own nor the worse Using it till I get the perfect case, and I still am looking
3	1394064000	I ordered a pink case for my iPad mini with retina. It does not fit properly and the edges of the case overlap onto the screen which makes it difficult to click anywhere on edge of screen.
5	1393977600	Love it! The color, the size is perfect for me.  I which it came with a clear cover to protect my screen.
5	1393804800	I like that it came with a little stylus. Another huge plus was having the elastic band for your hand on the backside. The only downfall is it wasn't tight enough because my hands are smaller. I bought it for my boyfriend though and it works just fine for larger hands. It made holding the iPad mini much easier. Without a case, we had to grip the corners of the iPad tightly to avoid touching the screen when passing it to eachother. The case helps alleviate that issue. Overall, the style and look of the case is professional and practical.
4	1393718400	I really like this case so far. The pen that comes with the iPad cover is a little cheap though. You have to kind of push hard with it. Harder than you would your finger. But overall, great.
4	1393718400	The iBlason Apple iPad Air Auto Wake/ Sleep Smart Case works great. I like how secure it feels - holds & protects as it should. I had to try a few times, but finally found how to make the case a stand. Movie viewing stand works great. Keyboarding angle not as great, but OK. All in all a good buy. Did you know you can turn on/off auto case sleep/wake on your iPad? So, you might not see it at first. Even comes with a pen/stylus. Kind of handy when meeting/networking.
4	1393632000	Good but too bulky, takes too much room in my bag. Also doesn't stand as well as I was expecting. But very good for the price.
5	1393545600	pen is a true pen. Can be used both on the tablet as on real paper. Flexible, cover can support a few different positions.
4	1393545600	It is a good cover for the iPad air.  The color is pretty.  I lost the stylus within the first 24 hours of having it so I would not buy it for that - it didn't stay in very well.
1	1393545600	I got the pink one. The color inside was grey not like the picture at all. There is no handle too. I am disappointed.
5	1393459200	The fit was perfect and lighter in weight than I had expected.Would have liked to have added my initials on it if it were an available option.
5	1393459200	I purchased this product in black for my iPad Air and I love it! It provides great protection and fits perfectly! The case is exactly as described by the seller. The auto sleep/wake function works without fail as well. It's a little hard to make the case stand up and fold into the right place, if I used this feature a more I think it would become less stiff and fold into place easier. The case is very snug and holds the iPad right in place. It's incredibly easy to insert and remove the iPad unlike with some other cases. The case included a bonus stylus pen which is very nice.  Overall, this is an incredibly nice case, the black color is beautiful, and has a professional look to it. The case provides awesome protection without being bulky, and I highly recommend this case.
5	1393459200	This cover is very smart and attractive and the quality of the material is quite good.  The functionality is great and I can recommend this highly.
5	1393459200	Lovely, useful, protects well and doesn't seem to wear out.  True color representation.  Also, the magnetic keyboard from another case adheres to this one too,
5	1393459200	I love this case. The color is great, but I'm a little pink crazy. The price is perfect for what you get, and it does exactly what it says. Conclusion: I recommend this product for the price.
5	1393372800	my wife loves it.  the pen works great for moving the screen if your finger gets tired.  the  strap keeps you ipad from falling on the floor when you fall to sleep browsing or reading those boring emails.  the quality of the material is good.  it feels like leather not some cheap plastic.  it shipped quickly and you can easily recharge in the case.  the stand is great for facetime with your grand daughter or friends.  buy it you will enjoy it. regards
4	1393286400	this case works really well. I like the design, all the features and the stand. Sometimes when you close the lid it doesn't turn off the iPad.
5	1393200000	great quality, sleek and professional. wish the back portion latched on to the flat when open and in use. Otherwise, it is everything i wanted.
5	1393200000	I love this iPad case it fits great and looks great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with the new iPad air.
4	1393200000	the quality of this case for the price is really good, the pen is not that useful though because the pad pen is very soft and it doesn't work correctly.
5	1393200000	Love this cover and all the extra's :-)Would definately reccomend, much nicer than expected.Will probably order in more colors
5	1393113600	Whoever designed this did a beautiful job. It is functional - light, stands up at two different levels, has the sleep magnet feature, the strap to grab it by if needed, and the credit card slots and even a pen. It fits my iPad mini perfectly. And it is lovely too!
5	1393027200	Very handy cover - looks nice and does a great job protecting mini. Stylus could use some improvement - doesn't work very well (have to push down pretty hard).
5	1393027200	Love, Love, Love this case and i have tried a dozen or more. Love color choices because i like to be able to spot my Pad easily. Love the stylus holder many don't have that feature. Those that do, such as Belkin, cost way more. Auto wake works great so far. No smell, material is superb! Great fit and excellent price. Even has a convenient card holder - again like the Belkin but way less. Only downside would be the border. Since the bevel is so thin on the Pad, the border from this case can make using the entire face of the Pad challenging. You will love it otherwise and smile when you see others who have paid way more knowing yours is as nice with a great price. Also when you pay less, it gives you the opportunity to own several cases as i do. I have a Zagg bluetooth which i love and one that allows access to the entire real estate of the Pad.
5	1393027200	It is everything as advertised. You would pay at least three times that much in a retail store.  Love it & would definately recommend it!
4	1393027200	Cases for iPad Airs are still really high. This one was priced right. I like the purple color.  The hand strap and the slots for business cards are a nice extra feature.
5	1392940800	Excellent case. Looks like it should cost 3 times what it does. Very happy with this case for iPad Mini.
5	1392940800	Love my pink mini iPad cover. It's versatile, high quality, & it's excellent protection for you mini iPad. Buy it!
4	1392854400	I've had this case on my iPad Mini for several months now and I really like it. It's held up much better than the Poetic case that I had on it before. The stylus that comes with it is OK, I ordered a better stylus because I like a pen that has a finer point. Also the pad on the stylus came off and I couldn't find a replacement for it. It still looks almost as good as the day I bought it, and it gets well used. I throw it in and out of my back pack all the time, and it's open & closed several times a day.
4	1392854400	I love the color I really enjoy the design. It works perfectly with my mini iPad and it does the job. I'd recommend it
4	1392768000	Bought this for iPad air.ProsPerfectly fits and secures the ipad.Auto wake/sleep works fineConsipad air looks bulky with this casethe stylus is worthless junkI don't use the elastic hand strap and don't feel it comfortable. May be its just me.
5	1392768000	Great cover for iPad.  Even has a spot for stylus and for  .credit card or small paper.  I gully recommend
2	1392681600	The stylus broke within 2 days and it's already starting to wear. Not happy with this purchase at all. Would not recommend.
5	1392681600	This is a good quality case. I like the look and feel of it. It protects my ipad well also. I would buy another case from this company.
5	1392595200	This is  high quality product.  I wanted a cover that would give me the features that this one has.  I especially wanted one that had a stylus holder.  The stylus that came with it was ok but I wantd to use my Wacom one which is fatter and it works great in the holder on this cover.  The strap is handy and is securely attached.  I was surprised at the high quality for the price, I would highly recommend this product!
5	1392595200	I don't understand a lot of the negative reviews, this case protects my mini yet allows me to access all its functions, buttons, etc.  What I have found most useful, yet when I ordered it, I thought it was just a gimmick -- is the stylus.  I have found myself using it more and more.  I looked at a lot of cases both on line and in various stores before purchasing the I-blazon from Amazon, but settled on it after reading a lot of the user reviews.  I have come to the conclusion that some people will write negative reviews for some of the most insignificant reasons.If you want a case that protects your ipad mini, yet allows you to easily access all its functions, I could not recommend a better case.  The only &#34;negative&#34; as far as my experience was the cost of shipping, by the time you added that to the tax now imposed on all online purchases from Amazon, it tends to drive the price up pretty quickly.  But I accepted that given how well built this case is, plus it was delivered directly to my door.
1	1392595200	I'm very disappointed with this product, the stylist/pen specifically.  This item isn't all that sturdy while propped up, but  after just a couple short days and no harsh conditions, the stylist pen broke, the rubber end fell off completely and the pen won't even retract back up after just 4-5 uses!!  I had hopped it would be simple to just get it replaced as I'm happy enough with the case, but come to find out after trying to get a replacement, that they won't do so, but will only do a complete refund!!! I'm not happy at all, that I, the customer, have been inconvenienced and the company won't do what's needed to make it right, but instead tells me I have to go through the entire choosing, buying and waiting for it to ship process, all over again because of their bad product! I myself am a business owner as well and this is NOT good business!! Be safe and go with a different seller!!- Tyla G.
5	1392595200	A great cover that arrived quickly and provides all the features I needed. An added bonus is the neat stylus/pen that is included.
5	1392595200	I am very happy with the the quality of the construction of the i-BLASON.  The stylus is a hany addition. Would recommend the i-BLASON to a friend.
5	1392595200	Meet the needs I was looking for. It fit my Ipad perfectly and I love the color purple and this was a beautiful color.
5	1392508800	My wife bought this case well over a year ago and she still loves it. The quality is excellent and you won't regret the purchase.
4	1392508800	First shipment was incorrect color - green !  I ordered the black.Amazon weblink would not allow online return but to call them on this product - why?  Amazon did not know.Amazon refunded $$ of the incorrect color within 4biz day.But had to place another order and received in 3days.Satisfied with the material and fit of the cover. Slight inconvenience with this cover are the sound buttons are harder to reach with finger.I do not use the cover as a stand; and the stand fold does not hold up as they should.I use the iPad more in a landscape view so I just swing the cover over to fold and place my finger between the folds when using the iPad.
5	1392422400	Needed something to protect my iPad mini and this was perfect for me. Looks well made and is very slim. I had no issues with the stand feature.
5	1392336000	I bought this last year and it still works good. Worth the price. After the year small wear but works.
5	1392336000	Better then anything in the stores the only problem is that the pen on the side gets in the way.
5	1392336000	This leather case is awesome. The case is practical but sleek and pretty. It's sturdy and very simple to use. It fits my iPad Air very snug and tight. Also, case arrived in 3 days. I wasn't too fond of the stylus, the rubber tip does not move well across the screen. Overall, it's a very good product to buy.
4	1392163200	I'm pleased with this I-pad cover.  It is well made and priced right.  I would recommend it to a friend.
3	1392163200	i like the case itself but my stylus is no longer working when I touch it to the screen.  not sure why
5	1392163200	Purchased a Mini I Pad for my Mom for Mothers' Day. The cover is great and it came with the pen.
5	1392163200	This has lasted the use of a small kiddo! It cleans well, and has saved the iPad from a few close calls! Great buy!
5	1392076800	see the other reviews and video. This thing is perfect for what I needed. No chance of the mini from slipping out. Stands up to view or a convenient handhold strap exists.
5	1391904000	Fits nicely and securely and allows one to use the ipad standing up or at an angle. just as they advertise.Seems well made and protective.
3	1391904000	I chose this rating because i accidentally thought that it will include an iPad, so I have the cover only.
4	1391904000	great fit for the ipad Air.  Easy to use especially holding it by the handle.  A bit bulky and heavier than i expected but would definetly recommend it .
2	1391731200	it has a problem with the home button being hard to push since the cover makes it difficult to reach
5	1391731200	This is the best cover we've ever purchased!  I love it and would recommend it to everyone!  Also excellent for kids...it protects the iPad completely.
4	1391731200	I love the cover! It's a nice shade of purple. It stands two different ways horizontally. The shorter stand is great for when I want to take notes while in class or searching through the web while my iPad is on a table or desk. The higher stand is great when I'm watching a video while my iPad is on a table or desk.However, I do not like the pen it came with. It is extremely have to be precise because the tip is very rounded and it flattens out a lot. Hence, the only reason why I'm giving this product a 4/5.
5	1391731200	My daughter loves this case.  It fits well and it's very functional.  She loved that it came with a stylus.
5	1391644800	For the price, this case is very difficult to beat.  It offers adequate protection for home and business use, and has a very professional appearance.  The stylus/pen, elastic handle and business card holders are nice touches.  The case is not genuine leather, but it does look like leather even if it doesn't feel like it.If you're not a road warrior or family with kids in need of a lifeproof or otter box, this is a smart way to go.  In fact, for this low price you may want to do as I'm planning to do - get an otter box for heavy duty cases, but use this case around the home and office.
4	1391644800	Case is exactly what we ordered. Stylus was cheap and broke! Easily replaced with similar stylus at Walmart. I would buy case again.
4	1391558400	So far it's working well. The only thing to improve it would be to add a Velcro strap to lock it.
5	1391558400	I have to get used to this one.  My old one was so thin, and cheaply made that this one feel heavy to me.  It's very well made & I love the hand strap and the pocket in the front to hold a note or credit card, etc.
4	1391558400	the iPad cover was great. the versatility and protection it has to offer should protect for the iPad for a long time.
5	1391558400	It took me a VERY long time to choose a cover that would be functional yet tasteful. Surprisingly, the quality of the material & craftsmanship is superb for being only $14.99. The Auto Wake/Sleep function works well and the stand & hand strap are both very durable. I don't use the stylus only because I don't care for it, instead I put my gel pen in the loop. I purchased the black cover because the other colors looked too bright for my taste, and black looks very professional & chic. I like how the front cover provides added protection from scratches if it's in your bag or backpack. I am VERY pleased with this cover and I highly recommend it!Cali from SD
5	1391558400	I purchased this product in green for my iPad mini and I absolutely love it! It provides great protection and fits perfectly! The case is exactly as described by the seller. The auto sleep/wake function works without fail as well. It's a little stiff right out of the package, but after a couple bends to make the case stand up it folds right into place. The case is very snug and holds the iPad right in place, but it's incredibly easy to insert and remove the iPad unlike with some other cases. The case included a bonus stylus pen which is very nice. The stylus is higher quality than others that I have received with cases I've purchased and works very well. Overall, this is an incredibly nice case, the green color is beautiful, it provides awesome protection without being bulky, and I highly recommend this case.
4	1391472000	The starp is nice when holding for long periods and the card holder is a nice touch. This case does not stand up on its own as well as I would like, but I am please overall with it.
4	1391472000	Need something for the time being until we can get a LifeProof case.  This one works nicely and keeps the iPad Air covered.The pen / stylus that came with it, is not that great, but, we had others, so it worked out ok.
5	1391472000	Great quality. I think it protects the iPad mini very well. It's not like an otter box but it's not bulky either. Very sleek. We put them on our 9 year olds iPad along with a bodyguards pure guard and I feel the protection is enough.  Purchased one for my 11 year old as well.  Would buy again.
5	1391472000	I love this protective sleeve for my Ipad Mini. Its light weight, durable, impressive (leather) looking and auto wake/sleep feature and was very reasonably priced. I've had this for over year and am very happy with its reliability.
4	1391472000	Love this case I was nervous at first didn't know the beans but it's sturdy and strong and I love stylus pen
4	1391472000	The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that it covers part of the screen and the stand up position isn't really helpful (wrong angle for me)
4	1391385600	Great cover for the iPad Air! Looks very nice, love the pink color. Good quality for the price. Only complaint is that it takes a little bit of playing with in order for it to stand, but overall not a big deal. I am very pleased with the look and quality of the product and would definitely recommend.
5	1391299200	The cover for my IPad mini fits perfectly. Has faux leather finish. Cover has some nice features as in th decription.  Usually pay another $10 for a Stylus which is included withe cover but this is also a pen, too.Worth every penny...great buy.
5	1391299200	This cover has everything I was looking for. Protection and style (the green color is fabulous!) It holds the iPad Mini very snugly and the folding cover &#34;snaps&#34; closed tightly with the hidden magnets. The handstrap is very handy (pun intended) and makes it easy to hold. Highly recommend this leather cover.
5	1391299200	I was hopeful i could find a good ipad mini cover without paying the high prices of the Apple brand covers.  This one is great!  The handle is perfect for reading and I love the stylist/pen.  The pockets are nice - I normally just keep a couple pieces of small paper in there because I am afraid a card may scratch the screen.  I do love this cover!  Thanks!  Would do business again!
3	1391212800	Too heavey, others are totally fine, But u do want ur Ipad air to be as light as possbile, right? Reccomand to buy other covers
5	1391212800	i bought this for my dad on ThankGiving Day. he love it and use it immediately at the time he got
4	1391212800	Nice product.  Holds my Air upright, slightly elevated or with the hand-holder strap well.  Would recommend it to others. I haven't used the Pen but it is a nice extra.
5	1391126400	It fits the IPad Air perfectly. I looked at hundreds of cases and as I noticed people have many different tastes or like to spend lots of money? This case is priced to sell and I own several  tablets already and this by far is the same quality and to top it off. It cost 60% less than the name brand cases. The case is light and made to fit the iPad air. It has all the cut outs for the camera and is comfortable to hold. Most important it keeps the iPad air light. The lid wakes the iPad air when you open the lid and vise-versa. It has a strap for your hand when you view in portrait style. I only wish that it had a strap so I could use it in the landscape mode - the strap that is. This case is much easier to hold when taking pictures or videos.  A lot of cases on the market forgot about the camera on these tablets. This I-blason case did not forget.
5	1391040000	This case is leather and besides the new smell works wonders.  I like that it has the magnets in the cover that auto wake and sleep the I-Pad.  It also fits perfect.
5	1391040000	I was looking for a very reasonable price to get a case for my iPad air. This is perfect my iPad. Love it!
5	1390953600	I like the quality of the cover and the stylus that's attached is very convenient.It protects the mini and the cover folds back when I'm using the I pad.
5	1390953600	a really top class product has given really good service with no problems at all, you couldn,t go wrong buying this , i would highly recommend it to anyone
4	1390953600	simply a nice one to have, the color was nice and pleasing to have. nice feeling when i hold it
5	1390953600	I love it but the cap on the pen came off, other than that its perfect. I would recommend it to my friends!
5	1390953600	It is very handy and exactly as advertised. It is well worth the money paid . Great deal! I like it.
3	1390953600	This is okay to use it. I got this for ipad mini and it fits well. I rate 3 because the color looked differennt from picture. I ordered pink, it totally different color... looks nicer on picture.. i dont know how can i say but it was not pretty pink as it looks in the picture. I am too lazy to change, so i decide to keep it...
5	1390867200	I am a teacher and it is wonderful for walking around the classroom ir I am projecting something on the Promeathean.And it has a lovely &#34;pen.?
5	1390867200	It does it all and is quite stylish. The pen is good to have but I find I don't really ever use it. Other then that, it's an excellent product!!!!
5	1390780800	Coming from an original iPad with an original iPad case, I was looking for something similar. This case is fantastic. It is high quality, fits perfectly, and a great price. I love the hand loop. It makes holding it easier. I highly recommend this case for anyone looking for a simple, quality, and inexpensive case. You will not regret buying this case.
5	1390780800	I would definitely recommend this. I bought this as a gift. Great material and quality. Fits the ipad mini very nicely.
5	1390780800	Good price, good quality and construction. Practically same as the photo but mine did not bring the small pocket, everything else is the same. The stylus does not work very well with a screen protector (in my case:  Tech Armor Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protector)  I recommend it.
2	1390694400	Heavy padding, alignment is fair, sometimes covers up part of the screen making it difficult to hit some of the buttons on the screen.  Does not always stand up. Don't think I'd recommend this case to a friend.
5	1390694400	Fits like a glove and light weight . Perfect for the grandkids and loved the colors. Like the credit card holder inside.
4	1390694400	It was easy to use.  it fit great.  Glad I made the purchase.  Would recommend it highly and loved the choice of colors.
3	1390694400	Looks clean & handle helps. Have to futz with it for a second to get it to stand on its own. When holding it by its handle, Ipad doesn't stay square like it shows in the picture.
4	1390608000	I like the elastic strap - it helps me hold the iPad securely with one hand. It would have been better if it was wider and more toward the middle, but it works okay.
5	1390521600	Easy to useGreat colorAll functions work as described.Sturdy, yet not heavy.Stylus loop is secure enough to not loose stylus, yet flexible enough to insert a stylus.Feels good.Stands in portrait well enough.After many different IPad mini with Retina covers, and returning them all, this is the one to keep.Thoroughly satisfied.
5	1390435200	This cover is awesome!  It is make of leather! and is really nice.  I would recommend this brand to everyone.  High quality, looks and feels durable.  The other leatherette ones I've had (2 in the last 12 months) have not held up to daily handling.  This one seems to be durable and well made and so far shows no wear when handled/used daily!Highly recommend to anyone wanting a Nice cover for their iPad mini or standard iPad!
4	1390348800	Good Product for a great price. Received on time. Fits the new iPad Air well too. I would buy it again if i ever needed one.
5	1390348800	this case works really well with the iPad mini my daughter has. The beautiful blue color compliments the white iPad. She loves it.
5	1390262400	The case works really well. It is also very stylish. I have received many compliments on the color. I love it.
4	1390262400	At the price I paid I really wasn't expecting much but this cover delivers. The cover protects my iPad front and back. The purple color differentiates it from some of the other iPads that end up floating around our house. The kickstand feature really does not work very well and the internal strap for holding the iPad has never worked for me. If the maker ironed out those issues this would be a five star product. An additional comment; if you are a person that uses a stylus this case comes with what appears to be a quality stylus that securely attaches with the case.
5	1390262400	Nice quality, lightweight but durable.  Worth price.  Love the pink too.  As a breast cancer survivor I only buy pink now.
2	1390262400	Not 100% ergonomic (the handle is pretty much useless), but it's a quality case and is easy to use. Buy this if you want a case that is secure, for light use (not for dropping, the sides are not protected) and if you don't need it to stand. The stand is useless too, the material is too weak for it to stand independently.
2	1390176000	I was shipped something very different from the photo - not only a different color on the outside, but a different color on the inside and the handles don't seem the same at all.  Not sure I got the right thing.
1	1390176000	i-BLASON  Would not refund my $17 for returned iPad case i returned according to their instructions.  If you buy from then, be sure you have no intent on returning the product.
4	1390176000	Despite it being a bit heavy, this cover does it's job well.  The stylus is convenient when needed but my screen responds to touch quite easily.
5	1390089600	Neat, compact, folds easily, and sized perfectly  and as usual the price was right. .the  big A does it again
5	1390089600	Ive had this case for about a week and really love it. Its a great looking case and it made out of leather.
5	1390003200	I love this case.  When I open it, my iPad mini wakes up and is ready for me to enter my security code.  It also has a place for credit cards, or similar sized cards on the inside of the cover.  I find the best use of those slots comes when I am flying somewhere - I put my credit card in one because the airlines do not take cash anymore, and nothing is FREE anymore.  So, while I am reading my latest book, I can hand the flight attendant my credit card without having to fish it out of my purse.
5	1390003200	I am rough on iPads, so this case is perfect for me.  I like the pink color so it's easy to identify.
5	1390003200	I have the same case for my iPad Mini, so I knew what to expect when I ordered this case for my Air, and it hasn't disappointed me. I particularly enjoy having a place to attach a stylus/pen
4	1390003200	As I write this review I'm using this item.It shows slight wear on the spine.It has a surface crack about 1/5 of the way up the spine from the bottom.The stylus/pen broke several weeks after receiving. Taking the pen part out of it, can still be used.For he $, this item is working as expected.
4	1389916800	The color was  my first choice and I love it.  The size is convenient and comfortable. The picture on this page shows me how to set it up properly, there was no paperwork with it.
5	1389916800	I can not tell you how great this is. Other friends and family members paid 8 to 9 times more for theirs and mine is a better value, material wise and most obviously price wise. It has great functions. It suits me.
3	1389916800	There are both pros and cons. The pros are it is lightweight and comes in pretty colors. I like the wake/sleep aspect. As for cons,the elastic on the  hand grip is not very strong, and easily stretched out in a short while. My biggest complaint is that the cover blocks the upper left corner of  my ipad and sometimes when I need to x something out, I have to lift the inside corner of the cover up to reach the screen.
5	1389830400	Works as advertised except for the stylus pen. It worked for about a week and the stopped working on my iPad. I have another stylus which works perfectly. Do not know why it doesn't work. Weird. Other than that, it's great. I like the stand, and the strap to hold it with your hand is a great idea. Case fits perfectly on the iPad.
5	1389830400	Very simple and good product - only drawback it is difficult to close apps because the leather make it difficult to get to the X - I have big fingers.
4	1389830400	I bought this in November for my Ipad Air and I drop and bump my Ipad Air a few times already and this cover protected it. I like it so far. The color is not what I expect it to be. I thought its the same as the one on the picture but it's still good. The only thing I don't like about this product is the stand its not as strong as i thought it would be. I still recommend this product as It meets my expectations. I bought this to protect my ipad air and it did so far so I'm satisfied.
3	1389830400	I picked this case for my 7 year old as it's a little thicker and had protection for all sides and the front of the IPAD.  The hand strap looks like it would be a great solution, but isn't very practical, he never uses it.  I'm more afraid he's going to drop it trying to contort his hand into the strap, than just carrying it normally.  The fit is pretty loose so it slides around a bit, which wouldn't be that big of an issue, but it prevents the auto wake/sleep from working consistently.
4	1389830400	All looks good, but i order the wrong stuff. I was to pick up stuff for my Ipad Mini not the Ipad.
5	1389744000	Functions great, looks great, and you can't beat the price!  The overhand strap is nice for when you are walking around taknig pictures with it.
5	1389744000	You have thousand of possibilities for an iPad case, and I tried few. The i-Blason is ergonomically designed using great materials and  excellent workmanship. Love it.
4	1389744000	Amazing for the money. Would love some velcro or a button or magnet to keep the flap alligned while it's open. Otherwise, better than anything you're gonna get from Apple.
4	1389657600	My pen already broke. The writing tip came off and it doesn't stay on. Other than that I love it
5	1389571200	I totally recommend this item for your iPad mini, especially if you are a clutz like I am. I drop my iPad all the time and I have absolutely no cracks.
5	1389571200	shopped local well known stores before purchasing the I-blazon case-- found most to be inferior quality, costlier, and less features, i.e. leather case, stylus holder, magnetic turn-off, and handle grip (great safety feature over-all great buy for the money, almost half the cost of some products I observed- backed up by amazon's speedy delivery and guarantees
3	1389571200	good casenot good penonly used one day that the pen is not working anymoreBut the case is good
5	1389571200	Came with a pen to use for ipad, has pockets fir cards and good quality leather/pleather. All holes align perfectly with my buttons, camera etc
5	1389398400	Just what i was looking for,  good quality, good protection, leather but stil thin even when folded back. I wish i could get something like this for my ipad2....lots of companies here have limited shipping...Amazon, time to get really global. Ship everywhere, please.
5	1389398400	This case really is perfect for all my desires and expectations. It is high quality material and it fits the ipad air nice and snug. There's no wiggle room. I haven't used the stylus because I already have one that I prefer with a small nib, but the holder fits it nicely as well. Has all the cut outs on the back that you need and doesn't interfere with any of the screen viewing. It actually gives you an edge to rest your palm in writing and painting apps. Would highly recommend this case for the air.
4	1389398400	I got this for my dads iPad Mini 1.Does everything it says it does. I would've preferred if it has a little thinner, and if the corner flaps the hold in the Ipad where a bit cleaner.
2	1389398400	Lefties beware!!!!!  These cases are all made for right handed people !  The holding strap willNot work if you are left handed and the case is heavy and bulky.and the stylus did not work. I wanted to return or exchange it for different one but the company refused to pay my shipping & since the item was  10.00, I did not bother to return it.  I tried to use it upside down, but the camera holes don't line up.LEFT HANDED PEOPLE NEED CASES WITH STRAPS TOO!
5	1389398400	I love the multiple features which are lightweight, holds business cards and more importantly has the sleep smart cover,  and happy with fast delivery, price and would recommend these covers  to everyone!
3	1389312000	Works good for right handed, but a lot of us aren't. Minor in convinces with hand strap, turn it over you say. Now it's upside down righty. Hold the strap, cover flops.
2	1389312000	I used to have a much better clamshell case for my iPad 4, so coming from that one to this was a big disappointment. I can't hold the iPad easily with one hand while lying down, unlike before with new trent air bender. If u just need any case, I'm sure this will do, but I didn't find it all that useful. If it had an elastic band to keep it from opening all the time I might rate it 3 stars.
2	1389312000	Product not as described.  Ordered light pink cover for ipad mini and was sent magenta (dark pink).  Contacted Amazon, was sent another one which was also magenta (sticker on package says magenta right on it although the order lists it as pink - as does the photo).Tried calling seller to see if the web description and photo were wrong or does a pink one exist, as this is the one my daughter wants.  Tried to contact the seller, message said they were closed.  Tried again next day and there was no option to speak to a person.The cover itself appears to function as described.
4	1389225600	the color is beautiful, is easy to handle, need more protection in the corners, I cannot used the pen because the rubber don't work.
4	1389225600	Arrived fast, pen works decently, and case provides satisfactory coverage. I did end up buying a better case later down the line.
5	1389225600	I ordered 2 of these for my daughters and they absolutely love them. High quality and well worth the money, Also came with a stylus!
4	1389225600	The cover fits very well. I am able to access all features of my ipad.  My only complaint is the inside of the cover is not green.  It is gray.
4	1389139200	Great item, fast delivery & it fits perfectly! This item seems more sturdy than others we tried. I would recommend this item.
3	1389139200	The product met my expectation, but I thought the product would come better wrapped and the case doesn't always work like a smart case.
5	1389139200	Very nice cover the product came fast the stated upon checkout very pleased with it fit ipod mini perfectly A
5	1389052800	it's a sturdy cord and easily seen.  seems to charge fully the ipad in the few times I've used it.  I think it's worth it to spend a few bucks on a cord that works rather than one of those cheap, thin cords that sometimes don't really charge your ipad.
4	1389052800	Everything about the case is wonderful except two things. One the handle for carrying isn't really set in the right place, and two it needs a band to keep it securely closed. Other than that, like I said for the price, I would still pay for this one over most other ones out there because it does it's job well and you don't have to spend $40-50 more.
5	1389052800	This ipad mini cover serves my purpose very well. I wanted one that is a stand also and that covers the screen when I throw it in my bag.
5	1388966400	I love the color, just as the picture, and I loved even more how fast the shipping was, because the product  took only about three days to be delivered. The stylus pen is an actual ink pen with the end functioning as a stylus.
4	1388966400	I love the case.  It fit perfectly, and isn't bulky like so many others. I like the fact that it is a &#34;smart cover&#34; and wakes the iPad when I open it.The free stylus was okay but cheap. The rubberized tip fell off the second day and was lost. But I didn't really use it so that wasn't an issue.
3	1388880000	I got the green one, which on the screen looks like a nice muted apple green color, however when I opened the package, I was surprised to find it's a neon green color. It's really bright, so if you like that kind of thing, then it's fine (I've since taken the pen out, because it was slipping out anyway)' and the interior is gray, not a lighter shade of green as shown, but I didn't want to continue to use my iPad without a cover, so it'll do until I find one I like.
4	1388793600	I got this for myself and my mother, we both love it. It fists in my purse, or I use it as my purse if I'm just going to the Dr. Just throw in my insurance card and bank card and go. So I can read or play a game while waiting on my name to be called. I recommend it.
3	1388707200	I really have found this case to be a bit redundant, as I am using the one that came with my blue-tooth keyboard.It does offer a nice hand grip and a stylus. I will likely use the stylus separately
5	1388707200	Super product, and fits perfectly. After viewing hundreds of others I am pleased I picked this one as it is useful and protects my mini.
2	1388707200	The case is okay...  It does cover the corners of the device so my brand new mini is already  dented on 2 corners.  Dropping it was my fault but accidents happen and I need a different case now.  The hand strap is not that helpful for me since you still need to grip it tight to keep cover closed...  I would not recommend unless you are just looking for a cheap alternative.
5	1388707200	This case is precise, light, very handy to carry or manage, and allows you to keep the iPad in any position you desire.Important: it has soft borders so it doesn&#8217;t ruin the iPad frame, like other covers do.My daughter chose this eye-catching pink colour, the iPad is very attractive in it, other than it naps in and out easily and quickly.Only one suggestion, I would have appreciated a stronger &#8220;Magnetic Closure&#8221;, so when you put the iPad away you can be sure it stays completely close and secured also in facing down circumstance.To conclude I'm really happy with it and I will buy again.
5	1388707200	I bought this for my daughter's mini iPad.  She really likes it!  It arrived very quickly and it does the job.  I would definitely recommend it.
2	1388620800	Good case for the price, prompt delivery, but gave me the wrong color, the picture and video review is misleading, ordered the all black case, received a black case with a gray interior, also read another review similar to my experience, was hoping to contribute to the good feedback and had high hopes but was disappointed unfortunately, if you don't care about getting the wrong color order from here, tried to reach someone on the customer service line to at least find out if they have the one i wanted in stock but its just a 30 second recording, returning and hoping I don't get played for my refund
5	1388620800	I priced a silimar case at the Apple store for $79. This case works great for my iPad Air.  The wake sleep works just fine.
5	1388534400	More than what I expected. Great quaIity and I'm happy I made this purchase. I highly recommend for the price.
5	1388534400	It's great but to fix one thing i would say make the inside black because the inside gets exposed to the outside.
1	1388534400	Do yourself a favor and choose a different seller to buy from. They totaly screwed up getting me a case for my fathers Xmas gift. I paid Dec13th....they marked it shipped the next day, even had a tracking number. Track web page stated it was enroute and on time for Dec18th delivery. Here is where it gets funny....on Dec24th I received an email that apologized for them realizing the order was not going to make it by the Dec18th delivery date and they were sorry if this was inconvenient for me. Well obviously I had to go to the stupid mall and shop last minute for a gift to give my father. These idiots dropped the ball from the get go. I'd recommend you take your business elsewhere and avoid the possible frustration.
5	1388534400	This is an excellent product.....very high quality for very low cost and my iPad Mini fits perfectly.  I definitely recommend...you won't be disappointed!
2	1388534400	this case is not what I expected, I got it for my brother as a gift and he is okay with it but it's not the same case shown in the picture!!! A little disappointed with it.
5	1388534400	My new ipad air cover is a perfect fit and has a great feel. Love that the pen is handy and can keep my business cards in the card holder.
5	1388534400	More than I expected in an iPad mini case. Love it! Very sturdy, protects iPad well. I will be purchasing another for my other devices.
5	1388448000	I had just bought my first iPad and I wanted a cover.  This did it ALL:  Sturdy, protective material; turns my iPad off automatically; includes a stylus for my work needs; and the handle grip makes it easy to hold and eliminates my fear of dropping it.  Best of all it was VERY affordable!
1	1388448000	I had to return it, because it was not working for my ipad air. you can not stand your ipad using this cover
5	1388448000	Received the cover sooner than I expected. It fits well and does what it says. It smells a bit when you first open the package. If it was not covered in plastic the smell would have time to dissipate. Simple to hold and feels good.
5	1388448000	thank you so much! this is what I am using every single day on my new ipad air. I'm absolutely loving it, and I think it is a very long-lasting, durable case
5	1388361600	My husband spends a great deal of his time on his iPad Mini and surfs continually using this tool.  Just like a kid.
5	1388361600	I just received my I-BLASON IPad mini 2 case and I love it. It came a day early and fits my iPad mini 2 perfectly. I am thrilled with my purchase! Can't beat it for the price.
5	1388361600	Love it.  It was what I expected.  I also feel I received it at a good price.  In fact I will order again.
4	1388188800	This iPad holder is really better than anything apple offers. I gave it to myWife with a new iPad air, she is tickled with it
4	1388102400	This is a comparatively inexpensive case that competently performs the tasks of protecting the iPad, putting it to sleep when closed, and providing a two position stand for the device in landscape mode.  It does the trick.
5	1388102400	This case has exceeded my expectations on every level and the price was so worth the purchase.  I would recommendI-BLASON case for its versatility and everyday use.
5	1388016000	Has all the appropriate cutouts and fit is very good. Previously bought same cover for original ipad mini and this one has thicker cover which provides a little more protection. Excellent deal for the price.
4	1388016000	Cover serves purpose; I would make engineering changes to inside cover and change material- but I'm certain it's a preference... Stylus- well they're all different- this is very lightweight and overall cost - def worth investment
5	1388016000	I love the vibrant color. The whole unit is really nice but I must say I wish there were more adjustments to set it  to stand on it's own. Other than that it's a great cover.
5	1388016000	This item was the perfect match to my Ipad Mini.  It actually was a better deal than the one they try to sell at Sprint.  The quality is great!  I would strongly recommend!
5	1388016000	Love this cover.  Several &#34;pockets&#34; inside to hold ID cards, etc.  Especially like the stylus holder on the outside edge so thatiPad can lay flat on a surface.  Color purple is nice and easily found when I'm looking for it.
2	1388016000	I do not like the handle placement and when I want to prop it up with the stand it is not very sturdy and falls over if it is not positioned just right. I like the cover style with the sleeper mode.
5	1388016000	nothing much more to say. it does its job and looks sleek doing it. the pen tip came off of the stylus, but that's not what I bought it for anyway.
5	1387670400	I am thrilled with my cover.  It is well built, sturdy and the stand is so convenient.  I couldn't be happier.  The price was better than anything that compared to this.
5	1387497600	Love the wake...snooze feature to save battery live.  Good protection for the price.  Wish it came in fun designs!!!!Thank you
5	1387497600	Holds the new retina iPad mini quite well.  Handsomely leather bound with white stitching looks very stylish.  Appropriate cut outs for front and back cameras, light sensor and top microphone.  Microphone on back is covered (like so many other cases too).Velcro flap tucks under iPad and keeps it from slipping out. Has a handle for when case is opened.  Cover has magnet that activates the iPad automatically when opened and turns off the screen when closed.5 stars!
5	1387497600	The product was exactly as advertised. Very high-quality, sent in good order and a reasonable price was charged. I am very pleased and would recommend iblazon products to anyone.
5	1387411200	It's a great case. Fits the iPad perfectly and the handle and stylus is a plus. When you prop it up, the back can be kind of annoying (you have to stick it into this latch thing to make it stand up), but it's still good.
1	1387411200	The color is not the same as the photo. It is missing the Screen Protector kit that was in the product Description and the only reason I ordered from this company. Not happy that I did not receive the color, the screen Protectors or the stylus in the Product description and photo as it is a Christmas Gift and I will not be able to get a Screen Protector by Christmas :(. DO not order from this company!! Shame on you Amazon!!!!!!!!!
3	1387238400	The handle is so helpful while reading, but the fold it so stiff it's difficult to hold it comfortably. Also, the smell is horrid, I've had this for a number of weeks and the fake leather still smells pretty bad.
5	1387238400	This case is amazing. Good quality, good price, simply perfect! Easy to hold in one hand plus a pen! Ipad feels great in this case.
3	1387152000	i liked the handgrip better than most, but the spine is so weak & flexible, that it defeats the purpose of the hand grip.
4	1387152000	this is a very nice case but it doesn't offer the side and drop protection that i needed with my toddler son handling the iPad
4	1387152000	This is an excellent product for a price that is just as excellent! The auto-wake works well and the case fits perfectly around the iPad mini.The only negative experiences I've had with the product are that the pen is made of cheap material, and that when holding it in my hand, the case slants to one side.
3	1387152000	Sure enough, it's in the fine print, but the words &#34;leather case&#34; in the title are bound to cause some confusion.
1	1387065600	The case is falling apart and it sucks. I would not recommend this to anyone. Also the stylus broke after a week
5	1387065600	Could have spent $30-50 bucks on a case but was happy to find this. Great quality for an amazing price! Stand works fine, stylus is solid... If anything it is a great fill-in until you decide on another case.
5	1387065600	I love this case...would recommend  to anyone to buy it. Was easy to apply to the iPad, very snug fit
4	1386979200	Nice case for the price. The free touch pen is a nice bonus. And the auto off and on works well.
1	1386979200	it's a pretty standard case for an Ipad. stand does not work easily. I have to fidget with the case to make sure it stays upright. the stylus holder is in an uncomfortable location. I ended up leaving the stylus somewhere else because it's just swings around while its in the holder. there doesn't seem to have anything to keep the covers closed. other tablet cases i've have in the past always have something like a strap, magnet or button to keep the cover flap closed, this product doesn't seem to have one.the customer service is horrible. can't reach them at all via phone. I ordered this product on Dec 1st, and the latest arrival date estimated was Dec 10th. guess what they sent me on Dec 11th, a computerized message that say that they just send it.overall, the product is not that good and the customer service is non-existant. I would not purchase from this seller again.
4	1386979200	Having a real pen attached is really handy, thanks for thinking of it, a magnetic catch to keep the cover open would be handy too.
1	1386892800	I wish I could give them no stars but 1 star is the minimun the system would allow. I ordered my ipad case on Dec 2 and was given a delivery date of Dec 6-9. The date then changed to Dec 6-11 and Finally it changed again to Dec 10. The last USPS tracking entry is on Dec 7 and showing that the package was received in MO...I live in SC. It is now Dec 13 and I have been trying to call the company for non-stop for the past 3 days. There phone line and service is the worst in the world. I have yet to speak to a live person and each time I have sat on hold for upwards of 30 mins, just to leave a voicemail that has yet to be returned. I have spoken to amazon and all they can do is send an email and play the 48 hour waiting game to wait for a responce. i-Blason obviously DO NOT care about their customer or the quality of customer service that they provide. If I can't receive my product by overnight express mail, then they need to give me a full refund.Amelia G.
5	1386892800	This item fit my ipad just fine. I would buy this product again. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality case.
4	1386892800	The photo is not correct for the purple version of this iPad Air/5 case - the case I just received is a pinkish purple on the outside and tan/gray on the inside (not all purple as expected). So far, it seems like a good case though, for the price. The iPad fits in it very well, and the sleep/wake function works correctly. A video review shows an iPad mini standing up vertically in this case - that does NOT work with the iPad Air case. (I wish it did!) The horizontal video and typing positions work well though. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, my case is VERY smelly, but hopefully the odor will go away soon.
5	1386892800	It fits well and is protecting the glass and will stay on well. Of good quality and seems to be the one&#8230;!
4	1386806400	True pink color.  Appears to be good quality. Fits iPad mini perfectly.  It would be nice to have a strap on the outside as well so you can use the strap to carry while the screen is protected.
5	1386806400	I have ordered two of these...The first being last year.  Love this product and the auto-open. It looks like a high quality pebbled leather and has held up extremely well. I take this everywhere..traveling internationally as well and have NEVER had any problems. It's lightweight and durable and if you lose the stylus, you can easily find a replacement anywhere. Give this product a try..you won't be sorry!!
5	1386720000	Love this little lime green cover.  It's substantial enough if I drop my beloved mini it'll protect it but it's not too bulky and I can still place it in my purse.  Having a pen/stylus attached is icing in the cake.  It clicks shut.  It stands up when I want it to.  Positively perfect and at a great price.  Thank you i-BLASON!
5	1386720000	Having purchased a new iPad Mini with retina display and being a true geek, I of course have to get a new case. There are several new cases on the market and I purchased this one because it had the stylus. Using a stylus really helps to keep the screen clear of finger smudges. I have another case that I use around the house, but I travel frequently. This case is perfect for traveling because of the added features that it has. The hand strap makes it much easier to use sitting on an airplane for an extended period of time. I also like the fact that you can include credit cards in the same case. Considering the truly reasonable price and the quality of the product, this ,at least for me, is the perfect travel case.
4	1386633600	Fit my iPad Mini perfectly... A bit cheaply made, but if you don't plan on miss using it, then it should work for you.
5	1386633600	Good fit for ipad mini.  Seems durable and well built.  Color (green) was exactly as it appeared on amazon.  Would purchase it again.
5	1386633600	So far I like this- only got it yesterday. However, it fits my new mini well. I like having a stylus loop instead go having one dangle. I am using its stylus, but others will fit in the elastic loop as well. I was afraid of the clashing colors so I want with the blue, however it turns out the interior fabric is gray and the whole thing comes off well. The elastic hand grip is nice for holding on to the pad. The magnet in open/close works as it hold. I believe I will keep using it. BTW the horrendous opening smell is dissipating well on day two.
4	1386633600	It works fine, has nice pockets, handle works not much else to say but it was a great buy at the time
4	1386547200	It has a,most everything I need in a case, stylus holder, book handle, card pocket and protection. The one thing it lacks is the strap to keep it opened or closed.
5	1386547200	loving the color,very good quality,people noticed it,overall the product is satisfactory.very easy and comfortable to my hands,highly recommends this product.
2	1386547200	If you want to wait over 30 days before you get the product than this is for you,! Considering it  eligible for prime should not take over 30 days especially when this happened a month prior to Christmas...The product itself was very good it's a very strong material the green is very very bright. The stylist works well on the iPad air that is important because one of the other ones that I had purchased to a different company the stylus barely worke.. The stitching is well done and does not appear to have any imperfections. It's very well and love the fact that it has the Velcro on the inside of the case to  keep it moving around. Strap works well and so do the credit card holders in the Sim card holder well there is no strap that connects it closed but,  does seem to have a slight magnet to keep. It closed. The auto wake n sleep function works great.
5	1386547200	Top notch item. My iPad is well protected and quite stylish! I liked it so much I purchased one as a birthday gift.
5	1386547200	I purchased one of these covers for my IPad Air. I was somewhat skeptical because of the price but when I received it I could not believe the quality! The leather is really very high quality and the overall construction is very good!!! They have really done a very good job with this case!!! I have told all of my friends about this product. If my wife gets an IPad Air I will defiantly get her the pink or purple one.
5	1386460800	Very well made and not bulky.  I actually use this for my mini with Retina display and it fits fine.  Nice and snug.  I had a case for my Ipad that wasn't as snug and my Ipad slipped out and because there was give in the seams, it started to tear.
4	1386460800	Pretty good product, nice leather, very soft. Couple things I don't really like is one when you fit the ipad mini2 in there, it still moves a little bit, and two the edge is kind of covered by the case, so the edge part  you have to push the iPad sometimes. But, overall, not a bad product. I like it.
4	1386460800	I bought this for my mother and she just loves it.  Easy handling, stylus, and the non slip material and the color choices.
5	1386460800	Very good quality leather case, works well and the addition of the pen/styles is a plus.The price was very inexpensive for thenice features and overall quality. My only regret is that at the time that I purchased, the only color available was black.I have had no issues with is case at all and would definately purchase again.
5	1386288000	Very good case for a great price! Fits perfect and I would recommend for anyone looking for a case for their ipad air to try this one!
5	1386288000	It's great. Very good quality, perfect for my needs. I would order this for any other ipad I would order in the future
5	1386288000	Amazing quality for the price. I have never posted a review before, but I was so impressed by this iPad Air case that I am making an exception.  It has a great look and feel, and the quality of the workmanship is outstanding. This is superior to cases costing $50 or more in the stores.  The wake/sleep functionality is great, and it fits my iPad Air perfectly.  The only thing that would have made it even better was if it had a way to form a stand for use in portrait mode.
5	1386288000	This is the second one I ordered for me. First one got ran over by several cars. I left it on the trunk with my iPad mini...lol iPad was destroyed but this product was still in decent shape
5	1386288000	The case is fantastic in every way, I just dont care for apples way of turning the ipad off and on when our open and close the cover, so I had to turn that off option off... otherwise, this is the best case that I have had for any of my ipads!
5	1386288000	Perfect for my needs. I love all the features and it looks great. It may not be real leather but you can't tell the difference. Great value.
5	1386288000	Got this to replace the saggy-baggy cover from my iPad first edition. It is a great fit for the iPad Air with easy access to the buttons. It adds a lot of protection and a bit of weight, but I don't take the iPad out of the house very often.
1	1386288000	Yes, you better refund the full money. If not, I will be taking action through Amazon.What a poor service by your company i-BLASON. After 13  days... the customer is without the product.I want your company to learn from others...I ordered a ipad 5 case 3 days back. I had it in hand within 2 days.I will be blogging on face book and other sites to tell this poor service.So customers are not getting cheated.
4	1386115200	I like my ipad air covers, it just took to long receiving them, I am little mad cause I had to wait a month to play with my new iPad air.
2	1386115200	The case is very thick - which is fine if you don't mind tripling the thickness of the iPad Air. The reason I bought this was because of the elastic strap shown in the photo that lets you hold the iPad in one hand and type with the other. However, this really doesn't work as the &#34;hinge&#34; is so loose that it would require you to use your thumb to stabilize the iPad in your hand (which is being done in the photo).  Well, as the bezel on the new iPad doesn't have room for your thumb to hold it without touching the screen, that is not an option. So, the elastic strap is useless and, as I said, that was why I bought this. So, the case is useless to me.
4	1385856000	thnk you for you the order is very good as what I whant and it nice to use thank agen to you
5	1385856000	Works extremely well.  Was exactly what I was hoping for.  It does not slide around in your hand.  It holds the iPad mini perfectly.  It has a little hand holder that helps hold the iPad for certain situations.  It also has two small credit card holder pockets that are convenient to hold appointment cards, money, written notes, etc.  very happy with this purchase!
5	1385856000	Sturdy and easy to hold on to because of the elastic strap, makes reading even while I am standing in a crowded rush-hour subway a breeze.
5	1385769600	Unlike other people who reviewed this product, I've had none of the problems others have mentioned1) One complaint was the cover blocked the rear camera. I found this to be untrue if you put the cover on correctly. there is a tab that has a Velcro closure, and once you slide the tablet in fully you wrap the tab around the tablet and secure it to the other Velcro piece on the cover.2) Another complaint was the tablet wouldn't stand like it should, this is somewhat true but is really not a problem if you take the time to stand it properly, and finally the pen that comes with the cover writes perfectly.All in all I like the feel of the cover and I think its a super great value.
4	1385769600	This cover is really cute and protects the iPad mini very well. I don't use the hand strap, the stylus or the card slots but I guess they could be useful to others. This would get 5 stars if the kickstand was more stable. When you fold it up to prop up the iPad, it won't lay flat, which causes the iPad to sometimes fall over or tilt downwards. I thought it would go away once I broke it in a little but it is still the same. Otherwise, this is a good purchase.
5	1385510400	A steal at three times the price.  Functional and well made.  Would buy more products from this manufacturer x x
2	1385424000	It works but if you ever drop your iPad your in trouble. I cracked my screen because I dropped it on the side. Not good protection for a 500$ ipad
5	1385424000	It's easy to fold, it really protects and comes with a special pen that helps using my new Ipad Air.  Looks professional
5	1385424000	This fit my Ipad mini with retina display perfectly. So pay not attention to the description that say it's not compatible.  Easy to apply if you follow directions.
5	1385337600	I looked a really long time.  I wanted something leather, not plastic.  Plastic just seemed to cheapen my iPad mini. I wanted something that looked expensive, so it had to be leather.  This was the only one I could find that had the material I wanted and good reviews (above 4 on Amazon).  I wanted also a little handle for me to hold.  It reminds me a bit of a moleskin notebook, if that were a case.  It is form fitting and my iPad mini easily slips into it.  It is tight so I don't have to worry about my electronic device falling out.  The stylus pen is an okay accessory.  I don't really use it but I like that it came with this extra.  I feel better about having this case because it keeps the dust off my iPad.  Would buy it again.  The price (around $15 dollars including shipping) is pretty reasonable compared to what other vendors try to charge.
2	1385337600	This iPad case is only ok. First of all it took 10 days to get it delivered and they charged for delivery. Considering that they advertised it would only take 3-5 days that was pretty bad false advertising. Nowadays when you have to compete with Amazon prime free 2 day shipping it's hard to justify that sort of delay. It has a strap that's pretty useless because it doesn't have much of a purpose. It's very awkward to use and hold it while using the strap. Also the cover doesn't magnetically stay open when you fold it back on itself. Also the stand is pretty useless because the angle that it makes the iPad is a very awkward and not an angle you would want to use it. It's just a poorly designed case.It's good that it wakes the iPad up when you open it and the stylus is nice. Overall I am disappointed however and would not recommend this product.
5	1385337600	I absolutely love this product.I spent over a week going back and forth trying to figure out whether or not I should buy this, I am glad I did.Upon receiving the product, I immediately sticked this ipad in there and I was a bit shocked because the bottom of my screen was blocked by one of the corners.  I finally realized I could push the ipad further in and that fixed it.The ipad goes into sleep mode when closed and comes back when I open it, just like it says.I am not feeling the holder thing though, when I tried using it the ipad tilted to the right (or left, depending on how you hold it).  Thankfully, I am able to live without that, I even forget that is there.It will stand at an angle, if you need or want your ipad to stand straight, this might not work.Accidents do happen and it happened to me.  It fell from my hand, screen facing down, and my heart stopped for a few seconds.  I was expecting the worst but nothing happened, not a scratch.
3	1385337600	Primary complaint is that there is no room at the edges to use the screen swipe functions for forward or backward web navigation.
5	1385251200	TLDR VERSION:Buy this case if you want something simple, inexpensive and protective.Don't buy this case if you're looking for something slim or fancy, or if having a thick border around the screen affects how you use your device.FULL REVIEW:I had the first generation i-Blason case for my iPad mini, which I liked fine enough. Had to upgrade to a new mini because i made the mistake of underestimating my storage needs, so I took the opportunity to get the new case, as well.Overall, I think they only improved the quality of their product. It's still very well-built for what you're paying (especially compared to the $70 you'd pay for the official Apple smart-cover).The smart-cover seems much more responsive than the original mini case. I no longer have to flip the case open and shut repeatedly to get the device to recognize the cover.It's still not the thinnest cover on the market, more than doubling the thickness of the mini, but it is well padded all around the device. Although I would rather not test the theory, I feel like it would protect the device against most common household drops.  It's a little thicker than the original mini case, which makes it a little tougher to get the spine part of the cover to tuck flat against the body when standing the pad up, but it's still doable.The hand strap is located near the spine of the cover, rather than the middle. I find that when I use it, it's best to rest my thumb on the left side bezel of your device for balance.As with any case where you insert the device into a windowed flap, the edges of the touch screen can be a bit tough to tap at times. Especially the tiny "x" that closes the left-most Safari tab.  You might want to invest in a stylus.Speaking of which, the stylus holder on the side of the case is a welcome design. Because it's an elastic band, it can stretch to fit styluses up to about the thickness of a sharpie pen. My Friendly Swede stylus fits perfectly.Although it's marketed as being for the Retina Mini, the only practical difference between the old and new mini, as far as this particular cover design is concerned, is the hole for the second microphone on the back.I would definitely buy this case again.
5	1385251200	This is a nice case. It has a leather-grained texture with suede interior. There is a magnetic closure and auto-awake feature. Sure, it's easy to just push the Home button to wake your iPad but why not let the case do it for you? Inside, there are two business/credit card slots and a strap which allows you to hold the case securely with one hand while you're reading, playing games, etc. There is a small, built-in flap so that you can prop the case open and use it as a stand but it only holds it at a low (maybe 20-25 degree) angle. Also, it does come with a pen/stylus with a rubber tipped bottom. The only I really didn't like much was the way that the stylus hangs on the outside of the case. I kept getting it caught on things or accidentally twisting it so that the pen nib was exposed. I just removed it from the case and used it for something else. Overall, for the price, I would definitely purchase it again.
4	1385164800	So far, after trying 3 different cases for the new iPad Air, this is my favorite one!  It's lightweight, sturdy, seems well-designed, and functions as it should.A couple of things to note: the hand strap could be tighter; it doesn't feel like it could really prevent the iPad from slipping out of your hand.  Also, there's no way to keep the case open when your hand is through the strap; the cover flaps around under the iPad, which is kind of annoying, but I can live with it.A few reviews mentioned the stink when it's first opened.  I pshawed that thinking, &#34;How bad can it be?&#34;  Heed their/my warnings: IT REEKS!!!  I'm sure the stench will dissipate in a few days, but for now...OMG.  But, I know you're going to have that with any fake leather.  Just the nature of the beast.Also, while I appreciate the free stylus/pen combo, the stylus doesn't work real well.  The pen writes as it should, but I didn't want it for the pen part; but since it was included free with the case, I'm not going to stress about that.All in all, this case was designed with the user in mind; the stylus holder is in the right place, the material seems like it will hold up to daily use, I like the slots for a couple of business cards, the sleep/wake feature works as it should, it's lightweight without detracting from protection, and it looks nice.I would buy this case again without a moment's hesitation.  And you sure can't beat the price, considering what comparable cases are going for!
5	1385164800	Looks just like the picture, nice quality, and the magnetic sleep/wake DOES work. Great cover for the price! Some trouble with shipping that was addressed by customer service relatively quickly.
5	1385078400	It is perfect. It is easy to hold in your hand. It stands on its own. The stylus is with it. It is sturdy and protects the screen very well.
5	1385078400	It is a very good case! The stylus is not perfect but is usable - I use it everyday. If you don't need a keyboard, this case is good choice.
5	1384819200	I was concerned about dropping my new i pad mini Retina display when I first got it as I had no case for it. The I-Blason case came yesterday. I bought black as I am a guy. I'm blown away. It looks 3 to 4 x more expensive than the $9.99 I paid for it. My I pad fit in perfectly ,all the require holes were there. There was round whole centered in the back,I thought they screwed up with an extra hole. They did not.It is for rear mic. I was concered about corner protection , the case is large enough to protect the entire i pad with a few millimeters to spare. It is better made ,thicker and more substantial than a top quality case I bought for my wife's tab 3 7".My I pad goes into sleep mode when the case is closed. This can be confirmed by a setting i the ipad which gives a clicking sound on closure. I have not used the elastic strap so far. I now feel confident using my ipad as I am not concerned about it dropping from my hand. Very little odor if any it smells like leather, even though the case is not made of it..The little card pocket in the cover it also a nice touch as is the black stitches on out side of cover  and white on inside. Buy it you will love it
5	1384732800	Protects, sits up so I can use the IPad easily and has all I need on it. I've used the product for over a month.
5	1384732800	Very nice product, the pen can be used on the i Pad, which was a plus as it was a gift from my daughter to her grandfather.
5	1384646400	Excellent product. At first, I was a little skeptical about the quality of the item, for the price was almost too good to be true. Ordinarily, I expect to pay much more for such product. I was positively surprised when I opened the box in which the I-BLASOM came. The case itself is light, well-made with great attention to detail. I use May iPad as a workhorse, very seldom going back to my desktop, so, a good, nice-looking, durable case is important to me. I-BLASOM meets all my expectations. The pen/stylus holder is a nice bonus. Before, I used to loose lots of time looking for a misplaced stylus. The type of leather that the manufacturer selected for the case is very pleasant to touch. My iPad Air fits snug into the case without a probability of sliding out, which was a problem with another case I used to have.
5	1384646400	It is a good deal to buy a case and screen protectors from the same seller. That will save the shipping fee. The case fits with Ipad Air very well and I like the stylus sent together with the case. I highly recommend it.
5	1384560000	Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Protects her iPad mini very well. Very handy to have the stylus / pen combination always available. She didn't think she would use the self standup feature but she actually uses it all the time. Price is reasonable and i-Blason's customer service and shipping is a good as Amazon's.
5	1384473600	Ok so for under $5, this was a great buy.  It's a nice fit and so far pretty good condition.
4	1384473600	Pretty well made, nice colors, does the job, nice hand strap & I appreciated the addition of the pen... However I can't get my case to stand as shown in the picture... It just falls over, before I even get a chance to touch it!
4	1384473600	I really like my iPad case. Although, I wish you could snap it back once you've opened it. The hand slot is nice, but when I try to read the weight of the iPad makes it slanted. If there was a snap to hold the back in place; it would be perfect! Also the pen is not necessary. I cut that off. Overall I give 4 stars.
5	1384300800	i love it,....... works great fits nicely great protector and a great price would recommend.....  has nice sleeves  for cc or dri lic
4	1384300800	Fits in my purse and I like that I can place my device inside for security, protection, a clean screen and sure grip.
1	1384214400	The case has an ugly color.  I tried different way to make it stand, just can't make it work.  The material is too soft.
5	1384214400	Great cover for my husband's mini ipad.  He's really enjoying it as it's a great looking cover and it protects his ipad.  Would highly recommend.
5	1384041600	Great value that is both functional and protective of my iPad mini. Much better than most other overpriced covers. Will get another for my next iPad.
5	1384041600	love the. case, iPad fit well in the case,  the auto Smart Cover function work well. very satisfy with the product. I just don't know what is the strap is use for.
3	1383955200	I got this for the Ipad Air.  It works.  But it is not friendly to the hand.  The stand is mediocre and the materials feel and look pretty cheap.  However, I paid five dollars delivered.  As such, it excels as a simple cover.  I like the magnetic auto on and that it had a stylus holder.For five bucks, great.  For a case for an eight hundred dollar Ipad Air, it seems like buying a "Club" to protect your Mercedes.
5	1383955200	Wow awesome case very nice feel, and a perfect fit, iPad Air feels solid in the caseI can now place my iPad on my lap without it slipping off.Close the cover iPad goes to sleep open cover it wakes up.Must have case, you can't beat the price
5	1383955200	Amazing deal!! $.01 and absolutely the best case I could imagine! Yes, $.01 for an iPad Air case..a NEW iPad design that fits perfectly on my new Air.  The cover allows it to go into sleep mode, it protects the iPad and love the card slots. I am VERY happy!!
1	1383696000	Ilike it's material but I don't like its color because its not as much as appealed to me as I thought.so I don't want to keep it.
5	1383696000	This case is amazing for the price cant go wrong bought a black one for myself and a green one my for wife she was really happy with it loves it and i do too.
5	1383696000	Great case for a great price.  Received over a month ago and have had no issues.  Holds mini iPad securely and although I haven't dropped it, seems like it should protect well in such an event.
5	1383523200	This case is yery well made with a lot of neat features. My mini iPad has protection and is securely fitted inside the sleeve with a velcro flap that goes underneath the device. It's not a thin imitation. Very nice pen/stylus. Rich colors. I had a hard time choosing, but love the purple. Very happy customer. The price is very reasonable!!! :)  Thank you so much
4	1383523200	Sturdy case - my ipad does not fall out. Wish it looked sleeker and prettier but it's a good value.
4	1383350400	Case is great! Pen part of stylus broke and is useless. Right out of packaging, I twisted the pen open to see how it would write and the tip came off.
5	1383004800	I have no complaints. It is a great case, exactly as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone. The stylus is great, and i love the elastic hand grip.
5	1383004800	Love this cover.  Had to search high and low to find a cover that had an inside pocket for a place to put my train ticket, or a few sheets of paper in case you wanted a visual reminder of something.  The stylus, worked great, and to have a pen included, the Best.Would recomment this Cover and yes it does come in other colors, but hey, getting the pink one kept the men in my house from sneaking it out to use for themselves.
4	1382832000	The stretchy handle, would be fantastic, if it was on the outside.  The stand, doesn't 'stand', very well.  I use it, all the time, but probably won't get another one, like this.
5	1382659200	So I got this case/cover for my husband as a Father's Day gift and it has been a solid cover for the price. If your looking for a inexpensive case for your iPad mini this will do just fine. We have been happy with it now for 4months. The leather is sturdy as well. Happy shopping.
4	1382659200	Fits and functions just fine. I do like the white stitching but now that I have the black one I wiish I would have bought the blue one instead. The stylus seriously sucks by the way! It doesn't work at all.
5	1382572800	It took me a while to order this cover because I had purchased a similar product from another company and was not happy with it.  So, I waited much longer than I should have.  This iPad Mini cover is sleek, fits great, and all the controls on are easy to get to.  It is such a bargain at this price!
4	1382486400	I bought the purple one. it is as good as the pic shows. since I don't really like the color, I gave it 4 stars.
5	1382400000	Bought as a gift and she loves it! Came on time and works great! Does not look cheap like some of the other reviews.
5	1382054400	I-Blason Apple I-pad cover works so perfect I love it. keeps my i-pad safe, clean, and great for travel. Would recommend this to anyone.
4	1382054400	It is great for my mini as it fits well, has an elastic/leather strap to use for reading and holding with one hand and doing work with the other. I only wish the prop up angle were was a little more reclined.
5	1382054400	My husband had bought an i-blason case before for our Ipad 2, so I knew the quality was going to be good.  We received this ipad mini case within a few days of ordering it.  The case was just as I expected, true to the color that I see online and beautiful quality just like our previous case.  I had it for ~ 2 weeks before I saw that there was no opening on the back side of the cover so that the ipad camera can see through.  I took some pictures of the case and pointed out this defect to the company.  Within 24 hours, I received an email asking me if I'd like to have a full refund or have a replacement ship to me at no extra cost.  Because I love the case and the unbeatable price for the quality, I told them to ship me another one.  It came within 3 days.  Not only did this company met my expectation, but really exceeded in terms of customer service.  I would definitely order from them again!
4	1381968000	The cover was fairly cheap but seems like it is well built.  The stylus is poorly designed - does not work with the ipad at all
5	1381881600	I love it it get in time and is get in a great condition. I love the color. Love the pen to.
4	1381795200	I ordered a few different cases and this one was the nicest.Fits well, doesn't block the screen and the handle works well when needed.The only negative is that the built in stand doesn't support the iPad all the time.  You have to reposition it sometimes to get it to stay standing.
5	1381708800	This is my second i-Blason case.  First one fit snug for a year.  Bought a new one to replace.Pros: Hand Strap, card holders, auto wake feature.
4	1381708800	For the price, you can't beat it, I've owned it for several months now and no issues. it's not perfect but it does what it's suppose to.
4	1381708800	This cover is just what I requested, it fits my ipad mini securely at a reasonable price and gives me more grip when holding and carrying my ipad mini.  The 'wake up' cover feature seems to work so far (I hear the click when I close it and it opens at my password screen no matter where I was when I closed it).  I give it 4 stars vs 5 because when you hold it by the hand elastic, the weight of the ipad makes the ipad sag slightly to one side.  Additionally, the 'free' stylus/ink pen seems to have a flimsy rubber tip, which I don't expect to last long. I'd have rather had a pure stylus without the pen, than a cheaper stylus tip with one.  I haven't used the stand feature yet, seems a little shaky but useable.  However, for a simple protective cover this fits the bill.  The purple is as shown, with the suede interior a slightly reddish plumb vs the true purple exterior.
5	1381622400	I own this and liked it so well I purchased one for my son who also loved it.  Well made, functional and easily compares to higher priced covers
5	1381536000	I choose a five star because I absolutely love my case. The two types of purples blended very well together. I would recommend this product to all purple lovers.
3	1381363200	After a few months of using this product, it became flimsy. It's also a tiny bit hard to pull the part that velcros to keep the ipad closed in. All in all, it's not that bad of a product.  I love the color.
4	1381363200	This is just as described.  it works well and is durable.If I could change anything:1) The pen loop would be lower so the pen (provided) does not stick above the case2) The card slots would be a bit looser (certainly they will loosen a bit - but 3 cards per slot is current max)3) The method of latching the folding cover into place for the standing position is not easy to use and takes some getting used to.
5	1381363200	I really like the magnetic close and the stylus holder with stylus in it for the price.  Much better type than the one I had from I-pad.
5	1381190400	It's rarely off my mini. I wish the strap feature allowed horizontal use though. Thick but padded. I'd like better color choices like gray, olive, rust, almond, tan, etc..It's not like the rotating easels, this one doesn't sit up at an angle in portrait position.
2	1381190400	Good protection for your Ipad Mini, but the tripod stand-up only works for the first few weeks (the leather breaks down and it becomes too floppy).  Also, when in landscape mode, the case covers the edge of the screen making it extermely difficult to swipe up from the bottom to access the quick control panel.
3	1381104000	I like that it covers my iPad and makes it easier to hold and carry around, but it is not real sturdy.  The folds that work to prop it up don't stand up, so I am very unhappy with that part.
5	1380672000	At fraction of the APPLE STORE price and complete cover vs Apple's hinge only version. Like the strap that is ideal for holding ipad while in bed.
5	1380499200	This case fits perfectly with my Ipad mini.  Love it and I received many complements on it.  The leather is smooth.  You will love it.
5	1380499200	very nice case for ipad mini nice color.  the wallet pocket is very useful and the pen is useful also . it will protect ur ipad mini form scratchs but not on hard drops but for the price cant beat it and it looks nice . also it has a handle but its on the inside so its weird
2	1380412800	It arrived as described, but I didn't realize the impact that the cover would have on the experience of using my iPad mini. Because it slides in and actually covers the sides of the iPad some functions (like the back button on the web) were hard to get to. You had to move the iPad mini around a bit to get full access to the screen. It's unfortunate because I loved the card holder and the strap on the back. I'm returning this to try another model that snaps into the case. Although I didn't use it long enough, and I don't know if this was just a coincidence (or even possible), but the cover also seemed to slow the processing of the device.
3	1380412800	this case is comfortable in your hand and does what it says but it really doesn't do a good job of being a &#34;stand&#34;for awhile it worked but it really doesn't hold it up when you try to use it as a stand. If using it as a stand is your main reason for buying, then I would get something else instead.
5	1380067200	This case from i-Blason was delivered sooner than expected.This a great buy at a very nice price! The cover is perfect for protection but gives you easy access to controls, while the black color and leather texture gives it a true business look. The case keeps the IPad mini secure and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.
5	1379980800	This Ipad cover is perfect, with an elegant and professional aspect. Light and thin at the same time.And practicle with a slot for the stylus.
5	1379980800	Very nicely made. Sturdy. I like how there are card holders within. Stylus a bonus, but it is really a full functioning pen that I also use the eraser side to touch the screen of my mini.
5	1379980800	This is perfect. Easy to clean. Doesn't look cheap. I love the color. Take it everywhere.Great product.Couldn't find anything like it at the big box stores.
5	1379980800	I think it works great and is at the right price.  Stylus is &#34;so-so&#34;, but I didn't by for the stylus and don't typically use one anyway.  Very happy with case itself.
3	1379980800	The case is good for wanting to carry you ipad in open use mode.  The stand option does not hold it a steady as I would like, but my reason for purchasing is for the carry open feature.
5	1379721600	This is for my teenage daughter. She really likes the color and the protection it provides is perfect. We have no complaints.
5	1379548800	The quality is great for what I paid for it. The covers I looked at in my local wireless store weren't even close in quality but cost more, glad I took a look at Amazon and found this one.
1	1379548800	The cover interferes with part of the screen on the top left so you cannot easily use the touchscreen. I had to replace it with a new cover I bought from Apple. It was a bad purchase.
4	1379462400	My only gripe with this cover is that it's hard to hit buttons on the corner of the screen. Otherwise, it's sturdy and cute, and protects the iPad well.
5	1379462400	The I- Blason cover for my iPad mini is an attractive, convenient, and well-designed product.  The shut-down feature is a plus.  The iPad fits securely and provides extra protection, no matter what challenges may arise!
5	1379376000	Love this case, esp for the price! been using only this case since I got my iPad mini in march : )
4	1379376000	I love this mini iPad cover,although the strap is on the inside. It would be nice to also have a strap on the outside ,making it easier to carry.
5	1379289600	Awesome product only flaw is strap not set up for left handed use but other than that its great. Must have
5	1379203200	Great a gift for my wife she loved it we both use it . It protects and helps it stand alone
5	1379116800	I loved this a product. it is good the they describe it. I using it and it work good in my ipad.
4	1379116800	The smart cover is awesome!!!!  love how it protects the mini ipad.  but the stylist pen is cheap. pen got dented easy and then tip came off...
5	1379030400	love that this has a handle and I am able to put cards and has a stencil to use on my ipad. love this!
4	1379030400	NOt too bad but doesn't look as good as another case I bought.  Still good as new after six months (not used as often)
5	1378944000	Love it. I ordered Pink and received purple but it's worked out fine. I love the coverage and protection it gives. The pen/stylist is perfect. Only thing I noticed was when you want to close out a program the cover fits a little close to the edge of the &#34;x&#34;
5	1378944000	Wow I really love my iPad case. It's the right color, perfect size to fit in my purse. I just love it . I carry it everywhere and gets a lots of compliments .
5	1378857600	iPad mini all the way. Very happy with this product. I can transfer anything from my iPhone to my iPad in a second and always access my info wherever I need it. Top notch technology!
5	1378771200	I bought this cover for myself, and one as a gift.  It's PERFECT.  The leather gets softer with use, the &#34;stand&#34; works wonderfully, and all the control buttons are easily accessible.  It fits my ipad mini with no issues at all!  Love it!! You won't be disappointed. :)
4	1378684800	For the price, this is a very good cover.  The only problem is it goes over the sides of the ipad and it is hard for it to respond when you have to click on a button on the sides of the ipad.
5	1378512000	It is perfect in every way. The fit , the color the texture. I love it very very very much....
5	1378512000	I gave this as a gift to my sister-in-law to protect her Mini IPad.  She travels a lot and I hoped it would protect her technology and she loves it. She said it is easy to use and very lightweight.
5	1378425600	My Son loves this product. It makes it easy for him to carry is iPad around. It looks stylish also. Great deal!
5	1378339200	This is a great product - well constructed and doe what it needs to do perfectly. I recommend this product highly.
5	1378339200	Great book cover style for mini iPad. Handy pen holder on side a nice bonus and cr card ir ID Slots nice for on the go kinda guy if one were traveling and wanted mini iPad handy at airport security check poit. It's durable minus bulk. Black great color for men. Can't put cash in it just 2 card slots which is enough. TIP: make sure your iPad settings have close lock feature on so opening and shutting is automatic.
2	1378339200	Beautiful purple color, but stylus broke the first week, I'd love to have a working stylus, please. Too bad. So sad.
5	1378166400	Wish it had more pockets ,easy  to use.I  looked through most if not all  on amazon. Best way is to look /shop for one , look at the functions  as in usability  then the color an where you are going to use it.
5	1378166400	When I went to order my second anti glare bubble free screen protector for our second ipad mini, the message that if I ordered the cover I could get $2 off the screen protector.  Well, I planned to order a cover also, so this was a bonus.  My cover is very nice.  And my order for both totaled $30.  My husband bought his cover at Wal-Mart and it cost $29 all by itself.  I don't know how it works but it has the auto sleep/wake function which is nice to have.
5	1377993600	This cover turned out much better than I expected.  The leather looks really nice, with white stitching accentuating the black color.  It has a magnetic closure that wakes the iPad automatically when it opens.  The hand strap is a nice touch, along with the holder for business cards, credit cards, or ID.  Some reviewers mentioned a smell, but I never noticed one.  I highly recommend this cover to give your iPad Mini some classy protection.
5	1377907200	I got this for eleven dollars. Well-worth it because it does its job of protecting the iPad mini and it looks nice as a bonus too!
5	1377734400	Very nice. I love this case. Love the color and the pen/stylus that comes with it. Good price and quality.
5	1377734400	I've been very happy with this iPad mini cover.  It's sturdy and not too bulky.  The auto wake feature works great.  I highly recommend this item.
3	1377734400	It's ok but too heavy and bulky. Would have returned it if it and bought a lighter one in a store if it wasn't a pain to do.
5	1377648000	This case is well made and easy to use. When I bought my iPad mini, I looked at other cases in a store... They wanted $30-40 for a plain case! This case is very nice and comes with a stylus and other great features for a fraction of the price! Love it!
5	1377648000	Fast shipping. Good leather, strong stitching and nice fit. Worth the money. Free stylus is on the cheap side but works well.
5	1377561600	I am so suprized about this case.. im not a worker for them or anything like that just a very happy customer usually this price you would think this case is low quality if you open and close it alot it would wrinkle on the out side but that does not happen nothing does is stays in tact i left my ipad in the sun for 2 days and No damage or it feeling real soft from the 102 degree temperature in protects and the handle strap is so continent if you are a public speaker fits my hands which are big yet my kid (8) hand fits in there also its amazing.. also the delivery time took only 2 days usually a week or two off amazon. The pen comes with it also good for games and drawing apps. the stitch design is so nice also .. 5/5 for this deal no doubt about thank you
4	1377475200	Like the cover a lot.  Flexible, convenient and offers great protection.  Does cover up a little of the outer buttons on a few apps, but all in all -- good buy.
4	1377475200	Gave only 4 stars because the screen on the sides are slightly hidden. otherwise everything seems to be fine for me.
4	1377475200	My needs were simple and this works well for me.  Great price, so its a great value overall.  Didn't need anything more
5	1377475200	This is the perfect cover. It protects the device, has magnetic closure and is made of high quality material. I've had two other covers that didn't measure up. In my opinion, this is by far the best cover out there.
5	1377388800	I Love this case. It fits perfect and suits my needs perfectly. I could not have asked for anything better.
5	1377302400	This is a great product!  It is very durable, easy to use and you can view a video if you have any reservations of how it works.
5	1377302400	I love this case for many reasons.  I-Blason has thought of everything.  It is not thin but the cover puts the iPad to sleep on closing.  It is easy to handle and hold with the strap.  It actually works with standing in either vertical or horizontal position.The pink color is just as it looks online.  Very happy with this purchase and the price is good too.
5	1377216000	Absolulety thrilled about my purchase, great product which fits perfectly my mini IPad. Got plenty of compliments from friends and family.
5	1377216000	I purchased this case mainly based off other's reviews and the price point. This case cost a third of the comparable cases in my local stores like Target and Walmart. I'm very happy with this purchase!The case is manufactured well. I found no defects in workmanship such as sewing mishaps, etc. It looks great!  It fits the iPad Mini snugly, which is great!  I had no problems getting my iPad in and it feels securely strapped in.  I'm pretty careful with my electronics but I feel that it would definitely help mitigate damage if I should drop it.There is a magnetic closure on the cover which helps keep it from sliding open in my purse. This also functions as an auto-wake/auto-sleep feature.I appreciate the hand strap on the back. This isn't a feature I've found in many other cases. I use my Mini as an e-reader at least 30-45 minutes a day. This strap is so very nice to have! It makes the iPad easier to hold.The one negative remark I have for this is that the (FREE!) stylus holder is on the outside of the case. I would have preferred to have the elastic holder in the middle, perhaps in the inside fold. With it being on the outside I can envision other things getting caught in it while it moves about in my purse. That hasn't happened yet, but its just a small preference. Not enough of an issue for me to not be willing to purchase another one of these in the future though.Overall, this is a really great iPad Mini case. It is great quality and has many benefits and is an incredible value!
4	1377129600	Everything is great except that it's sometimes hard to hit some of the button icons in the corner of the screen.
4	1377043200	Ok it is not like fabulous, but it is really nice for the price. It c omes with a stylus and I think the best feature is the slot that allows you to hold it securely and effortlessly.
4	1376956800	I am picky when it comes to i-Device cases and to me this is just an average case....not quite as good as I hoped.  When you stand it up using the case it doesn't seem to quite have a natural feel.  Hopefully as the leather breaks in this corrects itself but out of the box not so much.  The stylus that comes with the case is very cheap.....I will be buying a replacement stylus. This case only stands up in landscape mode ( I didn't expect it to do portrait mode).  The card holders are a nice touch however the magnetic cover seems to have the magnet right next to the cards.....not sure if this will demagnetize the cards or not.  I opted not to try it and only put business cards in it......tight fit and not ideal. The leather is a nice material and the case is light weight.  It also has a strap to slide your hand in so you can have it open and in one hand but again I was not a big fan of this either......its on the cover so the weight of the iPad causes it to bend.  With this said the material is nice and overall it is an okay case.  As I said before....I am picky and tent to point out the flaws.
4	1376956800	It is very stylish and I would love to use it but it is a bit large for my tablet that I have but I plan on getting an iPad mini soon so it's all good.
5	1376870400	WILL BUY A FEW MORE COLORSMAKES A GREAT GIFTWISH THERE WERE MORE DESIGNS BUTWOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE
5	1376697600	It is just what I was looking for and I love it,I like the slot on the side for the stylist
5	1376611200	I absolutely love it!  I had to replace my iPad Mini, and I was miserable until I put the cover on the replacement!
5	1376524800	Multi purpose product and very keenly priced. Well made, durable and perfect fit. Although the stylus is really a pen tip (no specialist stylus with the product), a minor issue and I have no hesitation in recommending it.
5	1376524800	It fit perfectly for Mini iPad. I like the most is the &#34;Elastic Hand Strap, Multi-Angle&#34;. It make secure the iPad while you use it on your palm. My spouse and I really happy with this product. I would buy it again in the future.
5	1376352000	I like it it is very handy and usefull, it has pockets and does protect my i pad well. so am glad I got it for my ipad
5	1376006400	This is so perfect!!!! Someone had a video on this and after watching thatvideo is what made me buy it. It was what I was looking for.  The pen thatcomes with it is a regular pen, it is not the kind you can use on the ipad.The ipad fits perfectly and is well protected.Great price, excellent quality, you will not be disappointed.The leather is thick, sturdy, and durable, it will hold up for a long time.I am very impressed.
4	1376006400	This i-BLASON Apple Ipad Mini 7.9 inch Auto Wake/ Sleep Smart Covder Leather  a good item priced fairly. I recommend to others.
4	1375920000	I love the handle when reading for hours. It feels like it protects it better than the apple cover. The pen is a really nice added bonus.
4	1375920000	This is a great case for my ipad mini.  I love the color (purple) and it's super light weight!  It sucks that you have to remove the ipad in order to clean it from dust and such but other than that it's great!
5	1375920000	The product works very well.  Love that it includes a stylus and how east it is to get in and out of the case.
5	1375920000	works well, can be used in horizontal view and the hand strap is great when reading. Also has a spot for cards- i keep business cards there as I use the ipad for presenting a lot. Stylus strap is a plus,but I don't tend to bring a stylus around a lot.
5	1375833600	I have been using this case for about a week and this case is a perfect fit for the iPad mini. It is lightweight yet sturdy. It completely surrounds the iPad and a flap tucks neatly under the iPad with added velcro to hold in place. No worries about the iPad falling out of the case. The outside color is exactly as shown with a soft leather feel. The picture shows the inside of the case to be green as well but mine arrived with a light tan inside liner - not a big deal and actually looks very nice. The inside of the case has a soft suede feel to it making it very pleasant to hold. Also located on the inside of the case is an elastic strap to help hold your iPad with one hand without dropping. There are also 2 credit card slots on the inside of the case that would also hold a small notepad. This cover also comes with a battery saving feature, when the cover is closed it puts the iPad to sleep and when it is opened, the iPad turns back on (assuming your iPad is charged). The cover has all necessary cutouts to allow the front and rear camera operate normally, to charge, to add head phones, to access volume control buttons, on and off buttons, and anything else I may have missed. You will also find that the case is professionally machine stitched addind to the durability of the case.As an added bonus, you will also receive a Pen Stylus (use as an ink pen or stylus).I have seen similar items in &#34;big box stores&#34; which sell for at least double, if not triple, the price of this iPad Mini Case so I don't see how you could go wrong purchasing this item.
5	1375833600	Keeps product safe and protected. Heavy duty cover is good for my husband who tends tobe rough with his stuff.
3	1375747200	This case is all right. My iPad does not respond to the stylus unless I press kind of hard. After a couple months, it stopped sitting up as well as when I first received it. I have moved on to a sturdier case with a keyboard.
3	1375660800	This case looks really nice on the picture but once you're actually holding it is kind of ehhh well a little thick on all sides..Once I placed my ipadmini inside the pouch the left margin covered a little of the screen so you have to move it a little.It also makes your slim ipad look bulky, IDK maybe is for protection?ANyways is ok but I think style wise I'll get another one....
5	1375660800	Fit well on my iPad and will protect  it when I let the kids play it. It is really nice
5	1375660800	Perfect on/off case that fits inside a purse or even a small briefcase and looks very professional.  Easy grip holder is wonderful.  Does not hold position in horizontal view but not too big an issue for me.
3	1375660800	functionally fine but the white stitching is already beginning to unravel... owned it about month now.  expected it to last longer than a month.
3	1375488000	a little bulky, otherwise OK.  pretty color,  hard to do things with it on there, but safer, prevents cracking case.
4	1375315200	As a cover, it is strong and does give the protection intended. It's handy and practical. Most of all, it keeps the ipad clean too.
4	1375315200	Good Quality! It does insure good screen protection against dust and potential shocks. I like the automatid turn on and turn off when the pad cover is opned or closed...
5	1375315200	It's an excellent product and I'm happy to have bought it cause it protects my my tablet very well  and plus I like the way it powers on just by opening it and it powers off when closing it I love this cover.
5	1375315200	So I really don't understand the negative comments people have left. This is a great case. The smart cover feature works perfectly. All buttons ARE accessible and all camera/speaker/lightning port also are easy to get to. As far as an odor goes, all I smell is a little plastic packaging smell. But its barley noticeable. Its a great fit and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this case, especially for college students
5	1375315200	I really like the ability to hold my business cards. It is high quality, shuts the IPAD off automatically. Good value for price.
5	1375228800	This is a perfect case for the ipad mini.  It holds the ipad securely, is made of leather, and there is a hole for the camera also so you don't have to take it out for pictures and movies.  I love that it has a holder for the stylus, which came with it by the way.  I only wish there was one just like it for the 8&#34;Notebook so my friend could get one too.
4	1375142400	Well..lets see :- Its cheap- Great finishing- Magnet unlock- Extra space for credit cards ? Ok , but ...really ?- the pen bundled does not work properlyA very good case , but not the one you can rely on if you Ipad falls from your hand . If you have slippery hands you should consider a better protection bag .
5	1375142400	It help me a lot to protect my iPad. Also looks really cool. It is more useful than apple's smart cover.
5	1375056000	I am known for my extensive product research. I've been burned by cheap manufacturers over the last 45 years so I make sure that nearly everything I purchase is the very best price for the very best product. The i-Blason ipad mini case is one of those products. I am impressed with the quality and the fit. The stylus is a little thin but it does come with the case at no extra charge. The hand strap is a big bonus for relieving hand stress, since the ipad mini's small size is difficult to hold in your hand without getting palm or finger stress. More importantly, my wife likes it too. Overall, this is an excellent purchase.
3	1375056000	This case does it's job but the handle isn't that useful unless you're setting it down, at which point the handle is pointless. I think it would be better if the covers were magnetized so that you didn't have to pinch the iPad together to prevent the screen from falling down so that you could use it while laying down/etc.
5	1375056000	I shopped a lot for a cover for my mini, both in stores and online. This is by far the best I found.
5	1375056000	this is a good product and is what was expected. It is a good product for the money, would recommend
4	1375056000	My 2 sons are using this cover and they love it. They like to take notes on the ipad and the designs is fantastic
5	1375056000	This case is sleek and handy. It is holding up fine after daily use for several months. We lost the pen pretty much immediately, but the fact that it came with a pen and has a holder on the side is a nice touch.
5	1374883200	I love the auto sleep/wake it is so handy. The stylis is very good quality and is also a pen which is very nice.  It is a good quality product.  Would recommend.
3	1374883200	The case is about what one should expect for the money. The folding back of the cover to create a stand is very unstable and requires holding of the device to make sure it doesn't fall over. Now that I have had the iPad mini for a few weeks and are using it more and more, I will probably purchase a more sturdy cover.
4	1374883200	This is a good deal for and Ipad mini case.  It works as advertised and I haven't had any issues with it.
5	1374883200	Got this for my father for his iPad Mini. fits well and he likes the inserts and its ability to stand. Seems durable too.
4	1374796800	I think the pen is in the wrong place when used in landscape position.  Would like return item - mini iPad had to be returned.
5	1374796800	This iPad cover is ideal.  It protects and allows one to get a solid grip on the mini iPad.  I like the convenience of the stylist holder.
1	1374710400	This case offers very little protection for your device. The case does close but it takes very little for it to come open.It is essentially a flimsy stand  and unless you plan on only using your iPad on a bed or a padded room this case just does not do the job!  I dropped my iPad with the case closed and my screen shattered. Make the investment and buy a real case. Saving a few bucks is just not worth it!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!
5	1374710400	Works great and fits good... Only wish it had a stand as well so I could use it more upright...
5	1374624000	Case looks good and works well with the ipad-mini.  Is comfortable in the hand and the stylus is definitely a plus......
4	1374451200	The iPad mini fits nicely into this case.  Still having trouble getting it to stand, but I expect it will loosen up.  I would have preferred the stitching to be black. The stylus loop and the card slots are a plus.  I haven't used the strap yet, but I can see it would be really handy when using it as a reader.
5	1374364800	I have brought several covers but this one is the best one yet. I love the color IPad  fit great and lots of protection. Also, had place for stylus and a place for business cards.
2	1374364800	The standing pose does not work as well as I would like. It looks like it is about to fall when I try to make it stand.
5	1374278400	I love the color and like the strap on the back for your hand to hold it upright.  Also, like the pen tht came with it.
4	1374019200	Love handle, love stylus that doubles as pen, love that it isn't so bulky that it can't fit in my purse, and love that it doesn't add too much more weight to my mini Ipad.
5	1374019200	Ipad mini fits nicely. The smart cover switch is great.  Very comfortable to use.  I like to use the stand when watching movies.
4	1373932800	It does what its supposed to; it's a nice fit for my iPad Mini. I feel it was a good purchase for the cost - very inexpensive.  I've only had it about 3 weeks but it appears to be durable - my 4yo daughter loves handling it and hasnt dropped it.
5	1373846400	Exceeds the quality that I expected. Nice feel, good fit. Like the pen that came with it. I take it with me everywhere.
5	1373846400	My husband had this cover on his Ipad 2 so when he upgraded to the mini I bought this for him. He loves it. He doesn't use the pen or the credit card holder though.
5	1373846400	I gave this to my father-in-law for his new Mini.  He loves it almost as much as his new mini.  I wish I could get the same cover for my regular sized iPad.
5	1373760000	My triplet cousins recently all got matching Ipad Minis and kept fighting over witch is who's so i bought them these cute cases: one pink, one purple, and one black. they love them!
4	1373760000	I was looking forward to receiving my iPad cover as I didn't want to take it "on the go" without protection. The cover arrived well packaged and right on time. The color is exactly as depicted in the photo.The business card holder feature is nice, but I doubt I'll use it. Although it is stitched to the cover, as opposed to glued, (nice touch) It seems like it would easily tear.One reason I chose this cover over another was because of the included stylus/pen. The stylus comes in handy now and again and the ink pen writes quite nicely. (No blobby ink) The elastic loop holds it securely and it is easy to pull out - not so much putting it back in. I would suggest a different material for the stylus holder - something with a little more body to it.A previous reviewer had pointed out difficulty with the frame of the cover obscuring part of the iPad. I am having the same experience, as the cover of obscures the very top left portion of the touch screen, making it difficult to close out some windows. It's a little bit annoying but worth mentioning.Overall, I am glad I made this purchase and I would recommend this seller and product to others.
5	1373673600	After having to replace my iPad mini because it fell on the cement, I searched for a sturdy case. This one works perfectly. I read in bed at night and my iPad mini can stand on it's own. It's also easy to hold with the attached band.
5	1373673600	This product is awesome. I bought this as a gift for my brother and he loved it. The quality is good. My brother really enjoys this product.
4	1373673600	I love how it puts iPad to sleep and wakes it when opening and closing cover, but the kickstand is not adjustable and a bit too short, so it tends to fall over unless on a firm surface.  Got spoiled by my old one that adjusted and could sit up on pillows in bed.  Overall, glad I have it!
3	1373587200	I was expecting bigger and w keyboard but my mistake. Will keep until I can afford a clam case. God is so good!
5	1373587200	this holder for my IPAD mini looks sharp, love how it turns off the screen when closed.  Easy to hold when reading a book.  The stylus is a bonus.  Recommend it.
5	1373587200	mini fits great in case. looks great. bonus pen stylus was a good accent . I-Blason great product. got it fast too
5	1373587200	Really good for the price we get it for - matches any other leather case in market by the look of it
5	1373500800	This cover is a nice materiel. Looks just like the pictures. The handle isn't very convenient, yet the stylus was a nice touch. Love the look and feel of it.
5	1373500800	Love the case - the sturdiness, the attached stylus. The upright feature allows me to forget I ever wanted an attached keyboard. Good purchase.
5	1373414400	I would highly recommend this iPad mini cover.  You can't beat the price for this sturdy case which has a slot for notes and comes with a pen in the pen attachment.  A great deal!
4	1373328000	I bought this in pink for my iPad mini and I love the color.  I get compliments on it all the time.As other people said, there is a smell to it when you first get it, but the smell was gone after a few days.The auto-wake/sleep function works great.  I like how it's totally enclosed (vs some covers that leave the Apple logo exposed).My main complaints are these:  One, the iPad doesn't sit straight in sleeve, so I have to lift the corner or shift the device to check my battery life, and the camera lens isn't in the center of the cutout.  Two, there is no protection for the corners of the iPad; I haven't had an issue, but part of that is because I'm really careful about it.  Three, it's kinda tricky to stand up.Other than those things, it's a great case.
5	1373241600	I love this case. I use it to protect my IPAD mini. It works well in my purse. The pen/stylus works well too. My daughter bought one too she liked mine so well.
4	1373241600	It would be best if the product had instructions with it.  I finally figured it out, though. For the price, it is fine.  There have been complaints that it is not real leather, but I think the synthetic leather is quite sturdy and will probably last a long time.  In my thinking, the case is quite good-looking.
4	1373155200	I like it but it sometimes makes it a little difficult to turn off apps. at the bottom of the screen (just the one near the side).
4	1373068800	It is very sturdy and  has a magnetic edge that keeps it closed when not in use.  I have used the small pocket for business cards and found that convenient for quick easy storage.  The pen was handy for notes and the soft end helps choose letters or options  that are sometimes crowded together.  One small negative is that the sound controls are slanted toward the rear and are a bit awkward and crowded to reach, a slight cut out in that area would be useful.
4	1373068800	This is a really good case! The iPad mini fits amazingly in it (note: I got the blue case and it looks so good with the white iPad mini.)  There are a few pros and cons about this case; more pros than cons, mind you.PROS:- The pen is amazing, and it turns into a pen and a stylus. It's very useful in some cases.- The stand is really solid. But sometimes when I use the stand on portrait mode, the stand presses back. But inreally have no problem with that.- The camera holes are perfect!- The multiple colors that this i-Blason case comes in are so cute when you use it with the iPad.- Charger, earphone plug, speakers, sleep button, are cut out perfectly and you'll have know problem with them.- Auto wake works perfectly.CONS:- The iPad mini gets a little loose when you put it in the case.- The microphone hole sometimes covers the microphone. (I think it does that because the iPad's really loose.- I can't really tap stuff on the far left side of the screen.To me, that's all! If you're thinking about getting this case, I think you really should. There are so many more pros in this case so don't hesitate to get it! :)(Note: I'm 12 so my taste in cases are very different from yours. If you get the case after reading my review and expecting something just like what I said and you don't like it.... Well, that's not really my problem since i gave you this warning.)
5	1373068800	This cover fits perfect and looks very nice.  It also protects my mini- iPad.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a mini iPad.
4	1372982400	purchased a cover with the initial purchase of our first ipad mini....2x's the price, and I did NOT like it.  purchased one like this for our 2nd one, LOVED it and decided to buy another one to replace the one purchased from Apple! :-)
5	1372982400	I ordered this nice case without reading the full description and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had the auto wake/sleep feature.  The price at amazon is great, I saw similar cases in stores selling for about twice this price.  The case is well made from quality leather and the combination pen/stylist is a great addition.  I like the case so well that I intend to order a couple more for gifts when I return home.
5	1372982400	I really enjoy this product. I was very surprised at how good this product it is for the money. That was the main thing that surprised me.
4	1372982400	I think this is great for the price, I think it is well worth it.  It's fits my mini ipad nicely.
4	1372896000	Although this cover would add to the dimensions and weight of your iPad mini and you'll lose the sleekness but I think the tradeoff is worth it since it provides very good protection. It fits perfectly well and holds your iPad firmly in place. The faux leather looks as good as real and there is no doubt it looks very professional. The inclusion of the stylus cum pen is a bonus and is suited for apps like Evernote and Paper.All in all, it is great if you want to protect your iPad from damage. As a bonus, it has the auto wake/sleep feature like the one present in Apple's own SmartCase.
3	1372896000	For the price I don't know if I should really expect too much.  I like it, the fit is great and it protects my iPad mini.  The stand doesn't work well, though, and the part that goes around the screen is coming apart.
5	1372723200	Got the violet color. Nice and bright but pleasing to the eye. Love the pen tip for typing, prevents oil build on the screen.
5	1372636800	This mini IPad cover is great! My husband loves the stylus attachment and the sturdy construction. Great product at a great price.
4	1372636800	Great quality & pen writes nice, excellent purchase very satisfied. I have had for about 3 weeks now & it has a  nice sleek look
5	1372636800	It's exactly what i needed and is durable. I've enjoyed it since i got it, very convenient. I wasn't sure how long the material would last especially since i use it daily but its handling very well.  I won't need another for a long while
5	1372636800	I love this case and the color pink! The quality is great and so is the color. It looks very professional.
4	1372550400	works well this cost half as much as the first one i bought at the store really nice features sleep smart cover works great really stretches my battery life, while protecting my screen. I like the handle just wished it would lock in differently or with a magnet still cant beat the price.
5	1372550400	Very goog qualityAnd it looks nice on my ipad miniBuy it! It is not perfect but it pretty good product
1	1372550400	Lots of bubbles. Hate it! I do not recommed this at all! For the price, sure you can get something better.
4	1372550400	It's very nice & fitted well. My daughter liked it very much. Not so much about the stylus,it has very soft tip.
5	1372550400	Love the color as I can always find it in my purse. Easy to handle and stylus is very handy
5	1372464000	It protects my iPad, turns it off when I close the cover.  The pen with the stylus end is an added benefit.I would recommend this product.
5	1372464000	I really love this cover! The elastic holder in the back to secure your hand is a nice addition.It has all the features of much more expensive covers plus I never lose my stylus thanks to the clever holder.At this price point, I would recommend this to iPad mini owners.
5	1372377600	The i-Blason Apple iPad Mini Auto Wake/Sleep Smart Cover Leather Case exceeds all my expectations. I am very impressed with the quality of materials and workmanship that have gone into crafting this case which is made of black leather with contrasting white stitching. Your iPad Mini will fit perfectly with all controls and ports available. The iPad is held firmly in place with a leather/velcro strap that tucks behind the iPad. The cover has a magnet that snaps firmly in place, yet opens easily. The wake/sleep function works flawlessly. There is a leather-trimmed hand strap on the inside of the cover enabling you to hold your iPad securely without having to stretch your hand. There are two card slots which are great for carrying a few business cards. The slots will accommodate a credit card, but I can't recommend using the slots for that purpose. The back of the case has a leather tab into which the front cover can be tucked, making it possible to stand the iPad either horizontally or vertically. There is also an opening in the upper left corner of the back for the camera lens. The case comes with a combination stylus/pen tucked into an elastic loop on the side of the case. The pen/stylus works very well, although it feels very light. I prefer a pen with a bit more weight. The only negative aspect to the case is that when the cover is folded back, the camera lens is covered. Could a matching opening be made in the front cover? Probably, but due to the flex in the hinge, it would still be tricky to line up the openings. The simplest solution is to tuck the front cover into the tab on the back. This will leave the camera lens unobstructed.All in all, I am delighted with the i-Blason case. Now that I have it in hand and have been using it for a few days, I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a case for their iPad Mini. I would expect to pay considerably more for a case of this quality and knowing there is a 3-year warranty makes it all the more attractive. Great case, great price!
3	1372377600	The  i pad mini case is great. Like the color. However it took 3 weeks for the person to receive the mini case which was over 2 weeks late for her birthday. so that was a little upsettingThanks Francis
5	1372377600	Was really pleased with this cover.  My husband absolutely loved it.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.  He really likes the hand strap that this one has along with the stylus holder.
5	1372377600	Love it!  Perfect for my Ipad mini and I love the pen that comes for free! Great purchase. Amazon ticks me off with needing extra words and really I don't have anything else to say.
5	1372291200	Excellent product! It arrived before the given time. The cover was of good quality and the fit was excellent. Many people asked where I purchase the case. Excellent quality for the cost. It's a must buy if you have a Mini ipad.
5	1372291200	Well made and fits perfect. No problems with product - even with three kids. Overall very pleased with product and highly recommend it.
3	1372204800	ProThis product fits the ipad mini pretty well.It looks decent.CostCons:One of the main issues I find is that it doesn't stand up wellCreases
4	1372204800	I got the cover quickly and it works pretty well. My cover didn't have any odor like some of the other reviews mentioned. The iPad fits nicely in the case. The only thing I am not particularly fond of is that the back kind of overlaps a little and makes it difficult to get to the buttons easily.My biggest complaint involves the stylus that came with the cover. Mine did not have the rubber part used to write on the iPad (I am not sure what it is called), so I pretty much just got a pen with a hole in the top. I have called i-Blason twice already and no one has answered. I left a message and no reply. I cannot find an email to reach them either. Now I am just left waiting for the other styli I ordered to arrive. It's a bit disappointing, but at least the stylus is easily replaceable.
5	1372118400	Good fit and price was half off.  Came with special pen that stays with cover so you can't lose it.
5	1372118400	Bought it for my husband's iPad Mini, it fits perfectly. He loves the elastic hand strap and the stylus holder. He said the stylus is too skinny for his hands so he gave it to me, but it's a great bonus. Credit card slots are pretty cool not sure if he will really use it or not(maybe more of placing a "If Found Please Call" type of card in it). The only thing I dislike is the look of the front cover. It has a deep vertical line/indentation on the top cover. It's there so you can flip the cover over and prop up the screen in landscape mode, but my husband isn't bothered by it, so no biggie. It also sits up it portrait mode and it's best feature...the cover puts the ipad in to sleep mode upon closing and wakes ipad upon opening.  Overall great buy.
5	1372118400	This item of theres was just what i need because i could not find any thing like this i stores . so when i found i loved it . it took me a day to get used to it, But i loved it after that and it still holds up perfect.
3	1372118400	The case itself is fine, I had a problem with the space provided for the home button. The original cut line was too narrow for me to be able to easily get the home button to work. I ended up trimming the area and the case works fine now. It may just be my ipad, but it was the only way to get my home button to work.
5	1372118400	Very good cover for iPad mini. Sleek design and fits perfect to mini. Not too bulky but is protective. Stylus works well on screen as well, good deal
5	1372032000	Love this cover.  It is very expensive looking.  The Ipad 2 fits perfect in it. I would highly recommend this product.
5	1372032000	Excellent!  Far above expectations!  (But now maybe not for you.)  &#34;Wow&#34; value in my opinion.  It is well worth your investment.
4	1372032000	The is not so good because don't tip the correctly word and have press very hard for  write good, ok
4	1372032000	When I opened the package this case came in, I was pleasantly surprised. The case is made of very soft leather and has a beautiful rich color (purple). My iPad mini fits snugly into the case and I have no concern about it falling out. I'm especially impressed with the wake/sleep feature. There are two drawbacks that kept me from giving the case five stars. I don't usually use my mini standing up, but if I did I would be very disappointed in that feature. It isn't very steady, and the user doesn't get a choice of positions. One small item annoys me because it would have been very easy to remedy. The loop for the stylus is useless. Instead of the stylus clip slipping over the top of the loop, it just stretches it. After bending the clip and using both hands, I got the stylus in place. Then the stylus was secure, but it flopped around as I carried my device. If the loop were made of a non-elastic material, that issue would be solved. Overall, especially considering its very moderate price, this case is one I would buy again and would recommend.
5	1371945600	Item is everything they claim. Pen seems to be a bit light weight, but other then that its a great product.
5	1371945600	Great little cover, comes with pen/stylist which works great.  The hand hold and support on the back work great as well.
4	1371945600	Like they way the screen shuts off when the cover is closed,  Nice flip back stand for reading.  However the stylus does not work on the I pad but does on my phone.
5	1371945600	This is perfect for my ipad mini. It stands up sideways nicely but too wobbly straight up. The pen and credit card holder is nice but I haven't used them. I really like the hand strap to hold it while viewing as it cuts down on hand fatigue. On off when closing the cover is a great feature.
5	1371945600	Very happy, would recommend.  Easy to use, protects the ipad perfectly. I really love the bright pink color and the texture.
5	1371859200	Very beautiful and functional.  The carrying handle is an extra plus.  Love it!  The color is great.  Would definitely recommend.
4	1371859200	My iPad mini is secure in case I drop it.  It is an attractive color and my Stylus is always with me.
5	1371772800	Wasn't aware before researching covers about the magnetic closing, which turns out to be a great feature.  Fits my Ipad Mini perfect, easy to use, sleek and a great price.
5	1371772800	Great cover at a great price. The stylus/pen is a nice added feature. I got the cover to carry my iPad mini in my purse and keep it protected, but it's stylish enough to compete with an expensive wallet.
5	1371772800	cali girl  -  I am totally delighted with this - It was like $20 less than the one Verizon wanted to sell me that was NOT functional -I got the purple / everything about this is exactly what I wanted.  - real leather, well designed. great price. - get it
5	1371772800	I have several cases for my iPad Mini. Most of them are more expensive Belkins, which I've reviewed as well. The primary reason I normally use the more affordable i-Blazon case is that it has a Smart Cover feature that puts my Mini to sleep when closed. It is almost like turning it off (power savings wise), only it starts up much more quickly once you lift the lid. It's a great feature that the more costly Belkins should have standard. They also don't feature the hand strap, card holders and pen/stylus.By comparison, I would say that the Belkin cases are slightly more attractive and are made from higher quality and more "touchable" materials. The i-Blazon case is made from a decent grade of leather and in all black looks very business-like. Classy. Perhaps the stitching is not as refined as the other cases, but it is well put together, my iPad fits snugly, all of the ports are easily accessible and it protects my valuable tablet. It has dropped several times from heights of up to 4-5 feet, and it still working fine. The inside of the case has a softer suede texture while the exterior is a glossier leather and easy to clean.With the 3 year warranty on top of it all, you should have not worries when getting this case. There are other color choices if black is not your thing, but you'll be paying a little more for them. A friend of mine got the purple model and it looks pretty nice with a white Mini. For what you get for the price, this a product I have no problem giving my highest recommendation.~ Kort
5	1371686400	Upon opening the packing, it was easy to see this is a very well constructed case using top quality materials. I ordered the black case with the pebble grain surface with white stitching. The workmanship is outstanding. The I-Pad mini fits very snugly and is protected on its back by some foam padding and a locking strap. The Mini will not fall out and is afforded some protection by the foam padding and the case itself. There is a handy pocket for business cards as well as an elastic hand strap to secure it while reading the screen.  In addition, a handy stylus / pen is included, making it easier to use the keyboard. One might have to cut out some of the foam padding to expose the lens for the camera on the back.This will be the best $15 you ever spent.
4	1371600000	This cover is absolutely excellent in every respect....other reviews covered these so I won't elaborate.2 minor cons- cover has tendency to cover some corners which obscures play button on video apps.- no kickstand for portrait mode which enables unit to lean back.  Turning  on its side enables a perpendicular position.Again...these are super-minor annoyances.  I am amazed at the quality of product you can get at this price point.
5	1371600000	Plain and simple:  bought this to, well, protect my iPad mini, and guess what?  Does EXACTLY that, no problems with the magnet cover.  Feels sturdy and well built.  GREAT price, I highly recommend!
4	1371513600	I really like my Smart Cover the only thing that I am a little disappointed in is the Stylus.  The rubber is has split and I am afraid that it soon will possibly scratch my I-pad.  Everything else is great.
5	1371427200	The iBLASON Apple iPad Mini Cover is exactly what I wanted.  Excellent quality, excellent fit, heavy-duty protection at a great price - there isn't anything I would change.  Perfect!  So happy with my purchase.
5	1371427200	I drop my tech devices a lot. I don't really intend to do this, but it happens no matter how careful I am. This cover is sturdy, yet light-weight.No obstructions to any of the ports or camera. I love the satisfying &#34;click&#34; when I close it.Construction appears sound, no unraveling of the stitching.
5	1371340800	The I-Blason iPad mini cover is great.  It is so easy to use and move to different positions. My favorite feature is that it puts your tablet to sleep when you close the cover. I didn't know covers could do that. This is a must have!
5	1371254400	This leather case for the ipad mini is excellent. Good leather, attractive, handy pencil/stylus slip on edge; Price is great! Just close it and the ipad is placed in sleep mode. Open it, and your screen is right there.The case can be folded to use and view the ipad in upright position. Handy hand strap. Comes in several colors, but I chose black because it doesn't show marks or dirt. Good buy, and I recommend it.
5	1371168000	I love it especially the fact that's its leather. I wish it came with a screen protector. Cute product. :)
4	1371081600	It arrived on time, and it's perfect for my mini I-Pad.  It looks nice and protects it. I like it very much. Thank you.
4	1370995200	I like it very much for the price. Apple offers lesser covers for a much higher price. Very handy and comfortable. Only drawback it the standing position is not very good. material is not stiff enough so it doesn't hold it upright enough to be of much use. I love the stylus/pen combo that's included.
3	1370995200	Seems a little akward taking photo's with my Ipad in my case. They should have a hole on the flip over side as well.
5	1370908800	I ordered this cover to replace a complicated swivel style that was awkward and did not stand up well. The one is a great deal! It is very high quality leather and finish and the card holder and hand strap are awesome to use. It also includes and pen/screen stylus is a great help for using on-the-run.And guess what! It really stands up!
5	1370822400	This was just as described. It is sturdy and exactly what I wanted.I was actually worried about the color but it was exactly like the photo and a good value for the price. I'm happy with this purchase.
5	1370822400	Looks great and keeps ipad mini covered. I like how the corners are secure since that's where they are most at risk when dropped.
5	1370736000	I am very pleased with this iPad mini cover in purple that I recently received.  It definitely looks like it does in the pictures.  The hand strap is a great feature as it allows you to hold the iPad mini securely without worrying about it slipping out of your hands. Overall, VERY happy with my purchase!
5	1370736000	My daughter found this online. I'm so GRATEFUL!  Every single time I hold it in my hand, I'm grateful. This is the BEST priced and performing cover for the iPad mini on the market!
5	1370649600	There is a lot to like about this cover and it was way cheaper than many others. I wish it was a little more upright when used folded.
5	1370649600	Loved this product brought it for my daughter for her birthday.  She loved the color and the stylus/pen was real cool.
4	1370563200	Nice product my girl loves it. Only issue was we replaced the pen with a more durable one but still enjoy the cover
5	1370563200	I was more than pleased with my iPad leather case. The stylus was a great bonus. It was exactly as described in the listing and arrived on the exact day it said it would.  I would highly recommend this case to anyone who has an APPLE iPad mini. I love the color (magenta) and the sturdiness of this case.  I am very glad I purchased it.
5	1370563200	I like it my mini iPad is very protected price is good it very satisfied with product I recommend this product
5	1370563200	Needed a cover for my mini and this one is great.  Love the color, purple, and the auto wake feature.  The color makes it easy to find in my travel bags.  It does add a bit of weight to the mini, but since I travel often, it is a small trade off for the protection it offers when having to take it in and out at security checkpoints and getting jostled around in my travel bags
4	1370390400	I really liked this product and would recommend it.  I especially like the hand grip on the back.  Feels very secure and is a good quality cover, and the stylus is great. Using this stylus is much better than using your finger.
5	1370390400	This was shipped quickly and is perfect for my son's Ipad mini that he brings everywhere.  He loves that it turns on when he opens the flap.
5	1370390400	This cover is absolutely wonderful.  It even comes with a stylus that is also a pen and the cover has slots for credit cards.  Love it.The only thing that would make it even better is a detachable shoulder strap.
5	1370390400	perfect! it fits well, protects well and is very durable. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a cover.
5	1370390400	This is our third cover purchase after buying three ipad minis. They are solid and work great. Have had compliments and even envy from folks who bought the standard hard covers. Highly recommended.
5	1370304000	This Cover fit very well in my Ipod mini, I bougth this product for my daugther. she is happy with this cover
3	1370131200	It holds the iPad in securely as well as the stylus but it doesn't really stand up well in upright position.
5	1370131200	I ordered this product and have been pleasantly surprised at how great it is.  The iPad Mini fits perfectly into place and all the buttons on the mini iPad are easily accessible cause of the appropriate holes already pre made on this case.  It also works great as a stand a number of several different ways.  It fits just right in my hand and the iPad mini is just as portable with the i-BLASON Smart Cover.One of my best purchases so far on Amazon and trust me... at any price there is no better smart cover.
5	1370044800	I absolutely love this case!  I looked at many cases in the different stores and ended up ordering this one on Amazon.  Not only was it a smoking good price, it is high quality and extremely functional.  I would highly recommend it!
5	1369958400	This high quality synthetic leather case fits our new iPad Mini perfectly! It slides easily into the cover and is secured by a velcro tab. The edges of the cover do not encroach into the iPad Mini screen. We really like its multi-functionality with the comfortable hand strap, the convenient easel for desktop use, the included ink pen/stylus, and the auto wake/sleep feature.
4	1369872000	I love the strap for your hand - that is a great feature. It is nice to have a stylus attached to the cover. I like the bright color & it is very well made. Glad I got it.
5	1369872000	Very nice quality leather cover. I didn't think I'd like the white stitching, but it looks good. It did not have the  funny odor others talked about. It functions as advertised and I love it!
2	1369872000	It is a good case, it upholds well but isn't very cute. I prefer more fashion forward cases that protect well.
5	1369872000	I really love this cover!!I feel it really protects my iPad suits my needs and yet it is not too bulky
5	1369872000	I would recommend to everyone. Enjoy using product. I love the color. 8 more words will not make or break product or review.
4	1369872000	The cover fit much better than I expected as I thought the Mini would slide around inside the pocket, but it continues to remain solidly in place.  The material appears and feels well made and looks much better than many of the other covers I looked at in several brick and mortar retailers while t a much cheaper cost.  I really like the on/off feature of opening/closing of the cover.  Two very minor issues - it is sometimes difficult to touch or maneuver items on the left most part of the screen when in portrait mode as the cover extends over the screen enough to interfere with your finger not hitting the appropriate location.  Second, when holding the unit with the cover turned behind the unit (as in one of the images) and using the attached handle (next to the credit card slots), the weight if the iPad pulls down and you must use your thumb on the left edge to hold the unit level.  Not a big deal once you get used to it....overall a very good product for a good price!
5	1369785600	I love this ipad cover, very functional and well done.  Great color, great functionality,  I would order again. It is wonderful
5	1369699200	great product, protects the ipad. my little 11 year old friend had to tell me that the soft end of the pen was a &#34;fingertip simulator&#34; i love it!
5	1369699200	This is my 2nd cover.  The first was a different brand and more expensive and it was white and got stained and I also had to modify it to make sure the camera was not covered giving my photos a halo effect.  Anyway the iBlason cover is my 2nd cover and it is very strong and the stylus as good as my other Targus stylus and with some apps it's even better.  The cover has 2 angles which is less than my 1st cover but the 2 angles are perfect.  One angle lays down 1 inch from the table and is good for typing or viewing at a desk.  The other angle is higher at 85 degrees(?) and tilts back slightly and may fall at first while leather is still stiff but is now staying put with some use. This is a great angle for reading recipies, and no more halo effect since the velcro secures the pad tightly.  What I like the best is the hand strap which is genius, no other cover is like this.  You can read anywhere.. Laying down under a tree hold it over head with ease and no worry that you'll drop it on your face and so ergo since you don't need to grip the iPad anymore so less stress on your hand.  Hope this helps...
4	1369699200	I bought  this mini iPad cover because of the featured hand strap and supposedly leather case. Too late to read that it was just a leather look, not a genuine leather. But it still looks fine and protects the iPad real well. The elastic hand strap didn't work well because the way it was positioned, the heavier iPad slides down or the cover behind slides up so that the iPad and the cover doesn't go together. It was really annoying but my husband found a solution. He put 2 dime size Velcro on the other side to snap the cover together. Now it works fine but when you close back the cover over the face of the iPad, the Velcro is very tacky to look at. :(  I found another cover that has the hand strap on the opposite side of the cover in that way, your hand and forearm will encircle the iPad for better hold. A plus for this item is the included stylus for the price.
4	1369699200	Quality much higher that expected. Love the color, It work great. Opening and closing the case turn the IPod on and off.
5	1369612800	This case is great for travel! It provides superior protection for my iPad, has a place to store business cards, a hand strap to aid you in holding it during meeting and such, and the stylus is also a pen! So functional!
5	1369526400	I went to every national chain in search of a smart cover for my iPad mini. The cheapest at staples and best buy was 29.95 and didn't have the sleep on close of cover function. In fact, none at either store featured it.
2	1369526400	The case is okay, the magnetic cover is really good. But after two weeks of use the bottom of the case started getting swollen and inflating. It didn't touch any water or fluid substances, yet it seems to be bending and swelling up. I don't know if I got a bad case or the case is suppose to be like this but this makes it really uncomfortable to hold my case.
3	1369526400	I thought I ordered one for the iPad 2 but instead got then one for the mini iPad totally my mistake but overall it's ok
5	1369440000	This case fits the iPad mini well and lets it stand up for hands-free viewing. The hand strap makes it more comfotrable to hold.  The sleep/wake feature is nice. i did not notice any objectionable odor
3	1369440000	I love the color. Issues, it does't stand on it's own as shown in the pic. The corner edges hinder some uses, such as those crazy x's, you need to tap for advertising that will come up during games and such. But it protects my iPad and as I said I love the color! I will keep this for now. But keeping my eye open for something different.
5	1369440000	okit was a gift to someone who has not given it back, so it must be good okok
5	1369353600	This i-blazon cover for our iPad Mini is just what was needed and for us it works great.  The leather is good quality and the "Elastic Hand Strap" works great for taking the strain off of your hand by letting the iPad rest without having to grasp it making what you are doing much easier.
5	1369353600	This product is really great and easy to use! I'd go with this one over any of the other cases sold.
5	1369267200	I got this case as a birthday gift with my iPad mini and I love it!!! The only problem I had was with the pen/stylus.  Not the greatest stylus there is. You have to press really hard on the screen for it to work.  Besides that I would definatly recommend this case. It's worth the price for the case!!!
2	1369267200	I am not happy with this iPad mini case.  The edging is to big for the iPad mini, and it makes it difficult to use the entire screen while the cover is on.  Also, the loop that is in place for the pointer device is in the way of changing the volume.  You have to hold the loop down in order to change the volume, which is annoying.  The touch pen is not very good at all.  I stopped using the that after a day.Using the case as a stand is substandard as well.  You have to still lean it against sometime for it to stay upright.I have discontinued using this case and I am really disappointed that I purchased it.
5	1369180800	Sturdy product. Great sleep feature. Stand works well if accessing a recipe or using the photo frame feature. Replaced the stylus with one that wasnt a pen. Perfect.
5	1369094400	No complains.  Delivery time great.  This is a very nice cover!!  It protects My iPad Mini well and does not add any weight to it.
1	1369094400	First off the actual case is a little big for my iPad mini and it is not easy to get into the corners when trying to end a page or start at the beginning of a line.  The material needs to be cut more a little more to get full access.  Not to mention I accidentally ordered two and they charged me half of the amount to ship it back, total rip off!!!
5	1369008000	I just bought two of the i-Blason Apple iPad Mini 7.9 Auto Wake/Sleep Smart Cover Leather Cases.  Yes!  Leather. This product is awesome as it not only secures your iPad mini but it is also multi-purpose too.  It has pockets inside for your drivers licenses or credit cards.  It comes with its own stylus/pen with holder.  Everything folds together so it is secure when shut.  Everything you need is right here.  This product is a good value as I compared it to others in major department stores.  And did I mention a 3 year warranty?  Nice!
5	1369008000	The Case is sturdy and nice looking. The ipad mini fits very securely into the sleeve due to the adjustable velcro tab used to secure it. That also makes it easy to remove it from the case should you so decide. And even though the sleeve doesn't cover the corners of the mini, the case itself extends beyond the corners on all sides. I have no problem getting to the extreme corners of the mini to reach icons, the Home key is easily accessed and the opening for the camera is more than ample.The Stylus is very handy and the elastic strap is well secured to the case. The Stylus could be a bit more sensitive but is still very serviceable. I hate having to look around for my stylus or have it dangle from my earphone jack - so this setup is very convenient for me.The landscape easel position was a bit unbalaced until I got firm with the case. I set it up and pushed forward and down on the top of the triangle to make it "learn" the correct position. I had to repeat that a couple of times until the leather learned to flex. After that, no problem getting the case into that position.The Strap on the inside cover makes holding the mini in the portrait position easier for reading and also while walking around making notes (list person here). Once I found the "sweet spot" for my size hand, it was very comfortable. And with a touch of (premature) arthritis, being able to hold the case securely with one open hand really helps.I haven't used the card holders for anything but an "if found" ID card (in case I lose it and someone honest finds it).And I LOVE the fact that my mini goes to sleep simply by closing the cover! (Hubby didn't get this case and has to remember to put his mini to sleep.) For an absent-minded person (list maker, remember?), that is the best ever feature!Overall, this case feels custom made for me! Totally delighted
5	1369008000	Was unsure just which case I was going to purchase, with so many available. This one had good reviews (as others did) and I decided to buy because of the reviews and price. Item arrived quickly and the iPad Mini fits in it perfectly. So far, I really like this case.
4	1368921600	the case is great, shuts off when closed starts up when opened easy to use stand. The stylus could use improvement I don't think it works to well but very happy with cover.
5	1368921600	This is a good buy --- price and quality.It installs easily and quickly.The material does not slip in your hands --- allows a good grip on the unit.  Bonus in having inside 'pockets'.It is recommended for the individual who wants a good I-Pad Mini cover that sells at a low price, but yet offers quality --- often the two are not available in one product.
3	1368835200	Pros:I've had this cover for over a year, looks nice, overall does the job, not too big, protects the mini when ur 2 yr old throws it etc.  overall descent for your money but could use some improvements.Cons:What drives me insane is when I'm playing games or viewing pics if the button is in the top corners u can't always reach it bc the frame covers it.  Annoying!!!The other reason why I am researching to find a new cover is bc when I do try to watch videos it doesn't always stand.  I'd also like to be able to view it vertically but that isn't an option unless u simply lay it down.The frame can make it difficult to push the volume buttons. i actually messed up my button somehow bc I pushed so hard bc the case was in the way. Now my button only works if I push it at an angle:/When the pen/stylus isn't in use it gets in the way so I removed it completely.  Tends to snag on things especially if in a purse or bag.The handle strap is nice but there needs to b something that keeps the inner cover from flapping around either elastic strap magnet or Velcro???  When using the strap it can b awkward keeping it from moving/opening or separating while in use.  Kinda hard to explain.
1	1368835200	The product photos was different from this review and the quality of the was not good as stated in the description. I would not buy this cover.
5	1368835200	The color looks great  and the material is first class and sturdy....This is the first cover leather we ordered, but compared to others that we see on the stores, this product is beyond our expectation.
4	1368748800	Like the cover.  Only thing that would make it better would be the stand does not have an ~ 45 degree angle.  It's more like a 20 degree angle.
3	1368662400	It is as described except the design for propping up the iPad is flawed.  It doesn't work - iPad falls backward.  Would be nice if there was a fastener to keep the case closed when iPad is not in use.  But price is reasonable for what it is, I guess.
5	1368662400	Neat little cover. Color nice leather soft and easy to handle.  Keeps my Ipad safe from outside elements. Good buy.
5	1368662400	I was looking for a quality iPad mini cover at a great price, and found it here. You get what's pictured (except the stylus is also a pen). My iPad fits perfectly in it, shuts off properly when I close the cover, and great design and color. I like the strap. I haven't used the stand too much, but it could be a little bit more stable and maybe another upright level would be good. But overall I am very pleased. I would recommend to others.
5	1368576000	Bought this case for my ipad mini. Initially bought a case from apple store. Decided to return it and bought this case for half the price. The case is awesome. It keeps my ipad nice and protected. Definitely recommend the product.
5	1368576000	It's so much easier to handle my mini iPad now. It's well protected and stays clean! I enjoy the pen as well that came with it.
4	1368403200	Overall the case is a great case. The only issues I have is the 'extra material' when i fold the case open, the crease could have been designed more slim line, but not a deal breaker.
4	1368403200	I love this case.  I use my iPad on the go at work quite a bit, and I really like the strap for your hand.  It makes it so easy to use without worrying about dropping it.  The only thing that I do not like is I feel like my iPad is slightly unstable and wobbles when I stand it up.  It could be that I just need to break in the case a little more.
4	1368403200	This is a very good case for the price.  I would recommend it to anyone. The only negative I have though is that the handle doesn't work very well. It wouldn't stop me from buying it again. Highly recommend
5	1368403200	Would recommend it for anyone with an ipad. Keeps it clean and safe when not in use. Everyone should have have one.
4	1368316800	I ordered this when I ordered my Ipad mini. When it arrived I was very surpised that it was actually so well made, I loved the smell of real leather. I order the black case which comes with white stiching. The Ipad mini fits very well in the case & I have had no problems with the auto-wake/sleep feature.I would have given the item 5 stars had the stylus/pen lasted at least 30 days. With that being said I would still recommended it to my family & friends.
5	1368230400	I have no complaints about this case.  The pen doesn't work well with a screen protector, works great on devices that don't have one.
5	1368144000	I'm holding this cover as I type this to you. It is very light weight and keeps my iPad clean and scratch-free.Thank you for fast shipping and great price.
5	1368144000	Very good quality.  Feels expensive and the price was great.  Works perfectly for me and I love the cool color.
5	1368057600	Handy,elegante works well even with my 5 year old. My wife stole it from me!! the pen is an additional tool not to do without.
5	1367971200	I love this.  It is so fun, cute, easy to use.  I love that it came with the pen.  I did not know it was going to come with that, so it was like Christmas!!! =)
5	1367971200	Was exactly what I wanted works perfect, product works exactly as described and is very durable , it arrived promptly and in great shape
4	1367884800	Love the way this case fits.  Nice product for the price. Just using this temporarily, though. Unless of course it proves to be even better than it seems.
5	1367798400	Maybe it wasn't a &#34;large&#34; investment but those iPads are pretty spendy. I shopped around for a cover that would be the most attractive, and one that would stand up to my grandchildren's attention. The i-BLASON fit the bill and came with the stylist as well, the small pen that I thought I'd never use but now use constantly. The well designed convertible nature of this cover makes it easy to use from various angles like free-standing, landscape or portrait modes. A really well designed cover.
5	1367798400	I purchased this ipad cover because not only did it keep my Apple iPad Mini clean and safe.  I love the fact that when it closes, the iPad cuts off and saves my battery.  The clicking noise that it makes when it closes lets me know that it is truly closed and my iPad is turned off. Purple is my favorite color so that was definately a given and the handle on the inside is great for carrying when I am moving from room to room and do not want it to close but have a handfull of items to carry.  The leather material is light and well stitched together, with a soft interior so that the face of my ipad is not scratched.  There are a couple of pockets on the inside allowing me to carry either business cards or my drivers license and credit cards when I do not want to carry my wallet.  I take this everywhere I go because there are so many uses for my iPad and because of the cover no one knows it is an ipad but me, most people think it is just a regular tablet.  The front cover flips over and locks into the back to allow it to stand so that you can watch movies or videos.  I would have like the base to have been a little stiffer but it works pretty well.  The 3 year warranty is also AMAZING as well.  I hope that you purchase one of these items to cover your iPad Mini as well because it definately has been a lifesaver for me...
5	1367798400	iPad Mini case.  I have an i-Blason battery case for my Iphone and decided to try this for my new iPad Mini.  With works great.
5	1367798400	Excellent cover for my mini IPad. I take it everywhere. Great for free-standing the Ipad. Good protection. Easy to carry and use
4	1367798400	But it makes it hard to touch the very edge of the screen.  Make sure you position it tightly as it works much better that way.
5	1367798400	This is an extremely well made cover for the iPad Mini and is very affordable. Besides containing many of the features found in covers costing many times more (like activating the iPad On/Off iPad feature with the cover) it contains a Pen/Stylus, an elastic handle,  a place to insert an ID card, and a well designed holder that allows the case to become a stand. The quality is very high with a soft interior that will protect the screen and case and a nicely stitched outer leather-like cover. There was absolutely no smell that some other people have reported. Also, the fit to the iPad is perfect; it holds the device snugly and securely. I very much recommend this cover.
4	1367712000	Well, it definitely not GENUINE LEATHER, but looks great! The inside is well made. And when the front cover is closed puts the ipad mini on stand by. GREAT!For the pen to work on the touch screen some pressure has to be put to it, and I personally don't recommend that. Because it will damage your screen, so I just don't use the pen! But it writes on paper, tough!
2	1367625600	It won't stand up for me at all.  And I don't get what the little Velcro tab inside is even for.  Sorry I wasted twenty bucks on it.
5	1367539200	I wanted more protection for my new Mini, and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. This little case is sturdy and stylish. Love the purple!
5	1367452800	The cover is too good and it is more than expected for me...very handy as well light weight. This is also kids safety..
3	1367452800	It is a nice case but the stand up feature is poor.  No option for vertical and horizontal.  Bought another case,
5	1367452800	Very nice product. Has the executive feel, and it fit perfectly.  Good price point!I would recommend this brand for any iPad owner.
5	1367452800	It is everything I expected. I love the color. The strap is handy. Very well made. I am happy with it.
5	1367452800	Great Leather Cover for Ipad Mini. I have checked out many covers for Ipad Mini. But this one definitely is the best at this price.
4	1367366400	Low Cost and pretty good cover.  No problems and I do not expect any.  I have had this cover for about five months and expect it to last many years to come.  Recommend it if you are looking for a functional cover that looks good also.
5	1367366400	I use it every day. Great protection when your a clutz like I am. The syles handy and works well too.
5	1367366400	I got this for my wife. She loves it. It is very lightweight which is important. If I had an iPad Mini I would pick one of these up for myself. Great value for the money.
4	1367366400	Not a bad little case at all.  Wish it had more padding though.  However, I had a difficult time finding a case for the mini, so this was great for a quick buy.
5	1367280000	This is perfect! It fits reasonably well and it offers the protection that I was looking for. The magnetic on and off for the mini is neat, as well.
5	1367280000	A very good smart cover and more, just as described and functions well.  It goes everywhere the ipad mini goes.
5	1367280000	I've been using this case for a couple of months and love everything about it. The color is my favorite, it is protective, the &#34;smart&#34; on and off feature works every time, I like that it has a strap for holding and a space for a stylus (which also works very well), and it fits perfectly with the needed slots for camera/speaker/charger/etc. The only thing it doesn't do TOO well is stand... it takes a bit of tweaking to get it to a stable position. Other than that, a great product!
4	1367193600	For the price this case is not all too bad at all. It comes with a touch pen. I had no problems with the sleep/wake feature. Works fine. Only gripe is that the case doesn't do too well when you stand it up.
2	1367193600	I just returned from a 30 day trip using the cover for my min-ipad.  I just took the mini-ipad out of the cover. The color of the cover, black, stained the bottom and top of my screen protected mini-ipad face. Nothing takes the stain off.  It may not be a big thing to most people, but it irritates me that there is a black stain at the top and bottom. The only solution is to replace the screen protector which I paid $29 for including installation. I doubt the stainw ould have penetrated an unprotected face.Also the cover interferes with wifi reception as you move farther away from your wifi router. I can not make a connection when I am downstairs, but have no problem with the case removed.  Other than these two problems it is a well constructed cover and a great buy for the price.
5	1367193600	I bought for my husband&#8217;s mini iPad since it is so small and would need protection. He loves it. It does not look cheap at all. The handle it has comes in handy when you are reading and holding with one hand. I have to say, I love this feature the most. He also loves the fact that it puts the mini to sleep once you close it.
5	1367193600	This cover is perfect for my needs. Compact, handy and it stands just the way I wanted  it to. Love it
5	1367107200	I looked at the higher priced covers and decided on this one, I am very happy with this purchase. The quality of this manufacturers products is very good. The cover holds the IPAD snug, and you can use it in either hand, there is a strap, so I can hold the IPAD properly without it slipping, or chance dropping it, even when standing, or on subway,. The case is classic, with very well done white stitching around the edge. Interior is soft material, it will protect the IPAD well. I recommend it.
5	1367107200	It fits my ipad very well and provides good protection for it. Very satisfied. It doesn't stand very well sometimes though.
5	1367107200	My friend got the cover first and I had first hand experience that it was a great product.  She has purple and I got the magenta.
4	1367020800	I like this case for going to places when i am at work or on the go where i need to project an image and have my business cards handy. you will thing you paid for the more expensive one. The look and feel is very nice. Fit and finish is very well put together.
5	1366934400	I have a full size ipad with expensive Apple cover. My husband purchased an iPad mini and didn't want to buy the high dollar apple store cover. This product is far superior to the Apple store & much less expensive. The construction provides excellent protection and looks good. Really don't need the stylus or card holder but it's an added feature.
2	1366848000	It is limited to only two positions, which I new when I was buying it, but when, I held it in my hand with the little band, it would be lopsided. I'm always afraid the ipad will tip over when I put it in a standing position. The ipad fit well into the cover, but not perfectly, as it does not align perfectly with the cover. However, it does provide pretty good protection for a cheap price, which is about the only reason why I've kept it.
5	1366848000	I love this! It's a perfect fit and makes using my iPad much more enjoyable. The shipping was fast. You will not be disappointed if you order this!
4	1366848000	This cover for my mini I pad is a beautiful pink and does exactly what it says. However, I've had it less than 6 months and have already noticed a crack in the spine.
3	1366848000	Everything is good with the case, except it doesn't protect it that much in the corners. So if it would had fallen it would most likely to brake. If you're looking for a good elegant case that protects, this is not what you're looking for.
5	1366761600	Lov thee case. Sleek and protective as well as vesital while still bein functional. I highly recommend to any ipad mini ow
4	1366675200	I needed a case, and didn't want to spend over $20. I love the color (purple) it doesn't look cheap and comes with a stylus! The strap comes in handy a lot, it's kinda soft. You can prop it up on its side, it's not the best, but I don't use it like that much. It fits my mini really well and I like the &#34;Auto wake/sleep&#34; feature. I saw some covers at the store but they seemed to be a little on the bulky side, this is quite perfect. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5	1366675200	This was for me and I like it. I have fast accesses to my iPad and the sleep mod is great when you close it.
3	1366675200	It is an okay case. It is a bit more thicker than I had anticipated. It is an okay case,  but it won't impress anyone.
5	1366675200	So far so good. I'm happy with my purchase.  I'm keeping an eye on the spine because it looks like it could get worn from folding it back and holding it, but so far the quality looks good and it's delivering on it's promises.  Delivered as on time.
5	1366588800	Great case! I purchased this case in November 2012 and the case still looks like new and I use it all the time! Also it was a great deal!
5	1366502400	Works very nicely and I really enjoy it. I will recommend it to anyone. the pen is handy and the cover works as described.
5	1366502400	I love it!!!!! Works great  and it makes it easier to hold my IPad. Everyone needs one of these to protect their iPad.
4	1366416000	I got this for my daughters iPad mini. It's really cute for a girl and the pen is a bonus. She loves the shade of pink. It doesn't look flimsy and cheap. It's a great product for the price
5	1366329600	This is the best lightweight case for the ipad. I was very skeptical but i was overly impressed by this product. its not real leather but it sure looks like it without all that weight, its very multifunctional. Kickstand, elastic hand band, auto sleep/wake feature, credit card holder and BONUS stylus pen! i love free stuff so that was a huge perk to the already low price. Its design is classy too, doesnt look cheap. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! everyone who has an ipad mini should own this case!
5	1366329600	Durable, fits well and looks attractive on my Ipad mini.  The quality of the material is very good and has stood up so far to very vigerous daily use.
5	1366329600	Works great, like the pen/stylus too....a must for a mini iPad. This is great quality and the price was unbelievable at this price.
5	1366243200	I considered many covers before buying this one for my iPad mini.  It is well built and very professional looking for use in business.  The positive engagement of the stand provides for viewing at two different angles and it won't slip out and settle down like many other covers do.  One unmentioned feature I realized is that with the cover folded back and engaged in the stand flap, the camera lens is not covered up, as is the case in many other covers lacking the engagement flap.  I found this youtube video review particularly helpful in making my buying decision -  [...]
5	1366156800	I like that it is a sleep cover, have one for my kindle also that it holds the styles pen.  have given one as a gift.
3	1366156800	Quality is good - would prefer to have black stitching instead of white, but I knew that when I ordered. Some of the features like the stack, hand strap and stylus holder are nice. I would like to see the stylus holder fit more flush to the side of the case.
5	1366070400	The case is awesome. It fits my iPad mini perfectly the hand strap is a great idea for it as we'll I use it all the time for work
5	1366070400	This case is really nice, iPad fits nice case matches my wifes Coach Purse perfect, I would highly recomend this case.
5	1365984000	OK, so she chose mainly on color - but it's a perfect size, very functional, and provides protection in case the iPad gets dropped or bumped.  Nice to be able to prop up the iPad  almost vertical for reading or almost horizontal for typing.
5	1365984000	I love it. Fits in my purse. Good for lying in the bed and doing work. Fits in hand and nice and soft.
4	1365811200	FOR THE PRICE I could not have found a better cover. The card pockets, strap and stylus holder are missing on the cover this replaced, the leather is soft and comfortable to hold. DEFINITELY A STEP UP FOR OUR IPad Mini
5	1365811200	Don't rely on my review, check out the one with the video, he explains it all and it is all true.  It is an awesome cover.
3	1365811200	The cover doesn't stand up enough & the stylus is just a ballpoint pen! it doesn't stand up like the picture.
1	1365724800	I purchased this as a Christmas gift. By March the back cover where it folds was breaking. This case was used gently. Not a good quality product. Buy a Snugg case. They cost 10 dollars more but they last..
5	1365724800	When I close the cover, the ipad mini shuts down and automatically turns on when I open it.  I like the angle for hands free reading.  The elastic &#34;handle&#34; allows me to hold the ipad mini comfortably without my hand cramping.
5	1365724800	For a case is that is so economical, this works flawlessly. It shuts off the iPad when you close it. The stylus with a pen is a great addition. The loop that holds the stylus will hold other pens or styluses if you wish. The elastic grip allows your hand to be relaxed while supporting the iPad. And the case of itself is a decent enough synthetic leather that should wear well and last a good while. The only added bonus would be a small ring to attach a leash to so that you could hook it to something like a shopping cart
5	1365638400	This is a great cover for the iPad mini.  I bought it because I needed a cover with the strap as I use my  iPad mini outdoors for my job, and I wanted a little more security while holding it outdoors.  I also like the fact the auto wake/sleep feature actually works with this cover, and it has a pen/stylus holder.  The cover feels much more sturdy than I thought it would.  The only issue is getting it to stand properly, but it is a very minor issue that is easily remedied.  In all, it's a great product!!!
4	1365638400	There was a mixup with the original order(they sent me a kindle fire cover), but the had the correct order to me 2 days later.  The case fits well.  I do have problems occasionally with things in the very top right corner having arrows or x's that need to be pushed and the case is covering it.  Otherwise just what I was looking for.
5	1365552000	My daughter was thrilled to have this for her iPad mini. It is so convenient and she absolutle loves it!  Thanks.
4	1365552000	I bought this cover for my daughter's iPad Mini. After about two months, or so, of use it is still holding together well.The cover turns off the iPad screen each and every time without a problem and the screen comes back on once the cover is opened.The cover features a hook on the back that allows the it to be folded over creating a stand for viewing apps and watching videos in landscape mode.The cover also comes with a dual pen/stylus that sits into a small hook on the side of the cover. It also has a few pockets for storing cards or small flat items.About the only feature I do not like about the cover is the material. The material has held up fine, but the feel of the faux leather doesn't provide much confidence in how it will hold up in the future. However considering the price, purpose, functionality, and the fact that it has withstood my daughter's abuse makes it worth the buy. She has already dropped her iPad Mini  a few times and it has protected it quite well so far.There are other higher quality covers available, but this is definitely a good buy if you are looking to save on a cover.
5	1365552000	It seems to be well made and my ipad mini fits really well into it.  It also holds the ipad securely with velcro so it doesn't slide.  I also like the strap-it makes it very easy to hold.
5	1365465600	Even though others have said the magnetic closure is not good for the iPad Mini, I have found no problems using it.  I think the magnet included is so &#34;weak&#34; it really cannot make an issue for the user.  I especially love the stretchy hand-band for holding it.  This is a much better constructed cover than I expected for the price, so I am extremely happy!
3	1365465600	It is ok and it meets the purpose it was purchased for which is protecting my iPad while carrying it around.
4	1365292800	This is almost perfect but the best out there for the money. Would be perfect if it also had a notepad slot.
5	1365206400	It fits perfectly and the strap makes it safer to hold my I pad and I won't drop it.  It protects my iPad and looks great.
2	1365206400	After looking through several iPad Mini cases, decided to purchase i-Blason, which seems to stand out for the stylus included and card holder, which can be handy sometimes. However, IT DOES NOT HAVE A CAMERA HOLE on the back of the case, which means you have to remove ipad mini from the case every single time you want to take a shot. To be fair, not all their cases are defective because my friend's does not have the same issue. SO, BE AWARE!
5	1365206400	The other reviews I read were correct as to this Mini iPad cover and all of its attributes.  In the online picture it appeared to be black but it came as deep purple, perhaps why the excellently low price.  However, the color is distinctive and I like that.  Great performance on all the attributes the title proclaims.
5	1365206400	Wonderful product and delivered when promised.  I love it.  Actually the ipad mini fits in my purse and even in my pocket and the over protects it.  The styllis was  plus.
2	1365120000	The case was very flimsy and wouldn't stand up properly. The stylus is skinny and lightweight. I wouldn't recommend it.
5	1365120000	This case is worth the money spent. It is perfect for the iPad mini and really protects it well. I really like the way it has a handle to hold it or a stand to be hands free.It did smell a little when I first got it but after a couple days the smell went away. Now I'm able to take my iPad mini with me and know it is well protected. Definitely recommend it!
4	1365120000	I've had this cover for three months now so I can write a fair review. When I initially got it, it did smell, like other's said. I wiped it down with warm soapy water and the smell instantly went away and it did not damage the color or anything. Quality wise, it's pretty good. I feel that my Mini is protected, and It definitely isn't going to fall out. It always fits my Mini perfectly. Some times it's hard to get to thinks in the corner of the screen because of the cutout but if I turn it sideways, there's no issues. At the top of the cover where it folds, it's started to wear a little bit, but that could be because I have it open and bent even when it's laying on the table.  The stylus that come with it was pretty worthless to me. I don't know if it is because I have a clear skin or what, but it was difficult to use. The pen ran out of ink after the first month of having it.
5	1365033600	Works beautifully and is stylish too!  Love it!  Would recommend to anyone who is looking for something not too bulky and that has great craftsmanship too!  A must have!
4	1365033600	Excellent product for the money.  Functional and good looking.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Would  have preferred outer stitching to be black rather than white, but not a big deal.
5	1364947200	I don't use the hand strap, but the case is great for $20.  Auto on works fantastic an it has a good feel to it.
2	1364947200	Cute but very awkward to hold and use if you are left handed. I find myself dropping it a lot.
5	1364860800	For the price, this is a great case. No plastic tabs to break off, magnetic cover, product fits perfectly, great product.
5	1364860800	Love this case! It's very nice and fits my iPad mini perfectly. It looks very professional and the side pockets are very handy. Definitely worth it. I would purchase again.
5	1364860800	Easy to put on, easy to use. Makes using the iPad really convenient and easy. Love the purple color of it
5	1364774400	very fit for my ipad mini. and i like this textile. And this cover comes with a pen which can be used for any tablet.
4	1364774400	This purple one is a great looking case for ipad mini along with the stylus. Everything about this case is great, only thing I'd add is support for multiple viewing angles (just one but that's usually good enough).
4	1364774400	Very nice only the elastic to hold the pen isn't strong enough and the pen is always falling low pulling the pen down to one side, which is  pain.
5	1364601600	Great purchase cover for the money. Money well spent. Love the stitching of leather card holders and stylus holder. Back binder does loose shape some after use but for me it's no big deal. Case still has tons of perks like stand auto on and off when opening and shutting plus the above mentioned. Plus it was CHEAP!
5	1364601600	First, the purple in the picture is near exact the color of the cover.The smart cover works, although every once in a while I need to slightly square the cover to get it to catch. My iPad mini is tightly secured with velcro. There is plenty of room for the camera to take clear shots. The latch for using the case as a stand works perfectly.I have no use for the card holders sewn into the inside cover (does anyone use these things??). The hand strap on the middle third of the cover is okay, but without a way to secure the cover into its open position holding the iPad via the strap must be done cautiously.
5	1364601600	VERY NICE, is perfect,  this item becarful my ipad, i-BLASON Apple iPad Mini 7.9 pulgadas Auto Wake / Sleep Cuero Smart Cov
4	1364515200	between the sturdy but thin cover profile, the sleep/wake function, the card pockets,  and the AWESOME elastic handle - this is by far the most comfortable & functional cover I've come across!  If you don't mind paying $150 from some Euro designers, I haven't found anything else that compares...  The only improvement I'd make a a large folio flap under the card pockets, to carry a few papers or 5x8 note cards... Then it'd be perfect!
5	1364515200	I have had it for nearly a week and love the case. I know it's new, so, of course I love it. But if anything changes I will update my review. I wasn't sure I was going to like the fact that the case did not have a bungee closure to keep it from opening and waking the iPad mini. However, I have found out that it has a magnetic closure that is very secure. It may wear over time, but as of now, it stays securely closed. I also wasn't sure I was going to like the card pockets and the handle strap. Boy, was I wrong. I am able to put the cloth to the clean the iPad mini with in one of the pockets and I just recently put a gift card in the other so I wouldn't forget to use it. The handle has came in handy (no pun intended) for when I am reading my books. I am able to hold the iPad mini with one hand through the handle strap and it stays secure. Much different from the bulky iPad I had before. The only down side is, although I love the stylus/pen, the pen stopped working on the first day. It no longer comes out when I twist it. When I shake it, I do hear it inside of there, but I don't know how to open the pen (twisting the tip and/or the middle hasn't worked) so I know if ever I had to replace the ink...I might as well purchase a new stylus/pen. Also, the stylus isn't easily picked up by my iPad mini like my fingers are. I don't know if I can adjust the sensitivity on the iPad mini screen or not (I looked but couldn't find anything), so I have to press a bit firmer to have my movements shown which causes a squeeky noise. Tolerable, but unfortunate.
4	1364515200	I like this case, but I'm not going to use it because I'm afraid the (totally unnecessary) card slots will scratch or press on the iPad screen.  Even with a screen protector, I wouldn't feel confident about the card slots.  I'd prefer just a simple smooth cover resting against the screen.  Even the hand strap seems unnecessary.  It's a cool idea, but after a while I'd probably stop bothering with the strap, plus eventually, as with all elastics, it will stretch out and press against the screen even more.  The iPad mini is small enough to safely hold with this case folded back "magazine style".  ...and I have small hands.  The hand strap is basically just a gimmick.If I were to actually use this case, I'd probably carefully remove the stitching and remove the card case.I like how well the iPad mini fits in the case, and the magnetic closure makes it very easy to open and keep closed.  The wake-sleep feature works well.The black case with white stitching looks very nice.  Simple and understated.The stylus loop is handy.  I'm not too sure about the stylus that came with it.  The rubber tip is hollow, and looks like it will fall apart soon.  If you're set on having a stylus, buy a different one.  Also in the description, it says stylus is "multi color to choose from", but you don't get to choose.  You get silver, but it's okay, it looks nice.So, in conclusion, I won't use this case because I don't like the card slots pressing against the screen.
5	1364515200	This is a great case.  My 14 year old son uses it daily and it has held up very well.  The bonus stylus is what sold my son on us getting this product for him.  He uses the stylus a lot more than I thought he would.  Great deal for the value
5	1364515200	The i-BLASON Apple iPad Mini cover is much better quality that I figured when I made this purchase.  The leather is flexible but stiff enough to protect and my ipad mini sits in the sleeve very snugly but I can still remove it if I need too.  The stitching is robust and I think it will hold together very well and the pen that it comes with is $8 on tigerdirect.  I would give it 6 stars if I could...
5	1364515200	This is perfect for my I Pad Mini.  It offers great protection when I carry it in my purse, it even makes a neat stand.
4	1364515200	This has worked out just great! Don't use the stand much, but feel more comfortable with it protected in passing it back and forth and just in general.
5	1364515200	Protects the ipad and at the same time gives you a notebook feel. I like the stylus that comes with it to as I have a tendancy to fat finger my typing on the ipad.
3	1364342400	While the case I got was a nice grade of leather and was delivered on time, the strap on the rear is useless. It no where near being taught enough to use it to hold your iPad up with it. On my case there is no loop to slip the stylus in like it showed in my initial advertisement. The platform that holds the iPad up in horizontal positions is great except for the last, or position closest to the user. When placing your iPad there and you tap it with a stylus, it continually pops out of the groove causing a need to re-establish the horizontal positioning.
5	1364342400	Fits great, well made, not bulky. Recommend highly. Can't go wrong with this item. Looked at a lot of items on Amazon and chose this one. Glad I did.
5	1364256000	This smart cover really does  a nice job protecting my mini ipad.  It is also very stylish and great quality. Seems like this will last me along time.  Another plus is that the stylus is also a pen and it writes so nice.  Would definitely recommend!
5	1364256000	I can take my cards. Tuck money in the slot. I have a pen when I need it.! Easy to handle.
5	1364256000	I really enjoy my sleep smart cove. I would recommend it to anyone. Easy and covenant to use. I really enjoy the cover.
5	1364256000	Very good product. Met all our expectations. Sturdy construction, fit product very well and was well worth the cost of the cover.
5	1364169600	I've purchased from this seller 3 x's. Every single item was sold to me as decribed. It was not made out of cheap material and it seems like my ipad mini covers are going to last a very long time. I WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE FROM i-BLASON IN THE NEAR FUTURE !!!! A++++ for selling good quality items at a great price.
3	1364169600	Just can't get it to stay upright, but didn't buy it for that reason, bought it for the hand strap.  Nothing fancy, but does the job.  I've tried to use the upright, just falls over.  Probably better ones out there for that purpose.
5	1364169600	It fits my iPad mini perfectly. Great buy for the price. I can throw it in my purse and it keeps it safe.
5	1364169600	Best I have seen, if you have an ipad mini this is worth it. Ignore the Apple stuff which does nothing to protect your pad and get this, you love it.
5	1364083200	This case works great for me. Love the pen/stylus that comes with it. Now I need to think of seven more words. Crazy.
5	1364083200	It is a reasonable price and fits great! It has been a life saver because the original cover I bough from Apple was scratching the back of my Ipad mini up and it was at least $30 more expensive.
5	1364083200	I loved this product so much, thank you question, I would advise all of looking for such a purchase of this product.
5	1364083200	In my view, the i-BLASON cover is absolutely AWESOME!!! I orginally purchased a Twelve South BookBook for iPad Mini, Classic Blackfor my iPad mini. The first BookBook didn't fit properly so I returned it for a replacement. The second BookBook was no better, so I returned it for a full refund. What adisappointment after spending almost $70!When I searched for another product on Amazon, I found the i-BLASON and how happy I am with this product! The sleep smart cover performs wonderfully well, the hand strap is very handy and I so enjoy having the card holder for my business cards. The bonus stylus is super and the ink pen in the stylus writes well. There was NO odor at all with the item I'd purchased so I'm truly confused as to why all the negativity I'd seen in previous feedback comments I'd read. Thrilled I'd gone ahead with this purchase as I'm definitely pleased and my hope is that others will give this product a try. So many great features at a very reasonable price.
5	1363996800	I bought one since I wasnt sure about the quality but was I surprised.  The case is very sturdy and it fits like a glove.  I looked at some of the other reviews and I still dont understand why some gave it some bad reviews.  I guess there are always people that complain about everything.  This is great quality and the price you just cant beat it.  Hey it comes with a free stylus so what else can you ask for.
3	1363910400	It works, but barely. The strap is for smaller hands or it needs to be bigger. The stand sucks. Small angle.
5	1363910400	It's all I expected and more, fits great and looks good. I am very happy with what I all I got.
5	1363824000	Its my favorite color and it has the sleep smart cover that i wanted. The price was right and it has a handle for reading so you don't drop it.
5	1363824000	So far so good. I use it every day and can't tell any wear and tear after 2 months. I wasn't sure about the hand strap at first, but now use it all the time.
5	1363737600	Beautiful deep pink color with a little bit of texture. The pen doesn't work so great with my ipad so i got one at walmart with a fatter head which works great.  This is a good buy !!!
4	1363737600	After a short breaking period the cover work well, butI had to replace the pen with one that works.
5	1363737600	Love it and you will too. I was not sure about this one but once I got it I was stoked.
5	1363651200	I order it last week and Everything came right on time...  cover look just like the picture.. pen works perfect...
4	1363651200	very durable, and easy to clean. was exactly what I order. Was hoping the stylus was a little smaller, but overall very satisfied.
5	1363651200	I looked at all the reviews before , so I was a tiny bit skeptical.  This product won me over! I have had none of the bad experiences that others had written about... The sleep and wake function work fine, there are no scuff marks on my device anywhere, and the cover fits my device perfectly.  I like the strap because I used to worry about dropping it while reading.  Awesome product!Sarah M.
5	1363651200	really happy with this product. not sure if it was going to be cheap because of the price but my 2 year old son plays with the mini and it holds up well for him with this case. the pen is great too actually. very nice, holds it snug, very happy with purchase.
5	1363564800	A steal for this case, at this price. Love it. Once it breaks in it stands up just fine, very durable.
5	1363564800	Love the color , bought in purple . very comfortable  For reading a book or magazine Would recommend . Pen works fine.
5	1363564800	I've had this case for a few months now and I love it!PROS:-Nice leather case, don't know if it's real or not but it feels great and doesn't look like it's cheap or fake!-Magnetic cover snaps that case and puts the iPad mini to sleep!-Stylus, it does the job... feels cheap like I'd break it though.  Could always buy another stylus and put it on the stylus holder though.-Fits the iPad mini pefectly and does not shift around inside.  Easy to put on and off.-Card holder slot is great for me to put my business cards in.CONS:-Just once complaint really and it's not a big one.  It's typicaly hard to balance the iPad to stand straight up or in landscape mode even with the front cover/kick stand portion of the case.  You can play around with it and eventually get it to stay up without falling but it's a bit difficult unlike other cases I've had where it's just place the front cover in the correct spot and the iPad will just stand up no problem.  Like I said, small complaint but still a complaint none the less.-Slightly thicker than those this plastic type cases since this is made of leather (I think!).  But not so thick that you would regret getting the case!Final verdict:If you want a good looking case for your iPad mini and good protection this is the one for you!  I have another iPad mini case that I first purchased that is thinner but I just keep using this one by i-BLASON because I love the way it makes my iPad mini looks and how it feels when using it!  Great product and a must buy!
4	1363478400	The cover is obviously not genuine leather, but it serves its function of protection. However, the stylus pen that comes with it is useless. It does not do anything on the screen, and if it does rarely, it is very dull. Good that I got a separate Stylus pen that works great.
5	1363478400	This is the perfect cover for my iPad mini. It is a great shade of pink, it has a stylus holder, and is well constructed.
4	1363478400	Have nothing negative to stay...great little cover for the mini.  Does everything I wanted, looking for another one for larger version.
5	1363478400	This is a great product.  Very comfortable to use.  Holds my ipad very securely.  Delivery was wonderful.  Very fast.  We are getting ready to order another.  Thank you for this product
5	1363392000	Not only do I like the color, but it's well-made and it has a holder on the back and also a stand for the days you want to watch something on Netflix.  Its prices is reasonable....
5	1363392000	Everything works as described. Fits very well, stands one position, good, sturdy n attractive. Will buy it again and recommend it. Delivered on time. Great product, great price.
5	1363392000	This is really a great case for the price. It stands up easy, it's durable, and it protects my iPad mini like its supposed. But, it's not too bulky - it looks professional and sleek. I haven't had any problems with it and if this one was to rip I would buy it again. I honestly don't use the pen much but it does work, too.
4	1363392000	This is a decent case. I spent several days looking an idea case for the iPad mini. This seemed to be the one that fit most of my needs. I wish they would have put the stylist/pen holder on the inside and maybe an holder for a notepad.Other than that this is fine case.Cheers,
5	1363392000	This is a nice case. Does not look cheap at all! The Velcro flap holds the iPad in securely. The strap on the back was a great idea. Love that I can put the stand in versatile directions and it stays put. The card holders were also a wonderful idea. The stylus and pen actually work. All in all it was worth every cent.
5	1363305600	I ordered the i-BLASON Apple iPad Mini case for my wife for her new iPad mini.  The overall quality of the product is fantastic!!  There are 2 different positions for displaying the iPad which makes a great all around product, whether you're at a desk and want it propped up to about an 80 degree angle so that you can use your bluetooth keyboard to type away, or if you're in the kitchen making that new recipe you just found and can put the case in a 40-45 degree angle so it's easy to see from your standing position.  The flap even has the magnets in it to put the iPad into sleep mode, just like the Apple iPad cases do.  When the case is fully flipped open, the handle makes it nice to have a firm grip on the iPad in the case without the worry of dropping it.Overall, this is a fantastic product, and for the price, I didn't have to think twice about purchasing this.  When I received the actual product and saw the quality, it made the purchase that more justifiable in my mind.
5	1363219200	Got a great bargain on this one! Looks good, fits well & has auto turn off & on feature. Covers & protect the iPad from every place. Its a Good buy...
4	1363132800	I just received mine today, earlier than expected. The case is great fits really well on the ipad mini but the color (I ordered the pink one) is not the same color as the one pictured it is darker in person.
5	1363132800	Highly recommend for the iPad mini user.  It fits very well and all the designed function just make sense for making iPad mini more enjoyable.
4	1363046400	This Smart Cover is just what I needed. I carry my mini around my classroom with ease. The stylus doe not work well so I substituted another.
5	1363046400	It was a super deal.  The case is beautiful and strong. I love it.  It was ship faster than I expected.  It was all a nice surprise.
1	1363046400	This case, although it looks sleek and can hold your business cards or IDs, has one very important flaw that you may want to consider if you own a white iPad mini. After having my iPad in its case for about 3 months now I finally took it out to clean it up. Shortly after taking out my iPad I noticed these black stains to the left and right of my home button. These stains are permanent, I've taken my iPad to apple professionals who say the only way to fix it is to replace the whole front glass. No thanks, anyways it has also stained the the back at the very top. Owners of the black iPad won't have this problem, or won't notice it. Not satisfied at all with this purchase, as now I'm having to spend $100+ for a new screen.
5	1362960000	It was every thing I thought it would be.  A little heavy but if I want it lighter I can remove it for awhile.
5	1362960000	I love it. My only problem is that my pen is dented. I find it kind of funny. It does stink but it is dyed leather. What do you expect?
4	1362960000	The product quality is great but when it comes to the installations it's trouble. Having had the experience with the ZAGG products, I'll recommend paying the extra money it's worth it.
5	1362960000	This is nice and easy. Works well - comfortable to hold through the leather strap. The pen is ok... Have to really press in it to acknowledge but overall really great.
4	1362873600	I got this case for my ipad mini, to replicate the features of a much more expensive case, which i gave to my wife when i got her a mini recently.  This case does most of the thing that case did(and some it didnt!), but for less than half the price.  This case is made of a sort of pleather type stuff, which feels good in the hand, has a flip cover, with the auto sleep features, a nice stylus loop, and easy access to all the buttons and ports on my mini.  The folding cover stand is the only weakness.  It fits into the notch on the back OK, but it's unstable trying to stand up, but I don't really ever use that so it's pretty much a non issue.  The hand loop is more useful to me, since I almost always just hold the thing, and the loop makes it a little easier to retain a grip on it one-handed.For what I paid for it, honestly I didn't even expect nearly this much, I feel like this case is a great deal.
4	1362873600	Works great with the mini IPad. The smart sleep cover is nice addition to save on the Battery. Would recommend to anyone.
5	1362873600	I am extremely pleased with this iPad Mini cover.  It's very protective of the iPad and the wake/sleep feature works exactly as advertised.  The included stylus is a nice feature as well, and I also like the way the cover can be folded to hold the iPad at a semi-upright position for easy viewing much like a laptop.  Highly recommended product, easy 5 stars.
5	1362873600	this is one useful product. wanted to give it 10 stars. this is a cover, credit card holder, stand and wake-up lock/unlocker. all in one. and with that price greatly satisfied. i am a first time user and cant compare it with anything else, i just bought it based on reviews posted and i am happy. the only other thing they can add to make it even more awesome is a keyboard ( a rubber foldable one )
5	1362873600	You really can't beat the price and color selection of this cover.  I just wish someone would make one that is more left-hander-friendly.  The holes exactly match up to my iPad Mini so there is no adjusting it when turning on and off, adjusting volume, or charging.
3	1362873600	It is good, it protects Both sides of the IPad, but the stand is not stable, it is a good case but I am sure that there better than this for the same price
5	1362787200	The color of this case is amazing. I ordered the purple one and it is the exact color on the picture that I received. Your Ipad is protected with this case and your Ipad stands properly without falling. The Auto Wake/Sleep function works amazing the plus side of this is that it saves battery. I am glad that I made this purchase and I highly recommend it for everyone!
5	1362787200	I love the color, the leather feel to it! It does indeed hold up your ipad mini, I feel that it's very safe and a great place to put your ipad in, also comes with the bonus stylus, still learning how to use that, well get nicer hand writing! I would def buy again and will be looking to buy something from them again!
5	1362700800	I've been looking for a cover and this is perfect for me. Thank you very much.  Great product to buy
3	1362614400	This was the first case i purchased. I wanted a business appropriate folio case with stylus holder and auto sleep wake and this fit the bill. Quality of the case is good for the money however I am returning for the following reasonsFirst and most important if you have a white LTE mini do not buy this case. The leather die will stain the white antenna strip which covers the lte antenna. I found after only a week of use I removed my mini and the antenna strip had dark marks on it where the case rests against it. Should be fine for black or wifi only versions.It is a pain to get it to stand up in landscape mode and when you finally get it to stand it is wobbly. It falls over very easily both forward and backward even after it breaks in.It also is fairly light but fairly this as well adds considerable thickness to the mini. It is almost twice as thick as the bear motion case I ordered to replace it.The stylus pen combination is good and a nice adder (doesn't compare to a Bamboo Duo if u take notes  but the Bamboo alone is twice as much as case stylus combo) the hand strap and business card holder are nice as well.Overall if you have a black or wifi only mini and don't mind fiddling with it to get it to stand for viewing it should suit your needs but the clincher for me was the marks it left.  A case is supposed to protect not the other way around.Contacted iBlason about the return and they were great however by the time I pay shipping to return I will only be getting back about $8 so thinking about just keeping it to have the spare pen and stylus.
4	1362528000	The case is exactly what I was looking for.  However, it has a strong &#34; chemically&#34; smell.  After a few weeks, the smell is not as strong but I'm hoping it will go away completely so I don't have to get a new case.
5	1362528000	It's good quality, and quite sturdy for a $20 case!  The stylus is also a pen, which is pretty cool.
5	1362441600	So i order this when i got my IPad Mini, and of course very hesitant about ordering it.. I got it and i was very surprised how good the case was, especially for the price... I would HIGHLY recommend this.. I honestly love it!
4	1362441600	Just like it, the color, the pen, the strap to hold the mini i pad.  I bought it to have an additional cover with a color that looks professional but cute.
4	1362355200	Convenient all around case with built in stylus holder. Smart cover and hand strap great features. Folding cover for stand up use is not real stable but overall a good value.
5	1362355200	This case is better than I expected my iPad mini looks classy in it. Good quality for the price :)
5	1362355200	Got this right in time and I love the color and its very sturdy to protect my mini. It looks classy and fits well in my bag or purse
4	1362355200	Woow! this is a nice device. I can't find anything wrong with this device. I like it a lot. Its strong and after 2 months of constant use it still looks like the day I bought it. I has the magnetic strip which allows the ipad mini to go into sleep mode once it is closed (you can hear the off click noise), and when you open the device it comes on immediately no need to unlock it.I mainly like it for the pen, which is an actual pen, however on the other end of the pen is kinda like a stylus. I like the pen because it makes the ipad mini look like a diary and NOT an ipad mini. This is the main reason I bought this case and it has not disappointed.I recommend this case.The faux leather finish is decent enough (not the best) and the case uses soft materials to ensure that the ipad mini does not receive any scratches, which was another reason I bought this case and not one of those with hard plastic, which I suspect may scratch the ipad.The only negative I saw was the fact that some (very little) sections of the screen are covered by the case and so are not easy to get to.All in all a decent case.
4	1362355200	I liked this product since i got it out of the box, the hand-strap on the inside cover works great, a great adittion for people working on the move.Everything has been built to fit the iPad mini with great precision. Like the camera outlets and the button and the cable accesses.The iPad fits great, it has the perfect room to be firmly in place. The autowake function works very well too!The things I didn't like are-It feels like cheap leather, although if it doesn't matter to you (and you're looking to protect your device, it gets the job done) you can ignore this issue.-You may want to replace the Pen/Stylus, since it feels like if you bought it in a $1 shop, it's made of plastic and you can feel as if you could break it easily.Summary, you get a nice case for a nice price.Definitively recommended!
4	1362182400	Thank you so much for the very nice cover for iPad mini it was exactly what I wanted. :-) I also like that it came with a stylus pen :-)
2	1362182400	The case covers the button to get you out of apps and the pen doesn't work.Other then that its just ok
5	1362182400	First of all, love the stitches, it PROTECTS the iPad completely which is the reason I bought it... Loved the price....1qtr of the price of what they sell at apple.. Don't buy their covers,
5	1362182400	What you see is what you get!!!Its very durable product and for a decent price.I suggest these products to anyone
5	1362182400	Nice,excellent, thanks beautiful,very kool liked nice good deal ,enjoyed ,wonderful love my cover and the color too,it comfortable nice to carring
5	1362096000	Makes me feel my iPad mini is safe if I drop it. Stands on its own to watch a video or tv show, turns on and off when you open or close. Even came with a pen/stylus and a holder on the side to store the stylus. Hand strap is comfortable, little slot can hold business card for identification. There are holes for the camera, power plug, ear buds. It looks elegant and like it's worth much more than the price. I love it.
5	1362096000	I love this case with my iPad mini. Love the feel. I would buy this one again. The pen/stylus holder is a plus
5	1362096000	this was very affordable and very expensive feeling & looking.  Highly recommended, works amazingly!  i recommend for anyone considering a cover for your ipad mini.
5	1362009600	Loved every singe thing about this case.  The stylus pen comes in very handy for both the ipad and for writing.
5	1362009600	I love the color...it fits my iPad mini perfectly..the pen doesn't work all the time but overall I like the cover.
5	1362009600	This was a great buy for me. It is durable and a perfect fit for my ipad mini. I am very happy with this case
5	1361923200	This is a very sophisticated looking cover.  It holds the mini iPad in place and provides great coverage and protection.  It's very light weight.would definitely buy this brand again.  Great price, exceptional quality, and great looking!
5	1361923200	This is the perfect. It has a handy strap so you can hold the pIPad while reading. I love it!
5	1361923200	The stylus doesn't work well. It's either the invellop anti-glare screen protector or the stylus. Either way the wife loves it.invellop screen protector:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQR24E/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2
5	1361923200	This cover is the perfect size for your iPad mini!  There are 2 credit card slots on one side and I put notes on index cards in them for things I'm researching on my iPad.  There is also a nifty elastic strap to put your hand through and hold your iPad.  This feature is great when you are reading in iBooks.  The color is also wonderful.  I love purple and this is a great shade!  Do not be afraid to buy this cover or your iPad mini!  When I first opened the package, there was the smell o the color dye, but it was gone after a few days and there is no longer any smell.
5	1361923200	The item came just as seen on the screen. I love my case. It fits perfectly on my ipad mini. I was in perfect condition.
5	1361923200	Love the cover.  It makes handling the slippery little iPad easy, especially love the strap hanldle.Glad I bought it
4	1361836800	I carry my ipad mini from home to work and back and listen to music in my car and the sleep smart cover is perfect for my needs
5	1361836800	La entrega y la calidad del producto excelente , facil de colocarlo, el color es hermoso y se ajusta perfectamente al ipad
4	1361836800	Bought this for my Dad's iPad mini which we gave him for his 82nd birthday!  I installed it and felt it was a very reasonably priced item that will protect my Dad's precious tech gadget!  It is made pretty well for the money and does the job it is intended to do.
4	1361836800	The leather cover looks great and works nicely, really no need for the pen. Will either lose or completely forget that there is a pen
3	1361750400	I don't know why they give the pen anyway it is not working on my ipad or did I miss something??? Case is nice but cannot stand very well..
4	1361750400	I like this product.  I like that it shuts off and on when you open it.  I also like the fact that it seems to protect my ipad mini and the price is very reasonable.  I would recommend this ipad cover.
5	1361750400	Saves my battery life tremendously & fits perfectly well for my iPad mini. I've had it for a few months & find it to be a great product. I definitely recommend!
4	1361750400	The cover works just as described.  The only thing that may not work as well as I would like is the stand part.  The ipad does not stand as straight as it does in the pictures.  It has more of an angle, but it does work.  I have had mine a few months and my mini ipad gets used everyday by the kids and it is still just like new!!  Auto wake up is still working too.  Would recommend to someone else.
4	1361750400	I love my new cover. It looks expensive and the quality of the leather is great, scratch resistant. The case is light weight and the contrast stitching gives it character. Great service, price and product.
1	1361750400	I was supposed to receive it 10 days ago! I tried to see the tracking information and it says it is unavailable.I hope someone from this company reads this and get back to me.
5	1361664000	I read other reviews and was not disappointed. The fit is snug. I like the various viewing angles and find the pen stylus to be a real bonus! Very affordable and vey good quality.
5	1361664000	Received equal as shown in images. Great quality. So far the best investment to protect an ipad mini. I recommended.
4	1361664000	Good case strong leather. I thought it had more standing position options but good anyways. The stylus is great also.
5	1361664000	I am very pleased with this product.  I bought it for my husband who has a medium size hand.  Mine are small.  It fits either of us without any slipping.  Really nice when you are reading and fall asleep.  It is well built and surprisingly light, so it doesn't add a lot of weight.  The stylus holder is  handy.  So nice for people with big fingers.  Wish more manufacturers would include them in their designs.
2	1361664000	Case fit great However the exposed corners leave the iPad mini vulnerable for chips and damaging from accidental drops. My magnets never worked so am very disappointed that the sleep and wake option is defective. It over worked when taking iPad mini out of case.
3	1361664000	The case does not fit the IPad mini! I advise you buy another case! On a better note, the sleep and wake function works!!!!
4	1361577600	I bought this for my wife when I surprised her with a new iPad mini. She loves it, not as much as the iPad but its very good for her. The thing goes right to sleep and wakes up when you open / close the cover Getting it to stand up will take time to break in because it doesn't actually stand up at first, it kind of leans, and leans some more till it tips over.The one thing that I don't like is that its says &#34;stylus&#34; when really its not. If it says stylus, it should be a genuine stylus. What it is, is a pen, with the soft end that can be used on the iPad screen. Once the ink runs out, then its just a broken pen with a soft end. Not a stylus.Overall, a good buy, and it fits perfectly. I would recommend.
3	1361577600	This cover is exactly as described and I will use it when I travel to keep my ipad safe but for daily use, I find it kind of bulky.  Not anything wrong with the cover, just my personal preference
4	1361577600	This case is the cutest, most convenient, lightest case for the iPad Mini. I love it! Only set-back is I wish it could be propped a bit higher.
5	1361491200	the cover protects as expected.the hand-hold is a great feature.I find myself using this cover more than a similar cover with an attached keyboard.I can walk around (eg. shopping) with the ipad mini on, taking notes and am confident that I won't drop the mini.stylus/pen is a nice bonus.
5	1361491200	This is as perfect as one can get for a mini smart cover.  Well constructed, all the cut-outs are in the right place, the wake and sleep function works perfectly, the synthetic leather material did not give out any bad sent.  Have not taken this cover off since it arrived several months ago.  The cover finish has a nice pebble texture and the card holders, if they are needed come in handy.The cover feels good to touch.  I highly recommend this cover for ultimate mini protection and functionalism.  It doesn't get any better than this.
5	1361491200	I love this cover. It is just what I was looking for. I love it.  It is just what I expected.Thanks
5	1361404800	Gave this to my Mother for Xmas and she loves the pen that comes with it. The handle is helpful on the case for her as well. I recommend it for everyone.
5	1361404800	I loved price, fast delivery and product. The Bonus stylus , Multi-angle features are nice. It's very lite weight also. Comparing $40 to $60 dollars this is a win for sureThe sleep wake feature is awesome
5	1361404800	This case should be a requirement for the iPad mini. It is well made and the delivery was faster than promised. I shopped locally in the Bryn Mawr, PA area and could not find any cases as nice.Ashley
5	1361318400	Great product yeah it smelled a little bit when I first got it but after about a day it was no longer there. Love the case I use it every day and has held up great.
5	1361318400	This case fits the iPad mini perfectly. Looks very nice and professional. I would buy this product again if I needed too.
4	1361318400	This is a good first cover or temporary item. There are a lot of items out there now. This one is nice in that it has the credit card holder installed which allows you to put iTunes Gift Cards in there as a gift!!
5	1361318400	This case fits the iPad mini perfectly. Looks very nice and professional. I would buy this product again if I needed too.
5	1361318400	Got this for my daughter's ipad mini. Well made and will definitely protect the product. Not too bulky yet very protective - would recommend this product. Nice color selection also.
4	1361318400	I got this for my daughter, she really likes it. Not the best quality but it does the job well. I'd buy it again
5	1361232000	Yes, this wasn't for me, but hey, I've used it too, and it looks nice, feels nice, protects the I-pad, and I don't know what else to say about it.  I think it's actually made of leather, but I can't swear to it.  Feels like leather.
4	1361232000	This product is really simple and durable.  I use the stylus pen for writing, I have yet to use it as a stylus.
4	1361232000	This is the second cover I tried for my iPad Mini, and I haven't been tempted to try any others.  I love the slots for business cards, and the elastic strap to slip my hand through.  The pen/stylus loop is handy, although when my stylus is in it, it's hard to access the volume buttons.  There is one slot to put the cover in to make it stand up, so there is only one viewing angle, but I don't mind using pillows or books to adjust it.  The cover is a textured fake leather material with white topstitching around the edges.  It's got a bit of a bomber jacket look to it.  The magnets turn my iPad on and off sometimes.  The cover occasionally needs a nudge up or down to get the magnet to line up correctly and work, but overall, I love it.
5	1361232000	Was unsure about ordering at first but took the jump and glad I did.  It was cheaper than some of the ones in the store and I got a color that I wanted.  It also puts it to sleep and works great!
5	1361145600	Great product. Would definitely recommend to anyone to protect the apple iPad mini , feel that my iPad is safe from scratches  with the iblason product.
5	1361145600	This was a great investment for my mini.  I love the color and it case is very durable.  I also love the fact that it's  a sleep cover...def. meets my expectations!
5	1361145600	Love this product. It is nice quality leather and its pink. I would buy it again. Came quickly and fits the ipad mini nicely.
5	1361059200	I am so glad I ordered ordered this. This is nicer and works better than The one My friend paid 4X more for.A must buy if You have a I-Pad mini
2	1361059200	I don't like the stand....doesn't really work ..device just topples over. Also very awed to hold with one hand without flap opening. Not happy with it at all. The color is all I like about it and he fact the I get coverage like a book case for front and back.
5	1360972800	Love the color and the dual purpose of the pen/stylus. The odor I read in the reviews only last a day or two.
5	1360972800	My wife was considering to purchase the black cover because the photos of this one shown in purple were a little too bright. When delivered the purple was a perfect color which also matched the cover on her iPhone.
5	1360972800	Sturdy and beautiful! Great price! It fit so well and protect the edge and front and back!  I got a different one from my daughter but  this one is much better!
4	1360972800	Received product on time, thank you!  Product is good (love the purple color) and serves its purpose if your intent is to carry your iPad Mini with you at all times. Fits perfectly into a medium size purse along with your "usual" purse items that you would normally lug around. Cover is not bulky, nor heavy.Other enjoyable features, such as; 1) the auto wake/sleep function, 2) the stylus holder, 3) the lining cover surrounding the iPad to secure it in its place along with velcro closure, 4) the credit card holder (I actually use it to hold business cards instead), 5) elastic hand strap and 6) with the cover on still able to charge and use iPad's side buttons & headphone plug are wonderful features!However, a couple of downfalls (or my rating would have been a 5 star); 1) stand is not the world's greatest to stream movies (use a metal business card holder, works perfectly), 2) the stylus that came with the cover is horrible compared to an inexpensive bundle packet stylus that I thankfully also ordered, 3) while mobile using the elastic hand strap the cover tends to slip downward and wants to flap closed (to fix this issue is to use a large rubber band to hold open and not move) and lastly 4) cover has a faint smelly odor (rub fabric softener sheet on cover to mask and absorb the odor does help). All in all, glad I purchased this cover at the cost effective price (again, love the purple color). Hope my quick inexpensive fixes help if you decide to purchase.  =)
3	1360972800	Have trouble making it stand but otherwise good buy for the price. half the price of others i looked at
5	1360886400	I looked at probably a hundred different cases and this was literally the only case I could find that looked like it would provide protection as well as be comfortable to use. I love it. I think it gets the job done very well. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
5	1360886400	I love that it turns the screen off when you close it and I like that it props it up at the perfect angle
5	1360886400	Considering the price, this is an excellent buy.  My only issue is the balancing act to stand it up.  But manageable.
5	1360886400	Considering the price, I didn't expect it to be that good, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.It fits well (1st gen iPad mini), and it came with a pen/stylus, which I didn't realize, so that was cool.  The stitching around the leather looks like it will hold up well for a long time.  The card pocket and hand strap are nice feature.  The smart cover works as expected too, so no disappointments there.No bothersome obstructions with the either the front or back cameras, and no problems with charging the device while in the case.I'm glad I decided to shop here first, before jumping on the Apple cover that you see near the displays at the store.  I think this is way better than Apple's iPad mini cover.The seller shipped very quickly too, so another bonus!
5	1360800000	I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and practicality of this case. I use my iPad mini for both personal and work. This will be great for meetings!
5	1360713600	This is an exceptional case for the iPad mini, and it is also a GREAT buy!I couldn't be more pleased, especially since the Bear Motion case that I bought previously was of such poor quality.I would definitely advise to stay away from the Bear Motion case because it is totally inferior for a few dollars less. But as they say, you get what you pay for.I even bought a second iBlason case for my wife because she was so impressed with mine.BUY IT!
5	1360713600	It was all that i expected and more. I would definetly recommend this product. You will gett your money's worth.
5	1360713600	Better than what I expected. I am looking to purchase additional colors because I was very satisfied with the product.
4	1360713600	A friend had one and I liked there's.So far has protected iPad well.Like the sleep feature of coverSorry review page not working
5	1360713600	Simple, elegant, nice color, easy access to all the buttons.  Strap for hand is handy.  Highly recommended.  Price was right.  Excellent purchase.
5	1360713600	Obviously, at this price point, it's not a top of the line case made of real leather.But it's well made, holds the iPad securely and protects it well.  My husband and I like the little hand strap, which makes it easier to hold like a book.  The pen and stylus are cheap, but they both do the job and the pen is easy enough to swap out.  The card holder is a bit silly, but we put my husband's business card into it, just in case it's ever misplaced and discovered by an honest person.The easel function works as designed too.
5	1360713600	Love this mini i-pad cover with the sleep/awake feature! (:I definitely recommend this cover for anyone looking for one!
4	1360713600	Its good. Good I brought it...its protecting the IPad, it slipped couple of time, thank god I have the cover on it !!!!
3	1360713600	My honest opinionPro:1. Build quality and the material used are good.cant complain on that2. Card slots, they are useful for your business card. You may put it a few for emergency case.3. White stitches with black PU leather provides a more "business" look4. You can be sure that your ipad will be safe inside even with a few of drop5. A bonus stylus pen6. Auto wake function working as it shouldCons:1. I am not sure if it applies to all, but the onenI received doesn't quite snugly fit in the compartment.2: it's difficult now to access the volume control button3.the handle? Shouldn't  it be outside" unless you want to hold it flapping against the top cover4. The stand, only 1 position possible. You cannot tilt it to any other angle5. my feather weight ipad now becomes "bantam" weight
4	1360627200	Great case.  Nice stylus/pen addition and I loved the strap!!  I eventually gave the case to my Girlfriend to use for her ipad mini since I upgraded to the larger iPad w/retina display.  But The cover is a great product.
5	1360627200	i love it  the pen works , the card holder was a great idea. the person that made this cover had the people in mind.
5	1360540800	Just what I wanted beautiful easy to use.  I get lots of complements and asked where I got it. Thanks
4	1360540800	I'm giving this 4 stars as opposed to 5, only because when I feel the upright position could be much sturdier. However, great quality, and I have definitely recommended to friends for their IPAD MINIS also, its the purrrrfect fit & finishing touch.
3	1360540800	I like this cover alot and could be perfect for the business person. Since my 3 year old daughter is the one using my ipad the most, it's not designed for children.  I will look into another one designed for children.  Maybe I'll find one designed for both the child and adult users.
5	1360540800	I absolutely love this cover. It is fashionable and functional. Have gotten many compliments on it. I use the handle when I am reading on my kindle. It keeps you from dropping the iPad mini. The stylus is definitely a plus  when I am using my square card reader. I finally got it to sit up but I really don't use my iPad that way.  Anyway it's a fabulous cover!
3	1360454400	I do not like the way the cover has to stand up. It has a flap that you have to slide the front under. And unless you are on a hard flat surface it doesn't stand up very well. Also, in the picture it looks as if the strap and credit card holder is on the outside, but actually it is on the inside, which is good for concealing the credit cards but I was hoping for a strap on the outside to help me carry it since I am disabled and have to use a walker. If it didn't have the auto wake feature, I  would send it back.
4	1360454400	Beautiful color. Very flexible. Made of strong competent material.Lite weight. Easy to carry. Stylus a big plus.. I am enjoying it very much.
5	1360454400	REALLY LIKED THE COVER, IT FITS SNUGLY AND WORKS LIKE I WANTED IT TOO.  THE STYLUS WAS AN ADDED BONUS I DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS INCLUDED AND IS ACTUALLY A WORKING PEN ALSO...
5	1360368000	I've had this for 3 months now and it's very nice! Perfect fit for our mini iPad. The sleep and wake feature works perfectly most of the time. If it doesn't wake it up, I just move the cover just a tad bit and it wakes it up. I would recommend this case.
5	1360368000	Cover is elegant and conveniently has a couple of business card pouches. I use mine for meetings and am able to feel comfortable in that it looks professional (vice the colored ones). It does have a subtle white stiching around the edges but does not detract from the overall appearance. It is sturdy and well-made.
5	1360368000	I can't think of anything that would make this design better.  Every port and button on the sides of your iPad are still accessible, so you never need to take the pad in and out (though that isn't very difficult if you want to anway.) Open the cover, iPad turns on - close the cover, iPad goes to sleep.  Easily hand held in vertical format, easy to stand on desk in a horizontal format.  Elastic strap helps prevent dropping if you are holding it open.I don't find the iPad stylus that comes with it to work very well - but when I tried a stylus that cost $19.00 it didn't work very well either.  Just use your finger.Highly recommended.
5	1360368000	Bought this case for my iPad mini & absolutely love it. The iPad fits securely in the case & the quality seems top notch. The slots for the stylus & business cards are really convenient additions.
4	1360368000	Bought for an iPad Mini I purchased for my parents.  They use it for Skype, games, and reading news.  This case is useful as a way to protect your iPad, and also easily configures the iPad to use at the table for Skype.  Couldn't ask for much more, and the price was quite good.
5	1360281600	The quality of materials and workmanship are excellent. The case fits the mini perfectly and all the ports and switches on the tablet are operable with the case on. It came with a stylus/pen which is a plus. The color on the "margentta" version is a bit darker than depicted here. The whole item was about the color of the strap in the picture.
4	1360281600	not expensive, yet a feel of leather, though still questioning if it is letherette, but practical, and protective, nothing spectacular, but one cannot expect miracles from only a cover, especially when it is inexpensive. I believe it is worth money spent.
4	1360281600	Great product for the price.  I bought the purple one for me and the black for my husband.  We are both very happy with them.
4	1360281600	This is an OK product  for the price. The description is accurate and  seems to be a quality item. When using it as a stand however it is  not very stable. It tends to want to fall forward. The stylus only works if you apply a significant amount of pressure on the screen. This is more a function of the iPad however and not the stylus. I would recommend this product if you are looking for just a basic case for your iPad nothing fancy
5	1360195200	Durable and cute!! And it comes with the pen! I love that it has a pocket for the I'd and credit card. I would love it more if it had a pocket for papers but I love it anyway.
5	1360108800	I love it. It's very safe, very nice looking, and the pen gets useful too. I have ordered three different cases for my ipad and this one is the best. I highly recommend it, it's very good quality
4	1360108800	I like this product a great deal. The case itself is very protective and still allows for access to all of the usable functions including charging and syncing. The only problem is that it seems the iPad gets better internet reception when out of the case. I also like the stylus which is included with the product
5	1360108800	.Protects my tablet and looks really nice.Good quality and it is better that what is advertised.The wake/sleep function is cool.Fits like a glove, has a place for credit cards and comes with a pen.Happy with this purchase.
5	1360108800	Wonderful very nice fits well and looks even better. Price is a fifth of apples. Good dealer fast delivery. And wonderful price. Just what I needed
5	1360108800	After I gave my wife an iPad Mini for Christmas, she went on Amazon to look at covers and selected this one. We love the fact that it comes with a stylus/pen. The cover fits perfectly, and the smart cover function works just fine.
4	1360108800	Well designed, decent price, excellent service by seller. The only reason for 4 stars is that haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up in the long run.
5	1360022400	very cool case, my wife loved it. very soft material, not sure if its real leather or not, but it certainly feels like it.
5	1360022400	I very much like the i-BLASON Apple iPAD Mini cover..especially the sleep/wake feature:) Nothing &#34;Fancy Dancy&#34;  .That's not what I wanted anyway, But it does the job I wanted it to do..keep my iPad safe and make it easy to &#34;Take and Go!&#34;
5	1360022400	When I received my iPad mini cover it did smell pretty bad as other reviewers have said.  So I put it out in the garage for the weekend.  After that is was OK and I have loved it sense.  Best thing I did was getting this little jewel.  You will not go wrong. It is made very well and I love the hand grip.  Don't care to much for the pen/stylus holder it gets in my way. So I do not keep the pen or stylus attached.  The Stylus that comes with the cover works better than the i-Blason Capacitive Stylus and Pen I bought extra.  So stay with the stylus that comes with it.
4	1360022400	I got this for my sister and she seems really satisfied with the case. It also came with a really cute stylus pen.
4	1359936000	The only think I can't understand is why the strap is on the INSIDE of the case! Why is that?
5	1359936000	Perfect fit, handle works great, black leather with white stitching looks fab with my white I pad, stand works every time, and the pen/stylus with strap is the best--I got this all for the same price that my hubby paid for just his stylus!
2	1359936000	does not protect edged, One simple fumble and you will ding you i pad. Office ok cool holder nice leather too, look and feels real good
4	1359936000	great product - light, sturdy, quality leather, color exactly as shown (I have picked it to make sure I don't loose my mini around the house);convenient  business/ credit card pocket; even handle is useful some time.Incorporated magnet which turns iPad on/off is very convenient.Full size pocket to store random receipts / papers would make this product 5 star, in my opinion.
4	1359936000	Ohhhh she loves it but sometimes it's hard for her to see the edges of some of herStory's that she reads
5	1359936000	I got this as a present for my mom when she got a new ipad mini.  She loves the handle on it for reading.  also she would forget to turn the screen off when she puts it down, but with the smart cover the screen turns off for her to save battery!! She wanted the purple one so thats what i got her. the stylus is a little weak, but she doesn't use it much.  If you want a good stylus look elsewhere!
5	1359936000	This is one of the best products for the price I paid. It has many features that other costly products does not offer. I suggest this product to everybody who beleives in the slogan cheap and best.
5	1359849600	it is soft, pretty and functional. It protects my IPad Mini and does not hide and buttons. I love it!
5	1359849600	very nice and sturdy. I would recomend this product to everyone who has a ipad. It feels very secure in the smart cover.
4	1359849600	I am very pleased with my cover. The color is wonderful. My reason for not giving it five stars, is the reading position is not comfortable.
4	1359763200	Listen up y'all. This case is exactly what I wanted in an iPad mini case - It fits great, It makes holding the iPad mini easier, and it protects the iPad mini. The pen was going to be an added bonus but it doesn't work as well as another stylus I have.
5	1359763200	Just excellent for my iPad mini. Fits perfect and looks great...I would certainly recommend this product for all iPad mini users.Regarding the shipping, it is just awesome. Reached on time and overall I would rate this A+++
4	1359763200	The case works great & I love the color! Plus it comes with a stylus pen which is nice. The only thing that doesn't make sense is the handle is on the inside, so it would have to be open to use it.
3	1359763200	I really like this iPad mini cover except its not cut perfectly. It isn't straight it covers some of my screen on the left hand side. I am constantly pulling on it to be able to see and use my screen. If it wasn't or that I would have given five stars it would be great if it fit properly.
5	1359763200	Case/cover is well made and fits mini very well.The elastic hand hold works well.Overall, a very good product.
5	1359763200	This cover is very well made! Love that it holds a few cards ( I keep my library card in it for online lending library) cover is very durable and the purple is nice and bright
5	1359676800	This cover is awesome I love it.My mini fits just right very snug, I am very satisfy with it.
5	1359676800	Just like the one at Bestbuy  but half the price.  My son had to buy it with his money so it really helped.  It is perfect!
4	1359504000	The color is as shown in the picture (purple). There is a slightly weird chemical smell, but not overpowering. The product itself fits my ipad mini securely and leaves appropriate space for camera, volume, power, home buttons. Free stylus does the job as well.
4	1359504000	This works for me, without the name brand advertising. It has a nice feature of the hand strap to secure the mini to the hand and a plus with the free stylus.
5	1359504000	Would recommendApart from being sleek its also sturdy enough for impact falls.Im surprized how nice it feels...not bulky at all.
5	1359504000	I love the fact it wakes up by itself, something I can never do, and it goes to sleep by itself, something I'm very good at and glad it is too.Love the color, the feel and the strap makes it easy to hold.  It's just a great compliment to my mini iPad.
5	1359504000	I choose the 5 star because I am very please with the color the leather and the way it is made and sure that it will protect my ipad mini very well, and I love the price
5	1359504000	The cover is sturdy and a great color (pink).  It fits the ipad nicely.  I understand what other reviewers said about the ipad shifting and not being able to tap a button if it's in the top left corner, but it really is not a big deal.  You just push the ipad over a little bit if need be.  I feel like the ipad is secure and protected.  The handle is nice when I'm holding it for extended periods.  I like the way the cover folds over and slips into the little pocket to make it stand up.  I did not think I would use the pen, but I have used it - like if my hands are damp while I'm cooking or when my kids use it b/c I don't want their greasy fingerprints on the ipad.  I don't think I will use the credit card holder unless I put an identification card in it.  The sleep/wake feature is nice and stays closed even when I have it in my purse.
5	1359504000	Great product. Lightweight and love the hand strap. Not sure  why there are credit card slots, but I don't care.
5	1359417600	I am a sculpture glass artist and do art and bead shows across the nation.  I bought the Apple Ipad Mini to use with the Square to accept credit card purchases.  I spent time in the store looking at covers then went on line to look at prices.  I bought the i-Blason in my favorite color [purple] because the description and the reviews offered everything I was looking for in a cover.  When it arrived I was impressed with the over all feel and quality of the cover.  I love how easily the Ipad slides into it then I tried out the different features of my Ipad and the cover allows access to everything on the Ipad like the camera and the various buttons.  The great feature is the strap since it allows me to hold it while customers sign their purchases with the stylus and a place to put their credit card.  Great price, fantastic quality and the best features.  thank you I-Blason
3	1359417600	Just received this case for my iPad mini. It's a perfect fit and I'm happy with the quality ( especially for the price since it's about half the price of similar cases sold locally) but I'm afraid I may be returning the case because it SMELLS bad! I assume its the dye. Maybe it will subside in a day or two.After only a day or two out of the package and the dye smell is gone; as I thought it would. Now I'm totally satisfied. Love the purple color (I usually am drawn to red.)  Love that my IPad fits so perfectly. The stylus loop is an extra bonus.
4	1359331200	This was very good value for the money.Magnetic closure is firm and stays shut,the hand strap is very useful.I chose the pink colour because,well I am over 70 and I can!!!!!!!!! Item was delivered on time and I would recommend this cover to everyone.
4	1359331200	I really never use the pen holder but it is a good protector of the ipad mini and when I open it...the ipad come on.  So it works as advertised.
5	1359331200	Excellent very nice, the color is perfect,Excellent very nice, the color is perfect,Excellent very nice, the color is perfect,
5	1359244800	The cover has so many ways to use it and so easy to hold. I have neuropathy in my hands and by sticking your hand through the back loop makes it so easy to hold. Love It.
5	1359244800	This product is a great purchase! It comes with a free stylus wich is reall awesome because it is a pen too.The case is very sturdy, it has a card holder, and it can stand by itself. I also love the fact that it has a Smart Cover to put the iPad mini to sleep. I would defenatly recommend this to other customers!
1	1359244800	The color is pretty but the stand is clumsy and the texture of the skin is cheap and stinky.  Look elsewhere
5	1359244800	Loved this case great color and price.  My friend paid double the price for hers but I like mine. Great deal.
5	1359244800	Well worth the money! exactly as described and arrived when promised. Would recommend this to anyone looking for the mini iPad case!
5	1359244800	Very pleased with my cover for my iPad Mini!  I can't believe others pay twice this much for about the only thing.  The only thing I'd change is the part where you fold it to have the iPad upright does stay firm.  I don't use that feature much, anyhow, but they do need to correct that.
5	1359244800	This cover is great! It does exactly what a cover is supposed to do...not sure what else to say but that. Um...the wife loves the pink color.
5	1359158400	I received this with in days of ordering. I was expecting much for the price but I was pleasantly surprised. Very durable and comes with some nice extras. Lots of pockets to hold cards, ect. A stylus that is also a pen and when you open close the case, the iPad wakes up and goes to sleep.
5	1359158400	I was searching everywhere for a basic case for my new iPad mini, and most I found ere selling for over $29 for just a plain cover! Then I found this case and the reviewers video sold me on this case - it's exactly what I was looking for and under $20! So easy to use, my mini slid in easily and the Velcro strap keeps it safe and snug. The overall look of the case is very professional and I am asked what is that? and I show them it's my ipad mini in an awesome case! The stylus pen is an added bonus! I love this case!!!
4	1359158400	Purchased this cover for a mini iPad. It turns off the iPad when cover is shut, very convenient .Color is same as picture, great value for a good product.
5	1359158400	This cover is perfect!  I love the handle and the slots for cards.  The attached pen is handy as well.  I would buy this product again.
5	1359072000	OMG! This case is the best; all leather (hi quality too) very nice suede lining; nice stylis on the tip of a pen plus a place to put the pin;; turn mini pad on when open and off when closed; and a place to put cards on the inside of the case if you don't need the key board case this case would be an excellent chose.
5	1359072000	my daughter is in love with her case, the color, the fit and convience of the handle on the inside
5	1359072000	Works well with the iPad mini.  Quick shipping and secure hold for the iPad.  The pen/ stylus is ancillary but a nice touch.
5	1358985600	Received the iPad mini for Christmas and my dear hubby got the smart cover to go along with it. I can't say that I was very happy with not having more protection for the back and sides so started looking at other cases. Got a Roo case from a local store but the loop for the stylus/pen was in the middle of the back!! Why?? Also, velcro that holds the flap to secure our iPad in place made a bulge on the back side (it wasn't recessed in, just added on top of the case). SO ordered this one as a last ditch attempt at finding a perfect fit and I did!!! Not a lot of bulk around the edges so it keeps the &#34;footprint&#34; of the iPad to about the same size as &#34;naked&#34;. The hand strap is nice for laying in bed and not having it fall on your face (I speak from experience unfortunately, lol) and I keep a small cleaning cloth in the credit card slot to clean up smudges. The stylus/pen that comes with it is nice but ordered a purple one here so it matches. All extras like the strap and the velcro are recessed so no added bulk there, either. Yes, the smell is STRONG when you first receive it but after about a week, there was no smell at all so just air it out for a bit. Definitely my favorite of the three!!
4	1358985600	Arrived as stated. A little bulkier than I thought it would be. The stand took awhile to break in but now is ok.
5	1358985600	Excellant product.  Works wonderfully and love the fact that there is a strap to put my and through while I read. Less chance of me dropping it.
5	1358985600	Good product, fits beautifuly in my new mini iPad. Light. Sturdy. Holes in the right place. The penn could be btter.
5	1358985600	Works great easy to install looks good use son all my devices happy user of there products would buy again
4	1358899200	Not sure why this case has so many negative reviews.  I bought the black cover the day after I got my iPad Mini after researching a couple of other ones here on Amazon (i-UniK Premium 2PC with Stand Leather Protection Caseand theIonic Rotating Stand Leather Case) which both had fewer and more tepid reviews.  I think this i-BLASON case is great!  The case sits upright in the stand and proved itself when I used it to look up and follow a recipe for dinner the other night.  I did have a slight problem in x-ing out of some screens where the tiny little X was right in the upper left corner, but that has not been a regular enough occurrence to even be a problem.  The slot for the cards seems odd as I would never be out without my wallet, but maybe it's for business cards or something other than credit cards.  Mine DID NOT smell at all as others have complained.  I've loved getting going with my iPad with this great case with its magnetic on/off function.
5	1358899200	Exactly what I ordered! Love the color and the case is very durable ! It actually was a present and once they opened it, they fell in love! fits the iPad mini perfect. Thanks a lot Amazon.
5	1358899200	I am so pleased with this case. I was not expecting it to be so nice at such a low price. Even my son was impressed and believe me, it takes a lot to impress him!
1	1358899200	Terrible product, did not work as stated. It was suppose to put the Ipad to sleep & wake it up and it did not do it no matter how I tried to make it work, I had to keep turning my Ipad off manually to keep from running my battery down. Not recommended it you want it to wake and sleep your product.
5	1358899200	Super fast shipment - perfect case for my ipad mini.  I won't really use the charge card slots for &#34;charge cards&#34;, but I folded up a little ipad cheat sheet and stuck in one...may use it, may not, but it's handy (I'm new to the &#34;i&#34; craze).  Great quality case - perfect as described.  Only wish there were some funky designs.  Don't hesitate.
5	1358899200	Exactly as described, fast shipping, and great response and communication! Would do business again and look forward to it! Thanks for a great experience.
5	1358899200	I am a first time Amazon customer and was very apprehensive about what would happen. I was pleasantly surprised. The price was good and the product was great! I am the envy of shoppers who are distrustful of online shopping. Ha!
5	1358812800	My wife and I purchased an iPad Mini for my mother for Christmas but didn't get her any accessories because we thought she would like to choose her own, particularly a case/cover. When we saw her this past week, we noticed she still did not purchase a case for her iPad Mini and when asked why, she said all the ones she saw were too expensive and/or looked cheap (she went to her local Walmart). My dad later then pulled me aside and asked if I could get her one, so I immediately jumped to Amazon.My wife owns the newest iPad, my father owns the iPad 2, and my work loans out an iPad 2 as well. The common theme among all these is that of all the cases on each of them, they are all $55+ and in my opinion, all of them suck (with the exception of my father-in-law's, which we got him for ChristmasNew Trent Arcadia NT38B/IMP38B Airbender ClamShell Keyboard Case for the iPad (4th Gen) with Retina display, NEW iPad (3rd Gen), iPad 2, Bluetooth keyboard /w matte finish compatible with the iPad (4th Gen) with Retina display, NEW iPad (3rd Gen), iPad ...).So that's when I found this one. At first I was skeptical. I mean for $17.95 (as of 1/19/2013), you can't imagine that the case would be any good. Even with the smaller size of the iPad Mini, you would imagine anything cheaper than $30 is crap. But not this one. The case itself fits the iPad Mini snugly and what surprised me is the autowake/sleep function ACTUALLY WORKS! Of all the cases I've mentioned in my previous paragraph, none of them were autowake/sleep compatible.The other feature I really like is the elastic hand strap. This works exceptionally well because it allows you to hold the iPad without gripping it. Plus since the iPad Mini is light, you don't get tired holding it up (this works exceptionally well if you have to hold it, like if you wanted to read an eBook). The stylus is a feature my mom really likes (she mainly plays games on her iPad) and for the constant poking at the screen, she's able to enjoy it and not get the screen greasy. The stand is actually sturdy and holds the iPad up well (but given the size of the iPad Mini, me and my mother prefer to use the hand grip to hold it close).The only feature I would probably deem as unnecessary is the ID/card holder pocket. I mean I guess someone would use it, but I personally wouldn't put any of my IDs or credit cards there. That's what my wallet is for... but alas, this is my mother's case and not mine.If I were to purchase an iPad Mini, I would definitely get this case first. It's affordable, really well made, and has great features.
5	1358812800	This case is not fancy but very functional.  It cost half of what other similar cases cost in the stores.  It holds the Ipad mini snugly and all the wholes line up perfectly.  The bonus stylus is a nice addition.
5	1358812800	I like this. Very convenient and I like it better than the Apple covers which don't protect the iPad all around from scratches, etc.
5	1358812800	I love the fact that it puts the ipad to sleep whenever the cover closes! The purple is the  perfect color
5	1358726400	Great little Smart Cover.  Read my IPad in this every day. Protects the IPad very well and it also powers it down when closed.
5	1358726400	I like the product.  Absolutely no complaints.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Nothing else needs to be said!
5	1358726400	I'm very pleased with this product. It holds and protects my mini iPad. It is a very quality product and an excellent deal for the price. Very well made.
5	1358726400	Like the handle, and the cover.  It is very functional and lightweight.  The leather smell took a little time to go away though...
3	1358726400	Have to say. Feels vaguely cheap. The stylus/pen.... It really is a pen. But the stylus... No. It doesn't even work!
5	1358640000	This cover is great, fits well, looks and feels like leather, color is as pictured, light weight and is exactly what I was looking for in  IPad mini case . After buying and using this case for myself I bought 2 more for friends.
5	1358640000	Now that I have my iPad Mini in it, I can truly say it really complements the iPad well. The quality of the leather is great (if it is faux leather, I can't tell - looks like good quality textured rather) and the white accent stitching gives it class. The magnetic auto wake/ sleep cover works like a charm  (unlike some other brands), and the free bonus stylus pen is a great addition (I don't ways use it but when I do, it works well). And the pen part writes well!!The other little details that I am impressed by are the finger insert/ grip and the stand up feature. Even though the iPad Mini is small and light, and easy to handle, once the fingers are inserted under the strip, you feel  confident that the tablet isn't going to slip out of your hands. The case stands comfortably in the landscape mode for movie viewing (as shown in the picture) or in writing mode (elevated only about 20-30 degrees). I use the latter mode more often.Overall, after spending a lot of money on my iPad, for the price I couldn't be happier with such a nice cover. Worth every bit.
5	1358640000	I love this case and the stylus. I'm very pleased with this purchase :) I will definitely recommend this product to my friends.
5	1358640000	I love this case... The stylus was a surprise (obviously I didn't read the description properly) and I love the colour...
5	1358553600	Perfect fit for your iPad mini. Fit like a glove reasonably priced, compared to the 50.00 the guy at the mall wanted. Worth the money.
5	1358553600	The faux leather is impossible to tell unless you have an elephant's nose. The color is very business-like. And it works superbly: When you close it, it turns machine-off; open it, iPad wakes-up. EXCELLENT & you can't beat their price. SHop with them!!!!
3	1358553600	I love the color, like the feel of the pseudo leather and the fit is good. It shuts off well. However, I'd not want to carry cards exposed as they would be and do not find the &#34;hand hold&#34; to be useful. It takes a lot of fiddling to get it to stand up as is shown in the pictures.
4	1358553600	I Received my cover today.....I love it!It does smell a little, but i'm sure it will go away.Would recommend this cover. Camera hole doesn't cover lens at all, despite reviews from others.So happy!LB
5	1358553600	This was an awesome purchase for a new iPad user.  The stylus pen was a plus and gives precise taps.  The foldover stand is easy to use and requires little effort, which is great when using facetime and quickly placing it on a table.  Overall, no complaints, the cover itself is soft to the touch and looks of high quality regardless of the actual price!
5	1358553600	this cover is off the hook I can carry it any where now since I got this cover its work perfect I dont need to bring wallet if I have this with me  I can put my card on it
5	1358553600	This case is better than we expected.  It has very professional styling in its leather case with stitching.  Much better looking than a lot of more expensive plastic ones.  We like how it stands, in both directions.  Our Ipad Mini fits into the case perfectly.  I especially like the elastic strap when holding it since it keeps us from dropping it.  The pen/stylus is a nice bonus.  We investigated a lot of cover options, and we couldn't be happier with the functionality, look, feel, and protection this case provides at a great price.
5	1358467200	I received my mini ipad for Christmas. My husband purchased a cover from Apple with it. While I recommend a cover for all ipads, I wanted a complete case for mine. I found this cover on Amazon and it is perfect! It comes in assorted colors and is very easy to use. It fits perfectly and I am able to use camera and facetime without any problems. My ipad is secure in the case and very portable. It fits into my purse or I can carry it alone and just slip my driving license and bank card into the slots provided. A wonderful find at a great price!!!!!
5	1358467200	the hang of shutting my tablet before I return it to it's home in my desk.  I also mostly have to go see if my chargers are keeping batteries 100%
4	1358467200	This is a good option. Easy to handle, and adds little to the weight. A good price and the pen/stylus is a plus.
3	1358467200	It is a very nice cover but I bought it because of the hand strap and pen. Thought they were great features. Unfortunately hand strap is on the INSIDE of the case not outside. Can't understand why... Also they say STYLUS PEN... I received a regular pen with it. No stylus to be found. Didn't appreciate that either.
5	1358380800	I really recommend this product as the style is clean and nice! It looks very professional and I love that it has a card holder as my mother in law put a few of her business cards in there to hand out! I bought this in December so I will update if anything happens with it but so far, my mother in law and I love it! Oh, and the stylus is a plus :)
5	1358380800	This is perfect! The shipping is super fast-very satisfied!I love how the device comes on and is ready to use as soon as I flip the smart cover.Thanks
5	1358380800	Received this as a gift along with my iPad mini.  It's made well and looks professional without being too bulky.  The functions perform as promised.  The wake/sleep function is a neat feature and I especially like the stylus/pen combination.  I would definitely recommend this product.
4	1358380800	Good Quality product but the stylus holder position not a right one. If slot was in the middle of the cover it would have been good. Otherwise good item at reasonable price..
4	1358294400	The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was the smell of the product when I first opened it. However, did some research online & found out lots if products made with this material has this chemical smell. The smell did go away over time. Other than that its a GREAT product.
5	1358294400	This case is great your traveling and day to day use. With the strap I'm able to use this anywhere and not worry about dropping it. Great product.
5	1358294400	I am very pleased with this case.  All functions of the iPad are easily accessible.  It provides good protection without being too bulky.  Nice quality for the price!
5	1358294400	This case is great for the iPad mini. I love the awake/asleep feature and its versatile. Love the pink color too
5	1358294400	I like the idea of protecting the Ipad from falling and the magnetic sleep cover is a great idea. Will look for another if this one becomes worn.
4	1358294400	I went ahead and bought this case because the price was so good and so were the reviews.  So far I really like it.  The stylus that came with it is mediocre (you kind of have to push down on it to make it respond), but I already have a stylus anyway.  According to some other reviewers, the smell is quite potent at first.  I would have to agree.  Hopefully it goes away quickly.  It almost smells like wet house paint.  But other than that, I am very satisfied.  The smart cover works, and my iPad Mini is secure.
1	1358294400	I did not receive what's in the picture. The pink color looks nicer in picture, it's darker in person. The inside color of the case is an ugly GRAY and there is no card holder or handle on it. Very disappointed.  If you don't have the product in stock, why not put that information on here?!!!
5	1358208000	I like the leather feeling, no mistakes finding at the present. Having some smells at the very beginning, Need to put aside for one day or two
4	1358208000	To start off with the color is a little different than portrayed in the picture, but it is still fine.  My mini fits perfect in it and fits securely.  It does have quite an odor, but I am sure it will subside.  Have had no problems getting it to stand upright as some reviewers have stated.  The one thing that I do not like is the stylus is a stylus on one end but it is a full functioning writing pen on the other, so not something you would want to use on your screen, so I did find that odd. But overall I like this cover for the price.
5	1358208000	Really neat product.  Does everything it says it will.  Very happy with it.This is nonsense simply to fill in the required number of words
5	1358208000	The case looks beautiful and the purple color is fun. It has some smart functions, that is the handy pen/stylus holder and the easy to use holder on the backside. But I bought it by mistake. I own a Kindle Fire HD not an Apple iPad mini. I just got so distracted by all the neat things about the case that I thought it was for me.
5	1358208000	Love this ipad cover.. It fits snug and is very durable and makes it a lot easier to hold on to my ipad.
5	1358208000	I bought this for my daughter - color perfect- product as described.. this leather case does protect the ipad mini very functional with pockets & pen stylus...although should offer replacement for the stylus-- it was damage by mishandling
4	1358121600	it's difficult to press the &#34;back page&#34; arrow on the screen if my mini ipad is in portrait view.  It doesn't have the problem if it's on landscape view. I ordered the purple cover and I do love it, but it does have that minor flaw. The mini has a smaller border compared to the standard size ipad, therefor the cover goes over the screen slightly and sometimes I have to push it over to press the arrow on the screen. Other than that, the quality is great for the price.  The stand-up position actually stays up which is quite nice.  Would still recommend to others even with that minor problem. Initially I wanted to rate it a 5, but decided to wait and use it at least 3 weeks before reviewing this cover. I'm glad I did.
3	1358121600	Stylus doesn't work very well, other than that the case itself functions as it should. Overall it is worth the money.
5	1358121600	This is a great cover.  Love the strap for carrying it one handed.  It's a great cover at an inexpensive price.
5	1358121600	It is a great cover for my ipad mini. The ipad mini slips right into its leather pocket on the right side and its cover can fold 360 degree. Once it folded, it has elastic hand band so that you can hold it while you read. Its cover can also slip minto the back of the case and hold it for easy tilt reading.  The price is right. I fully recommend it.
5	1358121600	This cover has all the &#34;bells and whistles&#34; that the more expensive cover's have, but at a much more affordable price. The handle is convenient when making presentations to customers and when using the Ipad. Love the &#34;sleep smart&#34; function and the pen/stylus. The leather is of exceptional quality. This one is for my husband, but I'll probably order one for myself. Great product.
5	1358035200	This is a beautiful, professional, little case.  i really like the space for cards. I can go to the grocery store, (my list is on the iPad mini) and only carry it.  It even arrived a day early.
5	1358035200	This cover is ideal for my iPad Mini.  It is a perfect fit, so you can easily touch all of the buttons and get to charger etc.  I did take the pen off - although it's a good idea and handy to have I found that it was catching when I wanted to put the iPad into my bag.  I would still recommend the cover as it keeps the pad safe and secure.
5	1357948800	This cover is everything that I wanted to protect my iPad Mini.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a complete cover for their Mini.
5	1357948800	My iPad mini fits perfectly.  The case is nice-looking and functional.  Took a while to get it to stand on its own but once I figured it out, it's perfect.  Love everything about, including the price.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality case.
5	1357948800	I looked around on Amazon and many other stores for an Ipad Mini case. There were alot to choose from, but none of them fit my expectations. I wanted to find a case that was durable, cute, and inexpensive. When I found this product, this one filled all my expectations. I ordered it and the shipment was very fast. When the package came I was amazed at the high quality and rich color of the case! It fits my Ipad Mini perfectly. I've had my case for a month, and I couldn't have asked for a better one. The fact that it comes with a stylus is a bonus! It works wonderfully and it also is very durable. This product has definitely exceeded my expectations! I will be buying another one!
5	1357948800	I love it super good quality leather! The pen slot is great and fits perfectly and the price is the best!!!
4	1357948800	Nice cover, but stand sometimes wobbles over,it Will definitely get better with use. The cover is very functional. It's a great buy
5	1357948800	I wanted something other than the Apple cover that only protects the screen and not the back of the iPad mini. This exceeds expectations. It is sturdy, pretty (I got this in pink), comes with the styliss, and has pockets to hold things. I can still charge it and adjust the volume with the buttons on the side; it fits the ipad perfectly. Magnets keep the cover from moving and leaving the ipad unprotected. Once you break in the creases, the stand also makes it easier to type on the screen sideways. The only criticism is that when you take it out of packaging the first time it has a funny chemical smell. You can't really smell it from afar but when you are up close then it is kind of strong. Hopefully it will go away. Overall, the features combined with the price made this the perfect product for me.
5	1357948800	I love this case!  It is such a pretty color and the stylus/pen that came with it is a nice extra!  It's a nice sleek case that doesn't add bulk to your iPad. The elastic strap is nice to slip your hand through to give better grip but isn't comfortable to hold your hand that way for long. I love that it also has a little stand feature. You just slide the front cover into a small flap and its propped up!  Really great accessory for a great price.
5	1357862400	I really enjoy using this case.  It fits perfectly and includes the bonus stylus.  I find it very comfortable to use and the hand hold band feature works great.  Thank you
4	1357862400	This cover is just what you need for your ipad mini.  It makes it easy to carry around and protects it nicely.  The magnetic cover is a wonderful feature.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the location of the stylus holder.  It is in the way of the volume buttons.  This is kind of a pain, so I just removed it since I never use it.  In every other way, this cover is wonderful.  It's made very well and is much better than the $50 case I had originally purchased. My daughter has now purchased the same cover only in magenta...and she is SUPER picky.  I highly recommend this cover.
5	1357862400	This is a good product it comes just like it says it does and protects my pad mini all around.
5	1357862400	I was stoked to get my ipad mini for Christmas and was SUPER excited to shop for accessories for it! First thing I knew I would need was a cover to protect it. I thought about the ipad smart cover but discovered that for something so expensive it would only cover the screen. I knew I wanted something that would protect it all around so I could carry my ipad in my handbag. This cover was perfect! Amazing price and it does it all! It fits like a dream, it covers and protects! The color is sooo cute and the sleep mode works great! The stylis that comes with it isn't the greatest but its good to use until you can get some better ones (Amazon has great deals for those too!) 5 stars!!!!!
4	1357862400	Product as advertised. Smelled strong in the beginning but it eventually faded out. Liked the wake/sleep feature and the included stylus
5	1357862400	Came as described and even a day early. Looks and feels solid. Haven't send the purpose of the strap for your hand because it just flaps. Everything else is fine with the case.  Just as good as the high priced cases on the market.
5	1357862400	This iPad mini case is just as described. It is well-made, very handy, protects the mini, looks great, and the price is ideal. You couldn't ask for a better case than this for your mini!
3	1357862400	I don't really understand why the handle is on the inside. Stupid design flaws but whatever it did the job
5	1357776000	I love this case. It is made very well. Stitching is attractive. Really love the hand strap, very helpful!Love the color, more of what I would call a raspberry color. Not pink or bubble gum-looking. Two tone is nice. Overall very attractive looking. Actually prettier than picture. Very pleased with the look and features of this case.
5	1357776000	Love this case! The color and workmanship is perfect. This will protect your ipad mini very well as the ipad is secured in place by a velcro fastener. Very smart looking. The sleep/wake functionality performs correctly as well. I have seen some reviews about the smell but I know for experience with other items made of the same material that the smell goes away. I like the feature where you could put in a business or credit card. Great idea. I would definitely recommend this case.
5	1357776000	Although the customer service department is somewhat not too responsive in replacing my ordered with the right cover case, I finally was able to use and feel the quality of this product, which has been great to me. Have been using it with my iPad Mini since I received it. I highly recommended this cover with its super quality. Thank you!
4	1357776000	It's very nice looking n practical.Perfect for a handbag n the color purple is great. The styler is a plus.
4	1357776000	Good product has a funny smell. I'm hoping it wears off because it is very strong. I haven't had any problems with the product itself. It keeps my iPad safe and that's why I got it
5	1357776000	I loooove it it protects mi mini good, I haveee no smell and it stands good easy to carry around collegeeee plus a free item not bad.
5	1357776000	Believe all the positive comments.  This is an excellent cover for the price.  I love this cover. It is perfect for the ipad mini and after looking for covers at retail stores, this one is the best I've seen.  The cover is of great quality, looks very professional and fully covers the ipad so it won't fall out.  You can also easily access the camera and the various buttons.  The included stylus is an extra perk.  I definitely recommend this cover to anyone looking for an ipad mini cover at a great price
5	1357689600	Holds iPad securely and comfortable to use. Price was great from Amazon. Good product overall would recommend getting this cover
5	1357689600	I ordered this in purple on the 7th and had it on the 9th. My iPad mini fits perfectly in this case and I love the color. The pen that comes with it works just fine. I saw similar cases at best buy for forty bucks. Great case!!
5	1357689600	This  cover fits perfectly. The previous reviews mentioned the smell which was a bit  strong at first but it disappeared in about a week. The iPad mini fits perfectly. the camera lens and all the control buttons are easily seen and function well with the cover on. The stand did take some time to get into the right attitude to hold the ipad up for a while. At first I had to press on the top of the ipad to keep it steady, but that was only after a long while of holding it up. It works very well after using it for a few days. I have no complaints about this cover and would recommend it to anyone. The sleep function on closing and opening the cover works perfectly.
4	1357689600	The price was great and looks good not sure if it is actually a genuine leather. Overall, satisfied with the Ipad mini cover.
5	1357603200	This mini iPad case is lovely ... Great quality, well made and the bonus combination pen/stylus works great...a worthwhile buy!
5	1357603200	I love the purple iPad mini case. Just perfect!! It fits into my purse and is easy to handle. I would buy another one when this one wears out. Oh and the stylus is right on time!!!
5	1357603200	I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND FOR HIS NEW I PAD MINI AND HE LOVES IT. PROTECTS AND IS VERY EASY TO CARRY.
5	1357603200	Very nice case in a pretty shade of pink.  Comes with a nice stylus.  I havent bought my mini yet but didnt want to miss out on this price!
5	1357603200	Good product for the price. This was a Xmas gift for a close relative of mines and they really love it.
5	1357516800	The case is study and the color is nice it's a dark purple. My ipad mini slides into the inside opening and all the edges are covered with leather and there is a Velcro strap to tuck in under it making it safe and not slipping. I really am nervous about the ones that you clip the i pad into bc it leaves the whole thing open, it's plastic ,and if you drop it well the ipad isn't cheap.  It also has a strap that you can hold it while reading and although I may not use the card holder there is a spot there for two cards.  Maybe for my Starbucks card It came with a stylus pen, although cute it's not that great, I have my own which fits into the elastic on the side. It does go to sleep when I close it.  I have to say so far so good.  I wish it had a pocket in the front.  I have the i pad 2 that case is awesome.  Has a pocket in the front, I keep the cleaning soft wipe in it and some mad money and my pen.  I would surely but again because like I said there is not plastic snap in and its safe and cozy protecting my investment. It took me forever to find this one and the price was awesome.  I got more than I paid for.  Now I wish they would make one with a front pocket! I will be buying another for my daughter.
5	1357516800	Got this for an ipad mini. It is of good quality and a masculine or business like look for a case for a man.
4	1357516800	That's nice.  Okokok don't wake up so good.:.................: ....  ... .... .... .... .... .... ..&iquest; &iquest;... .&iquest; ...
5	1357516800	bought this to go with the big gift for my husband for Christmas (the ipad mini black) ..and this cover is awesome!!!  I think what sold me on it was another reviewer had a video up of his review on it so it gave me more of an idea how it worked and what it looked like as he was holding it and talking about it...great cover I love it myself so if (ahem, cough cough) hint hint* if ..&#34;if&#34; Im lucky enough to get myself an ipad in the near future ...I will definitely be back to get one myself.  My husband owns his own small business and this is PERFECT for taking with him anywhere, anytime in the truck or wherever...every night he comes upstairs to use it and has never took the cover off..it looks so nice on there and has some slots for cards as well as the pen.  Thank you !! Good packaging as well as quick shipping:)) I WILL be back!:)
5	1357516800	I purchased this case for my daughter's Christmas gift. She loved the color. She loves the stand feature and stylus. My wife also thought the case was nice.The case arrived sooner than the estimated delivery date. Overall, we are satisfied with the purchase.
5	1357516800	This product is very classy looking for the low price. It has a working pen/stylus and convenient card holders. It provides protection for my iPad mini all while looking elegant. I would recommend this product!
5	1357516800	The iPad mini fits perfectly. The sleep/wake function always works when opening and closing the case. Some reviewers have mentioned a strong and bothersome &#34;new smell&#34;. This is true, but this smell wears off in about 2 days. Standing up the iPad for viewing (upright angle) or working (low angle) works excellent, especially after a couple of days of wearing in and loosening up. This is a great case!
5	1357430400	This cover is a great fit at a great price. Volume control, camera lens, home button, power button and lightning port are all very easily accessible while using this cover. The more I use it and "break it in", the happier I am with it! Comes with a stylus to boot!
4	1357430400	This well made case for the iPad Mini is just what I wanted. It provides good protection for both the front and the back of my iPad yet adds little in terms of additional size or bulk. It is well made of quality leather with no flaws in the sewing of the seams and with all the necessary holes in the case to allow access to buttons connections and for the speakers. In addition to the potential for it to stand the iPad either horizontally or vertically with a secure way to hold the back up, there are two small pockets suitable for a credit card or a few business cards. There is a convenient strap which  you can slip your hand under to hold the case securely when it is open. As a bonus, there is an included stylus in it's own little holder sewn into the case. All in all well worth the price.
5	1357430400	I really like this holder.  It is nice and light.  The strap for your hand is nice too.  The color is very good also.
5	1357430400	It came in great condition. Had nothing broken on it and works great. Made a great gift too! Would recommend to anyone
5	1357430400	I would recommend this case to anyone that has the mini ipad.  It has the strap to hold on to your ipad and it also includes the doubly useful stylus/pen.  And a couple of slots for a cc and/or drivers license makes it the perfect case!
5	1357344000	We were looking for an iPad mini case for a week and finally landed on this one.  Overall my wife loves it.  Very sturdy, lightweight, and feels like it will protect it well.  I combined this with a screen guard and it looks great.  The stylus was a nice touch as well that my wife uses all of the time now.  The only negative is the base is very small if you try to stand it up horizontally it falls over.  Other than that, it's great.
3	1357257600	It was hard to find just the right cover for my new mini iPad and this seemed perfect.Good points:  Vivid color, very attractive.  The elastic strap for holding the iPad securely is very handy.  My mini fit in it very well and was easy to slip in and fasten the velcro.Bad points:  folded back to set upright, it is very unsteady and could easily fall over.  The chemical smell is overwhelmingly strong. It is giving me a headache sitting here 24 inches from my nose.  I'm hoping the smell will dissipate after it is out in the open for a while.My biggest pet peeve is that the heading for the product says leather, but the description says synthetic leather. I like leather products and I dislike being told initially that something is leather when it is not.This cover will do to protect my mini iPad until I can find something better.
5	1357257600	It fits well on the iPad mini especially the part allows the hand to be more relaxed. I so like to feel the comfort when holding between the rear strap that snuggly fits in the hand. There is absolutely no chance of slippage. It also protects the iPad much better than the one I bought from the Apple store. You should get yours. I enjoy it immensely!
4	1357257600	This cover is less costly than others available and it works great.  It did have an odor when first received, as others mentioned but lasts only a short time.  Love the purple color!
4	1357257600	I like being able to slide hand in to get a better grip while in use.  I found it easy to use and like that it holds the handy pen/stylus.  Does sometimes fall over when propped as with all the ones I've seen thus far.  Auto shut off/wake when opening and closing.  And it isn't bulky or heavy.  Even the Apple guy said it was a cool case.
5	1357171200	This is a smart looking iPad mini cover-one thing I didn't notice from the photos, is it comes with a combination stylus/regular pen attached to the side of the case! Very handy!
5	1357171200	Just got this and I love it it fits great looks good and good quality , the price is great just go to best buy and compare :)
4	1357171200	I mainly got this cover because of the color.I didn't even realize the stylus was included but it was a plus.  The only downfall of this cover was the stand portion...it never stays balanced in that position.  I am content with it other than that.
5	1357171200	I was very pleased with this case . Very functional . Sleep and awake seem to work perfectly for me.
2	1357171200	Good case, love the hand strap feature and spot for cards.  The magnet that turns on the iPad is a great feature.
5	1357171200	After reading previous reviews (all positive) I thought I would try it, for two (2) reasons.  Availability, and Cost.  You just can't beat the cost, and the quality of the item is better than I expected.  I am very pleased to say the least.  It shipping came 3 days ahead of schedule, which made me happy. The iPad Mini Smart Cover fit perfectly on my iPad, and works as advertised with the Auto Wake/Sleep mode.  I am very pleased with this product, and you will be also.
2	1357171200	This case does not stand up as pictured. I would recommend the roocase version instead. You can stand that one up and watch a show with it.
5	1357171200	This cover fits very well, no complaints.  Makes holding the ipad much easier and it looks great.  I would recommend it to all my friends.
4	1357084800	I purchased this case after seeing many different cases and covers for the iPad mini that were out there. I wanted something that would cover the entire device (not just the front or just the back as many cases seem to be) as well as something slim and easy to travel with. It was also a plus that this case came with a stylus (which is also an ink pen on the opposite end) as I was planning on purchasing one anyway. I was hoping also for something with a sleep/wake function and something that could transform easily into a typing and viewing stand. I am very pleased with this case as it covers all of these things. This case fits an iPad mini very snugly and has a Velcro flap to ensure your iPad will not slip out. The sleep/wake function works perfectly and so does the stylus. I purchased the purple option to add some personality and am very happy (it is exactly the same hue as the picture shows.) Other reviewers have noticed a slight smell when they first opened their case...I have noticed this as well but do not find it overpowering and I expect it to fade with time. It smells like new plastic, which is fitting as this case is clearly made of new plastic. The inside feels a bit like suede and the outside feels like leather. This case allows for all ports and buttons to still be used easily. Overall, I am very happy, especially for this price.
4	1357084800	Bought this for my wife for Christmas for her new IPad Mini, fits well and seems secure.  A Stylus was included and has an ink pen as well.  Did not include a screen protector for the IPad.
5	1357084800	I cannot believe how reasonably priced this ipad mini cover was.  As a former ipad original owner, I have seen many cases that are junk and more then twice the cost of this.  Way to go blason!  I really like this cover.  The purple color looks a lot richer in person then the pics show.
5	1357084800	I purchased this item for the wife and she really enjoyed the smart cover and still has it in her hands every single day since she received it.
5	1357084800	This is a very high quality cover that fits perfectly! I love the look of it and it functions wonderfully. Lots of nice touches and excellent craftsmanship. I also am not really a stylus person....at least I never thought I was...but the inclusion of the nice pen/stylus combo has me rethinking that! :-)
5	1357084800	The minute this came, I took my mini out of the $45.00 cover I had purchased and replaced it with this. The sleep/wake feature works beautifully, the hand strap makes holding it very confortable and the mini slid right in. What a bargan!
5	1357084800	Beautiful color, IPad mini fits perfect. Love the idea of the two card holders inside the case. The stylus is a great tool as well.
4	1357084800	This product took over 2 weeks to get. Just using it to protect my iPad mini and the cover is smart so it puts it to sleep saving battery life and not having to turn it on and off.
5	1357084800	it fits to the tee and the slots for cards or papers is so great. the olor is rich. and the fact that it has a place for the stylus is a grat pule. thank you
4	1357084800	This is a great case for my ipad mini. It fits perfectly and i feel safe enough to carry it everywhere with me. The on/off feature is great. Love the card holder, it is great for my student id. The pen works well and is an actual ink pen also! I reccommend this case to anyone.
2	1357084800	This was a great idea and certainly wanted to protect the mini ipad investment, but design is lacking.  Just getting it in and out of cover is quite an ordeal.  Hard to access buttons once in the cover, comes with a pen (in elastic holder on the side); saw this as a great way to shut the thing and accidently catch the pen in the opening thereby scratching the screen of the ipad (obviously defeating it's purpose of protecting the mini).  Initially removed the pen, but found out it actually served to help access the buttons of the mini through inadequately small openings in the case.  Would have been much more pleased with a stylist (sp?) pen rather than an ink pen.  If only I were in charge, right!Also comes with slots to insert cards and small writing pad, I guess if you're truly using the thing in the course of business these might come in handy, but the irony of a high tech &#34;all in one, multipurpose, mini computer&#34; being accompanied with an ink pen and writing pad just seems a poor fit which added to the poor design.  To each his own.
5	1356998400	I shopped everywhere for a case for my iPad mini and found nothing less than $30 that had the same features.  Most have less.  First the sleep/wake feature is great.  The case makes it feel like I'm holding a book.  It's leather and stitching is very durable.  The strap, stylus loop, and extra slots are a bonus and a rare find.  This case will keep my mini safe, secure, and stylish.  Love it!
3	1356998400	We ordered two of these to protect the mini's we were getting for our two granddaughters. They work well (they are a little difficult to get on/off). As it turns out we did not feel the case would protect the mini well enough for our 5 year old so we purchased a different case for her. Improvement could be made on the strap for hand-holding the device - when using it the cover tends to get twisted. I feel it is a decent case for the money.
4	1356912000	I received an iPad as a Christmas gift and and I was a nervous wreck walking around with it for fear of it falling.  I wanted something that would protect the device and the glass front and yet have a way of holding on to it.  Looked all around and found this to be the perfect design.All the reviews I read were correct:  Had as strong odor of glue in the beginning, the stitching was white not black (which i preferred), folding it as a stand needs time to break in, and the stylus was useless.  Other things I notices is that there is a Velcro tongue that keeps the unit  securely in it's case.  The auto-close works perfectly and the magnet keeps in closed even in my purse. It looks like leather and for the money, this is well worth the value.  Only negative is the stylus holder which I cut off.
5	1356912000	If you purchased an I pad mini, this is a must purchase.Great protection for travel, or even at home to guard against scratches from everyday occurrences
3	1356912000	Love the fit of the case, like the hand strap, which may make it easier to hold and read in bed.  Ordered the magenta but it really is purple.  The main reason it might go back is the odor.  I don't want to have to wait 3 weeks for it to go away ( as stated in another review ).  I'll leave it out for 2 days and if it still stinks, it will go back.Still stinks, sent it back today.. Bought a stmbag grip and LOVE IT!  More money but superior product.
5	1356912000	I have been shopping in local stores trying to find a case for my daughters iPad mini and they all start at about $35 and up. Most  of the cases I have seen do not seem very secure they don't seem to be a good value. I came to Amazon and found this case which is wonderful! It smells horrible when you open it but I guess that is just the color on the material. It fits the ipad so nicely and it is extremely secure!! I love that the case wraps completely around the face of the iPad and keeps it in place. There is a little velcro piece at the end that I didn't realize was there...you tuck it behind the side of the iPad and it keeps it from coming out! Perfect especially with kids. It really cant fall out of this case. The stand is good and it has a little pen that comes with it as well. This was a very good value and I highly recommend it especially for teens.
5	1356912000	I love my new iPad case!!!  It's so nice. My only complaint is that the color is a little bit darker than the picture, but it still looks great! And it comes With a stylus?!! awesome !
3	1356912000	I loved the look of this case, but it smelled so bad I had to send t back! If u don't mind the strong smell of grossness, it's a fantastic case.  Had to send it back, sprayed perfume on it and it still really smelled, could not stand the smell!
5	1356825600	Very good product. Protects the IPad very well, the stylus pen is handy. Should order 1 of every color!! If you own an IPad, you need this holder!!
5	1356825600	Why would I pay over $25 at the apple store for a cover thar only covers the front, this cover is of well made materials, looks great and professional, best of all is the price. I bought two, one for me and one as a gift.
5	1356825600	When Got I thought it was going to cheap and flimsy, But I was wrong. Great quality and my I pad mini fix in there perfect!! Does not move around, sung fit, and great stylus pen!!!If you just got an Ipad mini I would Highly recommend this case to protect your investment.
5	1356825600	gr8 productIt's lightweightI would recommend to a friendWorth the money I paid for itBuy it u won't regret it
5	1356825600	This was a perfect companion for my husband's new ipad mini. He loves the cover and the strap for the hand. The pen was a nice addition. This was a great value.
4	1356825600	Purchased for my son for his ipad mini.  Case is well made, leather, and reasonably priced.  Pen included works great on the iPad screen.  Like how iPad shuts off when case is closed.  Also like the way the case serves as a stand.  Well worth it!
5	1356825600	This was exactly what I was hoping for - a sturdy protective cover that is functional. The extra pen/stylus holder is an extra bonus.
5	1356739200	would recommend to everyone! best i have seen even in stores is strong stands up! and best of all has elastic you can put hand through to hold!
2	1356739200	When I opened this item I was shocked by the very strong smell. It gave me a headache straight away. I decided to leave it open the whole night only to wake up in the morning to the same horrible smell. I had to send it back. It is a shame really.
5	1356739200	Great cover for iPad mini. Easy to hold with hand strap. Protects mini better than another cover I bought. Built in stylus is a plus also.  Of all the covers I have purchased for iPads this one went above expectations.
5	1356739200	This was a gift for my daughter and she really lived this item and the stylus.  Good quality and true to color.
5	1356652800	This iPad mini case is a great price and fits well. It is very light and protects the iPad mini nicely. There are so many cases for the iPads sometimes it is a shot in the dark especially when ordering online. This was a shot in the dark purchase and it paid off. The price is great and the additional stylus is a bonus.
4	1356652800	My mom loved this pink case for her new iPad mini!  She loves the strap on the back.  The only issue we had was getting it to stand on its own...it took some work, but we got it.
5	1356652800	Just like it says. On/off with open/close, handy to hold. The stand up feature isn't quite level but we don't use it that much anyway. Good buy for $20.
5	1356652800	The price was GREAT and the quality good. Everything you need for travel and protection. I gave it as a gift.
5	1356652800	I really like this case.  For less than $20 it is sturdy and attractive.  Opening the cover automatically wakes up my Mini.  The stylus/pen is a nice touch.  The elastic 'handle' makes holding on to the mini even more convenient.
5	1356652800	protects my mini iPad perfectly, I also love the color!Shipped very quickly. i would recommend it to anyone. Love it!
5	1356652800	This case is perfect for giving the iPad a business like look, when going to meetings. it has places for business cards and a pen that doubles as a stylus. The only issue which is tough to get used to is that if you don't have a pen or don't plan on using one, is that the pen holder sticks out like a sore thumb.
5	1356652800	I would recommend this case to everyone.  One of the best features is the sleep/wake functionality.  Other pluses are the great price and how it fits the ipad mini like a glove.  Its make using the ipad mini much more pleasant than without a cover at all.  Great product!
5	1356652800	We purchased this case after shopping around quite a bit for the sleep smart cover.  It looks a lot like the cover that we bought for my husband's iPad last year, except his isn't the sleep smart cover.  I was worried about the quality when ordering since the price was so reasonable.  Once we received the cover I was thrilled at the high quality of workmanship and materials for the purchase price.  It is sturdy and really well built. The cover fits my son's iPad mini perfectly. The sleep smart cover works like a charm with absolutely no problems whatsoever.  I'm sure with the quality this cover will last a long time.  Even in the hands of my son. :)  And the price was amazing!!!  Thank you for making and selling such high quality merchandise at a reasonable price.
5	1356566400	I love this cover!  It's small enough to still put it in my purse, but big enough to protect the iPad.  The cut outs are perfectly aligned with the cameras, speakers and volume buttons etc.  Having the auto sleep/wake function is a bonus I didn't realize would be so darn convenient!
5	1356566400	Great quality however it is bulky.  It is good for traveling to protect your device. The case is definitely a folio case/binder type. It  looks great, I love it and would recommend it.
5	1356566400	Worth ur money, the stylet isnt that useful, it doesnt look too stable when standing like it is advertised in pics... but it works, keeps ipad safe, away from slipping.
4	1356566400	Pretty good; decent functionally good protection, fairly attractive case. Comes w/ a stylus which is nice. Great value for the price &#60;$17.
5	1356566400	This case fits perfectly, with or without a protective clear back cover that i bought in addition to this case.  The auto sleep/wake functionality works well also.  Well worth the price, and arrived in time for Christmas.
5	1356566400	this case fits my ipad mini so perfectly and the purple is a nice vibrant color. wonderful price for a case that serves multiple purposes from standing the ipad to the automatic sleep. the stylus pen is a bonus!
4	1356566400	Bought all three colors for different people. The colors shown exactly what you get. The handle is not very efficient, but I am not sure much use they would have gotten anyways
4	1356566400	It's an all-around solid choice and reasonably priced. Solid construction with enough edges to protect the iPad when dropped. The only thing annoys me is the touch pen and the holder. I prefer to use my hand so I cut the pen holder from the case.
4	1356480000	it is a nice case but will probably find something different when there are more options. I can't get it to stand up like the picture shows. I loved the color options and the price.
5	1356480000	what you see is what you get. (Quality). was very impressed and satisfied with my purchase. would recommend it to others
4	1356480000	Great product! The apple iPad mini fits perfectly in this classy leather case. It's super easy to carry around especially in a ladies handbag. It comes with a stylus and writing pen which are in easy reach when using your iPad. The elastic grip on the underside of the front cover makes it easy to carry without slipping out of your hand. The cover can be adjusted so that your iPad can stand upright or lay down at a slightly elevated angel. I would highly recommend this case if you are looking for great quality at an exceptional price!
5	1356480000	Can't comment on durability, we bought them as Chrismas gifts along with new iPad minis.  They look great and fit perfectly.  The hand strap is very functional.
5	1356480000	This fills the bill for me. Nice size, fits the ipad mini well, excellent price, good protection, lovely color. I like that I can stand this up while viewing a recipe while cooking.
4	1356480000	Good cost performance. The only thing if I would like to say for an improvement is variations of standing angles.
5	1356393600	I am an old lady and love my purple! The leather is of good quality and had that leather smell. It fits the iPad mini perfectly and the stylus/ pen holder is a plus. I am pleased with this purchase and would buy from this seller again.
4	1356393600	The case suits its purpose and is a great value for the price. The iPad mini doesn't fit quite as snug as I would like. Therefore, the Smart Cover is not always working so well because of it. Not a big deal to me though. I would definitely recommend this product.
2	1356393600	The case seemed to work well in terms of sleep/wake functionality.  It did not stand well.  The most unattractive aspect wad the strong, harsh odor which triggered my asthma.  Product returned due to the smell.
5	1356393600	The iBlason case is an excellent case.  I would highly receommend it.  I purchased these with the iPad mini for my sons and they think that they are perfect.
5	1356393600	This i-BLASON case is a perfect fit for my daughter's Ipad Mini.  I am so glad I bought this one.
5	1356307200	Worth the extra money.  I have other cases but I use this one the most.  I had to pay a little more but I like it
4	1356307200	works well and wife is happy. you can't ask much more than that. shipped on time and priced right. well pleased.
5	1356307200	I justed needed a cover immediately for my mini ipad and the photos convinced me to try it out.  The delivery was before the due date. The lilac color is as pictured and it does the job.  It looks like a note pad/calendar when closed and doesn't draw unwanted attention. The cover is sturdy and the sleep mode activates when I close the cover.  The edge extends beyond the tablet itself so there may be protection if dropped at an angle. I haven't tried it so I'm just guessing.  Although the camera seems off centered, it takes pictures/video with unobstructed views. My stylus works as needed.I was half expecting to use this as a temporary cover but it has exceeded my expectations and will use this exclusively.
4	1356307200	This cover is adequate and serves it's purpose well. The cover came quickly and without issue. Texture is not too cheap feeling.
5	1356307200	no problem with this and so far so good. I am happy with it and  have no complains about this item. The price was right too.
2	1356307200	Was very disappointed. The way its made, it doesn't hold up the IPad. So that function is out the window.
5	1356307200	Have no complaints. Does what I need it to do. Serves its purpose. Great price compared to other cases. Would recommend.
5	1356220800	This is a great product. Provides protection if dropped, although I haven't dropped mine, yet, and makes it much easier to hold.  Some have complained about the white stitching, but I find it acceptable, maybe even attractive.  The magnetic sleep feature works great.  I don't use the stand-up feature.All in all, I am very pleased with it and glad that I bought it.
5	1356220800	Its a great ittle case. I would say that I would have rather have the pen NOT twist-to-extend, but thats sort of nitpicky. the fact that its a case that comes with a pen/stilus makes it the best ipad case i've ever had.
5	1356220800	Love this, it's for my grand daughter's iPad mini that she got for Christmas :-) I got my grandson one too
1	1356220800	Keyboard is very low quality.. Don't think it will last long.. Did not receive a stylus. This item is way overpriced for such low quality.
5	1356220800	I love the color and the functinality of my ipad case. I will probably order another one in a diffrent color.
3	1356220800	Pro:1. Stylus is a big plus.2. Gripping bar is a good feature.Cons:1. Quality of the fabric is so-so.2. When iPad goes into it, the boundaries of iPad and the case, does not align 100%.3. Holding with one hand, will tilt the iPad little lower.4. Holding with gripping bar, sometimes in inconvenient.5. Little pricey.
2	1356220800	Very poor quality! I got this as a gift and am not sure if I even want to give it to them anymore! The product is very cheap looking and feeling! Since this seemed to be the most popular search result, I was expecting better! The stand aspect doesn't seem to work properly and the whole thing keeps falling over. Also, the "bonus stylus" is just a writing pen that when you turn upside down has a rubber part to be used on touch screens! This is misleading!  For people not so technologically confident this could cause confusion and I could see someone accidently ruining their ipad by writing on it! Lastly, there was NO directions. The description had so many neat features and I have no idea how to use them because it came with absolutely nothing! I would love to know how the auto sleep feature works and how to properly use the stand because it is not as easy as it looks. Overall, I was less than pleased with this product!
5	1356134400	This is everything I could possibly want in a case. It has a place for a stylus - a handle to make holding it super easy. I'm a very satisfied customer. One note - the color is closer to &#34;berry&#34; - not a light pink, but it's still gorgeous.
5	1356048000	My mini Ipad loves this case.  It protects the back and the front, just not the face like most covers.It is a great product! Great Value!  I will be added additional colors soon.
5	1356048000	Great protection for the iPad Mini, sleep feature works perfect when closing the case, variety of viewing options. I am a reader and I love the handle while reading....The Perfect Case for the iPad Mini.
2	1355961600	Poor quality makes the case weaker as you continue to use it. Cant put it up as a stand anymore.
3	1355961600	This case is made well but it does not get my Ipad Mini to stand up because the bottom part is rounded.  Other than that a decent case for the Mini.
5	1355961600	Real leather and a good buy for the price. Purchased for my grandson who is getting the mini ipad as a gift from Santa.Will update after Christmas.
5	1355961600	I would recommend this cover to anyone with the IPad mini. It was exactly what it was described as and I really enjoy it.
4	1355875200	Great color and my wife, who it was purchased for, loves it.  It gets more of a 4.5 stars.  Well worth the money.
4	1355875200	Just got this today and it fits like a glove, stands up with sturdiness and closes securely. It all works just as advertised. the hand strap is comfortable and the stylus is a handy touch.
5	1355788800	The I-BLASON is the best case I have found. I love my iPad Mini but it is a little bit light for me. With this case I fill comfortable holding my iPad and the protection is great! I tried a number of other cases and by far this is the best. The price...what can I say...fantastic!
4	1355788800	I've had this case over a month and I love it.  Before writing this I read many of the negative reviews and I don't have any of those problems.  The magnets work, the case doesn't smell, the white stitching looks nice...  I use the stand quite a bit and it works great.  The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is I do think the buttons on the upper right side are a little difficult to use -- not really a big problem though.I highly recommend it and it is very reasonably priced.  I have the black one with the tasteful white stitching.
5	1355788800	I bought a case from Apple that was $40 and I really wasn't happy with it since it only covered the front of my iPad and looked kind of cheap. This case is half the price and I absolutely love it. The color is perfect, not too dark not too light. I love the handle and the card holder inside. The pen was definitely a bonus, because you can use it to write with and the top can be used on my iPad. I am really very happy with this case, it looks like it's a great quality case and looks more expensive than the case I bought from Apple!
2	1355702400	When shopping and looking at the pictures to make you choices, should use actual item, not one that is similar.
4	1355702400	It is a very good case. I very love it. My ipad  is now really safe, but there was only one disadvantage. When the case arrived the pan was ran down and I had to bought other pan to feel that ipads screen is safe from fingerprints and the nail scratches, but on the  other hand this case is best for its price.
2	1355702400	I ordered this before I received my Ipad Mini, but was not happy because it is hard to write or touch the corners of the ipad mini.  Keeps it secured but not easy to use it.  Don't recommend for the ipad Mini, should be constructed a bit better.
5	1355702400	Honestly, I was little reluctant at first to purchase this item: I figured that at this price range I would not get anything of decent quality but boy was I wrong. The quality surpassed items I've seen in twice the price range.  It's beautifully crafted, has the auto shut off feature and comes with the stylus that comes in handy if you want to draw or write on screen with it.  Someone gave a poor review because of the white stitch sewn into the case and let me tell you that it adds a bit of class and I would have paid extra to have it.  You can't go wrong with this case.
5	1355702400	I am very pleased with product. I am considering ordering a few more in different colors to have on hand.
4	1355702400	I like this cover because its sturdy.  And versatile, My Mini is safe in it and I don't worry about the kids using it.
5	1355702400	The case is straight foward. It wakes up when opening the cover and goes to sleep when closing the cover.The ipad mini fits snug just like it supposed be.Over all is a very good case and the price at the time was just right.
4	1355616000	This is a very nice case for a great price. I love the strap that allows you to safely hold the iPad with one hand. Be sure to stretch the frame before attaching the Velcro. If you do not the back tab button can be hard to get to if you have big hands.
5	1355616000	What else is there to say, the perfect cover for my Mini. I absolutely love it and the price was great.
5	1355529600	I bought this cover for my iPad mini because I wanted something that looked professional and was functional. So far I have only had it for 2 weeks but I already love it. It does a great job of protecting my iPad and looks great. There is a pen/stylus holder on built onto the side and there is a place to put my business cards. The elastic strap makes it easy to hold on to and the cover turns the iPad on and off just like it should. The only drawback is that it does not do a good job as a stand to hold the iPad upright in landscape orientation. Overall I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone.
4	1355529600	I would like to say that this is helpful. the leather is awesome and the hand slider was cool too.The stylus is useful some times and the whole feel is great in the hand.
5	1355529600	nice quality  ipad mini cover very reasonable price fast ship . . . . . . . . . .
5	1355443200	This case fit my ipad mini pretty well.  It was a little stinky but it's not bad now that I aired it out.  The description says that you get a stylus but I didn't get a stylus.  However they have contacted me to correct it.
5	1355443200	This low cost iPad mini cover has performed well. The cover fits well, the magnet ON/OFF feature functions well, and the Pen/stylus works well.  It provides protection for the front and back of the iPad, and there are openings for the camera, speakers, charger plug, and button access.  Compared to the costs of other covers that provide less protection, this one is a bargain.
5	1355443200	Quite useful to protect the mini iPad. Perfectly fits measures.  Easy to carro on. According to the product price. Recommend 100%
5	1355443200	This is a much better case than the Apple Smart Cover because this one protects the back and is much sturdier when you stand it up. It's also a lot cheaper.  It adds to the thickness somewhat of course, but it's still pretty light overall.  I highly recommend it.
5	1355443200	I like the fact it has a magnetic wake/sleep cover!  It is smooth so does not get caught on things in your purse.  You can put business cards inside the front cover and has a place on the side for pen/stylus!
3	1355443200	I hate when a vendor charges more than the freight should cost. It's simple fund the best rate to ship and charge only that. Bb
5	1355356800	I've been shopping for a case since I got my mini a month or two ago. All of them were over $50 and non of them had the features I was looking for. This case is awesome and I still can't believe the cost $19.99. Love it.
4	1355356800	Also would prefer a wide inside slot for cards,index card size; need more fluorescent pink, orange, bright colors;love the elastic band to stabilize grasp
4	1355356800	I like the hand strap on the back to secure it on the move. It works well but is a little unstable when in landscape mode and the quality of manufacturing so ok but not great, it does not align perfectly. The cover flap should have the corner cut out because it covers the back camera, which is my main complaint.
5	1355356800	If anyone has an I-pad mini, or even a family member with one, this case would have to be the best one to purchase. I would recomend it to anyone!
3	1355356800	I ordered this for the pen comes with the cover.  That was the only reason I kept the order.  The cover is Ok.  I found an lighter one I like better.  I checked with the stores the pen costed $15.I don't know why the other covers did not come with a pen.
5	1355270400	I just bought this for my mother for her new iPad mini (although I only paid $14.95 for it, and I just received it on 12/10/12...) it fits perfectly. It even gets velcro-ed in so the iPad doesn't slide out. If you're saying it doesn't fit, you're doing it wrong. It protects the iPad great around the edges without getting in the way of the screen. The magnets are a nice touch in keeping it closed. The leather is great - definitely worth the $15 I ordered for it. The card holder and handle are nice too.
2	1355270400	A small piece was missing from the package. However when you call the # provided, it tells you that the voice mail box is full and not accepting messages. So much for great customer service.So I now have to return the entire package and credit to my account and then  &#34;reorder&#34; the item again. There is no telling if the 2nd package will be right or here before Christmas.
2	1355270400	I don't use it, and it took over three weeks to get to my house, after it went to the post office? So I bought a different one because I needed some protection.Update. It dyed my ipad protection screen. Thank goodness I had one one!
5	1355184000	I appreciate this cover for its versatility and convenience.  Plus the color selection is generous.  The cover does all that it is shown to do and does it well.
5	1355184000	I am absolutely satisfied with this.  My granddaughter is going to love this addition to her new ipad mini.  Great!
1	1355184000	Doesn't fit the iPad Mini very well.  It's clumsy to put the device into the cover and secure it with Velcro.  The off-gassing from the material it's made of is sickening.  Check out Marware instead.
5	1355184000	Fits perfectly. Camera works well, cover works flawlessly to open-on and close. I love the purple, and quality. A better protection than the apple cover with no back.Hope to order a similar one for Christmas for an Ipad2 gift.
2	1355184000	I got an Ipad early for Christmas.  Of course I had to use it right away and day one it is laying on my big arm chair and my little long haired chihuahua comes and jumps on the chair and down the ipad goes to the floor.  It was not damaged and did not break but I decided to search for a cover.  Apples cover that was bought with it flopped open when it dropped so that cover is really useless.Back to this cover.  At first I didn't like it.  It had no instruction but I thought hey, just follow the hole openings on the ipad and it will fit.  But I left the foam insert in the cover and it was way tight.  I realized since the camera hole was not showing that that insert is to be discarded.  I don't really know why that big foam pad with a hole in the middle is in the case.  There is a magnet that closes the cover and puts the ipad to sleep.I don't really get the idea of the handle.  It seems out of place somehow.  If I wanted to use a handle it would be to carry it not to hold it in my lap.  When I did try to use the handle to hold the ipad my diamond wedding set got hung up and I nearly dropped the ipad. My advice is if you use the handle and wear jewelery be careful.  On the plus side of the case I feel much better having it on the Ipad because I can put it in my purse don't fear the screen getting scratched.  As I later learned no scratches but a broken glass caused by my dropping it an an inferior cover.UPDATE:Yes, I dropped the ipad and the screen broke in the top right corner.  I returned it to apple care for repair and that is a whole other story.  I have purchased an otterbox for the ipad since I know I can and will drop it. Had I have done what a friend recommended which is buy the otterbox I would not be out $250.00.  This case was no protection in this instance.  Here is the story on the apple care repair center.I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right. Here are the steps for repair. You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple. Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair. I say ok. I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass. They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired. I call apple care. They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things. After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it. I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back. I said for what. You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple. The moral to this story is forget their repair center. IT STINKS! I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait. That would have been a lot easier.
1	1355097600	This case does one thing well in that it holds the iPad mini securely in place.  However, there were too many things I didn't like about it:Functionality:1. The opening is cut too close to the upper left corner of the screen which causes problems with the iPad functionality at times.2. Neither of the standing positions is stable because of a lack of support in one section of the coverEsthetically:1. It has white stitching, not black as in the photo; I would have preferred black.2. It has a credit card holder.....what for?!3. The opening doesn't line up perfectly with the viewable screen area, which I found very annoying.4. It's a little bulkier than I would have liked.I ended up ordering a new cover - Bear Motion Premium Folio Case for iPad Mini - and I'm very pleased with it!
5	1355097600	Today I received this cover and I am so happy, that I can't stop myself writing this review about it. Initially, I was a little skeptical about buying it because of some Negative comments, but at the end of the day, I think I made the right choice.First of all, it's a great case for Price $12.95 and it fits well for Mini I-Pad. Perfect color, Black with White stitching. Sleep/Wake functionality works very well, can stand in 3 ways as you like for watching movies or Photo slide show. Has a pen with a small eraser on back for do all the things without touching I-Pad screen with your finger tips. Nice hand grip for reading purposes. Only one thing to notice, Case smells a bit due to Glue OR may be New Product smell, which will go away in a day or so, I bet. But I'm very happy with the case and would definitely recommend it.
5	1355097600	I bought this case for my IPad Mini. The following are my impressions after 2 weeks of use:1. Nice hard case with decent white accent stiching, looks very suave.2. Has 3 positions for holding the Ipad.3. Beautiful fit for the IPad. Perfectly aligned.4. Nice velcro lockin for the Ipad, very safe and no chance for the Ipad mini to fall off.All in all, very good value for the $12 I paid for it. I will recommend this for any Perspective IPad mini buyer. top Quality for the price.
5	1355011200	Great for running from meeting to meeting. Small to carry, functional to sit on table and use, and really like the additional pocket inside to carry along some cash for cafeteria as I move about the building.
4	1355011200	well made but the sleep/awake feature does not work.  I tried reajusting the mini in it but to no avail. Other than that it is really a nice cover, well made
1	1355011200	I loved the color, material and convenience of this cover. HOWEVER, it smelled awful and actually made my eyes burn. Big disappointment!
5	1355011200	Reasonable price for this quality case. My only suggestion is that instead of a credit card holder( really not necessary) there should be a pocket for a lens cleaning cloth. Other than that I highly recommend it.
4	1354924800	Great cover but the smart wake and sleep doesn't work which isn't a big issue for me, however it might be or someone else.
5	1354924800	Really surprised at how well this has worked out. For the price this has been above and beyond expectations. Would recommend this for anyone just looking for a decently priced case.  Also a plus it comes with a stylus and the pen actually works well.
4	1354838400	I think it is fine. It isn't featherlight, but it is sturdy and I like the hand grip on the back side a lot.You could pay a lot more for this.The stylus, though I don't use it often, works fine and is a ball point pen on the other end.The off/sleep button is a tad hard to get to but removing the stylus would solve that.Green light on this one.
5	1354838400	Perfect case for young teen who can be a lil' rough on electronics. Will like the auto / wake sleep feature , thehandle  a place for the pen.Much less expensive for all the other ones I've seen.I recommend this I pad mini cover, from i-BLAZON!
5	1354752000	Good price, good design. Stylus pen isn't so bad as some reviewers made it out to be. Best case with magnetic cover right now.
4	1354752000	This case is almost perfect, the only downside is that the few corners that remain uncovered started to get scuffs.Besides that little detail, it is a very good case
5	1354752000	I love this cover. It is perfect for the ipad mini and after looking at some of the covers in various stores, this one totally exceeded my expectations. The cover is of great quality, looks professional and fully envelopes the ipad so there is no way for it to fall out. It is so perfectly designed that the cut outs for the various buttons, camera etc are easily accessible and visible . The auto wake/sleep works great too. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an ipad mini cover.
5	1354665600	Very nice protective case for the iPad mini, much like a great book cover. I purchased the black one. It does not have black stitching like in the picture, the stitching is actually white, but the case still looks nice. I don't have a use for the stylus, but maybe others will. It's a nice bonus, I guess.I would recommend this product.
5	1354665600	I really did not expect alot from this case but boy it is pretty slick.  With business card holder and a slot to put your hand while reading, I actually love this case.  Even the leather (not sure if it is real or not) is really nice.  Recommended for sure as this is my main case.
3	1354665600	This case is okay in build quality but one of the feature it advertises from the picture is misleading. it depicts the iPad being held up in landscape mode with the pen at the top of the case. When attempting this  the iPad will fall flat on its face or fall backwards since there is only one notch at the back of the case. the case is also a little heavy but sturdy. Other than that the sleep function works and the case looks pretty decent.
4	1354579200	I gave 4 out of 5 stars only because the stylus pen that comes with the cover really does not work very well. I had to press the screen too many times in order for it to respond with the stylus. I'll continue to use my stylus I purchased from 5Below.I thought the cover did not fit properly at first, but then I realized I put the IPad in upside down. So the cover does fit perfectly. It holds the IPad very securely. The sleep/awake fuction works well (although I still don't get how it works). I like the band to hold the unit...it works really well when I use my IPad as a mobile payment device.
1	1354579200	The magnetic on/off does not work.  This does not work at all to prop up the mini like a stand.  The picture just lies.  When you hold it in your hand with the strap, nothing keeps it from flipping around on you.  I put this in the garbage.  I am very happy with the Moko.
4	1354579200	Good, solid cover. Stands ok but not great. Nice for the price. Would get it again if I needed to
4	1354579200	Perfect for My Ipad Mini!! I am just cutting 1 star for the stylus. The pen/Stylus is not that great.But the case it self is perfect. Loved it
5	1354579200	Fits perfectly! My IPAD fits securely inside and it all fits in my purse and it keeps my IPAD safe and secure!Pretty color too!
4	1354579200	This cover is solid, not flimsy compared to some. I don't use the kick stand often but it comes in handy when I do use it. The thing I like the most is the smart sleep feature when closing the cover and wake up feature when opening the cover.I would definitely recommend this case
5	1354406400	It comes with the stylus which can also be used as a pen.  I like the additional options for cards.  Color was perfect. Good value. Took me a long to time to receive through the mail.
5	1354406400	Was looking for the perfect cover for my Kid's iPad mini.  Looked at every brand and spent days considering the perfect one.  Many covers are better suited for adults and needed something more durable but fun for the kids and easy to use.  This was the only company that had a look like the kindle cover (tough hard cover) but had the sleep/wake function.  I think if they dropped it, it will be protected well.  I like the stylus pen option and the thoughtful design of the stretchy holder when you open the cover.  For the price, great deal and looks good.
4	1354406400	My wife needed a case for her new iPad Mini, and from the pictures this one looked to be a good fit.  I like how the pen has one end for using the iPad and the other end for paper.  The only down side is the loop the pen sits in is a little flimsy and the pen flips around a little bit.  I can now relax knowing that the iPad Mini had that extra needed protection.
4	1354320000	This is a great item for the price. Not fancy, not leather, but a great value. As far as the odor that others commented about... yes, there is an odor upon opening but did not smell anything after 2 days. I would recommend this item if looking for something to help protect your unit. The hand strap feature is very nice!
5	1354320000	Very pleased with the fit And quality of this cover.  The magnetic on and off works perfectly.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this cover for the iPad mini.
5	1354320000	This cover is FABULOUS. I was a bit hesitant at first, but when I received it, it was great. I think the best part was the elastic hand slit. I have an ipad 3 and my wife bought me a Tumi case, great item but after a while of holding it my hand gets tired and have to alternate hands. This slit makes life sooo much easier. I also live the stylus it comes with. Great item, recommended it to some friends and now they're buying too after seeing how convenient and handy this iPad Mini case is. Great job guys!!!
5	1354233600	I would recommend this cover as it is not slippery to handle, not plastic, feels good, works great. Cost was great. a little smell at beginning. Completely gone by now. Not sure what the other reviews' complaints
5	1354233600	I bought this for my wife to use with her Mini and she loves it.Quality and Workmanship is excellent.Great protection when carrying her iPad in her bag.Stylish, Functional and Useful.Price is outstanding, If purchased in the apple store you would be spending about 4 to 5 times more and it is still worth it.I would buy this for myself if I had an iPad mini and would recommend this to anyone.  Good buy for the iPad without spending apple store prices.
5	1354233600	The iPad Mini fits perfectly and securely and the functions are still easily accessible while in the case.  This case seems very well made and appears to be real leather.  Would buy again and strongly recommend.
5	1354233600	this leather case was half the price than the store wanted yet the full value for the money the stylus alone was worth the cost great case very satisfied fast delivery
1	1354233600	This product smells awful. I couldn't even use it. Every time I tried the smell gave me a headache. Plus, it doesn't stand up. Looks cute but that's it
5	1354233600	I just wanted a case to protect my iPad mini from daily use around the house--nothing fancy, nothing expensive. It's a simple design, stitching is good quality, material is good quality. Keeps it secure.
1	1354147200	This item smells horrible and does the stand does not work. YUCK! Don't waste your money! Four more words required :))
1	1354147200	I got this case about a week ago and have had nothing but problems since,the case does not stand up like it does in the pictures as the leather is to soft and just falls over. This case also causes issues with the wifi signal on my Ipad making it so it wont connect or loses connection constantly. The way this case is put together is also very cheaply made.
5	1354060800	I have the Snugg for my iPad , I recommend this to every one that owns iPad or mini iPad
5	1354060800	Both my wife and I love this case (we usually don't agree with each other).Great case, fantastic price, light weight, pretty-good protection.Initially, there was a slight odor (off-gassing) from new material, but it's not noticeable now (after ~3-weeks).Our 2-year old daughter has already dropped it, without incidence (so far).The iPad Mini is fairly-well protected in the case, with the case corners protruding slightly out to absorb a fall.The stand works great in 3 positions.We don't use the card holder, hand restraint, or stylus.Fantastic price for decent quality.****UPDATE****6-months later....Still love this case. We (including our 2.5-y.o. daughter) use it on a daily basis.  The case is holding-up well, still looks good, no damage, no stitching issues, no issues with top flap.  Still expect it to last a really long time.
3	1354060800	Everything is as shown in the pictures, color purple is true, slots are there. pen works nicely and the openings are where they are supposed to be. The only problem is the angle and lack of support. When you fold the cover back and put it on the desk in portrite mode, it is at a complete right angle there is no slant, which the screen needs for viewing and working. Also, it's to wobbly for using in horizontal mode and again, no slant.
4	1354060800	Just to avoid some confusion with other reviews, this is a synthetic leather case, and is not genuine leather (both the description on amazon and from iblason's website confirm this). The quality of the synthetic leather is really quite nice (comparable to genuine leather), it is thick and slightly spongy, and is very pleasant to handle. It did smell at first, but this isn't a surprise since it is synthetic and it came packaged in a plastic bag that held in the odor. As other reviewers stated, the sleep wake function works perfectly.This is my second case iPad mini case; My first one (a generic brand) didn't have good viewing angles, wouldn't stay locked into the stand feature easily, and was a cheap purchase that I made solely for protection (it was also sold conveniently right next to where I bought my ipad mini). It also lacked the sleep wake function. This case has a nice, steep viewing angle for watching movies- it's steep enough that if you are in a room with overhead lights you still won't see glare from them in most scenarios. The typing position is nice and shallow so I'm pretty satisfiedThe case does take a bit of breaking into, so far this has been a slow process (though I've only had it for about a week). To stand in the upright position without tipping over, you have to push down to flatten the spine- until the case is worn in the spine will want to stay curved and the ipad may tip back (there is no reinforced piece in the spine, only in the cover). This seems to be breaking in easily in less than a week.The low viewing angle is nice and shallow- it is good as a typing position. However, in one of the stock pictures it looks like the spine is propping up the ipad into a sturdy position- actually the ipad will sink down a little (as the spine is not reinforced, only the two front pieces are), so the viewing angle is a little shallower than what you see depicted. I don't mind so much and I can type just fine.The stylus is a good added bonus- I don't plan on using one too much, but now I have one and its the fancy pen/stylus type that everyone else seems to want. It works fine, has low resistance, and if iblason sold a pack of these for a few bucks I'd probably pick up a pack (though I prefer the non-pen version). But that's not why you are buying the case so it doesn't really matter.
5	1353974400	I ordered this in the pink and it is a much nicer case than I expected it to be. Appearance wise, it looks nicer and higher quality than I was expecting from the pictures. The stitching is pink and matches well with the rest of the case. The stylus/pen is slimmer than an average pen but the material that holds it is stretchy and can accomodate a normal pen if you want to switch it out.The ipad fits impressively well, I haven't had any trouble with the auto-wake function and there is no trouble plugging it in to charge with the case on. I use my ipad to do a lot of reading and I thought this case would make it less comfortable to do so, but it really hasn't. With the two interior slots for cards and the pen holder, it's great to take in place of an entire bag to a doctor's appointment, meeting, etc.The only downside I've found is that it is hard to use apps that have a small icon on the top left of the screen because the ipad does shift very slightly over time.
3	1353974400	the product is good.. very durable and the ipad feels safe.. the stylus however, is a big let down.. i literally have to press really hard to get a response from the ipad..was really looking forward to having a stylus with the ipad.
1	1353974400	I've had this item for about a week now, & I'm not happy with it because it doesn't stay standing up.  It has nothing to do with with the leather being stiff as the company told another customer.  Not only that, but when I do get it to stand after forcing it into a standing position, it doesn't stay & the iPad itself shifts and starts slipping down.  Sort of defeats the purpose.  I ordered this product to protect my new iPad mini and to have the option for it to stand.  I do not feel this product fulfills my needs.  I already ordered another one from a different company, & I'm looking into sending this one back.
4	1353888000	I love it but 1. It came way too late 2. It's a totally different pink its almost magenta which I wasn't expecting
4	1353801600	Update: I bought the case in November (rated it 5 stars) , now it's January and although there is still a lot to like, I have bought a second case...here's why: The I-blason has done some things very well. It has provided excellent protection, I love the bright, purple color and the auto wake/sleep function  has operated flawlessly for me. The stylus/pen has also come in handy. It is a little harder to make it stand up to watch a video, but I have been able to get it to stand everytime i've tried...just takes a few moments to get the cover to slip into the proper position. The one problem I've had which led me to buy a new case this week (Devicewear's Ridge) is that the I-pad mini has a very thin frame around its active screen, so any case like the I-Blason which has a frame that goes all the way around can end up covering up the top right corner of the screen. For game playing, video watching, and emailing this had no effect on the i-pad's functionality. However, when I'm browsing the web in portrait mode (which I tend to prefer) and need to scroll back and forth between screens there have been times I've had to remove the ipad mini in frustration because the back arrow is blocked by the frame of the case. This happened enough times that I did more research and learned that the cases with a plastic back that the ipad just snaps into, don't have this problem.Some more comparisions now that I have the two cases...Alhtough the I-Blason looks bulkier, when I weighed it on a postal scale it was actaully 0.3 oz LESS than the Devicewear product, even with the stylus attached. That surprised/impressed me.  The I-Blason's cover does have a slightly thicker, more leathery look.I do sometimes miss the handy strap that is on the I-Blason case, but I also like the very quick stand option with the Devicewear Ridge...setting it up to watch a video is instantaneous and you have 4 different angles at which to set the device.Overall, I will likely continue to use the I-Blason for when I'm travelling and more likely to be watching videos and playing games as opposed to web browsing.  The pen/stylus may come in handy in that case. At  home, where I often use it to check the web several times a day, I'll keep it in the Devicewear Ridge case.Fits the new mini ipad perfectly. I really like the strap, which makes it easier to hold.  It is very purple. The color is pretty close to how it looks online, however the interior suede section is more purple than the online photo which shows it as a pinker color. The auto wake/sleep function works well. Very pleased with this purchase.
5	1353715200	I am an executive that travels often.  This case is better than advertised quality-wise.  Professional looking, useful, functions very well.  I highly recommend.
5	1353715200	Love it with my mini. Just what I needed and it fits perfectly. Love the pen as well great bonus.
5	1353715200	This case is perfect for my mini. It fits nice and snug and offers plenty of protection. The sleep feature works nicely too. I've read other reviews mentioning the stitching color; I bought the purple and the stitching color is also purple. Overall, I highly recommend.
4	1353628800	It's hard to beat this case for the price.  It's very sturdy, fits perfectly (like a glove, but easy to take out and put in), protects the ipad from drops, and looks great.  The stand works fine and the stylus is nice.  For the price it's really hard to beat.  The cons is that it's hard to use the virtual keyboard as the space bar is kinda hard to hit with the flap so close to it.  Also when you close it, it doesn't always go into sleep mode.  But these are minor complaints overall.  It's a great case at a great price.  I feel like the ipad is protected when it's in the case and have no qualms about letting my kids run around with it while it's in this case.  Good little product.  Recommended!
5	1353628800	I ordered an iPad Mini and wanted a case for it as soon as it arrived.  The case arrivedquickly, and I am delighted with it. The fit and finish on this case is excellent! Everything linesup beautifully. The corners of the iPad show, but are protected by the front and back cornersof the case.  This case fits like a glove, and was obviously well thought out. The stylus is a nicebonus, and like many stylus out there - it has a working ball point pen on the opposite end ofthe soft tip - probably, if you have children too young to understand this, you should remove itfrom the case. I must say, now that the mini has been available for a few weeks, there are manycases available, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better case, and certainly a better value.
5	1353542400	I purchased the Apple smart cover but replaced it with this case. The quality of the case, pen and magnet are great for the price! The case shuts the iPad mini off which is great. I'd order another without hesitation.
5	1353456000	With a price you can't beat, this cover is exactly what I needed for my new mini.  It has all of the features of more expensive covers at a fraction of the price.  Cut outs for all of the external buttons, power connection, and cameras; plus a hand strap for holding while reading, a business or credit card holder, and a cover that elevates the mini for typing, and a combination pen/stylist.  The cover also has a sleep/awake feature that works perfectly.  What more could you ask for?
5	1353456000	I ordered through online, this cover is really perfect fit for IPAD Mini, and it has Wake & Sleep functionality, I recommend this cover to  others. Best price.
2	1353369600	I just received this and will be returning it. Build quality seems fine, but it's stiff and a bit thick. It would probably break in okay, but I don't need the pen holder and would like something lighter and more flexible that still covers both sides. I don't like the fake leather either.
5	1353283200	I love this case. The leather quality is amazing and feels like pure leather, even though it's synthetic. Fits snug on the ipad mini and holes/cutouts for camera, ports are in the right places. The stylus that comes along with the case is useful as well. I love that this case comes with a strap to slide your fingers through and hold the case + mini while reading, browsing etc. The stand position is relatively stable as well. I was able to sit the case in it's stand position and watch a hulu video for its entire duration without the case or mini falling over. The sticthing is white like another user mentioned, but it only lends to the nice look of the case instead of taking away from it. And the case is suprisingly light, which is a good thing since it doesnt make the mini any much bulkier to hold. The wake and sleep functionality works perfectly as well. The case has slots for credit cards etc. It's a useful feature to have for some.All in all - this is a great case to buy and use and the price cant be beat. I bought the black color since that was the only one available on prime one day shipping. I would definitely go back to the seller and buy another color as well.
4	1353283200	This is a great case, especially for the price.  The only reason I haven't given it a 5 star rating is because I have to be somewhat careful with the sleepwake function.  If it doesn't line up exactly right, it doesn't sleep the device but most of the time it's fine.  Other than that, I really like this case and you can't beat it for the price.  Delivery was fast via Prime and I've been using it for about ten days now.  I think I got one of the first ones so hopefully the sleep wake function has been tweaked a bit on a newer batch of these cases.
5	1353196800	Bought the Belkin cover. Returned it. $34. Bought the Snug, returned it $24. Got this cover. 1/2 the cost and it works great. No complaints and I got a free Stylus. Definitely worth the money.
4	1353110400	It's a better case than most and fits the i-pad mini well. Didn't really like the white stitching at first, but it's grown on me. The case works and does what it should, though the pen mechanism inside the stylus-pen fell apart after a couple of uses. I hope i-Blason will send me another (better) replacement stylus-pen.
1	1353024000	First off if I could give this ZERO stars I would.  I ordered this mini Ipad cover plus stylus to give as a birthday gift...when it arrived to my father-in-law he received a note that said the item we ACTUALLY ordered is not in stock and they have sent another cover in its place.  IT WAS A CHEAP COVER THAT WASN'T WORTH $5!!!  I am keeping in mind that the price on the cover I ordered is not expensive (that's why I choose it) but where was the email or phone call saying that this product was not in stock and here are the options for another color perhaps? DON'T ASSUME!!  So my father-in-law sent it back....it doesn't save me the EMBARRASSMENT though!!!Amazon....if it was your executive decision at the fulfillment center to just sent another product in its place because this was a GIFT then SHAME on you!!!You have all our information from our emails to our mobile numbers....use it!!!
5	1353024000	I am on a tight budget so I was looking for a case for my new iPad mini that did not cost too much but served my needs for protection and style.  I have had this case for about a week now and it is great.  The design and construction is solid and it looks and feels like genuine leather.  The magnets work every time to turn the iPad on and off. There is not much smell to the product, you have to hold it close to your face to smell it, and even then it is not unpleasant.  It also serves as a great stand when watching movies and video.  I am so happy with this purchase, I cannot imagine a better product for the money.
5	1353024000	Ordered this folio style cover for my new iPad Mini and didn't expect much for the price.  But I was wrong!  Real leather, nice stitching and quality throughout.  It even comes with a stylus/pen.  I'm very pleased with a great bargain.
5	1353024000	Good product the saver went on easy and with no bubbles don't hesitate to order cut outs were also in the correct spot
5	1352937600	Just recieved this product a few days ago and I must say this is a great case. The Ipad mini fits snuggly and securley, you also have easy access to all buttons and ports on the mini. The matariel feels very durable yet not super thick as to take away from the "mini" concept. The stylus pen is of high quality. Overall great product, and for the price is a steal, would recommend.
5	1352937600	I ordered two different cases and tried a few at Best Buy that just didn't cut it as far as the fit and security of the product. So maybe I got a little excited whenever this showed up and it fit my iPad mini perfectly. Maybe I ran down the street and celebrated, too (okay, THAT didn't happen).It is a very nice, leather-like portfolio case. Whenever I had one of these for my regular-sized iPad, this was my traveling case. It does add a little bulk to the iPad mini, as do most cases. But, this thing is guaranteed to protect your iPad mini great.The wake/sleep functionality works nicely and it folds down very nicely for typing. The stylus holder is a nice touch but the stylus/pen combo is a little cheap and light. It didn't bother me as I already have a very nice pen/stylus combo so the holder was just a nice convenience.This case is perfect for carrying around. You can throw it in your car passenger seat or put it in in the pocket of an airplane seat.One note, the stitching on the edges of the case is an off-white instead of black like the pictures show. It looks exactly like the one in the video review which is what I was anticipating anyway.Overall, this is the best of the early iPad mini cases and the price is right.
2	1352851200	I purchased this as I didn't want to spend more until more choices were on the marked with good reviews. I chose this and it was delivered promptly. What I didn't expect even though it was a low price was the smell. It smelled gross..similar to a new shower curtain. It took several days for it to go away and when holding the case, even my hands smelled. It does look kind of cheap and even if it didn't smell...I wouldn't use it.  If you have kids...the free stylus is a real pen and you need to make sure someone doesn't write on the face of the ipad. The upper left hand corner covers one of the spots that you need to get in often to close out windows and etc. But if I was to actually use it...I would just cut a little piece away in that area and the rest of the ipad is accessable.
4	1352764800	When I told my wife I was getting her an iPad mini, she was excited and immediately went case shopping. This was the first case she found and, while she kept looking, she never managed to find one that she thought was as stylish. When I looked at it, I thought it looked just like the purple version of my own iPad 2 case. (Case Crown)She really likes this case, and so do I. She loves the color and that it comes with a stylus. I like how strong the magnet is. It keeps it from opening from in her purse.My only complaint is the same as my own, that it doesn't cover the corners at all, which lessens the protection, but allows the iPad to show off the nice shiny aluminum backing. Curse and a blessing, I guess.
5	1352764800	Having just returned another brand of case made prior to the iPad Mini's debut, and incorrectly cut for fit around screen, I was reluctant to try another brand I wasn't familiar with. (but) based on the excellent reviews here which I often use to decide about making a purchase, I ordered this I-Blason leather case for the new iPad Mini.It arrived today 11/13 and I have to say, it is perfect in fit, quality of construction and the sleep/wake feature is working perfectly.I had previously purchased a Snugg case very similar in design to the I-Blason for an iPad 3 which while costing over 2X the price of this case, was almost exactly the same in design, function and appearance. I was preparing to place an order for the Snugg iPad Mini case for $24.99 plus shipping, and can honestly say this I-Blason case is going to be every bit as good as I'm certain the Snugg would have been and at 1/2 the cost.The case is snug on the iPad Mini which is good so that there's no movement of the screen within the face portion cut out for the glass display. The cutout is fairly close to the glass edge all around and thus leaves little for movement of the Mini in the case to assure 100% of the display is always exposed. I'm very confident this case will hold it's form and not have any issues with distortion or looseness as it begins to wear.All of the cutouts are perfectly aligned as well including the dock port, buttons, speakers and camera lens.This IS a -leather- case and not synthetic material. It should wear extremely well due to that.In summary, if you are worried about an iPad Mini case that again, like so many cases that came out early November and who tried to beat the Mini's debut while guessing at it's dimensions and were incorrectly designed, be very confident that this case will fit your Mini and also work w/ the sleep/wake function.With new stock arriving (mine was from the last new stock received (as Amazon was out-of-stock with this for about a week) you can be assured you are getting the most current case of this model.Why pay more as this case does the job so very well and is priced extremely fair given it's quality. (and i-Blason even includes a pen/stylus with this case at no charge!)
5	1352764800	I go this prior to seeing a lot of reviews, but the one that was there sounded encouraging.  It is perfect for the Mini, and I have no problems.  In response to one reviewer who mentioned the magnets do not turn the device on/off, make sure when you close it, that the sections are aligned correctly.  If they do not close square, a magnet may be off. In any event, at this price it would not be a deal breaker. Camera, earphone, Lightning, power, volume, and rotate controls are all easily accessed when the case is on. It comes with a pen, and pen holder. The pen is also a stylus, and it seems to work well. The stand feature slips in to hold the Mini in landscape orientation. There is no portrait stand , but there is a hand strap which works well in portrait mode.To sum it up, this is a 5 star bargain. Would buy it again in a heartbeat.Have been using this daily for about a month, still love it.
1	1352678400	It's difficult to find THE perfect case for a new product. I went through the case picking process with all of my iPads 1-3. So with the iPad Mini, I've done the same. This one looks good but I've returned it to Amazon because the magnets to open and close the Mini worked sporadically, apparently because there is NOT a good fit. Moreover, the stand isn't engineered correctly so it easily tips over. This one needs to go back to the drawing board. I wouldn't order it until they get enough complaints and returns to straighten out the defects.
4	1352592000	Just got the case yesterday. It is light and the iPad mini works just fine in it.The only thing minus about it is that the sleep function did not seem to work right. After playing with it found out when one closes the cover it has a tendency to not line up with the cover below but goes beyond it. Have a cover from Moko from Amazon for nexus 7 with wake feature and it works fine. The reason for this is grove or crease in the corners so the cover aligns perfect every time. Other then that the case is great and shut off just fine if I'am carful to line up the cover just right it works perfectly.
5	1352505600	I was extremely shaky about buying this iPad mini case. There was only one review that came out very early and I was not familiar with the company at all. I received this item today (8 days after order) And its freaking amazing. I'm so satisfied. Granted I've only used it for 30 minutes but its simply not cheap. You can tell its something that is going to last. I'm so glad I made this purchase. I want another one! (Even though I'll probably never need it) But this type of quality for this price is a steal. Auto Sleep AND Wake works flawlessly for me. I honestly expected it not to work but it worked out perfectly. I'm glad I took a chance on this. This is all I need for my iPad mini. Well, not all I need because I also got an i-BLASON removable screen protector. It's amazing but I'm going to have to do a separate review on that.
5	1352419200	Hopefully this might help if your still leary about getting this product.I just got mine and it came in record time. I ordered mine on the 5th and received it on the 9th. I ordered the magenta and its really pretty. If you love pink like me then this is the case for you. While waiting for mine to arrive in the mail I have been looking at other cases from Best buy and Sams club, only place here that had them. They were all cheaply made and I would not depend on those for protection. They only covered the corners with a rubber piece that the ipad mini could easily fall out of. Plus they were all ugly colors. This case from i-blason is really nice and very well made. It fully covers the ipad mini and protects the edges in case of accidental dropping. The smart sleep feature works perfect and all things line up properly so none of the buttons or speakers are covered up. Plus the price was very reasonable. Those other cases that were poorly made wanted over $30 for them. I paid less then $20 including shipping and I am happy with my case.
5	1352332800	I just received in the mail my i-Blason case for iPad mini and I will say that I am extremely happy with my purchase. The shipping for this item was very fast on the regular shipping method. The case is great. I bought it in advance since I don't even have my mini yet. So now I'm ready for it when ever best buy gets next shipment. The magnets on the case work even without the ipad inside... I was not expecting that. The included pen/stylus does not seem to be very good quality but it writes awesome and the sylus part of it also works great on the screen of my iphone 4s. Too bad it seems I could break it anytime by accident. Bottom line, very happy with this case!
4	1352332800	Everything is good except the auto wake-sleep function doesn't work sensitively sometime, otherwise I will give 5 stars. Or somebody can give me some advice or tricks on how to use it?
4	1352332800	Product seems good, mini fits snug buttons on the top and side are a little hard to use now but nothing to worry about. Pen/stylus is a nice touch and it doesnt seem terrible cheap.  4 stars only because of the button issue so far.
5	1352332800	I keep waiting for their to be a catch but this case is really awesome. Can't figure out how they selling it so cheap. Very happy with this purchase.
5	1352246400	After many iPad cases, all being abandoned because they just did not do the job, I took a chance on this because the price was great and I needed quick coverage for my new mini iPad.  It came today and it is the best case I have ever had.  Quality and function as well as slim profile that does not take away from the mini's small form factor.  I love it!!i-BLASON Apple iPad Mini 7.9 Inch Auto Wake / Sleep Smart Cover Leather Case (Elastic Hand Strap, Multi-Angle, Card Holder ) With Bonus Stylus (Multi-Color to Choose From) 3 Year Warranty - Black
4	1352246400	I purchased the i-BLASON case for my iPad Mini. It is a really sharp case.  The fit is excellent! The pictures in the ad are inaccurate. This case has white stitching (not black as depicted in the picture); I'm taking one star off for that. The case comes with a stylus/pen. It is of mediocre quality but I was not expecting anything great.  The fact that a stylus is included is a bonus. Shipping was fast and the product was brand new and in perfect condition. For $12.99 this is a great value. It complements the iPad Mini, protects the device, the smart wake-sleep function works flawlessly. I'm very happy with the case and would definitely recommend it.  Just remember that the stitching is WHITE, not black.
