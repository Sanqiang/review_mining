1	1406073600	Bought this a while ago. My child had an accident last night and it soaked right though the &#34;protector&#34;
5	1405296000	I got this mattress because I have a seven month old and a brand new mattresse those two things do not work well together. I've used this mattress protector for under a month so I've just washed it a few times and it's held up great so far.. It fit my 12&#34; mattress perfectly and the biggest plus is that you don't hear or feel the protector once it's on and under the sheets! I don't notice a difference in comfort at all sleeping with our without the protector.
5	1405296000	My daughter is a bed wetter, and this completely protected the mattress from any wetness. I'd recommend this to anyone.
5	1405209600	My kitty likes to pee on the bed but this has protected my mattress very well!  Now I just lock her out of the room though...
5	1405123200	excellent product
2	1405123200	Very thin pad. Not what I was expecting at all
4	1405123200	Love it! I had a small spill of juice and it never made it to my mattress topper.  I has a soft top layer and the under layer of plastic protective layer.  Awesome service.  I received it within the guaranteed Prime time frame.
5	1405036800	This is a great matress pad.  Unlike other waterprood pads this one is soft and doesn't make a krinkle noise or feel like you a laying on a thick piece of plastic. It fits my oversized queen matress just fine.  I have purchased similar matress pads in the past for double the cost of this one.  I am very happy with my purchase.
5	1405036800	We bought this for our toddlers 12&#34; foam mattress. It's very thin & fits nicely on her mattress. So far it's saved the mattress from a bloody nose & 1 pee accident. I washed and dried and after 2 washes it's still holding up. So far so good for the price. I like how it doesn't crinkle or feel plasticky. I may order a 2nd for backup.
5	1405036800	I bought this in twin for my son's bed and queen for our bed. The mattress protector we had was very loud and crinkly, and the backing started to melt after one time through the dryer. These are sooooo much better! You can't feel or hear a difference from just sleeping on a sheet.
5	1405036800	Fits great on the mattress. Feels really nice in terms of the material, not crinkly or 'plastic like'. Haven't had to test the waterproof aspect of it as little one hasn't yet had an accident but will update when it occurs. Overall good product at a good price!
5	1405036800	It's perfect and just a fraction of the cost the Big Box retailer was trying to tack on as an add-on item while completing my new bed purchase. High quality, affordable cost, great purchase.
4	1405036800	Good quality, easy fit, not too bulky, 10 year warranty..
3	1405036800	Feels like I'ma  child sleeping on this pad, it's definitely waterproof but feels like a rubber pad.  Not what I expected.
5	1405036800	works like a charm. I'm glad I reviewed the results of this protector, &#34;Great&#34; !
5	1405036800	I like the way it fits and there has not been any accidents.
5	1405036800	This really works. I had one just like it in a different brand but eventually the waterproof lining started to peel off of it. Looking back I think that was my fault. I didn't know how to wash it properly. Sometimes I used bleach, sometimes I dried it by itself. But I learned. The Hanna Kay protector has held up very nicely. I still machine wash it, but only with soap, no bleach. And I dry it with sheets, on low or medium. So far no problems in the year and a half I've been using it. It has saved my mattress from more spills and messes then I ever thought I would need it for. I have become very attached to this and it must go on my bed every time I change the sheets.
5	1404950400	The product fit perfectly onto my bed and it is thin and soft so you can't even feel it through a fitted sheet. Perfect! Recommend to anyone who needs a quality mattress protector.
5	1404950400	Perfect
5	1404950400	Durable bed cover.  I use it on my 2 year old daughters mattress and it has been removed and washed several times.  No rips or tears.  No noticeable wear since purchase.  Still fits the mattress very well.  The bed cover cleans easily in the wash with no stains as of yet.
5	1404950400	We have two of these and they are great.  Our cat has peed on our bed a few times, and before we had these protectors it was really difficult to clean.  This completely protected our mattress.  It doesn't make the bed feel any different and there is no noise.  It is easy to wash and a great price.
5	1404950400	Needed something that is waterproof and yet has a cotton top for comfort.
5	1404864000	Great product - great service!
5	1404864000	Fast service, product as expected, thank you
5	1404864000	Didn't smell. I bought one for queen and king mattresses and they fit perfectly. Is a little rough but once you put a sheet over it. It's not a big deal.
3	1404864000	I should have read the detailed description more carefully. So, I suppose it is my own fault that this product is not at all what I wanted. However, rather than go through the hassle of returning it, I will probably use it to protect my mattress and buy an actual mattress pad to put on top of it. It's polyurethane with a cotton terry surface. I should have known or paid more attention, but the only part I read was 100% cotton.
4	1404864000	Great for general protecting of the top of the mattress, I can see that if some liquid got on the side that it would soak onto the mattress due to the waterproof layer only covering the top of mattress. It will stop a good little bit of liquid from ruining and staining the mattress, especially when in the middle of bed. I used some stain remover on one stain from a fluid and I washed it as directed and itHeld up great. The top feel is kind of like a cheap towel (not very adsorbent) so I can also see if there is too much liquid it would possibly go over the side. The sides have deep pockets and I do not hear the waterproof layer if I have a fitted sheet over it, but just laying on the cover you will hear something when you move. But overall its great for what a 20 year old couple needed to keep thier mattress clean.
4	1404777600	Absolutely no complaints. Arrived quickly and it worked with our foam mattress that we just bought. Thanks!
4	1404777600	Somewhat thin feel to it but the elastic sides are deep enough for even the thickest eurotop padded mattress. Can't vouch for water protecting ability but will update once it is tested.
4	1404777600	It's...ya know...a mattress protector.  It protects my mattress...It also fits.
5	1404777600	I'm very pleased with the mattress cover. It's deep enough to fit over the Sleep Number bed. Its soft terry doesn't crackle when I move around.
5	1404777600	As advertised,  love it!
5	1404691200	Comfortable and quiet.  Can't even tell it's there!
4	1404691200	so far so good. I read a couple reviews that said it made a crunchy sound, but it really doesnt make a sound at all.
5	1404691200	Much cooler, and more hygienic than my old vinyl/plastic zippered mattress protector.  Plus, it takes the place of both my old mattress protector and my old polyester mattress pad.  Longer sides and strong elastic around the bottom to hold underneath the mattress.  Definitely worth the price.
5	1404691200	I bought this for my parents, who are very pleased with it. Excellent product (does what it's supposed to do), excellent price, excellent service.
5	1404691200	Good quality, reasonable price, and does what it meant to. The product even easily fits over my tall (height wise) pillow-top mattress. Had this for months and no complaints on my end, so if you are looking for a decent mattress protector, get this one.
4	1404691200	Great product.  We often sleep with our little one and have had leaks and spit ups. Our mattress is just fine.
4	1404691200	Good value, seems to be quality construction
4	1404691200	delivered on time, works really well and is barely noticeable (very thin and makes a little noise)
4	1404604800	does the job and no noise.
5	1404604800	We purchased this product for our new King mattress. It is soft and quiet and fits the mattress good.  I am highly satisfied with this product and if/when I need a mattress protector in the future, I will buy another.  Good price and good product.
4	1404604800	This cover gets the job done. We got two to rotate when we need to change the sheets on 5 year old's bed.
5	1404518400	Great fit on our queen size mattress...ample room. So far we love it!
5	1404518400	Fits nice - no complaints
5	1404518400	This was a great product for a great price - exactly what I wanted for our new mattress. I'm very happy with this purchase!
5	1404432000	Soft, terry-like feel. They actually work, too!  We have a new puppy, and there have been accidents in the bed, but the mattress isn't touched.  Also, no creepy vinyl noise. I plan to keep these on every mattress I have from now on!
1	1404432000	I think this mattress protector is horrible. I am going to return it.
5	1404345600	Absolutely love this mattress protector! I was worried about it being too noisy, but you can't even tell that it's on the mattress. It doesn't disturb our sleep at all.
5	1404345600	Perfect fit
5	1404345600	This is a high quality mattress protector.  I looks and feels exactly like the one a purchase from RTG for $59
5	1404345600	I like this protector because it has fabric on the top to make it soft but is still water proof underneath.
3	1404345600	Didn't fit as well but then I was putting it on the thinner bunk bed foam mattress.Grand daughter said it wasn't bad but I just didn't think it had the amount of filling I would like.BUT a very good value for the money if in need of a waterproof mattress protector.
5	1404259200	GREAT PRODUCT ....GOT IT QUICKLY
5	1404259200	This is a very nice mattress protector.  When I received it, I had to look at the order on Amazon to make sure it was waterproof because it did not seem like the old fashioned plastic mattress protectors.  This one is like terry cloth.  Very soft.  The only draw back was I couldn't find it on the packaging to see if it was waterproof until I looked closer.
5	1404259200	Already had 2 accidents on this & have washed it 3 times now. It has held up well so far & nothing has seeped through to the mattress. So far so good!
4	1404259200	Product was just as described. Very happy with it and with your fast service. Thank you, Nancy Nelson
5	1404259200	I love the quality of this mattress protector.  It came quickly......very happy with my purchase.
5	1404259200	Nice cover. Soft and waterproof. Needed to protects mattress from kids accidents when they sleep over
5	1404259200	This product is exactly what I needed. I love that it does not make sleeping hot and it does not feel like plastic like some of the other waterproof ones.
4	1404259200	Good mattress protector. Good delivery.
4	1404259200	It is not completely quiet, but it isn't as loud as I expected.  I haven't had any spills on it to test how leak proof it is.  This is replacing one that got destroyed in our dryer.
5	1404259200	thank you!
5	1404259200	This does the trick!
1	1404172800	This worked fine the first few times my child had an accident, but I'm writing now after removing it to find a soaking wet mattress underneath.  Not waterproof after all.
5	1404172800	received product--been using it on my child's bed for a couple months and it works! it works better than the others I have used and it has a soft top--not  plastic sounding or feeling. if you sit on the bed--there's no sound.
5	1404172800	Wonderful product.  Just as described. Fast shipping.
5	1404172800	I haven't had good luck with mattress protectors for our guest room. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but wanted one that would provide a little padding on the top and wash well. I have washed this once and so far so good.  I would buy at his one again.
5	1404172800	Got these covers to replace another brand that kept slipping off.  These are well made and don't easily slip off.
5	1404172800	Our dog got sick on our new, expensive Tempurpedic mattress and this protector did its job, thank goodness!  It fits well, washes completely clean and does not interfere with the feel/performance of the mattress.
5	1404086400	I bought one for my daughter's bed and liked it so I bought two more for my son's bed.  They are soft terrycloth (no plastic crunchy sounds), and I can wash and dry them easily.  So far, so great.  I've washed and dried them at least 5 times so far with no problems, still water proof.  Thank goodness!
5	1404086400	This was purchased as a gift for my grandson.  The protector arrived on time and was well packaged.  As to the quality or any recommendation, I have no idea.  I have one of these on my bed about three years old and it has held up fine and I have no complaints.
5	1404086400	I was so please with this product I bought a 2nd one! Washes up nice! You'd never know your sleeping on a mattress cover.
5	1404000000	I own a king tempur pedic.  Tempur's mattress protecter retained heat and cost 100 bucks, and finally ripped/melted somewhat in the dryer.This thing is inexpensive, has not melted or ripped on me.  Protects the mattress from my night sweats.Would recommend.  Owned 8months, still going strong.
4	1404000000	I saw some very underwhelming options at my local big-box stores, so I took to Amazon for better options. This works great on my foam mattress and I can now sleep easy knowing that the cup of coffee I will inevitably spill on it won't stain.
3	1404000000	It's OK but it is not what I ordered.  Packaging had no instructons andnothing about Dust Mites which was the product I ordered.
5	1404000000	I've gone through several mattress covers in the past and this has lasted me the longest hands down!!!I sleep with my miniature dachshund just about every night and for the most part he's pretty good about waking me up in the morning if he's gotta go. Sometimes i'm just dead to the world and the poor pup has an occasional accident. Not too often, but once is enough to merit a mattress cover/protector. Regretfully, I've bought some that don't quite stand the test of time and it's cost me dearly. I figured, since I'll buy just about everything off of amazon, they've got to have a pretty decent cover and i was right! I sleep on a queen-size bed if that matters, but I have not had a single issue with this product in well close to a year now.The one thing I will say is follow the laundry instructions closely. as harsh chemicals or temperatures can damage the protective lining. All around five stars, I am thoroughly impressed with this product.
5	1404000000	saved my new mattress many times from my 2 small kids
5	1403913600	I ordered this mattress pad based on the reviews I read from others. I am glad I did. It is pretty quiet and didn't have that nasty smell right out of the package. I haven't needed the waterproof feature, but I'm confident that, if needed, it will work as described. Shipping was quick and the price was fair.
4	1403827200	I've only had this product for one month, but so far, it has met my expectations.  I do recommend it.
5	1403827200	Great mattress pad. It breathes well but protects the mattress from toddlers. I am pleased it washes and drys well too. Much better than others we've tried.
5	1403740800	Product was received ahead of time and it covers the mattress completely. We've been using it for the last monthand it appears to do what it was advertised for. We also put hypoallergenic pillow cases on. I haven't had any allergyproblems as of yet. Thanks so much,JK
5	1403740800	Great quality for the price.
5	1403654400	My child spilt a cup of milk in our bed a week after putting this mattress cover on our bed.  Not one drop went to the mattress.  I would buy this product again.
5	1403654400	The Hanna Kay Premium 100% waterproof mattress protector is a great product.  I wasworried that it might be too &#34;hot&#34; and not breathable to sleep on, but I have not evennoticed a difference since putting it on my own bed and on my guestroom bed also.My recent house guest did not comment that it was too hot, so I am assuming thatit was not detectable to her either.Would recommend this product.
4	1403654400	Pleasantly surprised that it didn't have that crinkly plastic backing most waterproof pads have.  It fits our queen mattress nicely and doesn't bunch.
5	1403654400	This Hanna Kay Premium 100% Waterproof Mattress Protector replaced a $100 cover when the zipper broke and repeated washings could not make it fit the bed properly. We were always feeling lumped up fabric underneath us from that one, so it was time to make a change.We ordered this and it was at our door a couple of days later. It fits so well...just snug enough and has a nice feel to it. Per the instructions, you should definitely wash it prior to use. I read some reviews that mentioned it was rough, but I can assure you, this isn't the case. It's as soft as it needs to be and you are supposed to put the fitted sheet over it anyway, so it seems a moot point.I haven't tested it's waterproof qualities, but if that was a special concern of yours, then you would be better off buying a complete mattress cover that fit all sides and zipped closed.Overall, this pad is perfect for our needs.
1	1403654400	This mattress cover was, hands down, the hottest one I have ever slept on. We woke up in a pool of sweat every single night, and it completely negated our expensive cooling gel mattress. This cover was thin, light, quiet and it did have deep pockets to fit our deep mattress, but other than that, it was a complete failure. It's features are described as &#34;breathability dissipates body heat and maintain a comfortable sleeping temperature&#34; but this could not be further from the truth. The plastic lining makes you feel like you're sleeping on top of a plastic garbage bag all night. Do yourself and your guests a favor and skip this one.
5	1403568000	I purchased this product and came on time. Be sure to wash it before using it as instructions state. Great item
5	1403568000	This is a great value with a wonderfully luxurious feel. I let it air out in a room with the windows open for 48 hours and it smelled fine.
5	1403568000	I ordered one of these a few yrs ago and it's done it's job perfectly! So perfectly that i now ordered more for other beds in the house. I'm super impressed with how much liquid can be spilled on it and it doesn't leak thru onto the mattress. A+++
5	1403568000	We LOVE this! We needed it &#34;just in case&#34; for the grandbabies when they stay overnight. This is waterproof but does NOT have a &#34;plasticy&#34; feel and it is totally silent. I can't think of any negatives about this item. If you are fearful of a plastic noisy mattress pad, don't worry about this one.  :-)
5	1403481600	Nice product.  Meet expectations. Fit the the mattress it was ordered for.  Would recommend this product to people looking for a quality mattress cover.
3	1403395200	Not exactly top quality. Might be worth the money spent, I hope. Will wash a few times to see if it holds up.
5	1403395200	This mattress protector is very easy to get on the bed and we're able to throw it right in the wash with the rest of our sheets! Highly recommend!
4	1403222400	I like this product.  It's soft, it provides good protection, and it's not crinkly even though it's waterproof.I would recommend it.
4	1403222400	After looking and shopping for several days for a mattress pad, this one was the best in my opinion. So far it has not disappointed! I also purchased a foam mattress cover, got the mattress pad for this foam cover. It is meeting expectations so far.....
3	1403222400	It definitely absorbs a lot but the mattress still feels damp after my son pees. I would not buy this mattress pad again.
1	1403222400	I bought 2 of these for my toddler's bed for nighttime accident protection. Less than a year down the road, both of them leak. We now have a smelly stained mattress. And that 10 year warranty that's mentioned? Can't find any info online about the manufacturer or how to contact them. So the warranty is pretty useless.
5	1403136000	I am very pleased with my mattress protector. It very similar to a product I purchased 10 years ago and have not been able tongued since. It is marvelous as a mattress protector but much smaller and less bulky than most products. I love it!
5	1403136000	Sent quickly and as described.  Two thumbs up!  I would recommend this to a friend for sure.  Sturdy and strong.
5	1403136000	Great product. Will buy another soon, it works great and it fits perfectly. Also easy to wash and dry.  Thank you
3	1403049600	Serves the same purpose as a fitted sheet. It's very soft on the top. But it's a really THIN material. I was expecting something that would cover the top and bottom side of the mattress. No odor from the product. But for the price, really not worth it, just buy an extra fitted sheet.
4	1403049600	This is a great waterproof protector cover.  Fits very well on my mattress and also holds beds sheets very well. This will protect you mattress from absorbing sweat, and other accidents more often happens by kids.
5	1402963200	I bought one of these for my bed and a second one for the futon. They fit nice and snug and they wash up very nicely. I got them for protection for when the little grandkids come over. They have accidents and they spill. Now no worries, all is covered and I don't have to worry.
5	1402963200	We loved it...it was thin so it didn't interfere with sheets and it was durable.  So far it seems to be great!
5	1402876800	I have asthma. And I want to protect my expensive mattress from spilled liquid and food and other stuff. I really like this cover. I do not perspire as much as it is thicker and a better quality from my previous waterproof mattress protectors.  It washes well. As usual it takes longer to dry, however, I am not adverse to hanging it over a chair or draping it through several hangers to air dry if I need the dryer sooner.  And the price is right!
5	1402876800	This is my first Hanna Kay - it washes/dries easily - no plastic crinkle noise - soft terry surface - deep fitting for mattresses
5	1402876800	I got this  because my kid has late night Accidents. Its easy to put on and take off, the top is soft, and its keep the mattress dry.
1	1402790400	Bought this for my son's twin bed to protect his foam mattress from nighttime accidents. It felt nice enough, and wasn't plasticy and crinkly like others. BUT THE PEE GOES RIGHT THROUGH.This is NOT waterproof. it might protect from sweat or minor things, but this DOES NOT protect from accidents. The mattress is now stained, and smells. &#34;100% waterproof&#34; is 100% LIE.
5	1402704000	this one was a gift but I had purchased one for myself and it is an excellent product, Meets all my needs.Fits snug with plenty of room for my deep mattress
5	1402704000	Bought this mattress protector for our family member who can have bed accidents. Good quality and does not make the sounds that most other mattress protectors do. Looks like it will last a long time.
5	1402704000	I had high hopes for this waterproof pad and was not disappointed. I have an older dog who is starting to have incontinence issues. She is SO happy to resume sleeping on my bed. I was also pleased that it easily fit deep mattress. It seems to be very well made.
3	1402704000	It is a lot more flimsy than I expected. Time will tell if it holds up. I really wanted a watterproof mattress pad and dhould have bought that for a more plush feel. Unfortunately, when i searched online for the pad, it pulled up this product instead.
5	1402617600	I bought this for my new mattress.  I have used them before and am confident of their protection as long as you follow the washing directions.  No bleach!
5	1402531200	We bought this mattress protector because our daughter sometimes sleeps in bed with us and wets the bed.  I was worried that it would feel like we were sleeping on a plastic sheet, but it doesn't at all.  It seems very well made and durable as well.
4	1402531200	Recently bought this. It fits my queen size mattress well. The materials seem a bit thin, which makes me question the long term durability. However, only time will tell with this.Overall, I'm very happy with it.
5	1402531200	I have two major considerations for this product, two things I need it to do- to protect from liquid damage and to be quiet and not &#34;squeaky&#34;. This product does both of those things well. It fit our bed nicely, stays in place, and doesn't make noise when we toss and turn.
5	1402444800	I'm very happy so far with my recent purchase of the Hanna Kay Premium mattress protector; I'm sleeping like a baby.
5	1402444800	This mattress protector is very high quality.  It's totally waterproof.  It's not hot to sleep on as some mattress covers can be.  It's very comfortable.  And a great price!
5	1402444800	Ordered this for our new queen size mattress. I washed it before putting it on the bed and it fit perfectly. Stays on the mattress well.
5	1402444800	This is exactly what I was looking for! The top portion is quilted for comfort and underneath is the waterproof layer, the fitted sides are elastic mesh and fit snuggly on the bed.  Haven't had to wash it yet  but I'm not expecting any problem.
5	1402444800	Works as described.  We have a memory foam pad under the mattress cover and it easily fits over foam and our mattress.
5	1402272000	This mattress protector has protected my mattress for over a year and it has proved to me that it was worth the money. Every night, my bed feels just as wonderful as the night before, thanks to this wonderful protector.
5	1402099200	This bad boy rocks! Great quality, well made, and should last many moons! I love the terry cloth cover, and that it's water proof. Just sayin'..
5	1402012800	This is just a great item!  I have one against the mattress and the newer one over the top of the bedding (I have a stray cat who likes to mark things).  I used to buy just plastic sheets to put over the bedding, but my dogs had a riot tearing them to shreds, so I went with this wonderful product!  Stands up to all sorts of animal abuse, an easy fit, and certainly one of the best bedding choices I've made in a long time!
5	1401926400	This is a quality product.  Have already had a baby making liquid messes all over the bed and the protector stop all liquid from getting on the mattress.  Would buy again.
1	1401840000	Does not work. I used it on my son's bed (he is two). Last week he wet is bed at night and it went right through the cover! Do not buy this cover if you intend to use it for little kids.
5	1401840000	I have been looking for quality mattress protectors for an upscale vacation rental property. I bought three of these mattress protectors and they fit great!  Easy to put on the beds because they are like fitted sheets, with elastic corners, and are waterproof, too!  I just hope my guests don't take them home.  My order was filled promptly and arrived in perfect condition.  I plan to order more for my home.  Thanks for a great product at a reasonable price!
5	1401753600	Quick delivery, low price, no hassle.  This was for a spill-proof mattress pad.  For our son.  Not for me.  Don't look at me like that!
5	1401753600	VERY PLEASED WITH MY MATTRESS PROTECTOR MADE MY MATTRESS FEEL SOFTER AND THERE ISNT ANY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TO SHEET AND THE PROTECTOR BEFORE I USED TO FEEL THE MATTRESS BUT NOW I DONT IT IS SOFT
5	1401753600	soft and not at all rubbery or crunchy, this works like a dream. i highly recommend this and will be buying an extra.
5	1401753600	I had something similar to this last year and it leaked.  This one works.  I got rid of my vinyl cover and my bed is cooler.Good purchaseUpdate7-13-2014I use this as a water barrier between my air mattress and the memory foam.Doesn't work.  After several months there is this alien life form under the memory foam.Went back to vinyl.
5	1401753600	item offers an affordable and sturdy option for protecting your mattress. It is thin enough to where you dont have that uneven padding under your sheets but sturdy enough to handle and protect any issues that might arrive. Satisfied indeed.
5	1401753600	This protector is easy to put on, quiet, and I did not notice any packaging smell when I put it on. It wraps over my large pillow top mattress easily and does not slide around. I am pleased.
5	1401667200	There have been people complaining about this being noisy. I washed as instructed - no problems. It does not smell, it does not make noise. Whoever said this had to be using it as the fitted sheet for their bed/ only way it makes any noise.  I have a memory foam mattress and it does just fine.
5	1401667200	I've used this cover to help insure protection for my Dog ('was sick & Since has passed, at almost 15 yo). It helped a lot!!. Now  I'm depending on it for any possible (& Inevitable!) Puppy training mishaps : Ty Hanna Ky Premium for the security  and peace of mind :)
5	1401667200	I have a couple of older dogs who sometimes make mistakes and forget that outside is the place to go.  This mattress protector covers the mattress completely, is easy to change, and is machine wash and dry.  It makes life much easier for all of us.
2	1401667200	This mattress cover feels like it is probably waterproof, but it was far too noisy for us to keep and test out. It sounded like we had lined the bed with plastic grocery bags. We're springing a little more for one that has no plastic on it, unfortunately.
5	1401667200	Great item. My toddler sleeps with us occasionally and her leaky diapers have wreaked havoc on our mattress. Since we got this, nothing has passed through thankfully! Also, I don't notice it at all under the sheet.
5	1401667200	The mattress protector worked to keep my dog from peeing directly on the mattress, and prevented any fluid from soaking through. The top has a towel-like texture and the inside is plastic. I don't hear it or feel it when I'm moving around and sleeping. It's a snug but good fit on the mattress. Laundered and placed in the dryer once (on low heat), with no problems.
4	1401580800	We got this mattress pad very recently and it seems fine, However, without knowing about long term usage, I hesitate to give it 5 stars at this time. The pad seems well made and fits a thick mattress. It does not make a lot of noise like some waterproof pads do with movement, and it is thin enough that a heavier quilted pad can be put on top of it. It was a good buy and I don't worry if someone with incontinence problems sleeps on the bed.
5	1401494400	Good quality, great for potty training my preschool twins.  Just don't dry this in the dryer&#8230; be sure to air dry.  I first rinse in cold water and then wash it.  That helps to rinse away the urine before adding in the detergent.
1	1401408000	The reviews did not indicate that this was nothing but a terry-lined piece of plastic that crackles every time you move. I prefer a soft, cover. This was a piece of terry cloth that you can actually see-through. Very disappointed.
5	1401408000	Fits my deep 16-18&#34; queen size mattress perfectly.  Very happy with this product.  Great quality and such a great price!
5	1401408000	Came with simple instructions and looks like it should work well. Is not crinkly and does not make noise if you toss and turn.
5	1401408000	Exactly as described. Fits great. Arrived on time. I haven't spilled anything on my bed yet, so I can't attest to that. However, I love that it doesn't have a plastic sound when you move around on it and seems like it would protect my mattress if I did have a spill.
5	1401408000	The product is of good quality, protects our mattresses, and cost less than the ones sold in mattress stores. We now have three.
5	1401408000	This is a good protector.  I have not run into issues but it seems to stay very well on my mattress which is exciting.  I have bought this for my three year old daughter's big girl bed mattress which is no coils from IKEA and really didn't want that to get messed up or start to smell from her accidents.She has not had an accident so I have not tested the waterproof feature but that is a good thing!
2	1401321600	Easy to put on but you get what you pay for. Material is thin and doesn't seem like it will have much protection for my toddlers bed.  Wish I spent the money and got a more quality item.
5	1401321600	Excellent waterproof mattress protector, and I searched around a lot before purchasing.  Fits like a bottom sheet, is not hot, and you can't even tell it's underneath.  Not at all noisy.
5	1401321600	it works just as described, and keeps our matress nice and clean. Well worth the money to protect our matress!
5	1401321600	I cant attest to the water resistence and don't plan to test it. I bought it to keep most of the dirt and body oils from migrating in to my mattress. So far I can say its doing its purpose very well. Its not noisy on my foam mattress and seems to conform well and did it at a price I felt was great.
5	1401235200	Very good. You can't even tell it's on the matress, no noise like some others you can find. I recommend it.
5	1401235200	Very deep pocket all the way around easily covers the mattress and does not come loose. A light terry toweling top cover which is not hot and feels smooth under the sheet.
5	1401235200	I have been using this mattress protector for over a month now and I am very happy with it. It is waterproof like is advertise and does not make a &#34;plastic sound&#34; whenever i move at night and because of the price i would recommend it to anyone.
2	1401148800	I purchased this mattress pad for my 3 year old's twin bed.  It doesn't fit her mattress at all and is way too wide.  Had I not washed this item already, I would return it.
5	1401148800	Works great!  Have cats that sometimes barf on our bed. No leakage. Would definitely purchase this product again and I recommend it to others.
5	1401148800	I was so happy to find these.  I have 2 grandkids that sometimes have nighttime accidents.  These have a nice terry cloth top on them.  Good quality.
5	1401062400	I bought this before I Purchased my new Memory Foam Mattress. I was very happy that I did. While I was out for the day, the wind blew my bedroom door closed, trapping my cat in inside. I knew there would be a mess, because i was gone most of the day. I removed the comforter, sheets, and then, the mattress protector. Everything was soaked, but the mattress was bone dry.  Very Happy with my purchase. Saved My Mattress!
4	1400976000	I haven't owned this mattress protector long, but it seems to be of good quality.  I've washed it twice so far, and it's holding up well.
5	1400889600	I like the item; it seems great, but I use it as a precautionary item.It hasn't had to be washed since the initial wash because it hasn't gotten wet yet.Believe me I am not complaining but my review isn't of much help. I have one on each of my kids beds.
5	1400803200	Let's just start off with some honesty. You are NEVER going to find a waterproof mattress protector that doesn't sleep at least a little hot, and crinkle a bit. That's just the nature of waterproof material. That being said, I think this product has the best balance of protection and comfort that you're going to find. So even though it's not perfect, it gets five stars because it's a close as perfect you're going to get with this type of product.My cats have recently decided that the bed is the place to pee. Having purchased a very expensive mattress just last year, obviously this is really problematic. I had looked into waterproof covers in the past, and experimented with a few of them when I was dealing with a bed bug infestation and thought, &#34;Well, if I have to have a cover, I might as well get a waterproof one in case I spill something in the bed.&#34; They were all disastrous. I am naturally a hot sleeper, and most waterproof covers don't breathe at all. On top of that, who wants to put a crinkly material on top of a nice mattress?This time around, I did a lot of research because I NEEDED a waterproof option that I wouldn't want to strip off the bed after one night. I found it. I started off with one to see how well it worked and whether I could tolerate it, and I just ordered a second. When the cats pee on the bed at 3am, the last thing you want to do is laundry. This way, I can change the protector and sheets, and deal with the laundry at a more reasonable hour.If you are looking for protection and for something that isn't going to drive you insane, you want to get this cover. There have been multiple accidents in the bed since starting to use this, and none of them have made it through to the mattress. And I only somewhat notice the product under the sheet. Again, back to my original statement, you know it's there. It's a little hot, and a little crinkly, but at the end of the day, it's the best you're going to get.
1	1400716800	Bought it for my son, he's allergic to dust mites.I can see NO improvement at all. Over about 1 month - nothing.This thing did not help at all.
5	1400716800	I bought the Hanna Kay Premium 100% Waterproof Mattress Protector a few months ago.  I am really pleased.  I wish they had this years ago.  It is not fat and bulky. It does not make you swear and it stays on the bed.  Actually it is so perfect you will never know it is under your sheet.  I also read another review that said that it makes noise.  Mine did when I first put it on the bed.  However, I just check for that issue and it does not make noise now.  Maybe there is a break in period. It is very comfortable. I would buy this product again and I will recommend it to friends.
5	1400630400	It is just like the description says it is, it works perfect for what I needed. 100% recommended and I would buy more if I had more beds!
4	1400630400	Washed and dried without issue.  Fits oversize mattress with ease, Has no affect on the comfort of the mattress, as though it's not there.
5	1400544000	This is a great light weight mattress protector for very expensive mattresses or for kids who have occasional bed wetting incidents.It is also great when a child is sick.
5	1400544000	Fantastic product for the money.  Plenty deep enough for my deep mattress.  I was surprised at the very good quality at this price.  It has not come untucked once.  Very happy customer.
5	1400544000	If you need a mattress protector, I highly recommend this one. Water just pools up on it, yet it is soft and comfortable to sleep on. Arrived on time and was exactly as described.
5	1400544000	i have a toddler so this is great for when she wets the bed.  good price, good quality, protects the mattress.
5	1400457600	This is exactly like the mattress covers you have to buy when getting a Tempuredic mattress, but half the price.
5	1400457600	I love that it is not quilted because many quilted mattress pads make the sheets over it look quilted, which I do not like that look. Has been washed several times now, since I co-sleep with my baby, and has held up very well. I put it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes to wick all the water out then line dry it. Spit up and leaking diapers has put this mattress pad to the test and it is 100% waterproof without a doubt. It also does not have that plastic noise from the water-proof liner like some I have purchased in the past do. I recommend this product to anyone.
5	1400457600	im so glad with it as it is waterproof. my child pissed all over and the mattress was dry.........i cant belived i hust washed the cover and its new again
4	1400284800	I had one similar in the past when i bought my mattress a few years back but the one i bought with it was a bit tight and made the matter feel firm even though it is a soft pillow top. but this protector is perfect, deep pockets so it stays put we have a tendency to pull on the sheet while we sleep and it doesn't make the bed hot like others.
5	1400284800	Great waterproof mattress pad.  Holds up well wash after wash. Isn't all plastic, so you don't sweat from it. My little one used to wet the bed a lot so we would constantly be washing bedding. So many other mattress pads fell apart a couple of washes in. This one really held up.
5	1400284800	I have not used the protector yet..  It looks and feels amazing.  So I imagine once placed on the bed it could possibly be life changing.
3	1400198400	I am using this over an 8&#34; memoryfoam mattress.  It fits well and goes all the way underneath.  It is a tiny bit odd because the surface is a terrycloth pad.  I guess it is waterproof.  I have no plans to test that.
5	1400198400	Our old protector had seen better days so I ordered this one.  I considered the other brand on here that is about $10 more but I'm glad I went with this one.  It fit our 16&#34; Queen perfectly with room to spare.
5	1400198400	This is a really great product as I have two small children who sometimes spill thier drink on the bed. Mattress has never been wet. Also, fast shipping.
5	1400198400	Very pleased with the quality of this item.  I'm getting ready to buy a second one for another bedroom in my house..
5	1400198400	This is the second time I have purchased this product. So obviously I was very satisfied with the first.The sides are very deep and hold my already thick mattress with a 3 inch foam topper. It washes very well also.
5	1400198400	Mattresses are expensive! We bought this to protect our guest bed and it works great against spills or...um....accidents...Any our investment is protected
5	1400198400	Got four of these for my daughters beds and they are good quality. Fuzzy on one side and slippery on the other so you can use which ever side works best for you.
5	1400198400	Good product.  My son said he loves it  so much and can't stop sleeping on it. I recommend this to whoever want to purchase it
5	1400112000	I love that this product was made in the USA.  Good quality.  Fits easily onto my twins, fulls, and queens.
5	1400112000	The mattress pads that I orderd for two full size and one twin mattresses came quickly and were true to size.
5	1400112000	It feels very soft and no noise when you move in the bed. Even though my son through up in our bed, nothing went through the protector! I saved $100 on two protectors when buying from Amazon instead of store.
4	1400112000	I purchased this to use for myself.  After opening and feeling it I was worried it was going to be noisy to sleep on.  After getting it on the mattress you can't even tell it's there.  My mattress is 18&#34; deep and it fits great.  I would recommend this to anyone with a deep mattress with a pillowtop.
3	1400112000	it's a decent product.  not the quality we were looking for, but for the price, it does what it's intended to do.
5	1400025600	Some reviews were scaring me away, but shortly after putting this on my toddler son wet the bed, this protector kept every drop away from the mattress. I was sure to hang dry it to avoid any damage from the dryer even though the tag stated that low heat was fine for it. I would go back to this brand without hesitation.
5	1400025600	Fast delivery! Very easy to put on mattress. I feel better having my new mattress protected. Should be easily cleaned, I'm very happy with it.
5	1399939200	very high quality Mattress Protector ,fits perfectly  best for homes with small children  and people who have tendency to spill things on mattress
5	1399939200	Bought two of these one of my cats who would sometimes leave me steamy presents on my bed after a long day at work. She'd even leave it on MY side, and my side only, so I knew she's deliberately targeting me. That furry sack of cuteness. To retaliate, I bombard her with relentless belly rubs and mesmerizing head scratches. Anyway, since she targets the same spot, the protector held up very well. Since I travel a lot, I even go the extra mile and use the second one to cover my entire bed, with sheets and comforter and pillows! Ha! No getting through that one. The cats love it too!tl;dr5/5 - Good for overly-excited cats too.
5	1399939200	This fit perfectly on our King mattress with a 3 inch memory foam topper.  We are very happy, though we have not tested the waterproofing.
4	1399939200	It's waterproof, thin and easy to wash and dry.  But it does have a slight plasticky sound, like a diaper I guess.  It doesn't seem to bother my toddler but it would bother me a little.
5	1399939200	I did not have any issues putting it on the queen-sized mattress. Did not need a second person to stretch it.
5	1399852800	My three year old occasionally wets the bed, and this mattress protector does it's job.  We've only had this for a month, so I'm not sure how long it will last/keep working, but it's great so far.  It does not feel stiff under the sheets and it's not crinkly and noisy.
1	1399852800	Unless it had a zippered fit don't bother. I spent an entire two weeks trying to constantly get the protector to stay put around the seams of the mattress. It shifted everywhere like tissue paper. Do not waste your money.
5	1399852800	This has already been through 2 or 3 wet beds in the couple of months we have had it and it works great. Our toddler's mattress has stayed completely dry and this washes and dries well, as long as you use the suggested settings.
5	1399852800	Great mattress pad. Doesn't feel like it is waterproof which is nice. It feels very natural and works great. Haven't needed to test the waterproof part yet.
1	1399852800	After our 5 year old mattress protector started deteriorating, we ordered this one. Ordered this one based off the 4.5 starts... but should have read the reviews... not really sure how it scored so highly... there are a lot of really bad reviews out there... should have read through them. Our last protector was great. Protected our mattress, slept good, fit well. This one, I can't speak on how well it protects (well, except the puddle of sweat it causes), but it doesn't stay on and it is miserably hot. Complete waste of money.
1	1399852800	My puppy peed on the bed and it seeped through as if nothing was even there. Waste of money. :(
5	1399852800	Fits on bed really well, and doesn't move around like my old one did.You can barely tell it's there! Fast shipping!
5	1399852800	I had a mattress protector before and couldn't stand it because of the noise. Replaced with this one and the noise is no more an issue. Surface is pleasant and soft, you cannot tell there's a protector under the sheet.
1	1399852800	With so many positive reviews I figured I couldn't go wrong.I was wondering why there was a single image of this product and you kind of expect it to be somewhat big.The item received is smaller than my sheet set and just as thin.  I highly doubt this is waterproof and it looks like super cheap beach towel terry cloth.On its way back to where it came from...
4	1399766400	I can't stand the feel of this myself, but my special needs 9 year old leaves it alone and does well with it (she inherited our old king sized bed because she'd ruined four others in a year via various methods of excretion). She has shredded other mattress pads--we have two of this so that we can swap quickly if need be. She will even sleep on it without a sheet at times and do okay. I'd thought we'd use this on our new bed, but the feel was so rough and loud that I ended up getting one at costco. Little bit spendier, much better feel.
5	1399766400	This was a great price and great quality. It doesn't make any sound when my son sleeps on it and there is no leak through at all.
5	1399593600	we're very pleased with this product.  great fit...the fabric is so smooth you don't even know it's on the bed!
5	1399507200	i PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY STEPFATHER AND MOM. WHAT A GREAT IDEA FOR A PROTECTION COVER. THEY ARE USING IT WITH A BLOW UP MATTRESS I PURCHASED AS WELL.
3	1399507200	Feel warm and plasticy
4	1399420800	I bought the Hanna Kay Mattress protector for my grandson who is 10 and suffers from allergies.  He tells me that he is sleeping better now and has been sneezing less.  He did not use a mattress protector before this one, so it is helping.
4	1399420800	We have had no issues so far with it.  Time will tell when we was it more.  Will report back if dissatisfied.
5	1399334400	Purchased this for a deep mattress.  This protector fits deep mattresses with room to spare!  I would recommend to others.
5	1399334400	good
4	1399248000	My old mattress pad was ruined in the dryer, and I needed a waterproof protector since I have a cat that sometimes pees in places that he shouldn't. Initially, I was surprised by how thin this was - there is no padding built in. I have a pillow-top mattress though, so this wasn't an issue for me.I tested it with water, and it works as described. Will update if things change.
4	1399248000	will recommend itprotects the matterss from water and it is cloth like so it is washable. it doesnt cover the mattress completely tho
3	1399161600	I think it has a great quality. I would recommend it to all. Waterproof is important, good one. Hanna Kay has good products too.
4	1399161600	Originally paid $80 for a different type of protector that lasted over 4 years.  After finding a hole in that one, needed a new one.  The reviews on this one plus the price was a selling point.  Rec'd in no time at all.  Follow the washing instructions for a lasting product.  It's quiet, you'll never even know it's on the bed.  It fits our tempurpedic bed perfectly.
5	1399161600	Mattress protector is perfect for our guest bedroom. Fits the mattress perfectly. Have ordered a second one for our other guest bedroom.
1	1399075200	bath tower thin. It wasn't what I was expected.Amazon should find how why and how it it got some many good reviews.
5	1398988800	Haven't had this item long enough to really rate it, but it's a great product so far. Will review more once we've had it longer.
5	1398988800	my mattress covers my mattress exactly what i needed.  it washes very  nicely.  i would highly recommend it for any one young or old.
5	1398988800	Simple, easy, does the job and protects the mattress from my kids who pee the bed occasionally.  Hah thank you!
5	1398816000	It is light weight and comfortable Can't say much more about it, except I bought a far more expensive one elsewhere and ended up throwing it out within a week because it was too stiff.
5	1398816000	I purchased it for my 3 year old son, to prevent some night accident. It does its job nicely: protect the mattress, easy to clean and dry. A must have!
5	1398729600	Arrived on time, great condition, outstanding fit and the quality is top notch. Very soft and works great! My son had an accident a few nights after I had it on the bed, and it protected the mattress perfectly and also didn't stain.
5	1398643200	It's a great fit and protects great. Doesn't have a plastic feel or sound. Deep Pockets to fit different size mattresses.
5	1398643200	We bought this for our memory foam mattress so that the red sheets would not bleed onto the mattress. So it works well for that and we still fill the coolness of the gel in our mattress.
4	1398556800	Haven't tested the waterproof aspect of this product. Otherwise, it works as advertised for my memory foam mattress in my RV.
5	1398556800	They are perfect for under or on top of things to keep them from getting wet or soiled. My husband bleeds easy and I put it under the sheet to keep the mattress clean. It stays flat under the sheet.
5	1398470400	We use this in our 3 year olds bed and it has saved the mattress many times.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a toddler.
5	1398470400	I had two other waterproof mattress pads for my son's twin size bed, and neither held up. After repeat washing and drying, they fell apart. The Hanna Kay is the only one that held up, still looks good as new after over a year. So when the last one fell apart, I got another of these. I'm very happy with the quality.
4	1398470400	I've had this a couple months now and a few spills have happened on the bed and nothing has gotten through. I will give a disclaimer that I worked in mattress sales for four years so I know to be very careful with washing these regardless of what the label says which helps with my success.All of the covers, regardless of brand, should not be dried at all unless its air-fluff (no heat not even low) and washed in cold water on delicate. I have used Protect-A-Bed and the Leggett and platt brand covers as well and I had problems with leaking whenever I dried them and so I've learned to just not dry them at all.Also I usually replace them every 3 years because regardless of how gentle I am they seem to only last that long. I think for $30 or $40 I don't mind replacing them at that rate.
5	1398384000	We have no complaints whatsoever. Mattress protector seems to be made of good materials and arrived as described. Recommended so far.
5	1398384000	Product just as suggested, works well for my son who is having difficulty with wetting the bed. Helps at night when you just want a quick sheet change!
5	1398384000	This is great ... we have 2 young grandchildren AND a puppy. One never quite knows what to expect. This product is super fine. Great protection for a mattress that is quite costly. Why replace a mattress when you can afford to use this product. Washes nicely as well. I'm sold. You will be too. Go for it!!! :)
5	1398384000	This fit just right, was soft.  Already came in handy for our potty training daughter who sometimes still has accidents.
5	1398384000	Reasonable price and good quality pad. I put it under the other pad I have as a safeguard against accidents.
5	1398384000	Durable and great over sized shape will cover a large area for more protection.  Little ones don't stay put but this mat made life a lot easier and drier!!
5	1398211200	works great. Fast shipping. Got ticks shortly after this was placed on our bed and they cannot come through to the rest of the mattress. Got the king-sized one with deep pockets and it dutifully surrounds my mattress (8-9 inches).  Mind you I also have a 4 inch added memory foam mattress topper. Fits perfect with more room in case I want to add another 2-3 inches topper. THANKS!
5	1398211200	My wife and I bought this to protect  the mattress when she was pregnant, and we feared her water bursting in the middle of the night.  First it has ample room to fit any size mattress.  We feared it would be hot and make us sweat while sleeping, but it has not at all.  We absolutely love it and will recommend to anyone.
5	1398038400	I had one of those cheap mattress protectors before, and I could hear it every time I rolled over. This one is as thin and comfortable as a bottom sheet (it goes beneath your sheet of course) and it's quiet as can be. I haven't spilled anything on it yet, but it's just a matter of time. So far I'm very pleased.
5	1398038400	The material is so soft.... I have was many times and still going strong. Fantastic product. Recommend to keep mattress dry. Perfect fit.
5	1397865600	My son still has accidents during the night. I had one of those plastic type mattress covers that would make a lot of &#34;Crinkle&#34; sounds when you moved. lol! I wanted to try this one. I really didn't believe it would be waterproof as it is a soft cotton fabric. Well, he had his first accident last night and the mattress stayed dry. So it does work.!! I am going to get another one. Washes well without shrinking and fits his thick pillow top mattress.
5	1397692800	I bought this after my cat decided to tear into the bottom of my son's new box-spring and climb inside to sleep and hide. It was not only destroying the box-spring, but the noise of the cats getting inside was waking my son up during the night. Not to mention, the coils in a box-spring could easily harm your cats, or get them stuck or hung inside. After a lot of research looking for a remedy, I read a tip on the net that said to buy a mattress protector and install it on the underside of the box-spring just like you would on a mattress, but in reverse, so that the solid side in down toward the floor. It said that most mattress protectors are too thick and closely weaved for cats to get their claws into, unlike the grey sheeting that put on box-springs that can easily be shredded by them. I was skeptical, but I did not see any other option on the market anywhere to prevent your cats from getting into your box-spring (which is a big problem if you ask me - surprised there is not a product at there for this). I am happy to say that it WORKED PERFECTLY! I have 3 cats, one kitten that is fairly small and 2 large very powerful cats and none of them have been able to tear this and access the box-spring. They have completely given up! I will now buy these for all my box-springs in any room my cats have access to.
1	1397520000	I thought this was a dust mite cover from the description, but it doesn't cover the entire bed! I'm disappointed.
4	1397520000	I'm glad i bought this to protect my new mattress all though I haven't  had to test the product by spilling something on it. I can say that it's comfortable and  hardly noticeable. Shipping was fast and packing was fine. I would recommend the product to anyone and it was half the price of mattresses firm's  so that was a plus :)
4	1397520000	I got this for my son's bed who is potty training.  This has worked very well for this purpose.  The mattress has stayed totally dry!
5	1397433600	Perfect product! Saved my toddlers' mattresses on multiple occasions! Washed an dried it many times and it still looks like new. Would recommend it without hesitation.
5	1397433600	It took a few weeks for my son to try this out, but the night he tested it out...I'm extremely thankful for the ease of pulling it off and re-setting his bed for him to get back to sleep!
5	1397347200	We haven't had a wet incident yet, so can't critique the waterproof feature. It fits our 12 inch mattress perfectly and is very comfortable to sleep on.
5	1397347200	Even though the vast majority of the reviews were very positive, I worried about the few that described the mattress protector as noisy, slippery, or sized incorrectly.  I did not want a protector that was simply vinyl, because it would have been subject to those criticisms.  Much to my relief, I found this item to be perfect.  Even though it protects against leakage, somehow the manufacturer has come up with a material that still breathes and absolutely does NOT slip or make any noise.  Because it breathes, it is far better than the pure plastic protectors that are very uncomfortable to sleep on, trapping heat and reflecting it back.  It is waterproof in the same sense that Gore-Tex is--it breathes, allowing vapors to pass through without allowing water molecules to pass through.  As for it being &#34;flimsy&#34;, I suspect that those negative reviews came from people who though they were buying a mattress pad, rather than a protector.  This protector is the perfect compromise between the absolute water barrier provided by a plastic sheet and the comfort of a protector that breathes and does not crinkle or slip around like plastic.  I share the views of the vast majority of reviewers:  this is a great product.
5	1397260800	This was exactly what I was looking for....putting one of our younger kids into the spare room on a queen bed I wanted something that would protect the nicer mattress and this has been perfect.thank you
5	1397260800	Was very please with the waterproof mattress cover. It fits my bed very well no problems, would buy another one.
5	1397260800	The mattress protector fits well.  We haven't had any 'leaks' yet to test the waterproof feature.  It washed and dried on low heat setting just fine.
5	1397174400	This product is exactly what I needed as a mom who nurses and bed shares. The product came perfectly packaged, at a great price, and it protects my mattress from unwanted moisture. Thanks for an all-around great shopping experience.
5	1397174400	Very pleased with this mattress protector.  No crunchy sound and soft to the touch.  I would definitely recommend this product.
4	1397088000	Has proven comfortable and seems well constructed. We've destroyed similar mattress protectors by melting them in the dryer even on low heat. We bought two so we can always take the time to air dry the cover. We're not taking the risk of ever putting this in the dryer even though it says you can.
5	1397001600	we got this mattress to cover our newSleep Innovations 12-Inch SureTemp Memory Foam Mattressbecause of the warnings of moisture having the tendency to ruin memory foam. i figured, what's another $30 investment to protect the $400 mattress? and, while i have yet to have any spills or other accidents occur on the bed, i'm sure this will do a great job protecting the mattress. how can i be so sure? well, when i first got the cover, i washed it like you're supposed to do. apparently, it was still holding onto a lot of water, like a bowl would. i yanked the cover from the washer, and the retained water splashed out all over me. it actually soaked my outfit to the point that i had to go change!if this cover can hold that much water through a spin cycle, i'm confident that it can protect against some night sweats or spilled juice. as an added bonus, once it's on the mattress, i don't even notice any difference in feel or sound of the mattress. it's as soft as a regular cloth cover, and just as comfy! for the price, this is a no-brainer.
5	1396915200	I love this mattress protector it is effective and does not have the annoying crinkle  sound that most others do. It fits our mattress  well and does not slip off. It works well for keeping our new mattress safe from our kids and pets. I highly recommend this mattress protector to anyone in need of one.
4	1396915200	These seem like a good option -- they were a little large on the mattresses I had, but they were soft and comfortable on top and protective underneath.  Not the thickest mattress pad I've seen, but definitely seem sufficient.
5	1396828800	Arrived fast and did the job for a cheap price. This was more expensive as the local stores. Would highly recommend.
5	1396742400	I just got it, so I can't comment on the durability or the waterproof part. But the item is as described. It's very light and thin, soft terry cloth-like top, will fit deep mattresses. I got it to protect a featherbed I purchased, and it seems like it will do the job well. It has absolutely no crinkly sound at all.
4	1396742400	Love that this is washable. Wish the material were just a bit thicker, but the waterproof is key and it does protect the mattress well.
5	1396742400	No more waking up hearing my kids saying I need in the bed. This mattress cover is awesome. Washes great as long as you follow directions. Don't listen to any negative reviews on this product; it is the best.
3	1396656000	It's okay, I should have gotten a zipper one though. It is beneficial to have over a zipped bed bug protector.
5	1396656000	Needed another one for another grand child's bed when spending the night at our home. This one is very good quality at a really good price. Very pleased with my purchase and will definitely recommend.
5	1396656000	This is the second one I have purchased in 12 months (for a second bed, the first is still in original condition).  Both have been 100% waterproof, tolerate bi-weekly machine washings, and don't make a plastic crumpling sound with movement.
5	1396656000	Bought this for my three year old when we moved him from his toddler bed to a regular &#34;big boy&#34; bed.  I prefer to put it on the bed inside out so if there are any accidents, they aren't absorbed into the mattress pad, as the plastic side is on the bottom, not the top.  I haven't washed it yet as we haven't had any accidents so I'm not sure if it will shrink.  I would recommend.
4	1396656000	Really liked that this item was not all about plastic and had a fair price. Haven't washed it yet nor tested it out by spilling something but it seems sturdy and like it would do what it's supposed to.
5	1396569600	The best mattress protector I've ever purchased. Fits under the mattress and around the corners for a nice snug fit and also very soft.
5	1396483200	Good product, shipped fast. Elastic is strong enough to keep the protector on my mattress, so I don't have to worry about it pulling loose and it held up beautifully through washing and drying.
3	1396483200	doesnt cover whole bed, its like a sheet, but its aight. could be better if it covered the whole thing.
5	1396483200	Has held up nicely. Much better than the cheap kind I used before and were eventually ruined by heat of dryer.These hold up to high heat drying. Also, the material offers a better sleep experience as it does not feel plasticky.
5	1396483200	All of the beds that I have also include foam pads therefore they are quite thick. Finding covers to protect them that stay put can be a challenge. This cover fits the bill with wide sides to encompass all of the layers and still wrap underneath to hold well.
3	1396396800	I have two small kids so I have waterproof mattress pad covers on all of my beds.  This is the poorest quality mattress cover I have purchased.  If I could have felt/seen it before I bought it I probably would not have.  It was for our boat to protect the mattress so It will probably work, not sure if it will work despite the appearance of the material.  Feels and appears very cheaply made.
5	1396396800	Great product. We have one on our mattress and one on our sons. They go on easy and do a good job keep spills and stains off the mattress. Highly recommend
2	1396396800	I purchased 3 of these.My son had an accident on the twin and it worked fine.One morning he cam into my queen bed however, and had another accident. Went right through to the mattress.  Had it for maybe a week at that happened.
4	1396396800	This product fits memory foam mattresses, too. We use it for our toddler's bed. I would recommend to other parents.
5	1396310400	I actually use this in a newborn photography studio to protect from accidents.  So far the protector has kept things dry underneath and washes well.
5	1396310400	Perfect.  Washes and dries good. No slipping off. Shipoed qquickly and received when stated. Will purchase again if the need arises.
5	1396310400	Does exactly what it promises. There is no crunchy noises & it has proven itself already w/a sleepover from toddlers!
3	1396310400	Fit  bed nicely. Soft and fairly good quality. Would have liked more padding but good for kids beds  for accidents
5	1396310400	I purchased this product after reading some of the reviews and can say that I am truly happy with the results. I have a king size mattress and was not sure if it would fit snugly because I purchased one last year and it did not go over the mattress completely, I must say that this one fit very well covering all of the corners with room to spare. It has protected the mattress very well since my husband has problems sometimes with incontinence. I will purchase this product again sometimes in the future..
5	1396310400	Great product - after a number of mattress pad that were &#34;water resistant&#34;?, this one ACTUALLY is! Easy to care, high quality product
1	1396310400	This mattress cover is noisy. It crinkles when a body is laying or sitting on the bed. Very distracting when trying to sleep. We were unable to return it because we had used the item all ready. Pay for a better cover, it will save you money in the end.
5	1396310400	Fits perfect on my mattress! I normally have to buy a king size because of the thickness of the mattress! Love it!
4	1396310400	Great protector. No frills, soft to the touch. Haven't tested the water proof nature of this, but bought two so far and no complaints.
4	1396310400	The mattress protector was very easy to put on. At first it seemed to make a &#34;swishy&#34; noise, but we quickly got used to it. Considering the $80 mattress protector that Sleepy's tried to sell me, this one is clearly a steal. I would recommend it without reservation.
5	1396224000	Good!! It doesn't have weird sound when you sleep, I use it barely without sheet, but still very comfortable to sleep on.
5	1396224000	I am impressed. This product is perfect for anyone seeking to avoid the sound and smell of plastic or rubber sheets.  The terry cloth coating makes these very comfortable and you cannot even tell they are under the sheet. It is easy to wash.  No issues so far!
5	1396224000	I just got this mattress cover washed it and put it on the bed. Material feels great fits my new tall mattress like a glove. So far like it will get back to you later on protection after daughter has her baby.
5	1396224000	This item is excellent fitting and protects from sweating during hot weather or illness. Helps keep you dry and comfortable because it allows some air circulation.
5	1396224000	I was nervous when I first opened the package and felt the material.  The protector did have a crinkly, plastic feel to it and some of the negative reviews immediately came to mind.  I went ahead and washed it anyway, as instructed on the sheet that came in the packaging.  After pulling it out of the dryer (on tumble low), I could tell that the material was much softer and some of the 'crinkle' feel had disappeared.  I placed it on my king size memory foam mattress and  tested it out.  No plastic feel, no noises or crinkle sounds when shifting around.  I am thinking that the initial wash is specifically to help get rid of that feel.  I was pleasantly surprised.
5	1396224000	Arrived quickly and works wonderfully! No squeaky or crinkly sounds under my sheets and I can feel confident bringing my potty training toddler into bed on those tough nights or mornings! So far so good!
5	1396224000	This is a solid mattress cover for about one quarter of the price you will pay at a mattress store. It's not overly warm, which is a positive in my book!
4	1396224000	It fit easily on our bed and once I placed our regular cover on top of it I haven't noticed it at all.  We'll have to wait until I spill something in bed to really test it out.
5	1396224000	I needed something waterproof because my husband, due to cancer surgeries, then graft surgeries, was sent home from the hospital basically an invalid (even though he walked in there with his own two feet, he came out unable to walk)  I was afraid the waterproof sheets would be hot, uncomfortable or noisy, but these are not.  You don't even know they're on.My husband accidentally spilled some water from his cup and it did not go through the waterproof sheet.
5	1396137600	I was afraid this thing would sound crinkly but that is not the case at all. I don't even know it's there.
5	1396051200	Product is just as described.  Fit our queen pillow-top perfectly!  I was actually a little worried because I have quite a thick pillow top, but it went on with no problems.  So far it's working great!
5	1396051200	Great product the material is Soft breathable for my skin. Not sweating at night and it forms another soft layer to my mattress.
5	1396051200	This is a great mattress protector - I like that it is fitted so it fits perfect without being too baggy.  We have it on an 8&#34; contour mattress.  With two young kids around, I like to put waterproof pads on everything, so when we ordered a new mattress, this was a must have.  I like the feel of it, it isn't noisy, it fits well.  I highly recommend it.
5	1395964800	This product is not as thick as my other one, but I realize that it is just as good as my old one.  Great product.
1	1395964800	I was not happy with this purchase but needed the cover so I kept it. It is too small for the bed and doesn't even go down the side of the mattress all the way.
5	1395878400	This is a very good price conscience purchase. Could not come close to the price at the department store. Nice deep pocket!
5	1395878400	This mattress protector fits perfectly on my full size memory foam mattress. It stays put, has not wrinkled, and is so comfortable that you don't even know that it is there. I would buy this again.
5	1395878400	Fits well on any mattress.  I have them on several  different mattress thicknesses.  Also, they feel good under the sheet.
5	1395878400	Highly recommend this... I have a daughter that still gets occasional accidents, and this item protected her new mattress! I couldn't even tell she wet the bed after taking this off. Another plus was the speedy shipping! Thanks!!!
5	1395878400	I would highly recommend this mattress protector. It is thin but definitely does its job AND you can still feel the mattress beneath it. We have a memory foam mattress and another pad we bought was so thick it completely rendered the benefits of the memory foam useless. This is perfect and does the job well. I just had a baby so it is definitely being put through its paces (breastmilk, newborn diaper explosions, and other postpartum things...) It has held up really well and has protected the mattress admirably. Go for it! (Seller was quick, efficient, and product came as described.)
5	1395878400	Appears to be great quality and big enough to cover the entire area.  Very well pleased with product and delivery.
5	1395878400	This mattress protector works great! You cannot feel it not does it make any plastic-y type noises when moving around in bed.
3	1395878400	The waterproof/allergen stopping part is only the top of the mattress with regular fabric sides. You get what you pay for, the complete protection provided by a mattress protector that covers the whole mattress is better.
5	1395878400	Product is just as described.  I got the mattress cover very quickly and would order again if I needed one.
5	1395878400	I was concerned about crinkle-y sounds and feeling like I was sleeping on plastic, but I seriously can't even tell it's there. I can't comment on how well it actually works, since the cat hasn't peed on our new mattress. Hopefully I never will never know how well it works!
5	1395878400	We have had this for a while now, and it is great!  Fit is fantastic and washes up nicely.  Much happier with this than with the one we just replaced.
5	1395878400	This protector fit a 14 inch memory foam mattress with room to spare but is a good fit. It is soft and doesn't have any plastic feel to it. Luckily, we haven't had an opportunity to test the waterproof features but it seems like it would do the job.
5	1395878400	A great product for a good price. Highly recommend it to others. Keeps mattress safe, water and liquid free. Comfortable too.
2	1395878400	Overall this is a decent quality product. My husband and I bought a queen size to cover our 2&#34; memory foam topper with our mattress. At first it was great, but the nights were very cool. As the temperature went up a few degrees both of us started to wake up in the middle of the night in a pool of sweat. Sure, it is waterproof, but there is no breathing room at all. At this point I think it is too late to return this product. If you are looking for something in the cold winter, then maybe... but if you live in a climate where it is 45+ degrees in in the winter I'd hold off and find another product. There are plenty of other breathable hypoallergenic mattress protectors out there. It sucks to have wasted our money on this.
5	1395878400	Good price. Great fit. Darn good quality. Looks like this protector will last for quite some time. Just bought a new mattress and I'm sure this protector will do the job. Would do business again with this vendor.
4	1395878400	Worked very well protecting my new mattress (have a grandson who has an accident occasionally when visiting) Did it's job! Have purchased cheaper versions but hate the plastic and the noise they make while sleeping, this was well worth paying the extra money for.
5	1395878400	I purchased the queen sized protector for my new mattress. There were no issues with delivery, packaging, or fit on the mattress. I've had no issues with the protector creeping off the mattress or really anything else at all. It's sort of an out of sight out of mind kind of thing. It hasn't caused me a single problem and so I don't really think about it. It's simply there, doing its job. That's pretty much everything I could want from a product like this.
4	1395878400	A very good product but found it for $19.99 at Walmart after I purchased it. Still worth consideration. It wasn't worth returning at the price difference.
5	1395705600	its very soft and roomy compared to my previous purchases, i dont know how it holds up in the waterproofing dept, since i just got it and will update in a couple of more weeks of using this. arrived on time and no damages.
4	1395705600	and it is sliding for and back which is really annoying. I will try to wash/dry/shrink it for a better fit.
4	1395705600	I have a cat who has a tendency to pee on unsupervised beds. I bought this to save my mattress and so far it has. This cover has toughed out 3 accidents and subsequent washings. I washed it per the instructions and hung it on my washing line to air dry where it dries in a few hours. There are no defects in the plastic lining yet after three almost back to back washing cycles. The terri cloth softens with each wash too.I deducted a star because of the noise. It's definitively more quiet than other mattress covers I've used but the is still a fair amount of rustling that drives my significant other crazy. I've cured this by putting a fitted sheet over it.I really like this cover. It doesn't make me hot and it absorbs as well as it should. Even large puddles are no match for this protective cover.
5	1395619200	Bought 2 of these because I read reviews saying you can't put them in the dryer so I figured I'd better have one to be ready incase the one on the bed got peed on. Well after 4 days on my daughter's bed this cover was put to the test and I'm happy to report it did it's job.  I had the second for back up which I'm glad I did because these really do take all day to air dry. The cover is nice and has deep pockets so it will fit a thick mattress nicely. Our daughters mattress is a thick pillow top one but not the thickest out there but I know if we do up grade her mattress it will still work. This cover is nice and doesn't have a plastic sheet layer so it's not all crunchy like some are. I was a bit skeptical when I opened it up and put it on but it's proven to work so I'm happy and my daughter's mattress is saved from her accidents. If this protector wears out I'll definitely buy another. These are definitely worth buying just buy 2 so you have a backup while the one is drying out.
5	1395532800	So happy with this mattress protector.  Great price and for a great product. I've seen store try to sell these for $75! I am glad I found this on Amazon.Please keep in mind that you must wash this as soon as you get it before using.
5	1395532800	great product ! Great price! Don't buy the mattress protectors from the store for 100 dollars or more. This one is great!
3	1395446400	We needed a water proof pad for our 2 year old's 1st bed and this one was rated well so we bought it. It wasn't terrible so we kept it, but it isn't very heavy duty. I just wish that the fabric were sturdier and more cotton-like.
5	1395446400	I needed a mattress cover badly and I was being charged $75 by the place I got my mattress so I thought I would look online for a better deal. SCORE!!!! I really love this mattress cover so far. Hopefully this is not TMI but mother nature is bad to be during that time of the month and i am always staining the mattress. It happened again this month and voila! CLEAN! I do not get hot or anything sleeping on this and it does not make any type of crunchy plastic noises from the lining. Hopefully it continues to do me justice.
5	1395360000	I previously had a mattress pad/protector that had 4-corner elastic type straps to keep it in place - which it didn't. The mattress pad wandered around to match my tossing and turning, which means it routinely needed to be reset each morning.I was concerned buying this one as I have a typical Asian mattress about 8&#34; high and no box spring. Would it fit? The design of this cover is such that it easily accommodates mattresses of various heights based on its wrap around design. It meets my needs and I would buy it again.
5	1395360000	Love, love love this item. I thought I would hear the under layer of this protector during movement, but to my surprise I don't hear anything and it is true to its wear. I love it.
5	1395273600	We got this when we were expecting - just in case - and it's been wonderful. Baby spit up, grown-up drooling, unfortunate animal accidents, it's protected our mattress from all. And it's easy to wash (and dry). You won't even know it's on there. We keep it on all the time now (thanks to our animals!) and have zero complaints. I only wish I would've gotten it sooner!
5	1395273600	I was very impressed with how well this worked when I needed it to work. The icing on the cake was how easy it was to clean up and how quickly it dried. I just hand washed it, let it air dry, and put it back on the bed. Highly recommend it.
5	1395187200	Bought this to put on my three year old son's mattress since he is potty trained but has occassionally had an accident at night. Has had one accident since purchasing and it worked great; the mattress stayed completely dry. The protector washes great too.  Worth buying.
5	1395187200	This mattress protector is exactly what we wanted. It washed up nicely and was easy to put on the mattress without a lot of tugging and pulling. So far it is doing the job it was made and bought for. No weird packaging or plastic smells that I have read about in other reviews about other covers. I van definitely recommend!
5	1395187200	This mattress protector is marvelous.  It feels like terrycloth and has none of the crinkle sound of other waterproof covers, also performs well.  Happy to recommend it.
5	1395100800	Soft and absorbent. Doesn't feel like you have a plastic bag on your bed. Machine washable makes any spills or messes easy clean up! With two small children and a puppy in our household this is a must to keep our bed clean!
5	1395100800	Received my Hanna Kay mattress protector promptly and am very pleased with the product.  It fits good and is not noticeable at all.  Excellent product.
5	1395100800	I really like this protector! It dries well all the liquids spilled on my daughter's bed ( pee, milk, juice) without wetting the mattress. It is light and makes the laundry easy. It's simple to put on the bed, and the price is good.  I highly recommend it!
5	1395100800	Since I've put this on my mattress, my life has been much much better! It's great, robust, and waterproof. Totally suggested for twin size beds.
4	1395100800	Fits deep memory foam mattress -- lack of a fancy pattern is a plus for comfort IMO -- terry top is nice.
5	1395100800	This is a fine mattress protector.  We use it on my 3 year old daughter's bed in case of night time accidents.  We have only had to wash it twice, but had no problems.  It isn't noticeable under the sheet.  Nothing like mattress protectors that I remember from being young.  Very happy with our purchase.
5	1395100800	I wanted to protect a feather bed and an expensive 14&#34; thick Serta mattress and this product does exactly that. It is quiet, not crinkly, like some mattress protectors and its odorless. Basically you cannot tell it's there. Excellent investment.
5	1395100800	The mattress protector arrived promptly, and it fits my mattress, which is pillow-top, so deeper than normal. Unlike my previous protector, this one has not slipped up and off the mattress a single time since I've been using it for the past couple of months. It has stayed in place perfectly.
5	1395100800	I have purchased several of these mattress protectors and find them to be perfect for my need of protecting new mattresses in my beach rental property.
4	1395100800	I can never honestly say I &#34;love&#34; my mattress protector.  Yours has met my expectations and does not make crinkling noises when we are in bed.  It fit nicely and I think it is quite a buy for the money.  P Pratt
5	1395100800	I have a puppy.  My puppy sleeps with me.  The other morning he had an oops moment and tinkled on my bed.  The Hanna Kay mattress protector worked as advertised!  Nothing got through to my mattress and I was able to clean it without laundering as good as new!
5	1395100800	bought the Hanna Kay premium waterproof mattress protector to use over a talalay 3&#34; overlay and memory foam mattress.  Fit was perfect and feel was great
5	1395100800	This is a very comfortable mattress cover. It fits my queen pillow top memory foam mattress without any problem. It was well packaged, and shipped fast.
5	1395100800	My daughter just got potty trained so I got this mattress protector for all of our beds. The quality is very good. My daughter had a couple of accidents and the mattress protector did it's job. My daughter and I both have allergies too so it's a bonus that it's hypoallergenic.
4	1395100800	I have this on my 3 year-old's bed.  So far so good.  It's definitely been put to the test.  Protected the mattress from the dangers of a precariously potty trained toddler.
5	1395100800	I'm pretty sure my 10 month old wants to destroy our bed. I think he's made it his personal goal for this year. If he pees through his diaper, has a blowout diaper, or throws up, it ALWAYS happens when he's on my bed. The smart thing to do would be to probably stop letting him sit with me on my bed, but it's become a tradition to watch Mickey Mouse together on the bed early each morning. The mattress protector does a great job in protecting the mattress, and it doesn't sound/feel like I'm sleeping on top of a piece of plastic every time I move. My son has ruined three sets of bed sheets, but at least our mattress is safe! :)
4	1395014400	Wash and dried it - came out fine. Deep pockets to fit over my mattress plus memory foam topper. Doesn't feel like the highest quality materials, but I have no complaints so far. Only been using it about 2 weeks, so not sure how it will hold up.
4	1394755200	I got this because it's just good common sense to have a mattress protector on your mattress. I haven't spilled anything on it so I can't rate it according to that, but I do like it. I can't feel it under my sheets which is a huge plus. It fit my queen mattress perfectly and was very easy to put on. So far so good.
4	1394755200	Nice mattress cover. although waterproof, it is softer and does not seem to be 'stiff'. under the sheets. Great price. These guys are EXPENSIVE! Good value!
4	1394755200	Quality and price were good.  We will buy these again to go on other beds in our house.  Price was good also.
5	1394668800	I got a memory foam mattress with a gel foam topper that is not removable. The fabric on the mattress itself can be spot cleaned, but it cannot be detached to be washed, and the gel foam needs body heat to work correctly. For those reasons I needed a mattress protector that was breathable and waterproof (and hypoallergenic).  This product meets all the requirements and performs as promised.  It is a good value, has a decent warranty, and seems durable. It fits on my thick mattress. This is an excellent product at a reasonable price, and I'm happy to recommend it to others.
5	1394668800	Feels natural and not like plastic.  Doesn't change the feel of the mattress.  Haven't had any spills or accidents yet.
3	1394668800	I actually haven't had the chance to pee on this thing yet but I have a big hues party coming up and I'm sure I'm going to drink myself retarded. Now, if i actually end up in my bed then i'm sure i'll be able to test the pee catching qualities of this protector. feels soft seems to look like it could catch pee but i'll be the judge of that! And it's the deciding factor between good and evil.
5	1394582400	I wanted a thin waterproof protector because my mattress is already really high so I didn't want to add any more height to it and this fits the bill. I was afraid that I'd be able to feel it under my sheet but it's not detectable. Worth the price.
5	1394582400	I was a little hesitant to believe in a fabric mattress protector that claimed to last 25 years (I've had bad experience with mattress protectors in general in the past) but after two months it's so far holding up very well. It's absolutely worth the purchase, and if you follow the washing instructions I'm confident it will indeed last a long time.
5	1394582400	The mattress protector fits the mattress fine and the elastic would fit a range of thickness.  Haven't had major spills to test the waterproofness, but so far it has done well protecting the mattress from small spills and stains.
4	1394582400	We first got this for our toddler when he started using a twin mattress because he might have allergies and also for the waterproof protection from vomit & pee. It's worked great so far in terms of waterproof-ness. I like how the material is soft & pliant even though it's waterproof. Makes it easy to scrub clean and also doesn't crack like our waterproof crib mattress protector has. We've since bought another twin size one as a back up and a queen sized one for our own bed.
2	1394496000	This is more like a hospital bed cover than I wanted. I am sound sensitive and the plastic/rubber crunchy sound was more than I could bare. It will become a beach blanket liner this summer.
5	1394496000	It protects the upper half of the mattress (helps with my toddler sharing our bed if she has an accident). Its easy enough to throw in the washer and dryer and has worked out well so far.No complaints!
5	1394409600	This is a great product.  It also arrived on time and fit my Tempur-Pedic Queen pillow-top mattress.  I was worried it would be too small, but it fit perfectly.It's waterproof without having the plastic type protector.  It doesn't make any noise when laying on it and I don't even notice it.
3	1394409600	We have tried various mattress protector's and this one doesn't breathe at all.  Both my husband and I are waking up hot and sweating from underneath.  There are better options out there...Seller was great though...
5	1394409600	Nice quality, nice price, I can't even tell it's on the bed. Slipped very easily onto the memory foam mattress.
5	1394409600	the mattress protector has been very good, its doing its job and still you fill like you do not have anything that bothers yournsleep, love it, maria
5	1394323200	The mattress cover I previously used was in service for quite some time and a new one was needed. This waterproof protector,hypoallergenic is just what I was looking for. It truly deserves the five star rating I gave it. Fit and quality,very good, just what the doctor ordered . This is an item that a person probably won't shop for that frequently, but when my time came, I hit the jackpot! Thank you!
4	1394236800	this is a must for children! i have two covers for both beds that way i can wash one and immediately recover with the new one. sometimes i don't get all the bedding washed in time for that night and then i don't have a clean cover so having two is just nice to have. no issues with it getting thru to the mattress. its been washed a million times and no wear problems. highly suggest!
5	1394236800	The Hanna Kay Mattress Protector King size works great! It has a perfect fit and really protects just as described. Thank you so much!
5	1394236800	I have a bed wetter who has ruined two mattresses. I finally wised up and purchased a mattress protector. This has saved the new mattress. Absorbency is good and it doesn't have that plastic, sweaty feel like most mattress protectors. Great item.
5	1394150400	This is an amazing deal.  It fits perfectly.  I ordered one for each bed in our house.  I would order from them again. It's just perfect for protecting mattresses.
5	1394150400	Don't look at other brands. This is the one to get for price, comfort, flexibility. Love it. An excellent product.
5	1394150400	This is a great product at a great price. Needed a mattress protector for a spare bed with a new mattress that is used by small grandsons. Needed a &#34;just in case&#34; protector and this fit the bill. Would recommend this to anyone.
4	1394150400	This was a very good choice especially for the price.  Be aware when washing it for the first time as it is waterproof, the spin cycle will not get all the water out. It will act as a balloon.  Wring the excess out in washer before putting in dryer.
1	1394150400	I purchased this mattress pad after reading many reviews.  I am baffled at how many high ratings this mattress pad has received, because it is worthless!  My child pee'd his bed and it didn't just seep through a little- it seeped through a LOT.  My husband was pulling the soiled sheets off the bed and was griping about the fact that the mattress pad didn't work.  I came into the room rebutting him saying- &#34;it cannot have seeped through....this is a WATERPROOF mattress pad! You must be mistaken....&#34;  Well he wasn't mistaken- and our sons white pillow top mattress is now ruined.  Don't waste your money on this if you truly want something that can withstand liquid and protect your mattress.
5	1394150400	I purchased one mattress cover, and after seeing how quickly and thoroughly it dried, I ordered another. I have spent a &#34;mint&#34; over the years in electric cost just trying to dry my old waterproof mattress pads. Not any more. I will now buy only these!!!
5	1394064000	I love this mattress protector ! It fits well . Also , it is quite you don't even know it's there !
5	1394064000	works really well . Not like other waterproof ones that aren't breathable that make you overheated and make you sweat
4	1394064000	I've had it for 1 few weeks now.  My son peed on it once and it totally did the job.  Only complaint (and I don't think anyone else has solved this either) is that for busy moms that last thing you want is something that can't just be thrown in the dryer after washing.  Despite that, though, I am thinking I'll buy another one so I have two.Definitely recommend it!
5	1394064000	Very good... used it on my kids bed.. keeps matress safe .. i strongly recommend this product...very cheap too .!!!
5	1394064000	fit the queen bed perfectly, is definitely waterproof, and the terry on top provides nice texture under my sheets, you don't even know that it is a waterproof cover, like you cant feel that fabric with the terry over it. Perfect for what I was looking for
5	1394064000	This is a wonderful product for protecting your mattress - we have a potty-training 3 year old and haven't had a single issue of it leaking through or anything like that.  I definitely recommend this mattress protector - it's great!  No plastic smell, no crinkly plastic sounds - all in all, a big thumbs up!
5	1393977600	the mattress protector is something that everyone should have ... this is perfect and i will probably get more for the other beds.
5	1393977600	I had been having trouble finding a twin mattress protector at a reasonable price, and this one is just perfect!  It has the deep pockets I need, the quality of the product seems very good, and the item arrived in much better time than it took me to write this review.  I recommend 100%!
5	1393891200	This product is amazing! My three year old has had accidents during the night and not a drop has gotten on our mattress. I am thoroughly impressed that the product is soft, yet completely absorb ant!
5	1393891200	This is perfect for my pillow top queen mattress. I've had pads in the past and they were noisy, thick, and difficult to sleep on. This has really been great for me, and hasn't interrupted any sleep whatsoever.
5	1393891200	This fits perfectly and we have a rather deep mattress. Not noticeable when it's on as others have that scrunchy sound
5	1393891200	I bought this when my toddler began to sleep without diapers at night. It was exactly what I was looking for-you don't even notice it's on the bed and it fits our pillow top mattress (no problem). I highly recommend this product!
5	1393891200	Have had for several months, my son recently got out of bed, got into mine, took off his diaperand wet my bed, this mattress protector did the job!! my sheet was soaked, but my bed was100% dry due to this protector, I simply threw it in the wash and came out clean. highly recommend,my mattress still looks brand new thanks to this item!!!!!
5	1393891200	Fits freat on full size bed. Not loose or oversized. Delivery was fast. Top of protector is soft. Will recommend this product.
5	1393804800	Deep pockets to fit extra thick mattresses and it stays put. Shopped around and by far the best price and value.
5	1393804800	This protector is truly waterproof, doesn't crinkle like some do, and holds up well to washing and drying.  Worth every penny!
5	1393632000	I liked the fit and I liked the price!!  I guess it's waterproof, but didn't really care about that.  I wanted to make sure the mattress stayed clean and fresh and this mattress cover does that at a reasonable price.
5	1393632000	I am really please with our new mattress protectors. The old was were awful. The rubber lining did not hold up in the washing machine and it was all over the place. This pad offers the same protection to the mattress, but behaves when washed!!!
5	1393545600	I purchased 4 of these to use on all of our beds. So far, they are working great. Unfortunately I have children that occasionally wet the bed or spill liquids on the bed and they are definitely waterproof which is more than I can say for flimsier ones I have purchased.These are not hot to have as an under layer on the bed, again like many others I've purchased. They also don't shrink and they are easy to put on and don't shoot across the room like a slingshot like most mattress covers! Price is also very good too.As you can tell, I would definitely recommend them and will purchase again in future for any additional beds in our home. :)
4	1393545600	I purchased this protector to help protect an elderly persons mattress from getting wet due to 'accidents'.  I was a little disappointed that it was not very thick.  thankfully we have not had to use it yet so I cannot say it if works well or not.  I will say that it is reasonably priced and shipped quickly.
5	1393545600	Works perfectly on the queen sized mattress that it is installed on. Does not make hardly any sound like some of the other mattress protectors available.
4	1393459200	I put this on the mattress as I wanted to protect it from spills. I feel that it protects well, without causing extra heat or breath-ability issues. The manufacturer states that it is waterproof yet breaths, which is important. Also it is more than big enough- I have a very large pillow-top queen and this had no issues fitting over it.
5	1393372800	Ordered this as my son & grandson (who is 3) would be with us for several weeks...the 1st night they were here, all went well.This order came & we promptly put this over the mattress., and guess what?  My grandson peed the bed!EVERYTHING on top was soaked to the core...As there was such a large area affected, I was scared this may not have been enough to contain the urine on my brand new mattress, but, taking off all the layers, my mattress was clean & dry!So far, there have been 3 more &#34;accidents&#34; at night & my mattress has stayed dry as new!I'd definitely recommend this to ANYONE for ANY reason to protect their mattress investment, it really holds the liquids back!
5	1393372800	We needed a new mattress pad for a twin bed. This one was actually large enough that I didn't have to struggle to get it on the pillowtop mattress. Quick delivery, high quality product for a good price.
5	1393372800	These are 100% waterproof and you also can't feel them at all under your sheets because they have a terrycloth top. They are very durable (mine have been washed dozens of times). My only complaint is that it takes forever for them to dry. I usually end up running them through one dry cycle and then hanging dry. I'd recommend buying two per bed if you have a little one. They have saved my mattresses dozens of times.
5	1393286400	SO FAR SO GOOD. HAVE HAD ONE ACCIDENT AND IT WORKED VERY WELL. IT WASHES EASILY AND DRYS FAST AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT IS THERE. YES I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE.
4	1393286400	This protector was the essentially the same protector that I purchased from the furniture store when I bought my bed.  I am sure there is better one's out there, but this is just as advertised and at a fraction of the cost as you would pay at a furniture store.  I would certainly buy it again, and will recommend it to friends/family.
5	1393286400	I ordered this for my 4yr daughter's brand new bed.  I was looking for something to protect the mattress from the occasional accidents.  This fits a full bed great and I have had no issues as of yet and it's been 2 months.
5	1393286400	The item is exactly as described.  Have used for almost three months. Very good quality.  I would recommend.  Thank you!
5	1393113600	This product meet all my expectations! I would definitely purchase it again and would recommend it to anyone! Great product!
5	1393027200	THIS WORKED VERY WELL FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN'S BED. NO FUSS. NO BOTHER. NO WET NIGHTGOWNS, ETC. I WOULD CERTIANLY RECOMMEND.
5	1392940800	Thus is not a cheaply made moisture proof mattress cover, the one we remember when we were little. And regardless of why anyone needs a mattress cover, this will protect the expensive new mattress we have purchased!
1	1392854400	I had to return these because they were definitely not what I expected.  I thought that the picture looked like they were quilted, but they're not.  Although my mattresses are thick, these were still way too loose and flimsy. :(
5	1392854400	The five star relates more to the transaction, the fit and quality.  We have not had any spills on the beds (thank goodness!) so we cannot comment on it effectiveness in that regard.  We bought 2 of these for 2 full size beds.  The protector appears to be of good quality.  We have protectors on our other beds but another brand.  These appear to be at least the same or better quality.  We now have some peace of mind for our 2 new full size beds.  I would recommend this product.
5	1392854400	The product is great and meets my expectations - was a little bit loose on my Full size mattress, but it fits fine. I assume that is so it could fit a quilted top mattress, which is a good idea.
5	1392854400	I've used several different waterproof covers for my kids beds.  So far, these are the best.  They are very thin (almost would seem not waterproof!), and don't have that plastic feel a lot of other covers do.  They sound slinky but not noisy.  Have had them about 6 months and they've held up through multiple washes.
5	1392854400	Loved it. It helps a lot especially with the allergies and water protection is also good because we have small kids and sometimes when they come to our bed we don't have to worry about accidents.
2	1392768000	I bought this mattress protector primarily because of severe allergies- to protect against dust mites. I don't have bed bugs but I live in NYC so I'm paranoid about getting them. This mattress protector is basically just a plastic top sheet that you stretch over your mattress. I had one before that goes all the way around the mattress- top and bottom- you zip it in. With this one, the sides are permeable and the bottom is uncovered. Bed bugs get into your mattress by climbing up the legs. All of that is not a deal breaker for me. What really sucked is that it makes the bed very hot. I woke up sweating the past two nights. I even have a foam mattress pad over this. Basically it just radiates heat and reflects it back at you. Cheap, plasticy with a fake terry cloth top. I'm junking it..
4	1392768000	It might affect the comfort of my memory foam slightly, but it is worth it if it is waterproof. I haven't had the opportunity to find out if it works in that capacity yet, however.
5	1392681600	The cover fit my thick, plush pillow top mattress with room to spare. My cat threw up on the bed and the cover protected the mattress.
5	1392681600	Works just as advertised on my toddler's mattress. It's a little big for her 6 inch foam mattress, but that's not a problem.
5	1392681600	This is such an upgrade from the plastic water proof protector that I owned before. It doesn't make that crinkling sound when I get into bed!
5	1392681600	The protector has already proven itself after a couple of &#34;accidents.&#34;  The price was very reasonable, especially when compared to similar products of apparent lower quality.
5	1392595200	Because I have allergies, and a tendency to spill things, I wanted a waterproof protector to cover my mattress and new mattress topper.  This easily covers the two together, which totals more than 12 inches.  It appears as if it would cover mattresses that are at least a couple of inches thicker than mine as well.  I searched dozens of different covers and read hundreds of reviews before I bought this one.  I am totally delighted with my purchase!  It does not feel at all as if I am sleeping on a plastic cover (it is vinyl-like on one side, with terry cloth on the top), and is not hot to sleep on.  Other than the fact that I sleep much better, I cannot tell that I have a waterproof cover over the mattress.  I have not yet spilled anything or washed the cover, but will post another review if I have any complaints after doing so.
4	1392595200	This is thin and does not make noise -- my criteria for this kind of pad.  I thought the terry was a little rough, so I just put my padded mattress pad over this.
5	1392508800	Fits great  and it really protects the mattress. Spilled something on it and the mattress didn't get wet at all.
5	1392508800	Ever so glad we found this online, the Brick and Mortar Stores really mark this type of product up if you buy locally.Hope to see more great products from this Vendor. How about Bed in a BAG?Nice Fit on our Plush Mattress, Tall as a Pillow Top and FITS Great!
4	1392422400	We haven't has any issues with it. I would have preferred they fully enclosed the mattress and has a zipper rather than using elastic to hold them on. Otherwise, they seem well made.
5	1392422400	Got this for my son's bed as he still has accidents every now and then.  It seems to work well and is a nice quality, just like the reviews said.  I'm happy for the purchase.
4	1392336000	I have this one and a more plush matress protector and between the two i really like this one for the fact that it dries in the dryer three times faster.
1	1392336000	I bought this for my recently potty-trained son's twin bed.  He often has accidents at night and wets the bed. This &#34;waterproof&#34; mattress protector does nothing to protect the mattress.  The pee has gone right through it on multiple occasions and the mattress is now completely ruined.  We will need to buy a new mattress bc this protector does not live up to it's claim of being &#34;waterproof&#34; or a protector.  Do not buy.
5	1392336000	It is as described.  I love how it fits over my mattress and the mattress pad I bought. So far I am pleased with the product, not noisy, very soft  but I guess time will tell to see how long it will last.
5	1392336000	We returned home from a week's vacation to find that our house sitter had inadvertently locked our two cats out of their litter box all week.  Disaster.  Guess what they used as their litter box for the week?  Yup, our bed.  We were SO relieved to discover that this waterproof mattress protector had protected our expensive mattress.  The sheet reeks irrevocably of cat pee, so we're going to have to throw it out, but that is a thousand times better than having to buy a new mattress!  We will happily be purchasing another mattress protector from Hanna Kay.  It really worked, thank goodness!
5	1392076800	I haven't tested the most important feature of this protector, which is how it handles spills, but it does give the impression of a quality product. I bought one for a 12&#34; queen mattress and another for an 8&#34; twin mattress and both fit well. They are soft and don't make any noise so I don't really even notice they are there.
5	1392076800	Excellent quality! I bought these because we have small children who occasionally have &#34;accidents&#34;. They have been washed in the washing machine and are still as good as the day we got them. Highly recommend.
5	1392076800	Was delivered when needed.... We have been having issues with our son and some night time accidents and were in desperate need of a fix.  This mattress protector did the job and is a great quality.
5	1392076800	The Hanna Kay waterproof mattress protector works extremely well keeping the mattress from getting wet and stained.  It's reasonably priced and works great.  Highly recommend it.
2	1392076800	The cover is comfortable enough -- despite being lined with plastic (it is waterproof after all), I don't find it loud or crinkly feeling when I am sleeping on it. However, it is SO FREAKING HOT. Both my boyfriend and I wake up drenched in sweat every time I sleep on it, and it is 28 degrees outside! Needless to say, I'm currently in the market for a new one, hopefully before the weather warms up at all. (Unfortunately I can't return this one, because I already threw away the packaging...)
3	1392076800	I really want to like this protector.  It fits my bed well, went through the wash fine (only once so far), isn't noisy, and seems to have protected my mattress well as far as I can tell.  It's pretty similar to the old one I had (which started losing the waterproof coating on the back after 6ish years).  However, it traps/reflects back heat a LOT and I find myself waking up with the mattress-side of my body overly warm and sweaty, even if the rest of me is is fine or even cold.  I'm currently investigating wool mattress protectors, since they seem to regulate body temperature better than these synthetic ones...even if they're super expensive.
5	1392076800	not scratchy feeling like other mattress protectors, has kept the mattress dry and clean while going through the potty training stage for our puppies. Fits well, I ordered another one after I saw how well the first one worked.
5	1391990400	I tried a bunch of mattress protectors from many companies - this is by far the best. I highly recommend it!
5	1391990400	I bought this mattress cover for my spare bedroom. But guess what? It is now being used as a back seat cover for my car, because I just got a puppy! Has saved my car on many occasions and washes up great. Thanks so much.
4	1391990400	Great for frequent spills and wash it make sure you it does not go in a dryer that is warm because it does melt in the water proof part.
3	1391904000	I bought this to use with a platform bed. It cannot be used without some support- when I lie down the mattress sinks and I can feel the slats underneath. On a box spring, it's probably comfortable but on a platform bed it's just not. Plus it's still 'deformed' from being shipped in a glorified laundry bag. I'm disappointed
3	1391904000	It doesn't really cover the hole mattress, the sides are kind of expose and is not very comfortable, juice was spiled by accident and only one part was fine but the sides of the mattress got wet and stein :/
1	1391817600	I don't know exactly what I expected but this mattress pad is flimsy and thin ..I used it very briefly but had to replace it with something more substantial.
5	1391731200	Very glad purchased this mattress protector instead of one carried by Walmart.It's quiet, comfortable and should last a long time.
1	1391731200	My daughter had an accident last night. And turns out this mattress protector is not waterproof and now our very expensive mattress is ruined. :-(
5	1391731200	These have held up over the past year and work great.  They don't make any noise, wash well and are generally fabulous.
5	1391644800	With so many babies/kids in the house, we rely on these protectors to keep our mattresses dry.  They become softer with each wash without loosing their ability to repel.  We have had a few of our covers going on 4 years.  My husband and I even have one on our bed so the little ones wouldn't ruin our bed, either.  There is no noise with each movement, and after the first wash, there is not additional heat--complaints we have with other mattress protectors.
5	1391558400	It fit well ,so for so good time will tell but its great so far I like that it fit good
1	1391558400	Feels like you're laying on crinkly plastic. Put on when I received it and immediately took it off. Been sitting in my closet ever since. Such a waste of money!!!
5	1391472000	Didn't try the waterproof part, but doesn't make much noise for me (I probably have high tolerant though). Wash it once and still looks good coming out from low heat dryer. Overall would recommend to others.
5	1391472000	The ones I've used before were always like plastic and crinkled when ever I moved. When I moved across the bed the sheets would follow me because the plastic was slick. The Hanna Kay mattress protector feels and looks like linen and doesn't have that plastic smell either. The mattress underneath is still like new, thanks to the protection provided. The material breathes so there is no burping sound from trapped air between the protector and the mattress. I'm sold on the mattress protector and even the pillow case covers also from Hanna Kay.
5	1391472000	This offers decent protection from small leaks and is easy to wash and put on the mattress. Fits my queen bed perfectly despite thick mattress cover.
5	1391472000	My son has a dust mite allergy and this seems to function great!  It's easy to put on as well and fits comfortably under the fitted sheets.
5	1391472000	Keeps my memory foam mattress clean, cool, and comfortable. Washes nicely (I line dry it). The mesh on the sides allows it to &#34;breath&#34; and it fits very far underneath the mattress, keeping it in place snugly through all my tossing and turning. I love it, and recommend it!
4	1391472000	Quality and functionality. The best mattress protector I've found, with construction that is quality. Although recently purchased, looks and feels built to last. Recommended.
5	1391472000	I've spent a lot money trying to find the protectors that works for what I need it for. I finally found it and at an amazing cost. It has saved my furniture and mattress many times over. Yes I said furniture as I put a twin cover on my couch with a sheet over it. I highly recommend this product and company.
5	1391472000	Our order arrived quickly, fit our queen-size bed well, and was reasonably priced.  Great experience with this and company (paid twice as much for a similar product from a mattress store 6 years ago).
5	1391385600	I have gone through several mattress covers and this by far is the best one yet.  It is generous in fit, especially for deep mattresses.
5	1391385600	I have no problem with this product. I have not had the opportunity to test to see if its waterproof.
5	1391385600	My Husband and I love this mattress protectors. We have gone through several because all our other ones ripped but this one seems sturdy and built to last. It's machine washable which is another added bonus.
4	1391212800	The product showed up fast and it is just as good as advertised.  It is a great investment for your bed.
4	1391126400	Low Profile makes it fit under sheets easily. Like that you cannot feel it under the sheet and that it is waterproof!
5	1391126400	These mattress protector are terrific. Unlike some of the cheap ones I've bought in the past, these are plenty bit. They have a nice terrycloth texture and the side panels are not flimsy. This is a product that will last a long time. You can't go wrong with these.
5	1391126400	This mattress protector is a quality-built product; well-designed and durable. The fact that it is waterproof is a needed option for my use.  The 10 year warranty is an additional selling point for me. It arrived promptly and fit my extra-deep mattress securely. I highly recommend this product!
4	1391126400	Genereous fit on a king mattress. Nice cotton covering on the waterproof protectant.  Very comfortable to sleep on...it breathes and is  quiet to sleep on.  Washes up nicely.  Good price for the product purpose.
5	1391126400	Excellent mattress protector.  Great for a master bed that kids sometimes climb into.  It's quiet, but I don't worry about anything spilling or any little one &#34;leaking&#34; onto the mattress itself.  Easy to clean and very durable.
5	1391040000	It fits my 10 inch mattress well. It works for the purpose and protects the mattress from being soiled or wet.
5	1391040000	This mattress pad protects the mattress and does not feel like you are sleeping on plastic. It does a wonderful job preventing night time accidents from ruining your bed.Our four year old wears pull ups that sometimes go above max capacity. If he sleeps through it it can create a rather large puddle. This mattress pad prevents it from hurting our mattress topper and does not feel like a plastic sheet under the fitted sheet.
5	1391040000	The sides are very deep so stays on extremely well and help keeps my sheets (which are not so deep) from slipping off!
3	1391040000	the surface is like a towel. Fit my Queen size pretty well. I just saw Target has something better with the same price.
5	1391040000	This mattress pad is excellent quantity.  My cat actually threw up on the bed and this saved the brand new mattress underneath.Great price for a great product.
5	1390953600	Washed well, comfortable for person who slept on the bed, and didn't even realize it was a waterproof mattress protector!
5	1390953600	This is a very good mattress pad. I would compare it to my more expensive mattress pad I received with my Tempur pedic mattress. I would purchase another one.
4	1390953600	Just what I needed and at a very decent price too.It arrived quickly in good shape. It was really easy to put on too.
5	1390953600	Seems to be working so far - no problems - no weird smells or rashes.  Arrived in a couple of days of ordering, so that's good.  I am reluctant to spill anything on it as a test, until then I'll give it 5 Stars but, if that days comes and it doesn't work I'll update my review. :)
5	1390953600	Bought this for our guest bedroom, but when I felt how soft it is we decided to put it in our master bedroom instead. It was so much more comfortable than the one we had...AND much cheaper.
5	1390953600	Great price, and none of our guests complained of any discomfort from the protectors.  Nobody wet the bed, so we can't comment about water resistance.Arrived promptly in perfect condition.
5	1390953600	I was worried about the few reviews stating the cover leaked. I went ahead with the purchase and I'm glad I did. works great!
2	1390953600	This keeps the mattress from getting wet. We have an infant and she seems to only have explosive diapers while on our bed. What I don't like about it is that while washing it the pad retains  A LOT of water. Somehow (because it's water proof) water gets in between the layers of the pad and does not 'spin' out in the washing machine. This means I have to spend time dumping the water out of the pad before I can put it in the dryer. Also, this causes the need for more dry time.
4	1390867200	It seems well made, though we have not had any spills yet to be able to test the waterproof part. It is thinner than I had expected, and does not give any padding.
5	1390867200	I have a baby and to say the least i needed a good protection for my extremely posh mattress , so I ordered this on and so far I am very happy with it.
5	1390867200	This has proven to be waterproof many times over!  Our expensive mattress has been save because of this product.  In fact, we ordered two, one to put on while the other was being washed.
5	1390867200	Not long after purchasing this mattress protector, my 2 year old granddaughter took a nap in our guest room bed.  Grandma forgot her nap time diaper and she wet the bed.  The mattress stayed dry and I was pleased to find that it worked as advertised. I was surprised to find such a lightweight, non rubber or plastic feeling pad could do such a good job!
5	1390867200	Gift for my daughter who has allergies, she loves it.  I paired it with hypoallergenic pillow case covers and a air purifier for her room.  she is sleeping so much better.
5	1390780800	We searched the internet to find this product. and while others had some of the features this one did, this one was just what we were looking for. It is a great product, and we would recommend it to anyone. Also, delivery was prompt and delivery time short. I am glad we found this product.
4	1390780800	This one i purchased 8 months before, and i have a one and half year kid. It works great and worth for the price
5	1390780800	The mattress protector is soft to the touch and we have found it to be very waterproof. It's saved us on several occasions from a ruined mattress.
5	1390694400	Not only did it arrive much earlier than I'd thought it would, it's exactly what I was looking for.  It fits a full/queen (I bought Queen-size protector) mattress perfectly and seems to be excellent quality, too.  Nothing has been spilled on it (yet), but it seems to be just what it's advertised as -- Hypoallergenic, Waterproof Mattress Protector.  And the price was fantastic; it's so hard to find these at a reasonable price so I was very happy:)
4	1390694400	Does everything I expected, which is my requirement for a 4-star rating. Only reason the product doesn't get a 5-star rating is because it didn't exceed my expectations, but met it.
5	1390608000	Nice quality product, great performance and low price.  I got the queen size and will get a king size for my other mattress.
5	1390521600	We share our bed with dogs (shush. I know. I don't care. I love them). When one of them recently....er...&#34;became ill&#34; during the night, we made the decision to purchase this mattress protector, and I am very glad we did. So far it has performed as advertised. It does appear to be fluid proof (I could say water, but these boys don't toss water all over my bed at 2:00 am after eating the wrong thing outside), and has done it's job admirably.
5	1390521600	We wanted a good quality mattress protector to guard against spills that could ruin the memory foam on top of our bed.  I was very pleased with the quality of the Hanna Kay cover and yet an affordable price.
5	1390521600	We are using this in guest bedroom so I haven't slept on it.  It easily fits on our 13&#34; mattress.  Because it is thin it doesn't diminish cushiness of the pillow top of the mattress.
5	1390521600	Product seem to be working great so far, happy with the quality and it fits well on the mattress. We haven't had too many leaks to check and see but this mattress cover was better constructed than our last, so we are pretty confident.
5	1390435200	We ordered this for our son's twin bed to replace a cheap mattress pad that wore out too quickly.  So far, we are completely happy with our purchase. It fits well, doesn't slide around, and really does a great job overall.  Highly recommend this product.
5	1390435200	My daughter gets upset that she still needs something to protect her mattress in case she has an accident. Every time I put a pad on her bed she slumped a little and said, &#34;Do I HAVE to use that? I promise I won't pee the bed.&#34; This mattress protector looks like a cozy layer of warmth, which is how I describe it to my daughter. No more sad face from my kid and no more mattress scrubbing at 3am.Oh, and it fits great on my pillow top, queen mattress with room to spare.Thanks!
5	1390348800	This item came quickly and was as-advertised. It fits our 10-inch memory foam mattress well. There is elastic all the way around the side/bottom seams so it is snug under the mattress and doesn't move around. We don't hear any plastic-y type noises from it, either.
5	1390348800	I love the quality and the value of this mattress cover. The fit is perfect and it has stood up to a nursing dog and her 3 pups! Highly recommended!!
5	1390348800	Have no fear, this mattress protector does not make an annoying &#34;crinkly&#34; noise!  It does the job and even helps the bed linens stay put.  Excellent buy.
4	1390348800	very comfortable and well made I am happy with itI don't buy this type of product ofteni would recommend this product
4	1390262400	The best part of the mattress protector is that it doesn't make any noise when you lay on your bed.
4	1390262400	I was glad to order this item and have it shipped directly to my home. We had company over Christmas and was able to use this to protect a new mattress that we just ordered too on Amazon.I did read that the sides are not waterproof from another person who purchased it and that is correct as it much thinner and a different fabric than the other. So far I'm happy with this purchase.
4	1390262400	Product matched description and I am very satisfied with it. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quality mattress cover at a great price.
5	1390262400	We are very happy with our purchase. Arrived promptly.We moved our son to a bigger bed. We will also use this bed for guests and have our son share with his younger brother when we have visitors. We hope to have a &#34;quiet&#34; waterproof mattress pad and it has fit the bill.happy with our purchase!
5	1390262400	This mattress protector is great.  Does not slip off mattress, though would probably fit a mattress with a topper better&#8230;It is not noisy with movement.
5	1390262400	Bought for spare bed. So far so good and protects mattress feom water/spills and accidents.  Good price for the product.
1	1390262400	I received this about a week ago. It is soft and I washed them ( I got 2)  on delicate cycle. I dried them on delicate cycle as well. I followed all of the care instructions. I have a child that just turned 3 and this was put to the test................and FAILED!!! This is not waterproof at all. My got to the bed immediately following the accident and it was still too late.
5	1390262400	I bought this one because it has a terry cloth material on top of the plastic and I love it, it protects my new memory foam plus you don't feel any plastic because of the terry cloth FANTASTIC
3	1390262400	The downside is, you sweat a lot with this protector, due the luck of breathability. It requires another pad to avoid this.
4	1389830400	This protector fit perfectly and feels comfortable.  I'm sure this will help extend thelife of my mattress by several years.
5	1389830400	I like this so much I bought two.  It's not like the old fashioned plastic sheets, it quiet, soft & comfortable.  I can throw it in the washing machine and even put it in the dryer on a low setting.
2	1389830400	We get what we pay for..this is pretty thin and cheap.  If you have cats do not use this. Their nails slice it easily.
3	1389744000	I purchased this specific protector after reading the reviews. I had been looking into buying one for my allergies. I have never used one , ever, so I needed one that I wouldn't notice underneath me. Maybe this would be good for young children or people who are used to sleeping on them but for me it doesnt work because I notice the difference when I am moving around in bed. I removed it from the bed but since it seems well-made, I decided to keep it for future use in case I have a change of heart.
5	1389744000	Great quality, especially for price. Kept vomit off my sons bed...does not crinkle or make a sound. Would buy again
5	1389744000	after buying, using, and throwing away a bazillion others, this is the best and only kind anyone should ever buy!  Washes and dries well. Potty training in our home, one has been washed and dried at least 20 times and is still in perfect shape.
4	1389744000	Haven't really had a chance to test how well this works. I mostly bought it to protect my mattress and it fits my 10&#34; memory foam mattress well. I like that it doesn't make that crinkly sound that some protectors make. You won't even know its there.
5	1389657600	Hanna Kay Premium 100% Waterproof Mattress Protector ,Hypoallergenic - 10 Year Warrantyis  VERY WELL MADE AND EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO PROTECT MY INVESTMENT
5	1389657600	This was for someone else but they loved it.  It worked perfect.  The shipping was very fast.  Its great for anyone who has this problem.  It would be good both children or seniors.  :)
5	1389657600	This protector got us through the potty training! Good quality, decent price, what more can you ask for? Highly recommend!
4	1389657600	Love the mattress protector.  Fits perfectly and because of the terry covering doesn't crinkle like other plastic protectors. Would highly recommend.
4	1389571200	It was better than I expected. It's very durable and comfortable. The covering is easy to wash and I would recommend it.
4	1389571200	Got this for those occasional visits from the aging parents. (Mom is not so lucid anymore and has trouble with getting up at night.) This saves the mattress so we can still look forward to their visits.
1	1389571200	All I can say about this protector is slippery, slippery, slippery. I should have returned it, but instead ended up buying a regular mattress pad to put over it so my sheets wouldn't slip and slide. I wouldn't recommend this.
5	1389571200	Works as advertised. Comfortable, but haven't had a chance to test its waterproofness just yet. With any luck I won't have to.
5	1389571200	Great value at significantly cheaper than buying at the furniture store.  Would recommend this product as it has a soft feel and you can't tell that it's waterproof.
5	1389571200	Fits oversized mattress well. Not noticeable under fitted sheet.  Would buy again for other mattresses. Would reccommend to a friend
5	1389484800	waterproof and still soft.  Great to keep your mattress clean. I have tried others and they do not feel good.
3	1389398400	Mattress protectors are made of an unexpected terry cloth cover.  Seems to serve the purpose, but have not tested it's waterproof-ness yet.
5	1389312000	You would have no idea that this mattress protector is on my sons bed!  No noise, no smell, nothing!  Bought two for a bunk bed set up and sleep overs, piece of mind!
4	1389312000	I wanted to protect my new memory foam mattress (and it's warranty), but I didn't want to spend what amounted to 25% the cost of the mattress itself.  This protector has provided me with peace of mind at a reasonable price, very happy so far.
5	1389312000	Pros:Price - I paid about $60 less for this than a lower quality protector sold by MattressFirm.Quality - works as advertised.How it feels - I don't even notice it at night.Simple and effective product that does the job well for a low price without getting in the way.  Exactly what I wanted!
5	1389225600	I ordered this for a bed that my granddaughter uses and was very pleased with it when I received it.  It was easy to put on and looks very nice on the bed.  I feel good that if there are any accidents, the mattress is protected.  Actually it is so nice that I told my daughter to buy one for her daughter's bed and she did and also likes it.I am sure you will be pleased.
2	1389225600	I had the most wonderful, soft mattress top and when I used this mattress protector, my bed felt scratchy and felt like I was sleeping on a diaper.
4	1389225600	We haven't had this very long and have only washed it once (thus 4 vs 5 stars - I really don't know if it will hold up or not), but it's nice and thick and fits the mattress snugly.
3	1389139200	I bought this for my husband and my bed. Thinking the waterproof would be good with our kids. It makes me sweat like crazy. I end up with the covers kicked off. I guess it works - it's just hot.
5	1389052800	This is the only thing that works.  Have been using these for two years and nothing got through them so far.  Once I ventured out to purchase a more expensive cover which leaked through the first time my son spilled his milk on my bed... And then he peed his pants too...  I wish I stuck with these covers that are thinner,  don't have any padding,  but do the job...
2	1389052800	I did not like sleeping on this mattress cover and replaced it within a month. It may be great against water and bed bugs, but it's not all that soft and comfortable. It has a plastic feel, which is not what I want to feel under my sheets at night!! I replaced it with a softer one by Laura Ashley that I got at Bed, Bath and Beyond, and I like that one MUCH better!
5	1388880000	As stated at Amazon, excellent product. Product is performing better than expected.  Does not diminish the comfort level of the bed
1	1388880000	What is this?  Its a very THIN terrycloth with elastic edges to put on the mattress.  I can place bath towels on the mattresses that would be thicker & do better than this thing.  Sorry, sending it back!
5	1388707200	I use this on my bed because I have a toddler that has accidents sometimes. This fully protects my mattress. No leaks.
1	1388707200	Firstly, the mattress cover is amply sized for a deep queen mattress.  This is about the only positive I have for the cover.  It seems a bit cheap and flimsy.  I am using it in my guest bedroom, and I believe that it is sufficient considering this room does not get a great deal of use.  I would not, however, recommend it for a bed used on a daily basis.
5	1388620800	Item was exactly as described & packaged well. It arrived on time. Much better than product I had ordered previously that cost almost 3 times as much. It conforms to the mattress very well, important because I have adjustable beds & many mattress protectors (and sheets) pull up in the middle exposing the mattresses when the beds are activated. It definitely repels water very well & is easy to launder & dry. I would recommend & buy again. Thanks for a good product.
5	1388448000	I got this for allergy prevention, not bed-wetting.  It is comfortable, not too warm or loud and is easy to get on and off to wash.
5	1388448000	You can't go wrong with this mattress protector.  Just be sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions in washing and drying it.
5	1388361600	I have always kept a mattress cover on my beds.  The quality of this cover is by far the nicest I've ever owned.  Does not make a crinkle noise when you turn over on the bed.
5	1388361600	This mattress cover was perfect for an air mattress we recently bought. Durable enough for the air mattress and still very comfortable. Highly recommend this product.
4	1388361600	Prefect for protecting the matress. Haven't had it very long, but I am sure if something were to happen the mattress will be safe.
3	1388275200	If you're wanting something to give your mattress a little more fluff while protecting it, this isn't the pad to pick.  It's very thin--almost like another sheet.  I'm not sure how waterproof it is--we haven't gotten it wet yet.  It does appear to be breathable--you can see through the fibers, which makes me wonder just how waterproof it is.
4	1388188800	Yes, this does the job, but just like any other waterproof protector there will be limited breathability.  I have woken up a little warm&#8230;but not sweaty.  From other product reviews&#8230;this one seemed to be the most breathable for the reasonable price.  I would buy again.
5	1388102400	Our first mattress protector. The product delivers as it promises.. The comfort is great and the washing/drying is very convenient. Would definitely recommend.
5	1388102400	Although it's expensive (I found another type of waterproof bed cover for 1/2 the price in a local store), it is worth the money.  I don't feel like I'm changing a hospital bed, but rather putting on a nice soft mattress cover. also, it's nice that the sides go all the way down, as opposed to just uslng a corner elastic like the cheaper one I got.
5	1388102400	When I opened this I was a little surprised that this did not have a cloth side to it.  I use this to protect my Love Seat as I have an older cat who is suffering from bladder problems and sometimes she has accidents.  The protector covers the love seat and cushions perfectly and stays in place as opposed to other chair covers I have purchased.I really like this and will probably purchase another one and have piece of mind that if there is an accident, nothing will seep through and ruin my furniture.  My cat and I are both happy now.
5	1388016000	fits perfectly on my queen. have not had any spills yet to test but at least piece of mind..i would recommended it
5	1388016000	it is totally serving it's intended purpose. doesn't make a sound under the sheets. washed very well and came out still good
5	1388016000	Works great. My bed wetting son said it left him lying in a river of urine. Which is great since it didn't soak in and ruin his mattress.
5	1388016000	The backing looks like Gortex-like material, giving me good confidence in its water resistance.  Top is a fine yarn with a small loop, good for wicking away moisture and giving a feel like fabric.  The size was plenty deep to cover the standard mattress + the 4&#34; foam pad on top.  Well done.
1	1388016000	I bought this item to protect the brand new mattress of my 94 year old Grandfather who recently became semi-incontinent. He was good for a week, then had an accident today. The cover turned out to be as waterproof as a single layer of paper towels. The mattress is ruined. Just buy a much cheaper vinyl cover, it will actually work. I can say without exaggeration, this is the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon.
5	1387929600	Just what I wanted. We washed it and put it on first day and liked the feel. I even took a nap on it while the sheets were in the wash.
5	1387929600	Bought a really nice mattress and want to protect it. Looked at much more expensive ones but this was the best value. Waterproof and yet quiet. Seller was great, as well.
5	1387843200	This product works very well.  It is easy to take on and off the mattress which is a huge plus.  I would purchase it again.
5	1387843200	This was just what I wanted/needed and the price is great.  Very good quality.  Would buy again and recommend to others.
5	1387843200	Product just what I had been looking for.  Liked that it was fitted and could be removed to launder.  Fit my king bed perfectly.  Would purchase from this vendor again.
4	1387843200	I've had the mattress protector on for over a month now and it seems good so far.  I can't speak to the waterproofing (luckily), but I can say it seems well made and doesn't make noise when I move.  My only complaint so far is the material on the sides used to pull it down onto the mattress is like cheesecloth and seems to tear easily.  My old mattress cover fit perfectly, this one covers well, but the side material isn't elastic and so the side material droops down and hangs over.  When I change the sheets, I have to tuck this excess material in.  It's almost as if there's too much material on the sides and the band that attempts to pull it under the bed isn't strong enough to pull all the excess material in.  My mattress is rather tall with a little bit of &#34;pillow' so I feel like this must happen to most people with a normal mattress.
5	1387843200	This mattress protector is well made and adequately waterproof. In the past I paid more for one that wasn't nearly this good. Even though I have it on a futon mattress--which means due to the dimensions of the protector there is plenty of overlap--the elastic takes up the slack sufficiently. I'm very pleased with it.
5	1387843200	I am very seprised how good this protector isIs elegant very good quality and so easy to maintainBuy with confidence
5	1387756800	We love this mattress protector, it gives us peace of mind as our young son becomes fully potty-trained and night-time trained.  It's a great way to protect your investment, if you have new mattresses and want to ensure that they hold up in the long run.
2	1387756800	Even while putting on bed I could hear crackling, very thin. I was looking for terry cotton on the top but it was too thin layer of it. I was disappointed.
5	1387584000	It is easy to put on a bed and can last for long time. also it is easy to wash. It is good
5	1387497600	There is plenty of elastic and room for any depth of mattress and maybe even a queen.  It is a good product.
5	1387411200	Purchased at Amazon, delivered fast.  Installed easily on new mattress (queen 12&#34; foam mattress also bought at Amazon).  Not hot to sleep on.  Haven't had any spills yet, but thus far this mattress protector works as advertised.  No complaints.
5	1387411200	I am very happy with this mattress protector. I tested it to see if it repels water. It does and does the job very well. You will not be disappointed, you will be very pleased if you buy this protector for your mattress!!
1	1387411200	I returned this because the pad portion that goes right below your fitted sheet feels paper thin and almost scratchy. I tried it out and hated the feel.
5	1387324800	Perfect size for a kig size mattress protector that was difficult to find somewhere else!Comfortable and not noisy. Great product!
5	1387324800	I have 5 old cats that like to sleep on the bed.  I've always worried what would happen if one had an accident - it would ruin my mattress.  This is a perfect solution.  It just right for protecting my mattress from accidents.
5	1387324800	My significant other can be rather vigorous, so we wanted to protect our memory foam mattress. While there is a slight difference in feel with the memory foam, it's not regularly noticeable or bothersome enough to negate the benefit of this mattress protector! It's easy to wash and does the job for great value. I'd buy this again.
5	1387324800	Great pad for accidents as we reach the end of potty training. Keeps matress dry and washes/wears well. So pleased I bought another.
5	1387324800	Fits the mattress well.  Lots of room for deep mattress.  Doesn't move around. Soft. No crinkle plastic sound when you move. Does what it's supposed to do. Glad I purchased it.  Washed and dried well.
5	1387324800	This one was exactly the one that I wanted.  As the protector is very thin, it does not change the touch of foaming mattress.  I could never found the product like this at famous retailers.  There is no plasticky sound or feel, too.
5	1387238400	It doesn't seem like one of those plastic waterproof mattress protectors.  It's soft and thin so you don't get so hot at night.
5	1387238400	After purchasing 2 different covers at two local stores that disintegrated when washed, I was happy to find this quality product at a great price.  It's held up through washings and fits the bed great!
5	1387238400	Does its job, reasonably priced, and most of all non toxic! If you have a PVC cover make the witch now, dont put your health in an industries hands.
5	1387238400	it's a nice product soo pretty, i would like that more person try have it. because is nice and quality
5	1387238400	I haven't spilled anything on it so can't say whether that works or not but love the fact that it doesn't have the annoying crinkly sound that some mattress protectors seem to have. It is also very comfortable to sleep on!
5	1387152000	Made from high quality materials and fits well. A terrific product for the price. I'm very pleased with my purchase!
4	1386979200	Doing it's job.  So far so good.  Nothing to complain about.  It's a mattress cover.  What more can one say?
5	1386892800	I bought a new memory foam mattress and wanted to protect it. I purchased this cover to protect the mattress from any spills or fluids that would go through.Washing:When I received the cover, the first thing I did was wash it on a gentle cycle in a tumbling washer (Not a top loader, one of the front loaders that just flop the load over on itself a bunch). Then I dried it on the lowest heat setting with the rest of my new sheets. I was worried that this might have affected the waterproof nature of the cover, but before putting it on the bed I tested it with a little cup of water, and not a single drop came through.What I am getting at here is that contrary to some of the comments, the cover can be washed, it just must be done so in an intelligent and gentle manner. If you don't have a front loading washer, find a friend who does (this is what I have done), or do it by hand in the bathtub. I think a lot of the people who have had issues with it after washing/drying were probably too rough on the material, this thing is really quite thin.Comfort:You would never even know you are laying on something other than just a mattress. There is absolutely no crinkle, no noise, no weird feeling.I will update this review if anything changes, but so far I have been very happy with this cover.UPDATE: So the other night, my girlfriend's *ah hem* time came before she expected it this month. It was a mess to say the least, went right through the bed sheet. However, it stopped there. The Hanna Kay protector did not let a single drop through it. Also it was a cinch to clean up, just took a rinse and a little hand washing to come out and then tumble dried it on LOW. Extremely happy with the cover still, it saved my mattress from a big mess and stain!
5	1386806400	We bought this for our four year old daughter as we were transitioning out of pull-ups at night.  This is a great product, moisture never leaded through and it kept the mattress dry.  This is also very comfortable and you would never know that there is a mattress protector on the bed.  We have now washed this item about 10 times and there is no indication of wear.  This one cost a little bit more than some of the cheaper brands but it has been well worth it.
5	1386806400	First of all, I can say that the product works. Yes, it has been tested several times. The protector is also easy to put on. It is not that noisy and uncomfortable plastic either. It is so comfortable you could sleep directly on it!
3	1386806400	Good as a matress protector, but don't be fooled - this cover will not protect your mattress from bed bugs or other types of insects.  I've not had a problem with it, or bugs, however, it does not seal your mattress, nor go all way around it.  This is false advertising.
4	1386806400	So far no leaks from by little one on the mattress.  So that's all I really cared about with a mattress pad.  And my little one has no complaints about it.
5	1386720000	The quality of the mattress protector, packaging and the speedy delivery met my expectations in full.I have washed it few times and it kept all original qualities and  dimensions
4	1386720000	I purchased this for a guest bed. This product fit over a pillow top mattress with room to spare. It has been completely unnoticeable to people sleeping on the bed - no plastic rustling sounds, no uncomfortable crinkling under the sheets. The waterproofing seems to work well too... my dog had a bladder control incident on the bed after I'd put this on, and not a drop made it through the protector.
5	1386720000	it does what it says it does. protects your bed. it was perfect for our memory foam bed. thank you.
1	1386633600	I don't do reviews often, but this was a real disappointment. I ordered 2 of these for my grandchildren's beds. They are still young and bed wetters. Though these pads may protect the bed from dirt/dust, they are not waterproof. I'm now looking for something else that will work.
4	1386633600	It is exactly what I ordered, and deep pockets fit the mattress perfectly.  I did wash it on gentle cycle before putting it on the bed.
5	1386633600	I haven't tried spilling water on it yet... but it doesn't crinkle. It feels like it is not even there.
1	1386547200	This item is NOT waterproof. I have followed the directions for washing and drying and it has NOT protected our mattress from getting soiled. Do not buy this if you need it for young children.
5	1386547200	Good value, great price. I have purchased many other waterproof covers and this one has not disappointed me. Great fit.
5	1386547200	Great Mattress Protector/Cover and a Great Price;  Fits Perfectly on my new Queen Size Bed, that I also purchased from Amazon;Always use Mattress Protector/Cover on my Mattress as spots on mattress will void warranty on all brands
5	1386547200	We have used this brand for years!  Our little one has wet through a handful of times over the years and we've never had this mattress protector fail us.  It's easy to use and easy to clean!
5	1386547200	I bought the for my  3 year old when we first got ride of the diapers. I've had them for over almost a year now and they wash very nicely. She had her first accident the other day and nothing at all leaked to the mattress, which mad me very happy.
5	1386374400	This mattress protector was a perfect fit for our King size mattress.It was easy to fit and had no negative aspects.After two washings, it has held up well so far. I would recommend it.
2	1386374400	This mattress protector did not work for me at all.  If it's waterproof, it's because of all my sweat from it not being breathable at all.  I tried to sleep on it, but it changed the feel of the mattress for me, and I thought maybe I can just use it in the winter time or something.  Now that it's cold, I decided to try it again, and didn't tell my girlfriend I put it back on the mattress.  Neither of us slept well at all and felt like the protector made everything very hot (get your mind out of the gutter).  Everyone else's reviews made this item seem fantastic for the price, but I just can't sleep on it.
5	1386288000	I'm embarrassed to admit that I bought this in a King size to cover the top of my queen size bed due to a sick kitty marking the bed occasionally.  I have to say it worked great!  If there was an accident, I'd just wash it and replace it when we weren't around and it worked like a charm keeping the bed clean and dry and the cat didn't have to get upset noticing we were leaving for a while by having us put a tarp on the bed which is what we normally would do when we left for an extended period of time.  It would cause the cat to have separation anxiety knowing we were getting ready to leave and she would start to panic.This cover is soft and pliable and feels similar to a blanket so the cat would not notice the difference between it and the comforter.  It was large enough to wrap the whole queen bed with down comforter and pillows and everything by using the king size cover.  I was impressed that after 6 or 7 washings in an old washing machine with hot water and drying it in an old dryer on high heat (neither machine has more than 2 settings), it was still standing up to the test.  I wouldn't recommend using hot, but it worked nonetheless.Unconventional use, I realize, but for this purpose it worked like a charm.  If you have pets that sneak onto the bed when you're not home it would work great to keep the bed clean for you.  No pet hair or saliva or whatever else your pet might leave behind will make it through to your bed covers.I would imagine it would work great as it was intended for use as well.
5	1386288000	Thin, terry cloth, great price. My son wet the bed and luckily we had this mattress protector on!  Didn't leak.  Washed and dried on low.
4	1386288000	Do NOT put these in the dryer on high or they will absolutely get ruined.  You have to line dry them or put them on the lowest heat setting on your dryer or the vinyl gets melted and they won't hold liquid.  If you take care of it properly it will work fine, but if you accidentally set the dryer on high, your (expensive) mattress protector is toast!
5	1386201600	The item works as expected. My 2yrs old accidentally spilled water and the Mattress protector did work as expected.Would definitely recommend.
5	1386201600	Purchased the Hanna Kay Mattress Protectors from Perella's for both an older mattress and box spring in a seldom used guest bedroom.  These are both affordable and of a much higher quality than others I had looked at in stores and were shipped quickly.  These protectors &#34;saved&#34; me from the expense of purchasing a new mattress for the 2 weeks our grandson with dust mite allergies visits each year. BTW, my email questions to Perella's about this product were answered in less than hour.
3	1386201600	it covers the mattress, but the elastic to hold it on the mattress really sucks. Luckily I have a tight fitted sheet, so it stays on. We had one small accident and it didn't leak through the cover.
4	1386201600	Well, it's definitely improved our situation. We have a brand new foam mattress, that my husband complains is too firm. This pad gave the bed that &#34;hotel feel&#34; with an inexpensive price tag. I give it four stars, because we have the slip-slidy troubles with our sheets now, and my parents have another version of this and theirs is far more squishy than ours!
5	1386201600	Arrived on time, and works as promised.  Very comfortable, too!  Actually, I'm using it to minimize moisture getting through to the mattress, with a view to fixing a dust mite problem.  (Yikes!)  I don't know if it's solving that problem; but the mattress cover fits well and is comfortable, so no complaints.
5	1386115200	Bought this item as a gift-was told that it is great-would definitely buy another in the future.  Great product and great price.
3	1386115200	UPDATE: 12/28/2013: Received the Luna Protector and it used a similar netted material for the sides. I still like the Luna more because it makes a lot less crinkly noise. However have decide to raise the rating of this product to three stars because the materials used seem to be in line with the industry standard at this time. Hanna Kay also reached out to me via email to try and help with my problem which shows they care.This mattress protector works as intended the main reason I don't like it is the noise. When moving on my the bed with the Hanna Kay protector fitted on the mattress my bed makes a sound kind of like a thick winter coat . My old mattress protector did not have this problem. My secondary gripe is the products sides are made of a netted material that lends little or no protection to the mattress and doesn't have much elasticity. As far as the "waterproofness" goes I cant say it wouldn't work on top, but if you spilled on the side there would probably be leakage. This protector is not unusable but I find it to be inferior to my prior one which had just worn out. I have decided to try  the Luna Premium Hypoallergenic Mattress Protector and keep the Hanna Kay to use while I wash the Luna. In summary it works but its noisy and the side material is cheap.
3	1386115200	It does it's job but it is a little crinkly.  It also needs to be pulled tight every few days or else it gets a little loose.
5	1386028800	Soft and comfortable, no plasticky feel at all.  We spilled a cup of water on it and it worked great.
5	1386028800	GOOD FIT GOOD PROTECTION SOFT AND COMORTABLE. SOME MATTRESS PROTECTORS I HAVE USED HOLD MUCH WATER AFTER WASHING. THIS ONE COMES OUT OF WASHING MACHINE ALMOST DRY AFTER SPIN CYCLE.
5	1386028800	Works like a champ. Keeps the P out and the clean in. Don't spend an arm and a leg. Get this one that you can throw into the washing machine and wash as you desire. Our daughters is over 2 years old and looks new.
5	1386028800	This has worked out very well. Don't use bleach on mattress pads though. A friend found out too late on another pad)(different brand)
5	1385942400	Perfectly what I was looking for.  Easily fits over my pillow top queen mattress and stays in place with the elastic bands. Does not appear to sleep warm (got this in the fall) and does not make any weird plastic-y ruffling noise.
5	1385769600	Had it for about 2 months and have no complaints.  Seems to hold up in the washer.  Would buy again
4	1385769600	The mattress protector fits well and I have no issues with it. The waterproof feature is surprising, as it doesn't feel plastic-y. Yes, I would buy it again.
5	1385683200	Works great on my daughters memory foam mattress, hardly realize it is there. Provides a lot of peace of mind knowing the expensive foam mattress won't get ruined by spills or accidents.
5	1385596800	So far so good. Several toddler accidents and not wetness got to the mattress. Have washed and dried  it several times and it's still fine. I've slept in it and it doesn't make me sweat and it doesn't make a crinkly noise like some waterproof pads do.
5	1385596800	This mattress protector is exactly what we needed.  It has a soft, terry-cloth like touch and is not bulky.  I wanted something different from the typical plastic covers that are stiff and noisy any time someone moves on it.  Not so with this cover.  Shipping was quick too - it arrived earlier than expected.
4	1385596800	I can't tell the difference between this protector and the one we paid close to $100 for at the mattress store. So far it works great.
5	1385510400	Very happy with purchase. This was affordable but great quality.  Happy to know my toddler daughter's new mattress is well protected.
5	1385424000	Awesome and does the job!  No issues at all with the product and would highly recommend to anyone!  Easy to put on my guest bed.
4	1385424000	Fits my memory foam mattress well, doesn't slip or bunch up. No complaints thus far. Haven't had an opportunity to test the waterproof feature yet but it looks like it will hold up.
5	1385424000	Wonderful purchase! Bought a different brand that cost me $60 and this item is just like it ,but for a lot less!
2	1385424000	It worked once when my child had an accident, but the second time, it leak right through.  This is with an additional mattress pad on top of it.  Would not recommend this product.
5	1385251200	Got this more for sweat, etc than large leakage problems, so cannot comment on its waterproofness yet.  What I can say is that it fits the 15 inch mattress well, unlike stingy competitors.  We cannot feel the difference as it's quite thin and soft, without being plasticky.  Some other reviews mention the noise: yes, we noticed it sounds different than an uncovered mattress.  Not crinkly, more just that the sound of movement is not absorbed in the same way, so is a bit more noticeable.  This might be a problem for you if you're reeeeaally sensitive to noise, but we are already getting used to it.
5	1385078400	We ordered the protector to cover a deep mattress in our spare bedroom. The order arrived very quickly (thank you) and fit the bed perfectly. Luckily we have not had the opportunity to test its waterproof capability, but will report our results should an accident occur.
4	1385078400	Usage has been limited but the product seems very satifactory and performiong as billed.  Dimensions are more than adequate for use with deeper mattresses.
5	1385078400	This is a great pad. It took me a while to write a review because I hadn't had any reason to test the waterproof-ness. That has now changed.First. the pad is comfy and unobtrusive. We do not notice that it's even there and we don't find it &#34;crunchy&#34; or hot to sleep on. Recently I got the dreaded flu. Woke up 3 night in a row in a pool of sweat. Mattress pad was wet, but mattress below was dry as a bone.It washes up nicely and the pocket are deep enough to fit our thick, pillow-top mattress. It doesn't move, come loose or bunch up. And my fianc&eacute; is an &#34;active&#34; sleeper. In the morning, the top bedding look like he's been fighting with a tiger. But the mattress pad (and me) seems to make it through all that unscathed.Long story even longer...I'm picky and I'm a big fan of this mattress pad. I now have one on the guest bed also.
5	1385078400	Mattress protect fit nicely and is a good quality.  We are using it for a guest bed, and have heard how comfortable the bed is.
4	1384992000	The product arrived well packaged and in a short time. It washes well and fits my memory foam mattress. I have not had any spills yet ( have a 4 year old so only a matter of time) so cannot comment on the it being waterproof. So far so good.
5	1384992000	Fits great.  Perfect for my temperpedic mattress.  It's very thin and moisture proof.  I haven't washed it yet, hoping for the best.
5	1384992000	Very happy with this mattress cover in Queen size.  Fits my son's thick, padded mattress well.  Minimal plasticy noise.  Soft to touch.
5	1384905600	Excellent protector.  Would definitely recommend!  Best quality for your money.  I have been using for my three year old daughter, and the &#34;protector&#34; part has held up very well :-)
5	1384905600	Very nice cover, doesn't feel or sound like plastic. Good investment to protect a memory foam mattress. Fast delivery and excellent price ..
4	1384819200	I have a couple of young toddlers and they often have leaky diapers.  This cover saved my mattress twice.  Feels like terry cloth, but there is a plastic backing making it water repellent.  Not sure how it will hold up over time, after many washes, but so far so good.  Quite pleased with the quality/cost.  Saw some cheaper ones, but this one had a 10 yr warranty
5	1384732800	Does what it says it will do quietly (no rustling or crackling under the fitter sheet), and fits the mattress perfectly. Couldn't ask for a less obtrusive moisture barrier.
2	1384732800	Not as what I expected. The layer is very thin. It gives a lot of heat since it is not very breathable. Almost feel like those thin beach towels.
5	1384560000	This is a good product.  Fits nicely even on very thick mattresses.  Stays put in place without popping off the corners.  Seems to be a well made product of good quality.  I have not washed it yet though.
4	1384560000	I've been using this for a few months now, ever since I got into my third trimester of pregnancy, for fear I'd break my water on the bed. That didn't happen thank goodness, however I have had a baby on my bed for the last 5 months, and no leaks through to the mattress with this protector.At first it feels a bit weird to lay on, because it's slightly crunchy? Definitely a waterproof feature. Also, it feels a bit warmer than sleeping on the sheet alone, also due to the waterproof part of the protector.
5	1384560000	Comfortable to lie on, especially after it's washed a couple of times. It's not as stiff as some other products. It washes well and fits easily over a couple of mattresses with different heights.
4	1384560000	It is the best &#34;water proof&#34; pad I have ever used.  It fits on the bed and stays in place.
5	1384473600	I had this type of hypoallergenic mattress cover back in 2008 which I paid over $80 at a mattress store. However, when I bought a new mattress this year and shopped online and saw the Hana Kay mattress for under $30, I was skeptical, but I read the reviews that reassured me that this was the real deal and it is. This mattress cover is just as good, if not better than the $80 competitors.
2	1384473600	Purchased this for our brand new king size mattress and as a result now have a mattress that is destroyed. My son slept in our bed last night and had an accident which went right through the 100% WATERPROOF mattress protector destroying the mattress. If you do not have children nor animals this would be a good protector as it stays put, but it should not be advertised as 100% waterproof as I can assure you it is false advertising. Shame on the Hanna Kay.
5	1384473600	What to say...used under my sheet, it is working fine i tested with water. I do not see any issue after using of two months.
5	1384387200	So I gave up my king size bed and needed a new mattress cover. The bed place wanted to sell me one for $75.00 but I took a chance on this one and find it to be the same type as the one I had for my king size bed for half the price. I haven't had a major spill yet but I think I will be ok.
1	1384387200	Noisy and HOT!  My feet couldn't find a cool spot in the bed at all last night (the first and last night I used it).  Kept hearing crumpling sound whenever I moved around.  Boxed back up today to return it.Granted, both my husband and I like it cool when we sleep.  We're in our 30's and are of average weight.
5	1384387200	So far so good already had my daughter dump her whole water bottle on her bed and the mattress was not wet at all. I haven't had it long and it's only been through 1 wash so I can't comment on how long it will last but good for now and good for the price
2	1384387200	One of the key reasons I bought this particular protector was the note that it is &#34;100% Waterproof.&#34; This is a false claim. It didn't appear to be waterproof, but we tried it anyway. My young child sometimes still has accidents while sleeping; one such incident demonstrated the failure of this product. At that point, we bought a vinyl cover from a local merchant and used it on the bed.
5	1384387200	Great product, great price. It feels a little &#34;plasticky&#34; but it does what it's supposed to. Our daughter has frequent nose bleeds at night and this works great protecting her mattress from getting stained. Easy to wash.
5	1384387200	Does exactly what you would expect it to do! And it's nice that the protector isn't noisy under the sheet either.
5	1384300800	One of my dogs is incontinent, and this mattress protector has saved our new mattress 3 or 4 times already when she has accidents while she sleeps. We've washed it after each accident, and it's held up beautifully. Ordering a second one to swap out because it's held up so well. There wasn't any smell at first, and the top layer is not noticeable at all. Nothing bad to say about it.
4	1384300800	It seems to be as good as the one that I replaced which lasted 10 years.  Terry exterior keeps it from being so slippery for sheeting and so far is staying on the mattress quite well.
4	1384214400	my baby used to pee a lot on my mattress so i decided to buy this to protect my mattress.it seems to serve the purpose.i haven't washed it though so will give an update after i put it in the washer.
5	1384214400	I bought this proctector to help with mine and my wife's allergies with dander.  The first night we installed this made a huge difference.  This pad, combined with the Allersoft pillow cases made all the difference.  What a great night sleep.This pad doesn't make any noise whatsoever (no more than the old matress).As of now I am very happy with this purchase and will definately get another in the future if this one ever wears out.
5	1384214400	This product turned out to be the exact same product I spent more money for at another site. So I'm very happy I was able to save 35% off my previous buy.
5	1384214400	Hello all, I have this product in use for awhile and completely satisfied with it. I appreciate that is hypoallergenic and that is why I purchased it and it has help with my allergies and in turn that helps me get a good nights sleep. Thanks for producing such a good product. Dewayne Woolf
5	1384041600	Fit well on pillow top queen mattress.  Comfortable to sleep on and doesn't make noise when rolling around even tough it is water proof.  Easy to clean and well made.
5	1383955200	This is fabulous! I bought it months ago when my husband, who has Alzheimer's, started becoming occassionally incontinent during the day. However, it had never been put to the test until last night. It completely protected the mattress pad even though the protector was soaked for probably two or three hours. Not a drop came through to the pad. Besides the great waterproof protection, it is comfortable, not noticable under the sheet, and doesn't trap body heat like plastic would. One side benefit due to the textured surface is that it does help keep the bottom fitted sheet in place better than the surface of the mattress pad. Highly recommended!
5	1383955200	I'm very happy with this mattress pad. We just bought a new mattress and this fits perfectly. It's not too thick so the sheets stay on the bed and don't slide around. I'm going to buy another one.
5	1383868800	These work very well.  The fit on my sons beds is great.  With potty training, I got to put it to test.  It passed!  The mattress was very well protected.  I washed the protector and it came out like new.
5	1383868800	Fits deep mattress well.  Is comfortable. Does not make noise.  Does not make sleepers hot.  Will see how it wearsovertime.
5	1383782400	The item is soft and does not have synthetic materials so it is not noisy. I feel safe and assured that I'm sleeping in a clean environment every night.
5	1383782400	Work great! This is what i am looking for to protect my brand new Tempurpedic mattress from my kid's accident.
5	1383782400	Waterproof (tested unfortunately), that doesn't make you hot while you sleep & is not noisy. Best product of its kind on the market. With 4 kids, I've had quite a few!
5	1383696000	Absolutely love this product. My daughter woke up in the middle of the night and vomitted in Bed. This mattress cover protected moisture from getting into the mattress. I just washed the cover and it was clean. Would recommend this anyday.
5	1383696000	Works really well. No odor, fits my queen mattress well with deep pockets. Will hopefully keep my mattress protected for the long run.
5	1383696000	Works great, No issues, dog has peed on bed with it and did not soak through. Washed it on regular cycle, air dried it, and turned out fine. Soft, does not crinkly when laying on it. Did not notice a issue with temperature, but I do have a small mattress pad covering it.
5	1383696000	Love Love this mattress protector! It was a little more expensive than some of the others I saw here on amazon, but I bought it because I wanted one that was waterproof and quiet and this fit the bill! We haven't had any problems with this being noisy, and it's so easy to clean! I definitely feel like this was a purchase that will keep paying for itself, because I feel like it will extent the life and quality of my mattress!
5	1383696000	These are just great. I have cats that like to vomit - yes I know that is gross. I wanted to protect my bed. It is not like sleeping on a nasty plastic waterproof sheet at all. Its also most like a combo of tyvek and toweling. Put a regular sheet on over the top and you wouldn't know. It has saved by bed!
5	1383609600	Purchased this mattress cover for our guest room when my elderly father came for a stay. Needed to protect our mattress. This cover worked very well and laundered well also. Great value for the price.
4	1383609600	I purchased this to protect a new mattress in my guest room.  I was happy to find that it has nice deep pockets and was easy to fit around the new mattress.  I haven't tested the waterproof claim, and I hope to never need to.  However, it is soft and comfortable.  I would buy it again.
5	1383523200	This cover is soft and it does not have that annoying crinkly-plastic feel and sound like other waterproof covers I have had in the past. The entire cover, including the sides is well made, fits easily, stays tucked around the mattress, and washes and dries perfectly in my washer and dryer.
5	1383523200	Arrived in great condition, easy to use and fits well with our memory foam Queen mattress. had a couple episodes of our 3 year old having an accident, protected mattress well. no complaints. will buy again.
5	1383523200	Got this for a mattress/bed we were passing on to someone else (there's always that spilled Coke spot or something :) Checked it out when it arrived (very promptly - kudos to mfg) and it was very nice quality and fully served the purpose. Thinking of getting another for the replacement bed.
5	1383523200	As a pretty messy and clumsy person by nature, it isn't an option to not have a mattress cover. My last one ripped during nightly bed exercises and I had a brief period of going without a cover on my something-pedic mattress. In this short period of time a mug of tea, a messy meal, and many cups of water were spilled. With the Hanna Kay Premium protector I can keep up my bad habits and be sure that nothing will get through to stain my mattress. The soft texture makes it extremely unique in that it doesn't make noise! There's nothing worse than going to sit on your bed and it makes that awful plastic noise of most protectors. It was also much easier to get on than some others I have used and hasn't been hard to keep on. Would buy again.
5	1383523200	I ordered a mattress cover so when my young child occasionally sleeps in my bed with me, I wouldn't have to worry about any accidents. The cover fits well, is breathable and is large enough to cover my pillow top mattress and my down-alternative pillow too on top of my mattress. I am very happy with my purchase.
5	1383436800	Awesome protector! Fit well with my bed and I will buy another if I ever need another one. Highly recommended.
5	1383350400	One of our cats peed on my new mattress and this completely blocked any from going through. I washed it and it's back on the mattress with no scent or shrinkage. What else can I say? It saved the day.
5	1383350400	The order came a day earlier than promised, and everything was exactly as described.  The sheets were WONDERFUL, and the mattress pad is softer than I expected from the reviews.  Great products, great price, early delivery.  Yay!
5	1383264000	I have always bought a mattress protector just for the sake of saving an expensive item from wear and tear.Recently my little Chihuahua must have been upset leaving her home/ waited longer than she could hold... had peed on my comforter and upon further inspection saw it went all the way though... I was so upset til I got to the mattress..What a relief that my new mattress was completely clean and unharmed. I would buy another in a heart beat.
4	1383264000	Fits my mattress like a glove (right size:), no plastic sound, soft, feels like a quality product.I never washed it so I'm not sure how the product will perform after.
5	1383264000	Excellent this protector is a lot stronger than others I have purchased beforeBecause it is deep it hugs the mattress and remains in placeApart from that it is very comfortable Tolkien as it has a towel like surface on top of the plasticExcellent
4	1383177600	This fit my 10" just fine.  4-stars for some excess heat, but I don't wake up from it.  Much better than other mattress protectors.
5	1383177600	This is a good quality mattress pad that i would purchase again when i need another i would recommend it to others.
5	1383177600	i am very pleased with this product. It works great. Deff keeps matress super clean and dry. I would recommend to anyone.
5	1383177600	Very good product. It works very well to protect the mattress. esp if you have kids like us who has a 2 year old.
5	1383177600	It was shipped fast and one arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find it fit perfect and was still soft exactly as the ad describes. If and when I ever need more of these I will definitely come back or this seller. Thank you
5	1383177600	I got this for a twin bed my 2 year old is sleeping it, would highly recommend this matters protector.
5	1383091200	The cover fits well and has a soft outer surface. I put this in a spare bedroom that the grandson sleeps in but wanted a cover that adult guest won't mind.
5	1383091200	I've never had good luck with mattress covers.  Regardless of price, most are cheaply made, smell like toxins, and are noisy.  This one doesn't have any of those negative qualities.  I read a lot of the reviews here and took a chance.  The price was good and it arrived quickly. This says I'm reviewing the queen size but I bought the king size, not that size would make a difference.  So far, I'm happy and would buy it again.
1	1383091200	Washed and put into dryer and mattress pad melted and stuck together. I was so disappointed I tossed it out.
4	1383091200	Bought a new mattress to protect with this cover.  Haven't washed it or had any pet accidents on it yet. So far so good.
5	1383004800	I have been searching for a good mattress protector for a while. Finally found the best one. I will surely recommend it to my friends!!!
5	1383004800	This Hanna Kay Mattress pad is great, it is water proof and you cannot even tell it is on the bed.  It washes great and does not change the feel of your mattress.  I would highly recommend this mattress pad, it was just what I was looking for.
4	1383004800	I just bought a new memory foam mattress and wanted to protect it and keep it new as possible. I was very pleased with how fast this mattress protector got to me, it was shipped out much faster than estimated. I was a little worried that being waterproof, that the protector was going to have a lot of plastic in it and that I'd hear it crinkle loudly every time I moved. But as advertised, it does not make any noise at at all.
5	1383004800	I ordered this for my new Foam bed and it fits, looks, and feels great on my bed!  The protectant side is sturdy for any water spilled so that it will not ruin my new mattress.  It also had a 10 year warranty with is good to know!
5	1383004800	I purchased two Hanna Kay Premium Waterproof Mattress Protectors for twin beds in our guest bedroom for our grandchildren.  They were exactly as advertised on Amazon and fit the beds perfectly.  I have not washed the protectors yet but they look very durable and I will follow the suggested washing instructions.  I researched other brands of mattress protectors and the Hanna Kay brand offered the best quality for the best price.
5	1383004800	this product met my expectations.  Its softer than the last one i bought and is still the same price. also its washable!!
5	1382918400	I've had this mattress pad for a few weeks now and it has been in constant use since I got it.  It feels really good, stays well on the mattress and does not 'sound' waterproof.  By that, I mean that you do not get a plastic rustling sound as in others I have purchased. So far it's the best I have ever bought.
4	1382832000	I mainly got this because we just got a memory foam mattress and got this to mainly protect the mattress from any drink spills or from getting it sweat smelly from hot nights.  It does it's job well, but nothing has challenged it to do what it says, being waterproof and all.  It's a little noisy when moving around on the bed (I tend to toss and turn a lot), and that's my only complaint.
5	1382832000	I got two bed-wetting boys right now and these mattress covers hold up to almost daily washing.  Never had a leak through on their brand new mattresses.  The mattresses and the covers look brand new!
5	1382832000	I was in the market for a waterproof mattress cover for my rv. I have allergies so this is hypoallergenic not to heavy and it was the perfect cover for my needs...
1	1382745600	This was not made for a new queen size mattress.  It would not fit at all.  Felt it was a waste of time and money.
5	1382745600	Completely satisfied with the buy. After I bought a new mattress, this was the one recommended, and it's been as good as I had heard.
5	1382745600	Bought to be used by someone else and used the written reviews to purchase. did not have any complaints from person using it no loud plastic crackling
5	1382659200	it works great. I am using it for my kids. Price is what I expected too.  Washing is easy and dry.
5	1382659200	No problems with this mattress pad. Great price, perfect fit, can't complain! We've ordered other ones from the largest supermarket chain and we like this one much more.
5	1382659200	Not too difficult getting onto my son's twin mattress. As stated in earlier reviews, the cover does not get too hot though it does reflect a bit of heat, enough to feel it but not be too bothered by it. While the kid has yet to have an accident, he does tend to get sweaty at night and the cover kept the underlying mattress dry. So far so good so I'll go ahead and recommend this product.
5	1382572800	With a grandson that has a wetting problem it was great to buy this mattress cover. It doesn't shift or bunch, and is cool. He feels comfortable and not lying directly on a pad, but instead on the cool sheets is so good for him both physically and mentally. He is relaxed and feels like a big boy now. And, we are able to keep the mattress protected too. Thank you.
4	1382572800	This mattress protector works great. It's a little thinner than I would like - I have another one that has more padding that seems more comfortable - but otherwise this is fine. I like that it did not contain an overwhelming smell of chemicals when I opened it.
5	1382572800	Our son wet the bed once since we put this cover on. It kept the mattress completely dry. Its not a noisy cover either, soft and quiet.
5	1382486400	We bought this to replace one we had that had a plastic backing.  It is perfect.  It fit nicely on the bed and was delivered in record time.  Great company to work with as far as the product being as advertised.  It was nice & soft & no more loud noises of the plastic when moving around!  Highly recommend!
5	1382486400	The Hanna Kay mattress protector top is very soft. The waterproof material is also soft and not obvious like some others I've tried.  I've washed it twice and so far it looks like new.
4	1382486400	We use this mattress protector on a queen size memory foam mattress. It works as described and arrived in two days. Pleased with the purchase.
5	1382486400	We've tried others and none have come up to this quality, well worth the money. It stays in place and you wouldn't know it's even there.
4	1382486400	When I first received this mattress protector I was a bit disappointed because I was thinking it would be thick, plush and cozy like mattress pads I have used in the past.  Well, the title is protector, not pad.  We had just bought a new mattress for our 3 year old daughter and I left on the old mattress pad underneath this new mattress protector to give a little extra padding and coziness.  Thank goodness I had put on this new protector because not even a week after owning the new mattress, my daughter had an accident and wet the bed.  I immediately stripped the blankets and new sheets off (soaked through), frantic to get everything off before soaking through to the new mattress.  I thought for certain that the mattress would be ruined, but this mattress protector held it all off the mattress pad and the new mattress!  The urine was actually pooled and slowly soaking into the top cotton layer, while the plastic under layer ensured no leaks.  I was so relieved.  I immediately put it into the washer and it came out without any lingering urine smell and no discoloration.This protector has a rough, thin, terry cloth-like-feeling on the top side and a plastic-like-feeling on the underside.  The contents tag reads: 80% cotton, 20% polyester, Support 100% Impermeable. Care Instructions are machine wash warm or cold, low dry 125*F max.  I line dried to prevent any possible shrinkage and because I don't like putting plastic-feeling things in my dryer. This could be why it feels a little rough to the touch. I washed in cold when I first received it, and washed in warm after the accident without any negative side effects.  As a side note, there is no plastic smell associated with this product-yea!-even though it's made in China.I'm still using the mattress pad under this mattress protector for extra plushness, and that is the only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars.  I just wish it was thick and plush in addition to being waterproof. I can't deny that it saved my brand new mattress (my #1 goal), even though I don't like the thin, rough feel.
5	1382400000	We just got two of these and I really cannot say much yet except that I am very happy with the feel of the mattress pad and with the depth of the sides (so they will not slip off) and the quality seems very good.  I just washed them and put them on the bed.  They do seem thin, but from what I read, that is just the way they are because they have a super thin &#34;special&#34; waterproof membrane.  They do not seem noisy or hot which is what I cannot stand in a waterproof mattress pad.
4	1382400000	The mattress protector looks sturdy and fits the mattress snugly.  It looks like it would also fit much thicker mattresses than the twelve inch mattress I have it on.  It appears to be quite leak-proof, but so far there haven't been any problems where it would have been needed, so I can't comment on mattress protection.  If I find out that it protects well and goes through the wash well, I'll up the rating to five stars.
5	1382400000	Our son has this on his brand new mattress and has had a few accidents, however the mattress has remained dry thanks to this high quality mattress protector!
4	1382400000	It fit my queen mattress great. It's soft. Doesn't make a plastic crunch sound when you roll over on the bed. So far so good. I haven't tested it with liquids because didn't want to clean up the mess.
5	1382400000	This is a great mattress protector.  I use it for my four year old who wets the bed fairly frequently.  It does not leak through and holds up to washing well. I've had it about six months.  In fact the package encourages you to wash it before using as it is a little softer after being washed. It kind of feels like think terry cloth on one side with a plasticy/rubbery coating on the other side which makes it water proof. It is thin and I don't notice it under his sheet at all.
5	1382400000	We love this for our daughter's bed and will most likely be ordering another for our bed since she likes to sleep in ours and still not full able to stay dry at night.  We were always buying the cheap plastic covers before that were loud, and ripped far too easily.  This will save us so much money and looks far better than the cheap plastic.  I have washed this numerous times so far and although it does have a hole in it, its just along a seam and super easy to fix, this has been great!  Highly recommended!
4	1382313600	Don't know if it could handle a big spill or accident because its pretty thin,but  fine for sweat or minor stain prevention.
5	1382313600	I have had this mattress protector for a few months now and wish I had bought it sooner. Not noisy or hot and is very thin so I was a little skeptical but it works great. Would definitely buy again.
5	1382313600	The mattress proctor works and feel wonderful.  The price was a bargain.  Happy with the 10 year warranty also.Will definitely buy this product or other prodects from Hanna Kay in the future.Thank You......Hanna Kay.Jeff H. from Oregon
5	1382313600	We were very happy with the mattress protector. It arrived promptly and was exactly as described. The price seems a great value. We would buy this item again, and we would purchase from this seller again.
3	1382227200	It fits, it works... it's okay.There was an oder so I washed it, hung it up and sprayed it with scented Lysol.
5	1382140800	Everything seems to work as advertised. Although I haven't had a chance to to truly test it yet so I might have to change this when I do.
5	1382140800	I have a daughter that is potty training and i bought these for her bed. She has had only one accident, but it held up. I sleep on one for my bed, because they prevent mites and water spills. It is not hot or sweaty, it seems nice. I would buy them again.
5	1382140800	Item was delivered quickly.  Fits pillow top mattress very nicely, comfortable, quiet, so far, so good.  Would recommend to anyone needing a mattress protector.
5	1382054400	We were very pleased our purchase of this Queen size mattress pad.  It fit perfectly and provides excellent coverage for our Mother's bed.  She did not even realize that the bed size item was installed, which means there is no noise associated with the pad.  Thank you for this great product.
5	1382054400	RECIEVED THE MATTRESS PROTECTOR TODAY. VERY HIGH END COVER. SUPER NICE TERRY MATERIAL. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALSO VERY GOOD. DONT HESITATE BUY THIS MATRESSS COVER.
5	1382054400	This mattress pad fits well, creates no noise and GREAT price.  My 3 year old grandson hasn't christened it yet so I can't comment on how waterproof it is!.
5	1382054400	This product was exactly as it was described in the description.  I am very happy with this item and it seems to be durable enough as well without being intrusive on the feel of the bed.
4	1382054400	This does the job well and protects my bed from a dog that enjoys getting his paws wet from time to time. It does feel a bit stiff once you initially put it on but it breaks in quickly and feels good.
4	1382054400	I bought this cover about a month ago to protect my new mattress' warranty. My new mattress is a queen size pillow top and very thick but the mattress cover completely covers it and stays on. It hasn't moved since I put it on a month ago. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't tested the "waterproof" attribute but I'm fairly confident that it will. I'd reccommend this to a friend.
5	1381968000	We got this for my 3 year old's "big boy" double bed since we knew he would have some overnight potty accidents.  Sure enough, he has had a few accidents and this mattress pad cover has protected our mattress just as it was designed to!  The only surprise about this item is that it's a microfiber material, almost looking like the top is terry cloth.  Looks a little odd but it works!
5	1381968000	It is confortable and soft. The price was amazing, and it is waterproof. 100% safisfied and would recommended to anyone. I primarily use it to prevent from the musky smell of my basement room to seep into the mattress - good times.
5	1381968000	I ordered two of these to protect our mattresses.  I love that they are waterproof but they are not plastic-y.  You do not feel or hear this cover at all.  They are very thin, which is all I wanted.  I wasn't looking for a pad, just a protector.  These are perfect!!!
3	1381968000	I've never had a chance to test its water repelling abilities, so I can't judge that. But although it's not TOO warm to lie on, it doesn't breath particularly well, so it does get a little warm sometimes. But most surprising to me was that moving on it is a little noisy. Not a plastic crinkling, but still a little loud. Finally, it does tend to generate a little static electricity. Otherwise it seems fine.
4	1381968000	I purchased this for my 4 year old son's new bed. It fits great. Fortunately we haven't had any recent accidents but so far seems like it will hold up just fine.
4	1381968000	This cover fits our 14&#34; foam mattress perfectly.  It is nearly identical to the $160 (2 covers) we purchased from the store.  To be fair, the product sold in stores represents itself as a 3rd party warranty for damage to the mattress.  Reading through the disclaimer, we found there was 0 value in that warranty & returned the  store product.Comfortable, thin cotton layer protected with some polyester for some protection against moisture.  Breathes & does not generate heat.
5	1381968000	This mattress protector is just what I was looking for. It's easy to put on due to the flexible corners, and is light weight.
1	1381881600	I don't pee the bed and neither does my girlfriend so I guess this is my fault.  My girlfriend made me get a mattress protector so I got this one based on the reviews.  When I receiving it I was unhappy because it was like sleeping on a Walmart shopping bag.  I don't think this protector is for adults.  I think it's for kids who pee.  If your kid pees get this. This will protect your mattress from a substantial amount of pee.  If you are over the age of 8, you don't need this.  If you are and you or your significant other still pees the bed, you don't need this either.  You need a doctor
1	1381881600	It wasn't what I expected.  I expected it to be a complete cover with a zipper to enclose the entire mattress.
2	1381881600	I got this because my child sometimes sleeps in our bed (nightmares) and has had "accidents."  This is especially bad because we have a foam mattress topper.  The listing says this mattress protector is "breathable," yet I found it unbearably hot!  I actually tried it out for nearly a week, but then returned it.  I ended up using an old waterproof matress protector and topping it with the Deluxe 100% Cotton Damask Stripe Mattress Pad (sold here on Amazon).  Ahhhh, much better!
5	1381881600	Nice, white, clean, washes up well. No shrinkage or fraying. Does what it is supposed to do, cushion your sleep
3	1381881600	I didn't wash it prior to first use as the package instructs but there is no smell associated with the product.  It is not "crinkly" like other plastic backed mattress protectors.  Much softer, pliable and looks more durable than a more expensive one I bought at JC Penney.  The proof will be when I wash it, not sure how it will hold up.
4	1381881600	Perfect for our Black Beautyrest.  The mattress is effectively protected, yet, it is the mattress you feel and not the cover/protector.
4	1381881600	This is a good, basic mattress cover.  It doesn't entirely enclose the mattress like some others, but provides all the protection I need.
1	1381881600	For all of the people on here saying you can't hear it and you don't notice that it's even on the bed - I am concerned for your hearing.  It sounds like you are laying on a bed sized diaper.  And it even feels odd too.  If you get in bed and lay perfectly still all night, buy it.  Or if you are deaf.  But if you plan on even twitching a muscle at some point, forget it.
4	1381881600	Good mattress protector for the price. I paid almost $70 at a mattress store for a twin so this was a much better deal here.
5	1381881600	This protector fits perfectly onto my king mattress, and I feel very comfortable on it. I have not washed it yet, it is very good so far. Nice price too.
5	1381881600	I got this for my three year-old's bed when we stopped diapers to protect the mattress.  It keeps everything dry. I
5	1381881600	High quality product that fits well and is well made. I would definitely buy again. In fact I will be buying another.
5	1381795200	love it i order this produc 2 days ago and i gat in infron of my door the day afther i place the order it feet on my bed perfectly and it look realy durable ^_^
5	1381795200	This is a very good mattress protector.  It fits very well on a deeper mattress and holds up nicely in the wash, much better than other mattress protectors we have purchased.  Shipping was super fast!!!
2	1381795200	The thing is super thin, and a bit plastic-y feeling. My dogs ate it in one week so I can't say if it did it's job or not, but I guess it would have. I bought another from wal mart, same price, better quality (and yet to be eaten)
5	1381795200	I bought this one as a gift after I purchased a cali king size on for myself. My sister and I were given beds by a friend who was moving, they were really nice beds yet the mattresses were showing signs of use. This cover fits prefect and stays in place. I was worried it may shift or slide up on sides as sometimes fitted sheets do.
5	1381795200	works as indicated. I have a baby that sleeps in the bed with us and this is good for when there are the occasional diaper leaks ...
5	1381795200	We needed something to protect a mattress in case of an accident. So far no issue but it does fit nice and easy to work with. Arrived nice and quick.
5	1381708800	We bought this mattress pad to replace our pad that was falling apart.  I slept much better as soon as we put it on. It does make a little crinkly noise, but it's not very noticeable, and I never notice it when I'm sleeping. We also have a very deep mattress, and this pad covers it easily.
5	1381708800	I have absolutely no complaints. received the cover fast, put it on the mattress and basically forgot all about it (no noise or sweating or different sleeping...). Havent had any accidents yet, so I cant attest as to how it would do...
5	1381708800	Good quality, soft on one side, fits well, easy to wash, does not fall apart.I haven`t spilled anything yet, but it looks like it won`t let liquid to go through.
5	1381708800	Item is a replacement for a non waterproof mattress pad that didn't last 2 yrs.  So far this one looks solid and has a great warranty.
5	1381708800	This item provides great coverage.  It fits snugly and protects against moisture and or bugs. The size is appropriate and ?I wold definitely buy this item again.
5	1381708800	This is a great mattress pad.  I have a gelfoam mattress and it fits perfectly and protects well.  I would recommend, but make sure you get the right size to fit your mattress.
4	1381708800	I recently bought a new mattress and put quite an investment in on it and wanted to keep it protected. I had one I that I had bought not too long ago. I forgot to turn the heat down when I dried it and it melted itself together. This protector is a little thicker than my last (Newpoint Terry mattress protector). It did do the job, I got that one because of the price. It did protect from a few possible stains. I was a little concerned when I saw how thick the plastic coating layer was and didn't want the sound of a plastic bag in the bed, but it doesn't sound like plastic at all and I don' t notice that it is even on the bed. I'll update after I have washed it again.
5	1381622400	I bought a new mattress so I needed a protector for it. I received this item a couple months ago. I am very happy. Its comfortable, you don't even know it's there. I have a 1 year old that sleeps with  me often, my mattress is not ruined yet, so the protector is doing a great job. :)
4	1381536000	Feels very comfortable. I can't tell if it is a true membrane material (like Gortex) or a micro-laminate spray (the latter not being as durable to wear and washing).  However seems pretty good for the price if it will last 10 years.
5	1381449600	This is the second mattress cover I bought of this brand and size. They are  used on my children's beds and works great at protecting the mattress from night time accidents. I would recommend to others.
5	1381449600	I have an older cat who somtimes peed in the bed.  I bought this mattress protector and placed it over the mattress pad and it stopped the urine stain from getting to the mattress pad.
5	1381449600	We have had good luck with keeping the bed dry while using this mattress protector to save our three year olds bed during potty training. It fits the mattress well and washes and dries nicely!
5	1381449600	Very happy with the Hanna Kay Premium Waterproof Mattress Protector. Great quality, great price and quick delivery. Will recommend and will purchase for future mattresses.
5	1381449600	Nice product, I gave it as a gift to a friend. fits well and resist stains from food or drinks if you like take breakfast on your bed.
5	1381363200	This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Waterproof mattress protector; machine washable; all mattress depths applied. It might be pricy but try it and your will know its worth every penny!!! HIGHLY recommend :D
5	1381363200	Great protector for a great price.  It is not noisy and it washes well.  It was already &#34;put to the test,&#34; and it completely protected the mattress.  We are planning on buying one for all of our kid's beds.
5	1381363200	Great product.  Inexpensive, but seems like it will hold up.  It was the other positive reveiwers who convinced me to get this.  I would recommend.
1	1381363200	I really wanted to love this mattress protector. I had done a lot of research and this seemed perfect - thin, waterproof, terry cloth material, etc. However, it was just not comfortable. It will change the feel of your mattress. If you have a very firm mattress, it may work just fine. The item fits fine, but it crackles. I went from loving my bed to hating it.
5	1381363200	This protector is very efficient. My son has special needs and has not mastered toilet training yet, so this comes handy. I have tried several of these, but this is the best one I have ever bought in terms of quality. Also the price is so affordable compared to the high quality of the item.
5	1381363200	Awesome, bought it for my 3 yr old who is under potty training. it worked as it advertised, we are happy abt it.
5	1381276800	This item came shipped in a pretty compact box, I couldn't believe the whole mattress actually fit inside. I have been using it for over a month now and must say I'm very satisfied. It is very comfortable, and for the price you pay I don't think there is a better deal in terms of value.
5	1381276800	I LOVE this mattress protector! Honestly I bought it because it was cheap and got OK reviews. I figured I would never really need the waterproofing so it wouldn't matter much. It was comfortable, quiet and fit perfectly over my 18" pillow top mattress, so I was content with just that. Then just 2 weeks after I put it on, my dog had a seizure on my bed and there were all types of pet bodily fluids all over my bed which I didn't discover until much later in the day. I was ready cry until I remembered the protector. When I took it off, my bed was completely untouched! It washed and dried beautifully! I was so thrilled that I went right to amazon and bought 2 more! Then I told my entire family to go and buy them...some have pets with issues and some have small children. I LOVE this mattress protector! This was truly the BEST purchase I ever made on amazon! It saved my bed & for that, I can't thank the company enough or brag about this product enough!
5	1381276800	his cover keeps the mattress dry with every accident! We just bought our toddler a bedroom set with a new memory foam mattress and really didn't want to have to replace it after he was finished potty training. But we didn't want the cheap plastic crinkling mattress cover. We found this one and thought we would give it a try. It has worked perfectly.
5	1381276800	Deep pockets with soft top.  It stays in place with sleeping.  Not as waterproof as previous pads I have purchased.
5	1381276800	This is soft, flexible, quiet and washes very well. I have an 11year old with autism that wets almost every night. The ones I had (I had three to rotate) before lasted about 7 years (with washings two to three times a week) before the backing started to come off making them no longer water proof. I love this product and will keep buying the same one until it is no longer necessary. I highly recommend this mattress pad.
5	1381190400	It is a practical bed covers. Not much space, and it shows that it is posted. No sound at bedtime on.
5	1381190400	Great Product!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a mattress pad.  This product fits the taller mattresses very well.
5	1381190400	bought this to preserve the lifetime of my mattress. i haven't spilled anything yet or whatnot, so i haven't exactly test its preserving qualities, but it's comfortable, i don't notice it, etc. ergo, happy customer.
5	1381190400	This is a nice, thin but waterproof, mattress pad that does not make any of the normal crinkling sounds that so many waterproof pads do. I bought it for a twin size sofa bed, which means it is a bit large for the mattress, but with the elastic adjustable height sides, it molds very well.
5	1381190400	we have this on our bed for when our 2 year old son comes in, in case of accidents. i wondered if it would feel like there was plastic when you lie on it, but you cant at all. he's spilt water, and wet the bed, and this has protected our mattress really well
4	1381190400	Nice as it does not add to the thickness of an already over filled pillow top. Fit is good but would have preferred larger skirt with stronger elastic to firm up the position.Also, be warned about washing instructions...do it wrong and this will be a another layer of nothing.
5	1381104000	cover was as expected and fit perfectly.  Great price too.  Very happy with this product.  Not too thick or tight.
5	1381017600	My daughters love their bed, and when I had to sleep with my four year old a few nights, it was pretty comfortable. Good support. We shall see how long this mattress will last. So far so good.
5	1381017600	The mattress protector fits perfectly on my queen memory foam mattress I got here on Amazon as well. Haven't had to wash it yet, and haven't tried the waterproof capabilities yet either. It has a thin towel fabric on top and an elastic fabric on the sides. I did not expect that, since other protectors I've had, have a more plush soft feel, but it doesn't bother me, I just need to protect my mattress and it's doing the job.
1	1380931200	Sleeping on the Hanna Kay Premium Mattress protecter is like sleeping on a plastic bag. Hot and noisy. What a waste of my hard earned money. I can not recommend this mattress cover .
5	1380931200	This mattress protector is well-built with high quality materials, and I felt the price was very fair for what was delivered. There are no bells and whistles, and it just does what it's supposed to do. I'm very pleased with this product, and would not hesitate to buy another!
5	1380931200	Light, does not make noise, fits mattress well. So far so good. Thinking about purchasing more for my other mattresses.
4	1380844800	I have had this mattress protector for a few months now, and I have not had any issues with it.  Upon receiving it, I washed it with other bedding and ran it through the dryer on a medium low temperature per the instructions without any issues.  It did have a chemical odor just out of the package, but this is to be expected, and is easily fixed by washing it.  It fit well on my queen mattress; it wasn't too snug or too loose, and it allowed for deeper pockets for thicker mattresses.  The terry-cloth surface on the top is soft and unobtrusive, and it helps reduce any noise made by the protector.  At first I noticed a slight amount of noise when you move around with this on the bed, but it is not irritating and I got used to it quickly.  It seems like a small price to pay for a cleaner mattress and sleeping surface.  Overall, I would recommend this mattress protector as a good option to protect your health and investment in a nice mattress.
5	1380844800	I bought two of this item.  We have a Shih Tzu puppy and there are times she will not make it off the bed to go to the weewee pad.  This product works!!!  Also, the one on my daughter's bed..well..she spilled koolaid (which she was not suppose to have in her room) on her bed and it worked!!!The price was great, this product works!  You have to be sure not to dry it on high in the dryer but other than that, I highly recommend!!!Debra
5	1380844800	Good value for the money. Fits nice and does the trick. Others that I have bought do not cover the sides either so not sure what the other review is talking about.
5	1380758400	The cover fits the mattress well without any unpleasant odors or sound effects that some protective covers give out.  Appreciate the prompt service from Perella's.
4	1380758400	The protector fit great, and it seems to do the job.  I just wanted something to keep moisture away from my mattress.  I would buy this product again.
5	1380758400	I  ordered 2  of  these  mattress  pad  covers.  They  were  exactly  what  was  shown  and very  nice  in  comparison  to  others  we  have  purchased  elsewhere. I  would  recommend  these  to  anyone  who  has  children  who  like  to  sneak  food/ drinks  to  their  rooms.
5	1380758400	I have this same mattress pad on my own bed and when looking for something for my daughter's bed, knew this was what I wanted.  It is inexpensive and really is waterproof.  Very pleased.
5	1380758400	The item was shipped in a timely manner. Put it on the bed right away and it's just like the one that we originally had on our bed. Highly recommeneded.
4	1380758400	Have not had any spills so far so I can't say how well it protects my mattress yet. But I do like the terrycloth finish. It does not make noise when you lay down and you wouldn't even know there was a protective layer under the sheets.
4	1380672000	really good for use in my bad.. its stop liquids going thru my bad and over all is washable ...
5	1380672000	This Protector fits the bed very well. I have yet to prove the 100% waterproof but it appears that it will not be a problem. Comfortable doesn't feel like a sheet of plastic:)
5	1380672000	This is a well constructed mattress pad and the price is very fair for what you're getting. Just follow the laundering directions and you won't have any problems.
5	1380585600	Loved it. It looks nice and work as advertised. It's worth every penny. Would surely recommend to others and will surely buy again if needed.
5	1380585600	This is on my toddlers bed and no leakage yet.  I do like this one, over others, for the terry cloth top...less 'plastic-y' feeling than others and I am not hearing it crinkle under him so I like that it's not too obvious.  Now my little one hasn't given it a really good soaking yet, so if that changes things I will update my review.
5	1380585600	The mattress protector I have bought is totally waterproof, and it stays white !! (I have a grandson who sometimes pees on my mattress)I can wash it in the washing machinethen I am happy with my purchase
5	1380585600	We were kind of trying to 'squeeze by' with ordinary queen mattress covers.... but ours needed such a deep fit (21= inches) ... this one was PERFECT! Finally our sheets stay in place when we make the bed! :) Love it!
5	1380499200	I bought this for my daughter's bed. We are currently potty training her.At first it smells like plastic but I air it out for a few days and the smell is gone.The top part is terry cloth and the other side is plastic material.It doesn't make any crinkle sound when she sleeps on it, so it doesn't bother her sleep.She wet her bed once and i didn't change the bed right away because i have to clean her up.The urine didn't leak. It is waterproof.All in all, we love this mattress protector.
5	1380499200	My son wets the bed 3-4 times a week.  We recently replaced his mattress and ordered this product to protect the new mattress.  It works great!  Nothing has ever leaked through.  It doesn't make noise like many of the other protectors and it fits great.
5	1380499200	This is a great product that should help combact mold and mildew that can occur with a mattress.Item was reasonably priced.I am very satisfied and received it sooner than expected.Thanks!
3	1380499200	I was hoping for a waterproof mattress protector that did not have a plasticy feel/sound/texture to it - which I have had in the past.  This mattress protector is not it.
5	1380153600	I haven't had any issues with the mattress cover. It fit perfectly, maybe a little big, but no big deal. I don't have children or anything. I purchased it simply to protect the bed with possible spills. I have not tested it, so I can't vouch for it preventing water. I can say it is quiet under the sheets and doesn't make that plastic rustling noise.
5	1380153600	fits my eurotop queen mattress 16 inch... great quality  good price, and does the job to protect my mattress, will buy more for other beds
5	1380153600	We liked this product well enough to buy 3 of them for our mattresses.  Both the price and the delivery was excellent.  I don't believe that you will be disappointed!
5	1380067200	So far so good :-) I do not have any complaints about the product. Very reasonably priced. I can keep my mattress warranty.
5	1380067200	I love the quality of this mattress topper. It is perfect for our guest bedroom.  Great price and great quality!
5	1380067200	The mattress pad is very lightweight yet feels comfortable to sleep on.  I have not washed it yet, but I am very happy with the way it fits on the mattress.
5	1380067200	no problems so far, when i first had it on i noticed it had a slight tendency to have a crinkly plastic sound, but i dont even notice it anymore. i have no issues with it. i also havent spilled anything on my bed yet so have not been able to test its functionality. Essentially I'm reviewing a product without any insight into knowing if it is effective or not... this review is equivalent to me buying a new phone and saying it runs great because it fits in my pocket nicely.
5	1380067200	I needed a waterproof mattress protector for my 4 year olds new mattress after moving him from his toddler bed. I was looking for something affordable, PVC free, washable, and this product fits the bill! It's soft and does not make that plasticky noise if someone else sleeps on the bed!  Would highly recommend this item and would buy it again. I have washed it several times and it seems to be holding up well.
5	1380067200	Awesome mattress cover good price too. As do all waterproof mattress covers it does make your body perspire a little at times but not as bad as others do.  Overall great service. Fast shipping. Thanks a bunch amazon.
5	1380067200	I am completely satisfied with this mattress protector.  I washed and dried it as soon as it arrived.  No problems.  It fits the bed nicely, doesn't make crackling noises when in use, and doesn't make you hot while sleeping on it.  I am happy to recommend this product to others, and will buy another when needed. I ordered and received a Twin size, not a Queen as indicated on the product description.
1	1380067200	This  mattress cover is made of terry clothe. So avoid this item unless you really enjoy sleeping on a towel!!!!
5	1380067200	Full coverage, not noisy, I like it. My daughter's diaper leaks sometimes, so I needed mattress protection and so far so good!!!! (But I expect it to remain this way) (:
5	1379980800	read the people who had problems but ours works great. You must put it on correctly and mind wash instructs...but works great
5	1379980800	I haven't spilled any water on it, but so far so good. I actually was impressed with the material and feel of it when I opened it. I bought a protecter a few years ago and it was horrible. this was much better already.
5	1379980800	The product does exactly what the description stated. It is waterproof, fits the mattress perfectly, and feels very comfortable under my son's sheets. Reasonable priced. It arrived very quickly and the package had very detailed instructions about the care of the product. I don't put it in the dryer though, just in case. Highly recommend.
4	1379980800	This mattress protector is really nice. Fits a deep mattress with plenty of room to spare. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that there is no padding on it, just terry cloth covering the waterproof part. It got here in great shape and was shipped very quickly. Would definitely order from this company again!
5	1379980800	I am currently using this mattress pad on my 4 year old son's twin bed. We have really put it to the test since my son is still currently nighttime potty training. He has had about 5 accidents with this mattress pad and none have seeped through. It washes up very nicely as well.
5	1379980800	This waterproof mattress is just that.  The mattress fits perfect on the pillowtop.  It is just the same as the regular type ones.  It makes no noise and is very comfortable.  When washed and dried it comes out just like new again.  Great protector.
5	1379980800	Fits perfectly and works great.  I haven't spilled anything  to check if it works as expected but looks pretty good. I will recommend it.
5	1379980800	A good protector. I washed it when I changed my mattress and then I covered it on my new mattress.
5	1379980800	This mattress protector has everything. Waterproof, hypoallergenic, 10 year warranty and a great price. Wish it had been available years ago when all we could buy were big bulky pads that didn't really protect anything and took forever to dry when laundered. This one was a gift for a college-bound granddaughter, as I have my own. Wonderful quality. And great service from a company you can trust.
5	1379894400	Much cheaper than the one they were trying to sell me at the store to protect the warranty on our new memory foam mattress.  The top is completely waterproof (the waterproof portion is only on the top, not on the sides), easy remove and to wash, no crinkly sound at all.  We have had no problems with it retaining heat.  Perfect for what we were looking for.
5	1379894400	We ordered this for our 2 year old who is potty training, and so far it works great, keeps the mattress dry and washes well.
5	1379894400	I haven't had this product very long and haven't tested its waterproofing, but it's not noticeable under my sheets and washes easily, which is a win in my book.
5	1379894400	This is a great mattress cover. It fits well and did not have a toxic smell.  The waterproof barrier functions well, also. We have it on a twin sized bed with our 2 year old son, and he has leaked on it more than once, with absolutely no moisture leaking through to the mattress.  I would order this again!
5	1379894400	Most waterproof covers sound like you are sleeping on plastic tarps, but this one is perfect for my light sleeper!
5	1379894400	Great product, I purchased the mattress protector for my mom (82). Great buy for the price;  keeps her cool and protects the mattress.
5	1379808000	This protector is thin, yet effective...you'll never know it's there until you take off your sheets to wash them.  Within just one month, our two year old has put this to the test and I'm happy to report that our new matress is still clean and dry as the day we bought it.  Recommend washing it alone and line dry because the plastic liner could be sensitive to heat and other clothes items washed with it.  Couldn't ask for a better mattress protector!
5	1379808000	We recently upgraded our youngest from a toddler bed to a twin "big boy bed". We had already made a big dent in potty training, but needed something for "accidents" or "ACCIDENTS", depending on what he drank that day. This thing is great. No leakage noticed so far. When he wakes up in the middle of the night upset...not much of a problem to get him cleaned up, dried off, linens changed, and ready to get back to bed. Definitely a good product.
4	1379721600	This protector is great, however, it isn't the thickness I was expecting, but it does do what it's supposed to do, which is prevent moisture.
4	1379635200	Got this in a queen...having worked for a mattress store that sold PABD, these are definitely in the zone...good price, and they react about the same in the dryer...when you wash and dry these make sure it's not the only thing in the wash, not high heat or bleach and you should be good.
5	1379462400	I was replacing a similiar mattress protector that I had for a few years and I was so pleased with the Hanna Kay waterproof mattress protector. It fits beautifully...nice deep pockets and it is waterproof. What I like the most is that it does make any "crunchy" noisies that alot of waterproof protectors do and because of the cotton/terrycloth,it is not hot...seems to breathe nicely. Highly recommend this product.
5	1379462400	love this product. Washes and dries great. Make sure you read directions. Fits great. Just got my second one. Would buy again!
5	1379462400	This was just the right thing to protect our mattress when we have young grandkids overnight. So we have used this with kids several times.
4	1379462400	I bought a queen size. Fit on the mattress was excellent. Works well. Great product. Pricing was the best on amazon.com.
5	1379376000	We are very pleased with this product.  We have two kids and between potty training and getting sick in the middle of the night, this product has kept our mattresses dry and clean!
4	1379376000	This mattress protector is nice for the price. I haven't tested it waterproof-ness, and don't plan to, but we had just bought a new mattress and I wanted protection for the warrantee to be effective. It's thin enough that it doesn't interfere with the memory foam gel top we have. It is quiet, I was afraid it might be crinkly, but it's soft, washed well, and just what I needed.
3	1379376000	This waterproof mattress cover fits my queen size mattress with room to spare.  The stretchy material on the sides is not flimsy and should stand up to the occasional tugging and pulling.  After the sheets are put on the bed, you can not feel the mattress cover underneath when you lay on it.  The cloth covering over the waterproof liner is similar to a thin terrycloth. It does not make noise, is soft and it doesn't seem to make the bed too hot. I have not washed it yet, so I do not know how it will hold up after washing.  For the price, so far, it is a good value.
5	1379376000	You can barely feel it is even there. Really come a long way from those old, annoying, plastic crinkly sheets!!
3	1379376000	The mattress protector is just fine.  It was purchased for a new mattress in my guest bedroom and it really has not been tested.  It did go over the mattress without any problems and I'm sure it will do just fine.
5	1379376000	It fits the bed great, and is quite like people say. My daughter has wet the bed, but I've always been to tired to check the mattress below the protector so can't honestly say how waterproof it is.
4	1379376000	We own a number of vacation rental homes and put these on all the beds. Like other brands of this type, they aren't 100% perfect - we have seen stains go through them - but they are better than plastic/vinyl/rubber protectors that crinkle and make sleeping on them difficult. These are soft and quiet and you don't even know they are on the bed, so they are a good compromise that provide acceptable protection.
4	1379376000	All in all this product is the best value I could find anywhere. With little cash but nothing to sit on in my new apartment, I had a hard time finding something that could suit me on both counts. Delivered reliably in two boxes, easily assembled in a very small amount of time, this set has worked perfectly for me. Its even pretty comfortable. It probably won't last more than a few years but thats to be seen- several months down the road and its still doing fine by me. If you can't afford much but have space to use I would absolutely recommend this set.
5	1379376000	Absolutely thrilled with this product and the speedy delivery!  Fits my bed perfectly and is very soft and comfortable while being protective.  It washed & dried wonderfully!  Highly recommend this product and company!
5	1379376000	This product is exactly as described.  It is heavy duty and fits our queen size bed with pillow top perfectly.
5	1379376000	This mattress pad was put to the test when my baby yorkie decided to tinkle on our mattress. It did not leak one bit and I love that you can't even tell it's on the bed.
5	1379289600	This mattress cover has been just what we need.  The fabric is surprisingly breathable, and it leaves us reassured that our mattress is protected even with a baby crawling around/ spitting up on the bed.  Though our little one does not co-sleep, there have been a surprising number of messes.  The cover has washed up nicely each time we have washed it.  Overall, I feel pretty satisfied.
2	1379203200	I've had two queen covers of this brand since my daughter was born and co-slept with us starting in April 2010. The covers didn't sleep as hot as other covers (because of the terry cloth top?) but not as cool as a regular mattress. My daughter had major reflux and the covers always stopped the milk from getting onto her mattress. So when she moved to a twin bed I bought two and put them on her bed at the same time alternating them with sheets so that if she had an accident in the middle of the night I could strip off the first set of cover and sheet and Voila! Underneath would be a fresh set of cover and sheet and I could go right back to bed! Unfortunately for everyone this has never worked. Her accidents leak through BOTH covers, though a noticeably smaller area is saturated on the mattress than the wet area on the sheets - always in the center of where she is lying. I had some waterproof pads that I used with her reflux and put those in the middle of her mattress and that is doing the trick for now, but I'm disappointed! AND I've recommended these to people who bought them! Looking for a replacement. (BTW, I've always washed these on gentle and hang-dried them. The Twin covers leaked on the first use. So not user error.)
5	1379203200	This is a great protector.  Bought it for our Sealy foam mattress and love the fact that it can be washed.
5	1379116800	it exactly fit on my son full size bed. It good I choose it. Thanks for sending prominently. I will buy next time from this site
5	1378944000	So far the mattress protector seems to be very durable and well worth the purchase. While I have yet to have the need to use it (ie. spill something on the bed) it's nice to have this protection over the mattress. Well worth it for the price.
5	1378944000	We were hesitant to order a mattress protector because we did not want that plastic feel.  We have family over a lot, especially the grand children, and needed protection for the mattresses.  This product is great, it does the job and it is undetected by those sleeping on it.
2	1378944000	The terry cloth is VERY thin and sparse, and feels rather low in quality. The polyurethane waterproof backing smells a little like lighter fluid and still smelled that way after washing it for the first time before use. Product description is inaccurate as the terry cloth is not 100% cotton, but a 80/20 cotton/poly blend (says right on the package in tiny font). Maybe not a big deal to some, but I put a lot of stock into the product descriptions when buying online. I won't be buying this one again when I need another one.
5	1378944000	Great cover! Fit my extra deep queen mattress without a problem. Has protected mattress well through several mishaps---My infant is known for her constant spitting up - and my poor bed is often on the receiving end.Great price, also. Overall, very happy with this product and would purchase again.
5	1378944000	I bought these for my kids' mattresses in case of accidents. They recently stopped using pull-ups, so there have been many accidents. They have been washed often in the few months I've owned them. They've held up very well. (I've bought super cheap mattress protectors before, and they have ripped within the first three washes.) These are definitely worth the money.
5	1378944000	We have used Hanna Kay twice for mattress protection and it is by far the best price around and the free shipping was something we couldn't pass up! Well done!Tyler
5	1378944000	This mattress pad is really good quality and fits my mattress perfectly. I highly recommend it! I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
5	1378857600	I am extremely satisfied with this mattress cover. It's a good value for the money. I would definitely purchase this item again.
5	1378857600	The first week we used this we had a bloody nose and vomit all in the bed from our 2 year old on a new mattress. The protector is truly water proof and didn't let anything stain the mattress. It also cleaned up well in the washer.
5	1378857600	The mattress protector is for my son's bed.  It is soft and comfortable.  It doesn't make the "scratchy" sound when you move around.  Delivered on time and without hassel.
5	1378857600	Bought this mattress pad for the start of night-time potty training with my 3 year old.  This mattress protector is made of good quality materials.  I washed it before putting it on her bed.  It held up very well with the first washing and there has been no chemical smell. It has sides that adjusted easily to fit our very deep mattress and it stays in place very well.  I ordered two of these mattress pads and have had them both for a month now.  Both have stayed in great shape after a handful of washings.  Would definitely recommend these.
5	1378857600	Fast shipment and great product. I've bought in total of 3 queen and 1 king size and they fit wonderfully on extra thick mattresses. I haven't had a problem with it.
5	1378857600	I am using this on a Queen size bed, fitting over a 3 inch or so memory foam mattress topper. This keeps my memory foam topper from sliding around on top of the traditional mattress that is under it.
5	1378857600	I purchased this mattress protector for my memory foam type mattress in our guest room.  The mattress protector will work fine.  It is definitely waterproof, but it does not smell or make noise like other waterproof protectors.  This was purchased through Amazon from another vendor and the shipping and product were fine.
5	1378857600	The cost is much higher than some similar products, but in my experience the cheaper options were of such poor quality that the plastic started to shred almost immediately, and they became totally unusable in less than a year. This brand holds up very well, and after a year of use seems to be just as strong as new. I use them inside out on my children's beds so that if there is a nighttime leak it won't soak into the cover.I would definitely purchase more of these in the future if needed.
5	1378857600	Works well for our queen bed.  Soft not stiff.  Waterproof so it won't ruin mattress when my dog wets the bed.
4	1378857600	Three days after our dog puked on our new mattress, I ordered the mattress cover and it arrived promptly. At first I was not thrilled with it. You knew it was there. But after a week of sleeping on it, I have to say I love it. My mattress is now protected from my dog and I am protected from dust mites. Win-win situation. :)
5	1378684800	the product is exactly what we needed to protect our new mattress and the price was perfect...love the warranty for 10 years... you cannot beat it!
4	1378684800	I just bought a new mattress, and I didn't want to totally destroy it within the year.  After looking at the reviews, I decided to go with the Hanna Kay Premium Waterproof Mattress Protector.  I didn't want a mattress protector that had that plasticky sound and feel.  When it first arrived and I pulled it out, I was pleasantly surprised at the top of the protector.  The top is soft while underneath it's the plastic protector.  I thought that I would still end up hearing/feeling this cover, but after 4 months with this cover, I've yet to notice it is there (until I change my sheets).  Great product.  I would definitely recommend this protector for anyone!
5	1378684800	The mattress protector fit the queen mattress and bed spring snugly.  Seems to be high quality material and stitching.  Fairly sturdy.  The instructions say to wash before use as there may be a smell from the plastic, which was true.  After the first wash it smelled fine.
5	1378425600	Very nice, soft mattress pad.  Arrived quickly.  Washes well.  You can't tell when the bed is made that it is has a waterproof lining.  No plastic-y noise when you move etc.  Very happy with this purchase.
5	1378339200	Loved this mattress protector so much I ordered two more.  Never want to be without this product.  I sleep with five small dogs most nights and this product protects the mattress from sick tummies and other accidents.  Best yet, it doesn't make noises and it isn't hot.  In addition it helps to keep the sheet from bunching up.  All in all I am sleeping worry free.  For the price it is the bomb!
2	1378339200	This mattress cover is thin as paper, and made of cotton - like a worn towel.  No padding or quilting.  Would not recommend this at all.
2	1378339200	The grip on the sides are not strong enough OR long enough to cover the whole bed and protect the product from slipping around, very annoying when you're trying to sleep and the corners are popping up.
4	1378339200	Fits well. Thin as described by others, but well built. Make sure you read the washing instructions they are very specific.
5	1378252800	this protector fits securely without slipping or moving around. it wicks away moisture yet washes and dries (according to the instructions) very well. it has been a great addition to our bed protection diligence.
5	1378252800	My 6 year old son has occasionally wet his bed during his deep periods of sleep ( or we were not careful with drinking juices right before going to bed). It does't happen often, but after you spend a lot of money in a comfortable mattress, even 1 occurence is enough to ruin it. I am happy that this mattress protector did its job; after washing it and hang it outside to dry, it's just the same! Very useful!
5	1378252800	This is identical to the mattress pads we've purchased before $60+ for our Tempurpedic mattress.  I was so happy to find one for a LOT less expensive!  I plan to order another one very soon as our more expensive ones have worn out and I only ordered one to see what it was like.  Don't waste your money on the more expensive brand.  This one is EXACTLY the same!
5	1378252800	I bought one of these when we bought a new mattress and liked it, so when our daughter moved to a "big girl bed" we got one for her as well.  It doesn't make a crinkly sound, it's soft, and it really works.  I also like that it's not thick, so it doesn't add heat or bulk to the bed and you can still feel any pillowtop.  The price here is far cheaper than at the mattress store.  The elastic makes it secure even on pillowtop mattresses.  Our original mattress protector lasted four years until it was put in a too-full dryer on high heat and melted.  But during those four years it always looked great and saved our bed from many spills.  I recommend to dry this on low heat and in a large dryer or in the dryer by itself or with just a few items so it doesn't get too hot.
5	1378252800	I bought this for our toddler's twin bed.  We washed it first (I think that was recommended to make sure it was soft), and it fit the mattress fine.  I haven't "tested" it for waterproofness, but I give it five stars because it fits, it doesn't smell, and it isn't even noticeable when covered with a sheet.
4	1378252800	So overall I am pretty pleased with this mattress protector. I've only had it for about a month and no major spills yet. So what I can say is that it doesn't smell plasticy or gross. It feels nice and isn't all crinkly. And it doesn't slip off the mattress. I actually forget a lot of the time that I even have it on the mattress. Which is what you want right?
5	1378252800	This mattress pad assures me that in the event of a seizure or other illness that causes me to throw up, my mattress will be protected.  With a simple laundry cycle, my bed will be restored. It is non-intrusive; I don't even notice it while resting.
4	1378166400	The second night we had it on our toddler's bed he threw up in it - the mattress protector was waterproof and washed up easily. It does what it says it will do. Easy delivery. Happy with my purchase.
5	1378166400	The cover fit perfectly for our queen mattress (no box spring). We purchase this because of the new baby and needed something to protect the mattress. It does the job.
5	1378166400	I purchased this mattress protector because I have a son who is 15 months old. So far my son seems to be very comfortable in bed. I think its quality is excellent. The price is good, too!
5	1378166400	This is a good mattress cover - no issues with it at all. I would recommend it for any mattress protection needs.
4	1378166400	I am giving this four stars (vs five stars) because we have yet to use this product but a similar product purchased years ago was "just what the doctor ordered".  Great Seller.
5	1378166400	Great mattress pad for my son's bed and timely delivered!  We've already had two "incidents" and it worked great at protecting the mattress.
5	1378166400	This is a great pad for cheap. I have it on my daughters bed and it has survived a few accidents. Great product! bought another one after I had gotten the first.
4	1378166400	I have only had the product a few months and seems to be of good quality. I would recommend this.
5	1378166400	Mattress protector works great! I ended up ordering two so when ones in the wash I can change sheets. Great price
4	1378080000	(We actually got the twin size.) It is waterproof and fits our son's twin mattress great. It is very easy to wash and take care of (machine wash and dry).  His only complaint is that it makes his fitted sheet feel a little warm.
5	1377993600	Love this mattress protector.  It hasn't gotten wet yet, but if it does, I trust it will protect my mattress.
2	1377907200	I did way too much research before buying a protector. We had just gotten a new memory foam mattress with the &#34;cooling layer&#34; and didn't want a thick pad to keep us from using that feature. I wasn't too worried about sound, but I was worried about feeling like I was sleeping on a plastic bag. That's what this felt like. I woke up sweating most nights/mornings - not normal. I gave it a week and just couldn't do it anymore. Wish I could return it and use the money for something else. I know others have had good luck with this, I guess I just wasn't one of them.
5	1377907200	Really nice mattress cover for the price, fits my deep queen mattress perfectly and quiet to sleep on. LOVE AMAZON!
5	1377820800	I bought this for my 2 year old daughter's bed as we anticipate potty training soon.  She's still in diapers at the moment, but we have had some diaper leaks overnight (she's a very heavy wetter at times) and the mattress protector has performed perfectly - no moisture got through to the mattress.
2	1377820800	not what i was expecting. it dose not meet my needs. may be a good product but not what i was hoping for
4	1377734400	worked for what i needed it for. i needed it to cover an old couch that smelled. it fit great. luckily the couch is twin size. it doesn't slip. and the price was cheap. also the top is soft but not slippery so i put a blanket over it and voila...a new sofa...haha or make shift
4	1377734400	I bought this item a few months ago.  It is good so far.  Hopefully, it lasts for the life of the mattress.
5	1377734400	If you are looking for a mattress protector, this is the one to buy.I got this because of the great price but didn't expect it to be better then all the others I've tried. It fits very well, even on a large pillow-top mattress, is exceptional. It could even fit a thicker mattress with no problems. It's lightweight and waterproof.
4	1377734400	The mattress protector that I received seems to be of good quality and efficient for the price. I cannot elaborate much as we haven't had a spill yet but I'm glad I made the purchase!
4	1377648000	Terry like covering. I thought I might hear the waterproof cover squishing every time I turned over but not at all.
5	1377561600	This is a nice change of pace from the previous waterproof mattress protectors.  We have used it for about a month and washed it several times already.  So far so good!
5	1377561600	Two accidents & the mattress was safe, washed up great, no shrinkage. Don't feel a difference when it's on, fits my queen memory foam mattress great.
4	1377475200	The material seemed a little stiff and a little more like vinyl than I expected on the sides, but the top is soft and it really works!  I tested it with water!
2	1377475200	I purchased this mattress cover for my three year old when he had an accident.  This mattress "protector" continues to allow the accident to get to his mattress.  I would not purchase again nor would I recommend this product.
5	1377475200	This mattress cover was just what I wanted for my 3 year old's new twin bed. I'm happy with my purchase.
5	1377388800	This mattress cover just saved my 15 year warranty on my memory foam mattress- it's voided if there is a liquid spill on it. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!  This product is so reasonably priced, too!  The mattress cover that they tried to sell me at the mattress store was inferior and it was nearly 4 TIMES the cost of this product.  Thanks again!!
3	1377302400	I bought this because my husband and I sweat a lot when we sleep. Wanted to save our mattress.. but this makes you hotter:( only used for about 3 days, now it just sits in the closet. I'm sure it does a good job, but if your hot natured ... don't get it!
2	1377216000	Got the product and the look and feel of it was excellent.  Company recommended washing before using and drying (my instinct would have been not to put this in the dryer).  I did as instructed and it came out the dryer with the back stuck together in some places.  When I tried to gently remove the fold/wrinkle caused by the backing sticking together in presumably the dryer, little holes occurred in the back. I eventually gave up and put it on the bed with the big wrinkle.  My daughter hasn't complained yet, but the waterproofing is definitely compromised, and if she sleeps in that section, it can't be comfortable.  :(
5	1377129600	Nice and soft surface....I buy this to protect my bed just in case my water break. So far I like this product
4	1377129600	Good product, but not smooth. It has a rough surface like a towel. Inner is lined with a material that seems watertight to me, but I have not tested it.
5	1377129600	I recently bought a new pillow top mattress which is nice and plush on top. I initially bought a quilt like mattress cover to protect it. I noticed the mattress no longer had the plush feel to it, it was sort of hard. I then learned about the waterproof thin mattress covers. I purchased this based on the reviews and decent price. Boy what a difference!!! Once again I was able to feel the plushness of my pillow top. At first I did hear a faint sound of plastic but that stopped after a couple days of use. Now it's like the protector is not even there. Its very soft and breathable. The pockets around the protector are nice and deep. I have a 14.5 inch mattress and there is plenty pocket depth to spare. The sides are nice and durable too. I did a spot test to see if it kept the water off the mattress and it did exactly as it said it does. Please note that this does not protect the sides of the mattress from water. The only area that I cannot rate is how it holds up to washing, as I have yet to wash it. I love this protector. I only wish I had purchased this before wasting money on the quilted mattress cover.
5	1377129600	As of now,it's exactly as described. I haven't had a chance to see if it's waterproof yet.Will let you know in the near future!
4	1377129600	nice terry? top to it. doesn't feel waterproof. fit a moderately thick mattress well.only give 4 stars not knowing if it can hold up over time.
5	1377129600	The mattress protector showed up lightening fast, washed nicely, and slipped easily on my extra deep mattress with room to spare. There are no crinkling noises when I sleep and I haven't noticed that It traps body heat.  I haven't had any spills, so can't give an opinion on that part
5	1377043200	this matress feel good, made of nice material  and it is waterproof, right size for a queen bed, this is the best price i can find
4	1377043200	The mattress protector was great, affordable and very helpful for my child dust mite allergy.  It fits well into the twin size mattress as well.
4	1377043200	Happy with the material of the mattress protector and does its job well. I also have a more expensive one which is a different brand and I don't see any difference in quality!
4	1377043200	The mattress protector was just as advertised. It fits over a thick, pillow top mattress and is comfortable between a mattress pad and sheet.
5	1377043200	The Hanna Kay Mattress protector arrived extremely fast and is everything I hoped for. It fit my very large pillow top mattress perfectly and has helped reduce my allergies. I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this item and seller.
5	1376956800	So far so good. Seems to repel water and we have not had any issues with doggies wetting the bed lately.
5	1376697600	My 3 year old's bed has seen a couple of accidents with this on and nothing has gone through . Put it in with the regular laundry without trouble.  Also, it's hardly noticeable under the sheets.
5	1376611200	I bought this because my dog was acting very sick and wetting herself, on my bed. This wicked the moisture away when she had accidents.  It protected anything from reaching my mattress. It doesn't make a crinkly sound. It has been washed several times and still seems brand new.
4	1376524800	I like this mattress pad cover.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I think it's a little loose, causing it to be bulky.  If I had a thicker mattress, it would be required, but for a thin mattress, the extra isn't needed.
5	1376524800	i give this product a 5 because you can`t even tell you have a cover on your mattress and it feels great
4	1376438400	It's a good mattress protector. It fits the mattress well. The quality is fine enough for its purpose. I'm glad I purchased it.
5	1376438400	Product arrived on-time and as described. We have yet to tryout the water proofing (toddler in the household), but overall we are satisfied with this purchase.
4	1376438400	But.... You have to still wash it like a blanket if the sheet gets wet by whatever. The fibers are clothier so we flipp it over some times so we don't have to go threw the trouble of taking it off.
5	1376438400	This is just as good as other mattress protectors that I have purchased for twice the cost. I would definitely recommend this product.
5	1376438400	This was exactly what we wanted. Lightweight, doesn't make any noise when laying or sleeping on it, waterproof, and no vinyl smell at all. Does the job that was needed perfectly.
5	1376438400	This product is the same product that one of the major mattress stores here in Houston tried to sell us with our new mattresses, but at literally 1/3 of the price.  Deep pockets will go over a thicker mattress. Washable, breathable, does not sleep hot at all.  Very happy with the purchase, and we received the product from the seller in the time that was promised. Highly recommend.
5	1376438400	This is a great product a little on the larger side for a twin but makes it easy to go on the mattress. The sides are generous. I have washed and dried twice. No shrinking or melting or matting. No smell.I order this for my 97 year old Mother. She has severe sciatica and very few times has difficulty getting up and to the bathroom in time. Needless to say this distresses her. But she is less distressed knowing bedding is protected and less work to fix the problem.Great product
5	1376438400	This is a great waterproof mattress pad that we bought for my daughter's bed (who is potty training). I can vouch that it is truly waterproof because in our house it has been tested--we ended up with a wet pad but a very dry bed. Plus it is very soft to the tough so it does not feel like you are lying on crinkly paper. We ended up buying two and are very happy with our purchases.
5	1376438400	well packed, easy to install, nice to touch, no sound when you move - i hope it will last - go get it!
5	1376438400	I bought the Hanna Kay mattress protecter for my son's bed at college.  It's a great product and we're quite happy with it!  It was sold by Perella's and I was extremely happy with them also.  Fast, reliable service (it only took a few days to receive) and the price was great.  I looked elsewhere and no one beat the price Perella's offered.  I would recommend them to anyone.
5	1376352000	There is no plastic sound when you lay down, fits nicely, washing is a breeze. Recommend to any toddler in training.
5	1376265600	We purchased a different mattress protector and hated it, it made us sweat and made crunching sound when we rolled around in our bed.  We threw that away as soon as our kid stopped co-sleeping with us.  Recently, our toddler decided to jump in our bed with a cup of milk, of course he spilled it everywhere on our mattress.  I cleaned up the mess and quickly searched Amazon to find the best mattress protector that fits the bill... I'm glad I came across this product with very good review and order it via Amazon Prime.  When it arrived, I immediately put it on our mattress.  It's from a small company and I can tell the company takes pride in their product.  It's very well assembled and doesn't make the crunchy sound like our old mattress protector.  I can't comment on the effectiveness of the waterproof since we have not had any accidents since.
5	1376265600	Great product and great service. This is water repellent without being hot or making crinkly noises. Just what I was looking for.
5	1376179200	This mattress pad is so comfortable to sleep on and it's waterproof also.  When I need another one, I will order one from you.
5	1376006400	A wonderful product! Highly recommend. When I sleep I tend to have night sweats. This protector has helped a great deal in keeping the bed dry and it seems to keep me a bit dryer also! I have had this product for two months. It washes and dries easily. It fits over my queen size pillow top mattress as well as a memory foam egg crate. Well worth the money!
5	1376006400	I bought this product after finding out I am allergic to dust mites.  I found that the product matched the description perfectly.  It was easy to put on my mattress and it fit well. The quality is good. Most importantly my allergy symptoms cleared up.  I am very happy with this product.
5	1375920000	We only had a spill on the new mattress with the protector on it and I was so please that there was not even an ounce of moisture under the cover.  It is also soft and does not make any noise like some others.
4	1375920000	Fits nicely on my thick mattress. Doesnt pull up at the corners as there is ample fabric to tuck under.
5	1375920000	We like it. No gassy smell or crinkle sound. Does the job we need it to do. Fits our queen size memory foam mattress topper just fine.
3	1375920000	This is a fine mattress pad for the money, but I was expecting it to be more plush. It's pretty thin.
5	1375920000	I ordered it, it came, in good time, in good condition, fits well, looks great.  Haven't had anyone sleep on it yet, much less, um, test it's water repellent qualities. Hope it will be a while before I have reason to rate that. So, for what it's worth, it's great so far, and based on that I am not worried about down the road.
5	1375920000	Doesn't feel stiff at all.  I can barely tell it's on!  The one downside is that it stinks to high heaven like a beach ball when you first open it, but the smell dissipates quickly.
4	1375920000	This mattress protector so far has fit the bed well and has helped prevent any allergic reactions. I don't see any problems with it, and would recommend it as a economical buy.
5	1375920000	Bought 2 of these to cover and protect my down feather bed from sweat and the occasional kitten accident. I have 2 so I can alternate between washing. So far so good.
5	1375920000	Fast delivery, fits perfectly (and the sheets fit over it just fine) and is exactly as we'd hoped it would be. A highly recommended mattress protector.
4	1375920000	Very happy with the mattress cover. My main concern was would it fit the deep mattress.  It fit perfect, even had extra room so made it easy to pit on.  Received and packed to customer satisfaction.
5	1375920000	It fits well and I like the hypoallergenic quality about it and the waterproofing.  The nice thing is the waterproofing is not noticeable and doesn't make "crinkle" noises under the sleepers.It washed well and went back on the bed with no problem with shrinkage.
5	1375747200	Exactly what I needed for top of my bed...to cover it so my older cat could sleep on bed (she occasionally gets sick, so this wasperfect.)
5	1375660800	I bought it for my kids that moved to twin bed. They had couple accidents already and the mattress is all dry. I washed in cold water and dried it on low, and looks as new still.
2	1375401600	The materials are cheap. The construction of the product is no more that adequate. The material seems flimsy. Based on the reviews, I expected a much better product. I would not have purchased it if I had seen it in a store. I paid what I estimate to be twice what it's worth.
5	1375401600	I have tried other mattress protectors and they are impossible to sleep on & was reluctant to try this one but figured for the price why not?  I am so glad I did as I needed it for protection for my vengeful shi tzu pup who retaliates in the form peeing on my bed. I had an accident within having the mattress pad on within the first week and worked like a charm.  Would definitely purchase again! Just as good as another one I purchased for almost 4 times the amount.
4	1375315200	My guest said the bed was very comfortable and did not feel as if it had a waterproof mattress protector on it.
5	1375315200	This mattress protector fit perfectly on my queen size pillow top mattress, which calls for sheet sizes at least 18" deep. It is a very good quality and does not increase the temperature for sleep. I spent a great deal of money for my mattress and wanted a cover to protect it but not increase the retained temperature. This product satisfied all my requirements. I have washed it and the shape remained in tact as well.
5	1375315200	I ordered one of these mattress protectors in order to keep my warranty good on my new mattress.  It fit the mattress great and goes all the way under the corners of my pillowtop mattress.  It doesnt work it's way off overnight so I know im always protected.
5	1375315200	I've bought plastic sheets before and you could feel the plastic under the sheet and It made the bed warm in the summer.  Not these sheets. They fit and feel just like a regular sheet and yet give that extra protection. Very happy with this purchase
5	1375315200	I was looking for a soft protector that would not add heat to the bedding, and this is the one! Easy to put on, comfy. And it got to me quickly. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a light weight mattress pad.
5	1375315200	We bought two of these for 8&#34; twin mattresses. There is a lot of extra material, but the covers don't slide around. One has received a lot of extra washing (hooray for potty training), and it has held up well so far. There haven't been any leaks.
4	1375228800	I just bought an expensive new mattress, and the mattress store recommended gettinga waterproof mattress cover to protect it, particularly since I have pets. I don'thave a problem with any of them peeing where they shouldn't, but they do occasionallythrow up or have muddy/dirty paws, and I didn't want to risk the new mattressgetting dirty. I normally shy away from waterproof mattress covers because theyhave a rubbery/plastic feel and can be too hot in the summer, but I decided togive this one a try. I was very impressed by the terry cloth feel of the material,and it didn't have that feel of rubber sheeting. Nor has it proven to be too hotduring a sticky, hot Florida summer. I was also impressed by the price. Very goodvalue for money. The only minus I could mention is that the material is a bitthinner than I would like (I can see the design on my mattress through it), butthat is a minor quibble, as it may have ended up being hotter if it were thicker.I definitely recommend this cover!
4	1375228800	The pad is thinner than I expected.  The reviews are asked for early so I have not had the product long enough to know how long it will last or how it will launder.
1	1375228800	I purchased this product thinking it was a whole mattress protector for people with allergies. It was a related product upsell on the product that I should have purchased. I changed my mind and purchased this one instead because the description made it sound softer, but equivalent otherwise to the one I was going to buy. This is NOT a mattress protector that encases your mattress, it is more like the ones you put on your kids' beds so that if they have an accident it doesn't get to the mattress. It is shaped like a fitted sheet with plastic coating and terry-cloth like material rather than the full (likely zip around) mattress protector that I was expecting. I would have returned it but when I was taking it out of the package a very sharp piece of cardboard gave me a good cut to my hand and I bled all over it - yes, all over it, it was a bad cut - the product was no longer returnable at that point. I tried it anyway - and it bunches up and is truly a waste of money. I felt like the description led me to believe this would protect from allergens introduced by the mattress and there is no way that this would work for that because it only covers what a fitted sheet would cover. If you want it for someone wetting the bed, that is about the only use for it.
5	1375228800	Used this cover for my daughter while trying to potty train her at night.She literally soaked herself in urine every night but this cover protected our mattress 100%.I wash it in warm or hot water and dry on medium heat. It has not melted like the one I had from target . It takes long to dry but all these covers seem to.It has pretty deep pockets and doesn't move or shift.It's like a plastic underneath with a towel like terry cloth over it so its fine to sleep directly on it. No one is waking up overly sweaty or hot like you would with just straight plastic. It saves me the trouble if putting sheets on top of it and having to wash them everyday as well.
5	1375228800	The mattress cover is awesome! Spilt some wine on bed and did not go through to the mattress. Very good buy!!
4	1375228800	Item was shipped quickly and arrived on time.  Quality is fine - product is just as described.  No problems.  Bought one for me and one for my daughter to use with her toddler.
5	1375228800	Very nice cover.  Well made, just what I was looking for.  A great price for a cover with a 10 year warranty.
5	1375228800	This item has worked great. It's fits great on my large mattress and doesn't bunch up or move at all. It also doesn't add any extra heat, in fact it's so comfortable you don't even know it's there! I have washed it a few times and it's still working great for me so this is definitely a great value.
5	1375228800	This is a substantial well-made mattress cover. Will probably buy one to have as an extra. The cover is soft but strong.
5	1375142400	My brother moved, he needed a new mattress protector, and this fits the bill quite nicely. No problems at all.
5	1375056000	I have a dog who makes mistakes on the bed sometimes.  This product is a more durable and comfortable option than a plain vinyl protector.  I now own two which allows for quick bed changes when accidents occur.  By placing it between the sheet and hard to wash mattress pads I don't have to worry about the long drying time mattress toppers have.I would recommend this to pet owners as well as anyone who has children or loved ones that may soil their mattresses.
5	1374796800	Looked at a lot of protectors before deciding on this one.  I made the right choice.The fabric is great, not flimsy and the fit is excellent.  The protective lining does notget hot during the night and doesn't make that awful crinkly noise which plastic makes.The mattress protector has not crawled out of place even after a few sheet changes.For the price...an excellent value.
5	1374796800	This product has been great so far.  It is quiet and comfortable.  I am glad to have a protected mattress.
4	1374710400	I purchased the mattress protector for my two toddlers' twin beds.  Needless to say, my daughter wet the bed the first night, but the mattress was totally dry.  So I am happy with my purchase.  It isn't loud or crinkly when my kids move around either.  ONE NOTE-this is not a mattress PAD, it is a mattress protector.  It is very thin and provides no cushioning or anything like that.  They don't claim that it is in the advertising, but I just wanted to be clear.  It keeps my beds dry, which is why I bought it.  Definitely recommend!
5	1374710400	Love this pad-Soft, easy to fold when not in use and doesn't make u hot n sweaty!!Great for child/guest bed-No one knows the difference!
5	1374710400	This mattress protector is pretty soft and it doesn't make you as sweaty as other waterproof covers. Fit easily and well, and it's quiet too. Washes up fine. Guess it does all I ask for in a mattress protector.
5	1374710400	I like this product it measures up to other more expensive ones the terry cloth cover is nice. And it is easily laundered better than high cost covers.
2	1374710400	This is my third mattress cover in a year. Each time I buy more expensive thinking it will hold up better. If you only need to wash occasionally, then I'm sure it's good, but with a youngster who occasionally sleeps with me and has the occasional accident, not so much. The problem is the corners. I have washed this maybe 6-8 times and the corners are already very fragile. Must be careful putting it on the mattress so as to rip it which will happen in about 4 more washes...( I know from experience). I only use low heat as well. I bought a front loader so I am hoping to get  a few more washes out of it....
4	1374710400	The mattress protector fits well on the mattress and was comfortable to sleep on.  Delivery was very prompt and the package arrived without damage.
5	1374710400	This seems to be a high quality product that does the job. Seems to fit well and washed well. I ordered a second one too.
5	1374710400	We purchased this for use on an Aerobed for our 3 year-old while we were on vacation in a rental home at the beach.  Fits great, no "plastic-like" odor, soft to the touch.  Luckily, we haven't had to test it's "100% waterproof" claim just yet...but we are happy with the product when compared to other similar mattress pads we've owned in the past. We've had problems with other "waterproof" mattress pads melting in the dryer...literally, a plastic, soupy, sticky mess.  So, we learned our lesson and only dry after washing at a low temperature setting, and check frequently so as not to over-dry and "melt" any of the waterproof layer.
5	1374710400	We've washed the protector 3 times already and it looks good as new! Also, holds in leaks/accidents, nothing has gone through to the mattress. Highly recommend!
5	1374710400	Great overall product. The material of this mattress protector is different from others that I have purchased in the past. This is a very breathable material that, for a hot-bodied person like me is very important. It certainly makes a difference on those hot nights which is great. Definitely recommended.
5	1374624000	I like the product it flits the mattress perfectly and you cannot feel that you have it under the sheets
5	1374624000	Decent product at a decent price. I have shopped for a product like this for a while, and I'm pleased with this one.
2	1374624000	I bought these for my two daughters' beds but couldn't bring myself to put them on the beds because they smell so awful! The moment I unzipped the package I was hit with the vinyl off gassing fumes. I thought it might air out or at least get quite a bit better after washing them so I did. They have been airing out in my dining room for two weeks and still smell like vinyl...and I mean even with my nose inches from the fabric. I can't even imagine letting my kids rest their heads on this night after night for 11+ hours a night. They are going back and I'm just amazed no one has mentioned this problem in any of the reviews I read before I bought them. Why would you tolerate the smell when there is a vinyl free product on amazon for just a couple bucks more?
5	1374624000	This mattress protector is very light weight which I like and the pockets are very deep. We will see if it holds up to the 10 year warranty.
5	1374537600	This is a great looking and great fitting mattress protector. I am happy with the quality as well.  Its very comfortable and adds a layer of cushion to my bed too.
5	1374364800	I found this product to be all I was looking for in a waterproof mattress protector.  It is easy to put on and off, is completely waterproof and very easily laundered.
4	1374364800	i havent washed it yet so i cant vouch for how it will be after a wash, but it fit my bed perfectly, and im glad my very expensive mattress is being protected from any damages.
5	1374364800	Nice and soft, not hot, comfy.  Great buy for the price and I would recommend to anyone looking to safeguard their Matt's.
5	1374364800	We have only been using the cover for 2-3 weeks. So far it seems to work fine. We'll see in a couple of years.
5	1374278400	This item arrived on time and would fit a couple of different types of queen mattresses which was how it was described. It isn't the type that makes the bed feel crinkly. The top of the surface is like a fine terry cloth material.
2	1374192000	It leaked through one time, now our foam mattress has pee in it.  I our child has peed on it many times, but one time it did leak and unfortunaltely thats all it takes
5	1374105600	Solid mattress cover.  Fits nicely, and makes the bed feel "refreshed"....good quality, good value compared to other similar covers.  Didn't check the waterproof part, put seems like it would work.
5	1374105600	This is everything I was looking for in such a product. Thin enough not to feel it, quality so you don't hear any rustling and works as its advertised. Highly recommend
5	1374105600	This prdt. was a gift to my son who is a roommate with his brother.  He did not have a choice, but was in a bed that absolutely killed his back.  Since I got him this prdt., he now gets a great nights sleep every night!!  He's even 6"3' and weighs approx. 275 lbs. and it still feels great!!
5	1374105600	I ordered this mattress protector a few weeks ago for a brand new memory foam bed and so far it works as advertised. It seems to breathe much better than the cheap protector I bought at Target when I first got the bed, which felt like sleeping on a garbage bag. My wife also noticed the difference immediately. It doesn't protect from bed bugs because it is the "fitted sheet" style, but I wasn't worried about that.
5	1374105600	I purchased this mattress protector to replace a retired plastic protector with a terry cloth cover which had split due to wear and tear of normal use and cleaning.  I love this new protector because it is so low-profile, unnoticeable, light, breathable, reliably absorbent and more resilient to normal cleansing.  I would recommend to anyone whom wants to protect their mattress for any reason, this purchase you cannot go wrong.  The cost was nearly 1/3 of what I was finding in the less desireable, unwarranted plastic versions.  This is a product I will continually recommend in the future.  The service exceeded what I had experienced in previous purchases of similar items.
5	1374105600	I bought this mattress protector to go over a memory foam topper I just bought, both to protect it and to hold it in place.  The topper is thick, so I just needed something extra thin and soft, and I didn't want it to interfere with the cushion of the topper.  This protector is perfect!  I also love that it's waterproof and hypoallergenic, to help my topper last longer, too.
5	1374105600	this is the best mattress protector I have bought.  I wanted one that wouldn't be noticed when you laid on it, and that's what I got.
5	1374105600	Mattress Protector is really good and the price was also good as compared to other. it was suggested by one of my friend.
5	1374105600	This product worked awesome. It covered up the smell of old accidents and kept new ones from ruining the mattress.  Easy to put on and take off, perfectly machine washable.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5	1374105600	I have a toddler that I co-sleep with who also drinks 16oz of milk before bed.  So often times, I wake up in a puddle.  I had a waterproof mattress protector that got demolished from me washing/drying it so much.  I put this on my bed and so far so good.  There haven't been any accidents yet so I haven't cleaned it yet.  Therefore I can't speak to durability, but I can say that this was much easier to put on my bed that the other one.  And this one feels nicer.
5	1374105600	Arrived on schedule, thinner then expected, thought it was a pad not just protector, but will be careful when drying so as not to have experience of other purchasers.
5	1374019200	my first cover i purchased at the time i bought my new mattress set.  held up for several years and then needed replacing.  found this one on line and discription seemed to meet my needs.  arrived and was more impressed because of the price point.  looks good and fitted great.  happy so far...only down side is made in CHINA.  why doesn't amazon list country of origin?
4	1374019200	I liked the feel of this mattress pad, seems softer than most I've tried. I ended up liking another brand better, but this seems pretty good.
5	1373760000	We've only had this pad for a couple months, but it works great and I don't foresee any problems down the road.  I liked it so much I ordered a second one for the top bunk.  The terry clothe on one side really makes it so that you can't even tell there's a waterproof mattress protector on the bed.  My son's had a few accidents and it's been washed several times without any signs of wear and tear.
4	1373673600	Was worried about the 'crinkling noise' when moving around, that other customers complained about.  We did not experience any crinkling noise. Make sure to wash as directed before 1st use.  As for it getting too hot and sweating due to the 'plastic' underlay....that still remains debatable.  Have paid over $100 for other mattress protectors that did not survive more than 3 washings.  For the price, if it survives 3 washings, I'll be happy.
4	1373587200	This is a great price for a great product. It fits my mattress snugly so I don't have to worry about it slipping off. The terry cloth top is absorbent and washes well. Would definitely recommend.
5	1373500800	We bought this for our 2 year old's bed. Works great, and price was right. If we needed another one we would defiantly get purchase again.Thank you,Troy
5	1373500800	Fits twin mattress just right, protects well. I bought for child that wets bed -- so I did but some pads to absorb most the liquid and these to protect the mattress. I put the pads between the sheet and this mattress protector. Doing the job well.
5	1373414400	These mattress protectors really work. The only problem is that you have to remember to always dry them on low heat. I destroyed one by accidentally drying it on high heat once--that created very tiny holes that allowed liquid to seep through.
5	1373414400	Perfect...just as described; arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I now have these mattress protectors on every bed in the house. :)
5	1373414400	Material is very soft and completely waterproof. I really liked it and it stays on the bed perfectly. buying a mattress protector online seemed to be better idea than one at the store which they were selling to me while buying the mattress as the cost was really high in the store.
5	1373414400	Ain't no pee pee got through this thing. I laid down about a half gallon last night, I was drunk as a skunk and nothing went though. Thank you for perpetuating my crippling alcoholism.
5	1373414400	We use a twin size mattress topper as a dog bed for our big Yellow Lab, and the cover that came with it was shot.  I ordered this cover as a waterproof replacement.  The cover fits great and the elastic holds it on well, even though the topper is only 4 inches thick.  It keeps the mattress clean, just as advertised.
4	1373414400	Fits, seems waterproof enough, it does make it a little warmer than I'd like when I sleep and the "fuzzy" side is not too comfortable, but it works as advertised!
5	1373414400	My number one priority for a mattress cover is that it stays snugly on the mattress.  This is fantastic, I haven't had any problems with it creeping up on my son's twin mattress.  It also proved to be waterproof.  It washed up very nicely.  I haven't found a better mattress cover and the price makes it even better!
5	1373328000	Arrived in two days as promised. The top is soft and sides are very thin material. It has elastic around the bottom like a regular fitted sheet. The top get's softer after washing. It is quiet which made me skeptical that it would in fact be water proof. My three year old already wet her bed and it kept the mattress dry as promised. I recommend this product!
4	1373241600	I needed something to protect the mattress for my two year old son who recently moved to a twin bed.  The first night he used it required a change of sheets the next morning.  Since then we have ended up washing the cover a couple times and it is holding up well.  My son isn't bothered by it either.  I'd recommend it.
4	1373068800	Cover is on a guest bed.  Has only been used once since I purchased it.  Waterproof quality has not been tested yet.
5	1372896000	Well I have used a few mattress covers and and none of them have done what they claim. Very disappointing to say the least. I looked for a few days at all of the covers and I'm glad to say that I'm very happy so far with your product. I hope to have and use it for a long time. At this time I would recommend it to anyone looking for this kind of a cover. Thank you for making a well made product cause it seems that most companies anymore are in it for the money and not the quality of the product. Thank you and keep up the good work.
5	1372896000	I haven't had any spills yet but I did wash and dry this product and so far I'm pretty with it.  It arrived in a timely fashion, it's all good so far.
5	1372896000	I promptly received the Hanna Kay Mattress Protector - if we paid $30 additional for the product, our review would be the same; we are delighted. The protector fits the queen Sleep Number mattress perfectly, and more importantly it remains fit around the mattress, no "shifting" of the protector under the fitted sheet. Additionally, the lightweight manufacturing doesn't change the feel of the mattress. I've experienced other product which feels lumpy or creates a feeling of being damp. Buy this product and we're confident you will agree with
5	1372809600	We have a topper on top of our mattress and this fits over both the mattress and the topper with no problem.
4	1372809600	I like that this product is not loud. It is not like sleeping on rubber or plastic.  Very comfortable and seems to work.  It hasn't been test yet (thankfully)
4	1372809600	I had bought some mattress protestors about 1 year ago and they were horrible. They kept the mattress safe but after the first wash after an accident they started to fall apart. I finally had enough of the torn up ones and decided to buy these.So far they are great. They aren't crunch like some can be. The only reason I gave them a four was because I haven't washed them yet so I don't know how they hold up in the washer. I will post again to let you know how they stand up.
5	1372809600	Wont really know how well i like it until there's an accident on it...but it seems good. Good fit, feels soft and no smell.
5	1372809600	This was a perfect cover for our daughter's bed. Unlike other waterproof covers we've had, this one doesn't seem to be made of plastic.  We love it.
4	1372809600	Good quality mattress protector. Fit the queen mattress very well. I have only slept on it about 10 nights so far (its at a 2nd property) and haven't spilled anything on it. Will follow up after I have more durability and protective information.
5	1372464000	Most mattress protectors are not deep enough.  I have a deep mattress and then a 2 inch topper on it.  There is plenty of sleeve to bring down the sides and tuck in.  A glass of water was spilled on the bed, but did not penetrate the cover or make the mattress wet.  It works great.
5	1372464000	This is so much better than the all plastic ones. It is quiet and comfortable. You can't even tell it is there.
5	1372291200	It stretches very nicely all around my thick mattress.  Not noisy or stiff due to waterproofing.  The top is a terry cloth which was not stated.
5	1372204800	Update: At first these seem like 4 star quality material but after several bedtime accidents and washes I realize that this deserves 5 stars. At least 30 accidents and not one leak! After at least 30 washes, it has kept in perfect condition. Buy this one!!!!I bought two of these for my 2 year olds and 3 year olds twin size beds. My son (2) likes to take off his nappy and had an accident on his bed. I was thrilled that this product held up to my expectations and there was no leakage. I would buy this product again. The only downfall is that this product is only water proof for the top of the mattress and not the sides so if there were a spill of some kind on the sides (unlikely as it may seem) this would not offer protection. With my kids, I am sure this is a high possibility but good product overall.
5	1372204800	I have this mattress protector on a 6&#34; memory foam mattress.  Fits well.  No noise.  Glad it's there to protect.  Have only had it on for a couple of weeks so not sure how well it protects.  I'm sure I'll find out soon enough!
5	1372118400	Excellent mattress cover at a good price. Deep enough for a thick mattress. Not stiff or noisy. Not as expensive as so many others. Let's see how it holds up after washing.
4	1372118400	Bought it for a bed in a 2 year old's room. It seems to be of good quality. Will let you know how it washes!
5	1372118400	The mattress cover is big for a twin however so far, its taken care of any accidents we've had. Using these covers now on 2 beds.
1	1372118400	This product states it is waterproof, but it is not.  It does not add any protection to the mattress. I will need to buy a better product to protect the mattress.
5	1372118400	Fast Ship. Fits deep mattress. Great price for being hypoallergenic.  Soft feel without stiffness.  Can't even tell its under the fitted sheet!  No smell/odor after being removed from package after 24 hrs.  Haven't had spills yet to determine waterproofing but so far very pleased with product.
5	1372118400	The cover does what it is supposed to do.  We received it right away without any challenges. I suppose if I need other bedding related items, I'll look here again.
5	1372118400	I bought the Waterproof Mattress Protector for my kids' (ages 1 and 3) new bunk bed.  Not crinkly and plasticy at all, very soft and cozy.  They're VERY generously cut, so I don't have to struggle and stretch to get them all around every corner and edge of the mattresses.  We've only had one nighttime potty accident so far (knock on wood!) and the protector worked beautifully, stopping the wetness from getting through to the new mattresses.  Exactly why I bought them!  Bravo!
5	1371945600	I purchased 3 of these mattress covers and couldn't be happier!  All 3 mattresses are different depths and the covers fit all 3 equally well.  You also get the luxury of a waterproof cover without the plastic crinkle each time you move!  I would definitely purchase this item again.
5	1371772800	I've already had to wash this mattress protector about 15 times (wish i was kidding) it holds up GREAT!!! Honestly it's worth it.
5	1371772800	I am delighted with the Hanna Kay Permium Mattress Protector.  It is lightweight and easy to handle.  Although I haven't had it long enough to evaluate the 10 year guarantee, it seems sturdy.
5	1371772800	Good product. Not crinkly, or plastic like some others. Keeps my nice mattress pad protected without being too hot. Picked the right one.
5	1371772800	Fits snugly and securely.  I like that it has a fabric coated vinyl which makes for a very comfortable night's sleep. We have this on every bed in our house.
5	1371686400	I like the deep sides on this mattress cover.  I have not had an occasion yet to see how the waterproof feature works.
5	1371686400	I like it very much. As promised, it does not make noise and is waterproof. Bought this to place on an Aerobed when we slept on the floor with dog who had surgery.
5	1371686400	I have 2 kids under 6, so we wash a lot of sheets, and our mattress protectors get washed and put back on over and over.  This one doesnt feel plasticy, even if you scrunch it up, it doesnt make that vinyl-y sound other mattress protectors do, and it washes nicely, more like a regular sheet than a waterproof thing.  It has deep pockets and is easy to put on our mattresses.
4	1371686400	We just purchased this protector like a month ago. I'm giving 4 stars because so far we haven't had any diaper leaks so I can't say how good it is regarding waterproof. I can say though that it fitted the mattress well and that when you are lying down it feels comfortable and it doesn't make the bed hot. It seems to be good quality and so far we are happy with the purchase.
5	1371686400	Very good quality and fit.  Easy to put on the bed without help.  Just what I wanted to protect the new mattress in my guest room.
5	1371686400	The item is being used for two of our beds that we just purchased, our children have had only two accidents but the mattress protectors worked great, thanks
3	1371686400	The quality of the product seems good.  My daughter did have one leaky diaper and it didn't go through to the mattress.It was also delivered quickly and in good shape - no complaints there.My concern is just that the waterproof pad is only on the top, it does not tuck over the sides.  Therefore, if the mattress protector is not on "perfectly" there is a potential for something to get through to the mattress around the edges or the sides.I don't know if this is the case with all such products or just this one, but when I buy another mattress protector, when my son gets his "big boy bed", I am going to investigate and see if I can find one with side protection as well.
5	1371686400	These work very well. They feel like a thin terry cloth and there is no "plastic" sound or sensation. Easy to put on and launder. We even use them on air mattresses when traveling. Highly recommended.
5	1371686400	Works as stated. It protects the mattress from spills, stains, and other not so fun liquids that might normally penetrate the sheets into the mattress. This product was purchased for two different bunk bed mattresses and kids that are still potty training. So far so good. Mattresses are good as new!
5	1371686400	I really like this mattress protector. It is light-weight, fits my bed, and not plastically stiff like other waterproof protectors. Good product.
5	1371600000	We washed it before use and it came out fine.. It will serve our purpose for my granddaughter's twin bed..
5	1371513600	This pad does what it claims to do.  We use for its intended purpose and we have had no problems.  I should note that we have used the twin size.
5	1371513600	I was frankly skeptical that any purchase of a waterproof mattress protector would meet my needs, so I am thrilled to be wrong with regards to the performance of the Hanna Kay Premium pad.  I am a "Princess & the Pea" kinda girl, so any wrinkles or bumps in my bed linens can potentially disrupt my sleep; no worries with the Hanna Kay.  What a relief!  I highly recommend it.
2	1371427200	Advertised as Hypoallergenic; Protects Against Dust Mites, Fluids, Urine, Perspiration, Allergens And Bacteria .There is nothing on the package to indicate that this is true. It is labeled as a &#34;Mattress Protector&#34; and that is all that it is, nothing more!
5	1371427200	I bought this to put on my toddlers bed and it works perfect. It is easy to clean and keeps the bed protected.
5	1371081600	This product arrived on time and was exactly as described. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality product at a good price.
5	1371081600	This mattress protector works well. It is 100% waterproof without having a plastic feel or sound. It fits nicely over a deep mattress. This was bought for a child bed, but is very comparable to an expensive cover bought for our Queen sized bed. Honestly, I wish I would have known about this affordable cover before I overpaid on another brand. Very satisfied!
5	1371081600	I love the waterproff mattress cover because my 11 still pees in the bed and I have a 2 year old who has accidents every now and then.
5	1371081600	The price was right, and the fit was perfect - even on my memory foam mattress! It looks practically identical to one I paid far more for.
4	1370995200	It's a mattress cover, and it fit on my pillow-top queen mattress.  I can't vouch for the water-proof or stain-proof-ness of the cover, because the only incident I've had since the purchase was my dog peeing on the comforter, which absorbed everything before it seeped down to the sheets or mattress cover.So all I can say is that it fits, and appears that it will block a pee flood if the dog tries again.
5	1370908800	Great mattress cover for my purposes. It provides a little extra softness with the fuzzy top, and I don't ever hear the sound of plastic. I really like it.
3	1370908800	SHould have checked the thickness of the pads.  They are quite thin and provide little to no &#34;softness&#34; to the mattress.  But my main concern were the allergy-free, waterproof properties.  A good buy, tho.
4	1370822400	We just got this item in the mail a couple of weeks ago.  It looks pretty strong and ready to uphold nighttime wetness which is an occasional occurrence with our 2 year old daughter.
5	1370822400	For the price, this worked out well quite well. Comfortable and easy maintenance. No problems. I am a satisfied customer.
4	1370822400	I received it in good shape and it seems to be a good product. It made it thru the wash in good shape.  I like it. It does what it's supposed to.
4	1370649600	Good fit great value , easy to get over corners of mattress seems to be perfect !  Thinking of reordering in QUEEN .
5	1370649600	This mattress protector has done its job with protecting a new mattress. Couldn't be more pleased. Would recommend to everyone.
5	1370649600	I was worried this would be too hot while we were sleeping bc we live in a hot climate. Luckily it felt great and didnt have a crinkly sound. Would buy it again.
4	1370563200	Due to my recent struggle with allergies, my ENT doctor suggested that I purchase a hypoallergenic mattress cover. I was a little worried when I got it because it sounded like the waterproof material might make it noisy and crinkly, but it makes no noise whatsoever. After having it on my bed for a week, I don't even know it is there but it gives me peace of mind knowing that I am protected from all the built up dust and allergens in my mattress.
4	1370563200	I washed the mattress cover first as instructed before use. There was no odor to the product. It fits well on the bed. I have an adjustable sleep number bed and cover does not bind up when bed is adjusted. There is no noise to the protective cover. I have not tested the product as far as pouring a glass of water on it to see if it repels. I might do that when I wash it again. Overall it is priced right and so far has passed my inspection. Good product, good buy.
5	1370476800	A great product! My toddler sleeps well and doesn't wake up sweating because of its breathable fabric. Highly recommend it as a water proof mattress protector!
1	1370476800	I would NOT recommend this product to anyone who is truly looking for a &#34;Waterproof&#34; mattress cover. Why? Easy. It is NOT &#34;Waterproof.&#34; How do I know this? It has been tested and tried. Result? It failed miserably. My plan is to hopefully be able to return it.
5	1370476800	Well made mattress protector.  Bought for our guest room and will do so again when the time comes to replace the one in our master bedroom.
5	1370476800	went over mattress easy, didn't seem to change the feel, don't notice that it's there... that's just what I was looking for...
5	1370476800	This mattress pad was affordable. It completely blocks wetness from the mattress. It also doesn't have a plastic smell or feel with its terry cloth surface. I'm thinking about getting another.
5	1370390400	This is great - it has no plastic smell, washed just fine and doesn't crinkle when it's on the bed. I will be buying more for our other beds!
5	1370304000	We've had this product for about a month now and no complaints.  It has withstood one toddler spilling her glass of water in bed and one night time accident, while protecting the mattress.  It's easily machine washable with I appreciate.  Can't beat the warranty as well.  I would recommend.
5	1370304000	This mattress cover is great! The top of it is very soft, but seems to be very durable too. The bottom side of it is definitely water proof so it should do the job. Haven't had anything spilled on it yet, but it seems to be protecting the mattress well anyways.
4	1370304000	Now that both our kids have bunk beds we were running short on mattress protectors.  After a quick search on amazon I came up with these as looking good for the price I was willing to pay.  They are good quality and work fine, our daughter threw up on one just last week and nothing leaked through. However the "waterproof" part is only on the top and not the sides so some of the barf that ran down the side soaked through, that is why I give only 4 stars.  Still like the product, might order a couple more to replace some older ones and may even get one for our bed.
5	1370304000	While it is true it is hard to screw up a basic a product like this, but at least you should know that this mattress cover seems to be made with quality fabric and has been well stitched.  The elastic seems durable and the cover does fit well on a twin mattress without too much stretching, etc.This has held up well over the couple months we've been using it.  Would definitely buy this one again if needed.
4	1370304000	This product was affordable and fits the mattress well.  It stays on when the sheets are removed for washing and yet was easy to put on and remove when it is time to wash the mattress protector.
5	1370217600	I have a little one on potty training process and this product is just perfect. I will buy a couple more for the siblings shortly.
5	1370217600	Now that I have had a chance to launder this mattress cover several times, and have been using it for a month, I find it to be wearing well, and best of all, it doesn't bunch up like my previous fiber filled mattress pads did.
1	1370044800	I bought this a month and a half ago and put it on my son's new mattress. He wet the bed last night and this did little to protect the mattress. When I took the bedding off, I found that the mattress was wet and smells like pee. I own several other waterproof mattress protectors (different brands) and have never had this happen before.
5	1369872000	I have two twelve year old cats one with a stomach problem, and a visiting two year old nephew.  The protector hasn't even noticed.  Toss it in the laundry - your mattress will still be perfect.
5	1369872000	I was sceptical before I ordered this mattress protector. After searching for other similar products and reading through the reviews, the was the only one with high ratings and at an offordable price. The packaging was good and it came a day earlier than expected. The protector was way beyond my expectations. It perfectly fits around my queen size mattress without much effort.. And the makers truly fulfill the dexription of the product.  If you are looking for a good matress protector, this is the one you are looking for.
5	1369872000	We bought this mattress cover for our 2 year old who still has night time accidents once in a while. It works perfectly and is so easy to wash. :)
5	1369872000	When I arrived in Afghanistan, I needed something to cover my twin mattress. The protector was a bit tight to stretch over, but once I intalled it, I had no issues with it slipping. I feel safer sleeping on a mattress with a protective layer under me. Good value for the price.
5	1369872000	This is a great product, and it shipped very fast from Amazon.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I paid over $100 for a different mattress protector, and this one is a better quality product.
5	1369872000	As described arrived as planned does great job at protecting the mattress easy to put on and remove from the bed
5	1369872000	I have bought this product before and loved it! This time I got it at better price with fast shipping and love it just as much as the last one I purchased!
5	1369785600	Does its job well and I did not pay a fortune to use it. I recommend this mattress protector. Nice job!
5	1369785600	We have a new tempurpedic mattress and wanted to protect it from liquids as its not supposed to get wet.  Their own cover was really expensive and got terrible reviews, so I was very glad to find this one. It is a nice, thin, quiet cover. It doesn't interfere with the memory foam responsiveness, which is what I was looking for instead of those super padded covers. The pockets are plenty deep and don't budge when we raise and lower the head and foot of the bed. I will likely order a second one.
5	1369785600	We purchased this for our 3 year old's bed, who is still not fully potty trained for night time and has occasional accidents during nap time.  So far, I have been very happy with it.  He has had a couple accidents and the cover has held up well. It is also quiet, you would never know it was on the bed.
1	1369785600	As much as I would love to write a review about how great this product is I am sad to say that I cannot do so. you see I ordered this product and it says that it was delivered but I have not yet received it and although I called amazon and filed a claim a week ago I have yet to here back from them which is quite frustrating especially since I paid for next day delivery!!@!@
5	1369699200	This is absolutely as advertised.  I have a pillow-top queen mattress and was concerned whether the sides of the protector would be deep enough.  It fits great and there is depth to spare and the elastic around the inner edge assures that there is no sagging at all.  Also, the terry top is super comfortable.
5	1369699200	This is a savior!  I accidentally spilled my coffee over my month old mattress, I was praying that it did not go through the mattress protector... and  there it was a big brown spot on top of the terry cloth top of the protector and when I checked underneath, no stain at all! My mattress was spotless and dry! I cannot thank this mattress protector enough. It definitely saved me my warranty.  After washing it and putting it on the dryer (low heat), it was like new again.  I love it.  Will definitely recommend this to family & friends.
5	1369526400	This product is perfect. Waterproof, yet you wont even feel it is there. We bought this to cover our new memory foam mattress, and it worked perfectly.
4	1369526400	Haven't had a chance to test the waterproofness yet, but this fits my toddler's twin bed fine. It's not terribly crinkly or noisy, but it's mildly uncomfortable. I'd recommend having a mattress pad over it, because it's a weird terry cloth material that you can feel through the sheets.
4	1369526400	OK , product since we haven't used it long enough to tell the quality. Will update again after few washes.
4	1369526400	I bought this for my son's twin bed and it has so far done the job well. It holds up in the wash provided you follow care instructions. Would happily buy again. I wish it was softer but happy nevertheless
4	1369440000	I bought three of these for my kids 2 twin beds. I like to have an extra in case we have an accident. They seem to be constructed well and fit the beds well. Luckily I haven't had to test the waterproof feature yet.
5	1369353600	Purchased this product for my spare bedroom. My brother visited and he has a problem holding in his bowels. This kept my mattress dry and free from any accidents he had.
4	1369353600	I have three of these - one for each of the kid's bed and one for my bed (queen-sized) and I've tried others.  This is probably the best waterproof option (just when you go to dry it in your dryer, you have to put it on low heat so it doesn't melt off the waterproofing) but it does heat up especially during the summertime.  I do love the fact that it has a 10-year warranty which is why we opted for this one over the other options out there.  It is a little loose and this is over a pillowtop so it's pretty easy to put on.  Nor does it have that crinky sound or feeling with the soft terry like fabric on top.
5	1369267200	I purchased for my 2 children's twin mattresses from Costco and they fit perfect.  Have not had to test the waterproof feature yet:-) so I can't tell you how it holds up but seems to be a good product so far!I am going to be buying one for our king next!
5	1369267200	Fits great. Better quality than I thought it would've been. Fits nicely and is soft to the touch. I would but from them again&#128512;
5	1369094400	This was a great deal, these are so much more in the mattress stores. Arrived in perfect condition, great mattress protection and has a soft, terry feel, would not know you were sleeping on a waterproof mattress protector, no rubbery feel. :) Perfect & a Great deal!
5	1368835200	I'm so glad I got these for my new mattress. Two days after I put it on, my granddaughter was sick and threw up on the bed. So happy for the extra protection. So far it has worked well and at a good price.Comes with warranty also.
5	1368748800	comfortable, washes and dries well, perfect on our pillow top queen mattress! would recommend and buy again! great product great price!
5	1368748800	The mattress cover works great. Thinner than i imagined but it is working great, very durable. Cheaper in the long run when compared to buying the plastic zip on kind that seem to disintegrate in a year. And my boys are no longer sweating at night with having more of a layer of fabric between them and the plastic. Very satisfied. Will be buying another just like it when our other is out of their crib.
5	1368748800	We bought this cover for a camper bed. The matress in the bed is really nice, but the previous owners had a small dog in it and the hair was all over. We felt that after cleaning the matress this cover would be great as an additional hypoallergenic protection, from a matress that otherwise would not need to be replaced. It was a good and fiscally more sound choice as opposed to buying a new matress for a camper we will only use for 2 weeks out of the year.
4	1368748800	I needed a mattress protector because no point in spending what it costs for a mattress these days to have it ruined by a spill. The Hanna Kay premium is 100% water proof and with a 10 year warranty how could I lose.
5	1368748800	This is a great mattress protector. Washes well. I would recommend this to anyone with pets and children. Is truly waterproof.
5	1368662400	As described, kid vomited the very next day after receiving. Worked like a charm to protect new mattress. Do not dry in dryer, hang dry. Ruined my first one for my first kid many years ago.
1	1368576000	This product worked just fine for about 3 days. After the first day my little brother had an accident, we had to wash it. We remade the bed with it and about a week later, he had another accident. The mattress was wet and stained after only washing the mattress cover one time. This is the second one of these we have bought from the same company. These mattress covers are terrible and I would never buy another one ever again.
5	1368576000	This was for my mother and she was so happy to get one that (1) fit her bed and (2) was ultra thin.
4	1368489600	This mattress protector is what I expected and seems good. I won't really know for sure until I spill something on it.
5	1368403200	Lightweight, waterproof and quiet.  Perfect for when my newborn grandson comes to visit. Nothing has made it through to the mattress. Easy to care for.
4	1368230400	I've had the protector for a few months now and I don't even notice it's there. I definitely recommend it.
4	1368144000	This is a nice product and meets my expectations as a protector for a new mattress. Soft, comfortable, and the plastic-nature of the material is barely noticeable, as was written is previously reviews. Quick shipping, nice packaging, and the seller was attentive in making sure the product was what I desired.
5	1368144000	Product met expectations. Fit perfectly on our twin bed mattress for my 2 year old son. I havent had any issues!
4	1368144000	This item looks like it will do the job. Lightweight but sturdy. I have just purchased it, so cannot speak to its durability which is why I rated it a 4. Appears well made, so I anticipate no problems with it holding up.
4	1368057600	I originally bought a cheap one from the store and it fell apart in two months.  That's when I went and bought this one.  Seems to be a lot better quality.  The elastic band around it holds it tight to the mattress.
5	1368057600	We haven't had it very long, but so far, so good!  Easy to get on and off and perfectly comfortable to sleep on, not noticeable at all, and it has kept our mattress dry when our baby's diaper leaks...
5	1368057600	This is just what I was looking for. It is soft and quiet, washes nicely, and doesn't make you feel too sweaty like some others.
4	1368057600	The cover fits on the new twin mattress and is much softer than some of the other mattress covers. Still has that slight crinkle/plastic sound but as I said, MUCH better. I would purchase again.
5	1368057600	I bought this cover to protect my new mattress and it does exactly what it describes. It fits perfectly and doesn't slip or slide around.
4	1367798400	I bought this based on the reviews. It doesn't make noise which is nice. I haven't spilled anything yet so not much to report yet.
5	1367798400	Mom is in a nursing home where the beds are covered in plastic and hard as a rock. Bought this along with the All Season Down Alternative Mattress Topper and her bed is so much more comfortable. She is happier and sleeping better. This keeps everything secure and remains cozy on top.
5	1367798400	This item shipped quickly. It was exactly what they advertised. Great price! Have only had it a couple weeks, but seems to be well-made.
5	1367798400	I'have had no problems with this product since I received it. It fits well, even when I added a mattress topper to my bed. Fortunately, I haven't had any spills, etc., since I got it, but I trust that it would protect my mattress as advertised.
4	1367798400	Fits very well on the mattress, the sheets don't move at all.I choose the product because of the price and so far I'm happy with it.
2	1367798400	No way this protects in any way from leaks. I guess I was expecting a twin version of the crib waterproof sheet . turns out this item has some padding that maybe absorbs spils, but definetly does not protects the matress .
3	1367798400	There is nothing so special about this cover. No cushion just feels like a piece of plastic covered with cloth.  But if doess its job
5	1367625600	This is a great product at a very reasonable price.  It does a good job of protecting the mattress at all times.
5	1367452800	I just bought my two sons new beds.  I was surprised when they tried to sell me a mattress covers for $100 each.  They then told me that if I don't buy the cover and something happens to the matresses (stains) ten my warrantee is voided!  Really??  After I just spent Thousands of Dollars in mattresses!Anyway, I found this cover at a fraction of the cost.  And ya know what..it feels exactly like the ones in the furniture store.Don't fall for the furniture store upselling pressures -- this one is great!
5	1367452800	Works like a charm! My newborn had two accidents on my bed while I changed him. My mattress stayed protected.
5	1367452800	Product arrived on time and exactly as advertised!Very happy with the purchase.Cheaper than other similar products listed on Amazon and other sites. I recommend this product
5	1367366400	These mattress protectors are perfect for both my children's twin size beds. They fit perfectly under their sheets without any discomfort or noise. Feels good to know that their mattresses are protected from anything thing that might come in contact with them.
5	1367366400	When I bought my mattress 8 years ago, I was given a waterproof mattress protectors as a promotion with the mattress.  Mine had worn out over the years from washing and drying so it was time to get a new one.  I'll be honest, I don't need the waterproof for anything other than the occasional breakfast in bed and sweat.  Because I've used a waterproof mattress pad for the entire life of my mattress it continues to look brand new.  There are no stains, etc.  I read the reviews before purchasing this product and some said that you could heard the crinkling.  I cannot hear anything when I lay on my bed.  I don't even know it's there.  I feel like it is breathable and while I can't yet speak on it's ability to be waterproof yet, I'm certain it will be.  It was easy to wash and I dryed it on the lowest setting as indicated on the instructions and I had no problems.  Air drying is really the best way to go with the waterproof mattress pad to entend it's life, but I live in an apt and don't really have the ability to put something this big out to dry.
5	1367366400	I got a total of 3 mattress covers, for myself and family members. It's noiseless, and gives my pillow top mattress just the right amount of protection, and speedy delivery. I have no complaints at all. This mattress cover was money well spent.
3	1367366400	We have a cat who sometimes chooses to express his displeasure by urinating on our bed. When we got new mattresses for our guest beds, we wanted them protected from any damage he may cause. I bought this expecting it to be like the quilted waterproof mattress pads we have for our bed, but it is not. This product is similar to a very light towel with a waterproof plastic backing. It slides around a bit on the mattress, makes some crinkly noises (which our quilted pads do not, you'd never know they were waterproof) and is not padded.I returned two of the three mattress protectors we ordered (We used one to cover the mattress while waiting for the replacement quilted pads to arrive) because I was expecting a different type of product. That said, if you are simply looking for a slightly more discreet version of the plastic shower curtain style mattress protector, I'm sure this will work great. It trapped a lot of water in the washing machine, and I imagine the one we kept will be useful when our kids are older and potty training.
4	1367366400	It came with one black mark on it about an two inches long, but since it's under the sheet you can't see it. Otherwise it's perfect.
5	1367280000	Was what I was looking for at a good price. Fit well and looks fine. I don't hear any crinkle or notice any plastic or rubber smells. It was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. It hasn't been tested for leaking but should be fine. I was reassured that if I have a problem the company will deal with it. I say this because they emailed me after a few weeks and asked if everything was good and if I had any question.
5	1367280000	Arrived on time and works well.  I've been looking for a waterproof mattress pad that doesn't make a crinkling sound and I've found it. I would recommend this product for anyone sick and tired of those crinkly sounding mattress pads that seem to be the only ones that you find in stores.
5	1367193600	Bought this for my son's twin bed. The mattress protector lived up to its name and did a good job of keeping the mattress beneath dry.Would recommend this product and buy it again if I need it.
5	1367107200	good mattress padbought it for my girl friendit makes her sheet not slippery and stay firm with her mattress
5	1367107200	Great product.  I bought a similar brand product a few years earlier and liked it; this one is exactly as I was expecting .  My elderly parents visit at our home and I wanted to protect the new mattress I purchased for the guest room.  The fit is great and it doesn't make noise.  I have another that I use to protect our memory foam mattress.  I will never go back to regular mattress pads.
5	1366934400	Perfect fitting pad!  I had used vinyl or rubber sheet protectors, but this is a mattress pad with the protection needed.
5	1366934400	Great value, fits great and does a great job as a mattress cover.  It's a lot lower in price than some of the other covers, but does just as good a job.  I would buy this cover again.
5	1366848000	It smelled just a tiny bit when came out of a bag.The protector is soft, fits the mattress perfectly (Queen). I wash it on &#34;color&#34; cycle in the wash machine and air dry it - had not had any issue with &#34;melting&#34; as some other reviewers indicated.
5	1366848000	We have had it for over a week now and you would never know its there. I can't speak for how waterproof the liner is because we have not had any accidents yet. So far so good if anything changes I will update my review.
5	1366848000	The product does as described. It is a very comfortable mattress cover.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested.  Perella's shipped it right away so we received it in 2 days.  For a small business that is acting like they are the largest corp. in town.  If I order anything else and Perella's is on the list of companies to get it from, I will choose them.  Thank you for the great customer service.
5	1366761600	At first I was a little worried about the quality when I ordered for such a great price, but when I received I was so relieved it was excellent quality.  Placed on my toddlers bed the same day.  Perfect fit.  Would definitely order from this seller.
5	1366761600	This mattress protector met my expectations for performance. Washes well and has lasted way longer than any cheaper varieties I have tried.
5	1366588800	I received the product in good order. I have had the cover for a couple weeks and I am very pleased with it-I feel that it is an excellent value; Kudos to Perella's Amazon Marketplace-WELL DONE!
5	1366416000	Very good quality and not over-priced at all.  This product washes and dryers perfectly and fits the mattress with ease.  I would purchase again for sure.  Very pleased!
1	1366243200	This product is described as being 100% waterproof in the title. It is NOT. I would call it water-resistant at best. I have a dog with an occasional incontinence issue who sometimes sleeps on my bed. If this cover gets wet, the terrycloth top absorbs a lot of the liquid, but if you don't get it off the bed fairly quickly, it will seep through some. Not all, but certainly not 100% waterproof. My new mattress now has pee on it despite my best efforts to avoid this.It is not crinkly sounding to me and I do not find it heat-enhancing, but if what you are hoping for is a cover that can keep your mattress 100% dry during a full night's sleep after getting wet, I wouldn't buy this again. I guess I will have to now buy a crinkly, truly waterproof plastic cover.
5	1366243200	Loved this thing.  I've had some pretty crappy, krinkly mattress covers that make noise, slide around, and don't fit tightly in the corners.  This is the best one I've found.  The terry is soft and quiet, and it fits nicely under the bottom sheet.  I haven't had to check the water absorbancy issue yet (knock on wood) so I'll update if it's a fiasco, but for now, I love this thing.  Love!
5	1366243200	I am very pleased with this mattress pad. I was worried it would be loud when my child laid on it because of the plastic but it is comfortable enough for him. We have 1 accident so far and it did what i needed it to do and it washed well!
5	1366243200	Needed a waterproof pad for my Chocolate Lab that sometimes sleeps too deeply and wets the bed!The pad covers a twin-sized bed - perfect for our King-sized bed - she gets half the bed :)
5	1366156800	This was a great buy. I bought this pad for my 3yr old's bed - the price is right and it works. Shipping was fast too!
5	1365638400	So far I'm happy with the way this fits on our tempurpedic mattress...and it has a nice terrycloth like top that doesn't slide around or make crinkly noise. Neither my husband or I are bedwetters, so we may never test that part of it, but I liked the price and will be be trying it on my three year olds bed, which will be the true test!!
3	1365552000	I was looking for a complete plastic material to protect mattress from bed bugs.This product was clearly not meant for this purpose,So had to return!
5	1365552000	So far, this has been a great mattress protector.  I washed it and dried it on low.  It fits on our bed nicely, even though it is a large tempurpedic mattress.  No smell, no crinkly noises.  We're happy with the purchase...we've had it about a month now.
4	1365552000	Its cotton surface feels good. Nothing like sleeping on the plastic. Although smells a little plastic. The instruction says it should be ok after wash.
1	1365552000	I'm not one for liking the feel and sound of a mattress protector on my bed, but after reading quite a few reviews about this product I figured I'd give it a try on my brand new mattress from The Original Mattress Factory.  Here's my honest opinion...if you take all the rattiest worn-out dish cloths from your kitchen and sew them together, then glue them to a thin plastic tarp, this product is what you get.  The fabric on top is rough and the plastic backing crackles with every move.  I was not at all impressed with this purchase.  Given the previous reviews, it is my guess that the quality or construction of this product has recently changed.
1	1365552000	Wash instructions recommend washing prior to use and I followed them exactly as described.  After drying I realized that portions of the cover ended up sticking together and creating holes making the cover useless.  Instructions say to dry on low or medium heat but it should probably say hang dry only. Warranty services is a waste of time, don't expect to talk to anyone.
5	1365465600	Excellent Product, however for our double pillow top Serta, I will require two for the protection of the mattress. The first one ordered fits perfectly, I like the fact that it also holds the top sheet in place, It is a great product and I will definitely be purchasing another one. Great Service, keep up the great work.
5	1365379200	This product is as advertised.  Fully covers the mattress, stops leaks, and seems to work just fine for what it's intended.
5	1365379200	I am very happy with the quality of this Mattress Protector. Wash and Dried Nicely. Make Sure you follow the label instructions.I bought a Queen for my Full bed. As I have a Mattress pad, so this combination works great. Fits down the sides and tucks nicely.
3	1365292800	The product doesn't impressed me by look. It looks cheap, just terry cloth. But I haven't experienced whether it works or not. That's still under experiencing phrase.
5	1365206400	Researched several types of pads. Requirements were comfort, no "crackling" sound upon movement, tight fit, fluid protection, good warranty, and protection from mites, bugs and other pesky things. I purchased this for my adult son post purchasing a rather expensive mattress for his guest bedroom. I am an overly clean person, thus when sleeping on a mattress that is not mine, I want to be assured it is clean. Product met all expectations. In addition, I am a staunch supporter of small business. This is a small business operation and did a marvelous job representing the product, pricing and shipment.
5	1365120000	We upgraded our sons bed to the queen bed and great luck with the single size. The queen we put this on was a pillow top and had a great fit and is functioning well as a mattress protection barrier.
3	1365120000	This is a functional mattress pad. It will protect the mattress from spills - which was what I needed as I have a vacation rental property and needed to protect the new mattresses (many of the renters have toddlers). When I am at the house I put a plush mattress pad on top of this functional mattress pad for two reasons. The Hannah Kay pad is not a snug fit and the wrinkles in the pad become uncomfortable. I also think that it creates heat as it's rubberized. I did buy 3 more, but wouldn't buy them for my full time home where I don't have renters in the bed.
5	1365120000	When I purchased this item I wasn't sure how effective and how comfortable it would be without being able to touch and know how it would hold up to it's description. I was very happy to know that it was very soft and not crinkly underneath my fitted sheet. And with small children running through the house it's good to know that my mattress is protected. And what's even better is the 10 year warranty!!
5	1365120000	This is a great product.  It fits very nicely on newer thicker mattresses. Very happy with the fact that it is waterproof and hypoallergenic.  Price was right also!!
5	1365120000	I purchased this cover for a brand new bed. It fit perfectly with no tugging / pulling. It is noiseless and comfortable. I am quite pleased with the quality and price.
5	1365033600	this is the 2nd order and its the best .This mattress protector is awesome and I have found this mattress cover to be a great product. It has saved my mattress numerous times, as I often sleep with a newborn (leaks,spit ups). Since it is so thin it doesn't take away from the comfort of the bed. I was initially concerned that it might create hot spots, but it doesn't. It washes well and feels durable and well made. I would buy this product again if needed without hesitation.
5	1365033600	I ordered this to help with my allergies and its excellent. Does the job yet you can't hear it or feel it so its perfect. I am very pleased.
5	1365033600	Great deal.Good shipping this will keep our sleeper couches safe from the grandkids when they spend the night at Grandma and Grandpa's. Thank you
5	1365033600	I ordered this mattress protector to go UNDER my mattress pad to protect a very expensive mattress.  It's wonderful!  Fits perfectly and the top is a nice fluffy terry cloth that prevents my mattress pad from shifting around under my sheets like it did before the Hanna Kay.  I liked it so much I ordered one for my teenage son since he seems to spend most of his life in bed!
5	1365033600	I received this mattress protector in good time and it looks very nice. It has a soft suede-like appearance and feel. One has to  be careful when laundering it: no bleach, not even chlorine-free, no ironing, according to the instructions. I washed it before using, as the instructions recommend. Haven't washed it a second time yet, as it is still pretty new. It looks great and fits my very deep mattress well. I would definitely recommend this protector and the vendor.
4	1365033600	Bought this for my son to protect his mattress from random accidents. Doesn't make the Krinkle noise that most mattress protectors do and washes very easily. Definitely recommend it!
5	1365033600	it fits the queen bed we got it for perfectly. we haven't had any accidents yet to test the waterproof-ability, but it's good quality and i think it'll hold up fine.
5	1365033600	Great product,originally  ordered a twin for a kids bed for surprise accidents, and was such a great product that i bought one to replace the very expensive one on my bed that had fallen apart. it is truly water proof, and you can't tell it is on the bed, like with plastic ones, have had to wash it a few times and it still works perfect and is holding up well!
4	1365033600	I'm  very pleased with the matress protector.  It arrived promptly and I think it will be great.  It is not fancy but it will meet all of our requirements.  Thanks.I would recommend this seller.
5	1365033600	I needed a mattress cover that would protect the mattress from spills.  This mattress pad fits smoothly on the bed.  The surface next to the body is a soft low-loft terry cloth.  There is no sense of increased heat or moisture retention I experienced with my former covers.  Additionally it fit both over my mattress and a memory foam topper.  It is the best mattress cover I have owned.
5	1365033600	We bought this for our son who is still at the age where he's regularly wetting the bed. It isn't loud or crinkly, doesn't really change the feel of the bed at all but it definitely stops any liquid from coming through.
5	1365033600	Have had one of these on my/our bed, for quite some time -- and love it. Got one for the guestroom bed just to keep the matress clean. Very glad I did, as guest spilled coffee and this protected the mattress.Have washed and dried both several times now, and they hold up well.
5	1365033600	I have found that as my pets age they have accidents too so I've had to cover things to protect them.  This mattress protector was very well priced and fits over the mattress of the new sofa bed perfectly.  I would buy it again.
4	1365033600	I have yet to spill anything on this, so I cannot vouch for it's waterproofness, but I am happy with it thus far.  It's not crinkly or rubbery.  It's soft and I don't even notice that it's on the bed.
5	1364860800	We purchased a new mattress set and waited until Amazon shipped this Hanna Kay Water-proof Protector before even setting up our bed. Good thing we did. This thing saved and prolonged the warrantee on our $600.00 purchase. It does, indeed, keep water from soaking into the mattress and allows you time to clean up any spills (..or accidents). Very soft and easy to install. Our Queen mattress is almost 11 inches thick and this protector fits it just fine. Stays on well, too! What more can I say. It's a very wise investment if you want to protect your mattress.
5	1364860800	Couldn't be happier with these mattress protectors. I bought 3 of them and have zero complaints! No more washing sheets when my kids have an accident in the night! Fast shipping, great transaction!
4	1364601600	good!Hanna Kay Mattress Protector Waterproof Breathable and Hypoallergenicmattress protecter !e n j o y i t !
5	1364428800	I wanted to protect my mattress from my visiting grandson who sometimes has accidents.  So far he has had no accidents here so I can't confirm the protection but it looks like it will work.
4	1364256000	The Hanna Kay Premium 100% Waterproof Mattress Protector is really nice, fits perfect and has a great fabric. I can't tell yet if it's a perfect waterproof, but it seem it is.
5	1363996800	I have purchased other mattress protectors and was looking for one that is both waterproof and mould proof. This mattress protector fits both requirements very nicely.
1	1363910400	Do not buy this if you want a waterproof cover.  It does not work.  You will be disappointed. Grr.  Grr
5	1363910400	We ordered this protector as a replacement for our old one, whose plastic backing had disintegrated. We've pre-washed the Hanna Kay protector as per the instructions, and we can already tell that the plastic seems more durable. It is a perfect fit for our deep, queen-sized mattress.Shipping was prompt.
5	1363910400	We have had the mattress protector a few weeks now and so far very satisfied. It seems to be made of better quality than the previous one we had, for which we overpaid. I would recommend this brand.
5	1363824000	Great cover for the $$$! Washes up well and keeps the mattress clean. My child has put it to the test.
1	1363824000	DO NOT BUY if you are looking for a waterproof pad for children.  Our son has had a few accidents and eveytime it has seeped through.  The last accident was a big one and it was completely wet and reaking of urine when I took the pad off.  Waste of money.  Now I have to purchase a true waterproof pad!!
4	1363824000	I Believe this was a good product for the price. I thought it would have a better cushion than it did.The one I had was thicker and lasted awhile and was time to change. This one fit well and was thinner but may not be bad as not to be so warm.Shipping was Quick and easy the way I like it.
5	1363824000	The protector arrives, we place it on the bed and marvel at how non crinkly and quiet it is, and would you know that not 6 hours later, my little daughter gets the stomach bug? I'll spare you the gory details, but this thing works.
5	1363824000	I was looking for something lightweight yet could handle accidents in bed & found this product.  It meets my requirements thoroughly.  When I'm in the bed I don't feel the product which was exactly what I wanted.  Can't go wrong buying this.  Haven't washed it yet but I have no worries.
5	1363824000	Great mattress protector. It's really waterproof--large amounts of liquid will form puddles, but not soak through. Yet there is nearly zero crinkling, and it doesn't feel like plastic under the sheet.
4	1363824000	Only slightly noticeable as a layer between our sheets and new mattress... no manufacturing smells, just clean and fresh... we'll see how it holds up to the first time my wife spills hot cocoa in bed!... ;)
5	1363824000	This is a great item. I am using it on my memory foam mattress and it is great. We love it. Stays on really well
5	1363824000	The cover arrived in a timely manner and  was as described.  It was well packaged and as advertised is waterproof.  I have not laundered it yet but expect the results to be as described.
5	1363824000	Works great. Just like a pad I got at sleeptrain, except this is much cheaper.  Really keeps the mattress dry from accidents. My son's had two and the mattress was dry!
4	1363737600	We received it earlier than estimated, which was great.  The product works well so far.  We are happy with the purchase.
5	1363737600	I have 2 of these to make sure that no sweat or water soils my mattresses. Feels great and works as a charm.
4	1363651200	I have a foam mattress and bought this just in case my wife's water broke in the middle of the night. Once we put it on, I forgot it's even there. So far, so good.
5	1363651200	This product is great for our toddler. I love that is hypo allergenic and WATER PROOF. It makes no noise either
5	1363651200	Recieved the item quickly and was very impressed with the durability of the item for the price. Seems very well made, soft and is waterproof. There is no noise when moving in the bed. Quite pliable and love the terrycloth top portion.
5	1363651200	Fit our queen mattress perfectly. It is made of good quality materials. Washes and drys easy. Pretty much perfect for what we wanted!
5	1363651200	Great price and works really well, is soft to and not plasticky. Makes the bed feel comfy while protecting it from dust mites etc.
5	1363651200	Super lightweight, high-quality, easy-wash mattress protector! Unlike others, this doesn't have a plastic-y smell or crinkle. No plastic liner to crumble, tear, or peel off in the dryer. A far more advanced product than the traditional mattress pad/protector. Perfect for my still-in-overnite PullUps/still pees thru Pull-Ups kid.
5	1363651200	This is a great mattress pad.  We've tried others that make you hot when you sleep on them, but this one is great.  It washes well and protects the mattress from accidents.
4	1363564800	I bought this in readiness to potty train my son.  Fortunately, he has not tested out the waterproof feature yet.  But before I put it on his bed, I poured a cupful of water on it and it didn't leak through.  You could feel the coldness of the water on the underside, but there was no actual moisture.  I don't know what would happen if your child decided to wet the bed and keep on sleeping for a few more hours.  I was also concerned that it would be noisy because of the plastic, but it isn't noisy at all.  Very happy with this purchase.
5	1363478400	love this product , want it in a king size, would order time and again, very nice keeps mattress clean
5	1363392000	Product was exactly as advertised. The seller, Perella's, shipped the product promptly and I received it as expected. The product performed as advertised in the areas of fitting on the mattress and protecting it from liquids. My three-year old son had an overnight accident while sleeping on his brand new mattress. Luckily the cover arrived before the mattress and was in place to prevent any soiling. Excellent seller and product.
5	1363305600	Good price, good quality. Perfect for my bed. Came fast. I am happy with my purchase. Really recommend to other people. Thanks
4	1363219200	Our daughter just got her first big girl bed and this protector is a perfect fit. We were looking for quality (cotton and hypoallergenic) and good price. We found both. Shipping was quick too !
4	1362873600	Ordered this mattress cover to replace an old worn out one. The new cover seems to be of good quality and fit the mattress (queen) perfectly. Haven't had an opportunity to check the moisture-blocking properties yet so I won't comment on those claims. Order arrived as scheduled in undamaged packaging. I am happy so far with the product and the seller.
4	1362787200	This seems to be an okay mattress cover.  We can only comment on the way in which it was made, not durability or to the degree it's waterproof.  It fits our queen mattress well; this mattress is not an over-sized pillow top and I'm not sure this mattress would be for one of these mattresses.
5	1362700800	I purchased this mattress cover because I have a three year old who comes in our bed most nights and refuses to leave.  While he is absolutely potty trained during the day, there are likely to be accidents at night :-(.  The other problem involved in this situation of "not going to sleep in my own bed" is he is a "big boy" and refuses to sleep in a pull-up at night.  If he wakes up and I have "slipped" one on while he was asleep he will take it off.  Therefore, I bought this mattress cover and it is amazing.  It felt plasticy (sp) when I took it out of the package and I was concerned about it.  I washed it as instructed on the packaging and dried it.  Once I put it on the bed and slept on it there was not plastic feeling at all.  I move around on the bed at night and cannot even tell that there is a mattress cover on it.  It's amazing!
5	1362700800	Really like the mattress pads. They arent plastic on top like our last ones, thereby holding up much better. Will probably b a few more!
4	1362700800	Thyis fits my very deep pillow topped mattress and does not make me hot. Would recommend to anyone, it arrived very quickly.
5	1362614400	I've bought a mattress protector before for double the price and hated it.  I LOVE this one. We have a memory foam mattress and my husband said with the first one you couldn't even feel the mattress.  This one is amazing.  If anything it makes the bed even more comfortable.  I highly recommend this product.
1	1362614400	The mattress bad is to big for our queen size bed. It also is so slippery no sheets that I have tried will stay on, even deep pocket.
5	1362614400	I purchased this item because I wanted to protect my four-year old's new mattress.  I wanted something that would be waterproof and at the same time breathable.  This mattress protector is great!
5	1362614400	I ordered this waterproof mattress pad to protect my 5 year old's twin mattress from any late night "oops."  Our previous mattress pad got ripped and would no longer stay on the bed.  After receiving this one I washed it and put it on his bed, it fit much better than the old one (probably less likely to rip this way) and was softer and cushier than the old one.  It doesn't feel like a piece of plastic either.  Be sure to read the laundering directions as bleach will destroy the waterproofing.  It arrived on time in adequate packaging!
5	1362614400	Speedy delivery. We got a new mattress and decided to use a mattress protector.  It goes on easy and easy to pop off to wash, unlike the ones that encase the mattress and zip closed.
5	1362614400	I purchased two of these for my daughter's bunk beds. They are high quality, go through the washer and dryer just fine, and fit great on the beds. Excellent value.
5	1362614400	This was exactly as described and very easy to put on.  I was able to get it and put it right onto my queen size mattress.
2	1362614400	The order came quickly, packing was great, new packaging.  The product itself wasn't great.  The mattress pad made the bed very warm, so we took it off the bed.
5	1362614400	Product arrived on time.  Seems to work well and looks durable.  I ordered a 2nd for the trundle where there is little clearance as it is not a bulky mattress pad.
5	1362614400	I moved my toddler into a big boy (twin) bed but he is not yet potty trained.  I wanted a mattress protector for any overnight accidents that might happen.  This product was just how it is described, delivered quickly (I am a prime member so I got free 2 day), and very fairly priced.  Thank you!
5	1362441600	WORKS LIKE I EXPECTED BED BEEN WET FREE ESPECIALLY FROM MY SON WHO ALWAYS SPILLING STUFF ON MY BED, THE BEST MATTRESS COVER.
5	1362355200	Exactly as described! Already had 1 spill and thank goodness the mattress protector was on and soaked it up! Arrived quickly and have had no problems.
4	1362268800	Very happy with this product,it was  shipped very quick, very happy with the quality, and comfort of this protector, and best of all it was priced equal to anything I could find at the mall or anyplace .
4	1362096000	I was hesitant about this because it is so thin, but it does work.  We use this on my 3 year old's bed and have no leaks through to the mattress.  It is thin and soft and doesn't crinkle like plastic.
5	1362096000	I was surprised to receive such a thin waterproof mattress pad.  It works perfectly and we've had quite a few accidents to test it.  I don't think its noisy at all. Would definitely recommend.
5	1362009600	Want to dramatically improve your quality of life and be a better person?  If you do, this mattress pad probably isn't what you are looking for.  Are you looking for a high quality mattress pad that is far less expensive than the competitors - if so then this is solution.  Do you really need a mattress pad that has a fancy name or is made of italian goat fibers?  I don't.  Waterproof?  Check.  Hypoallergenic?  Check.  Better than noisy plastic that sounds like you are sleeping on paper?  Check.  What more do you need?  If you spend more than 45 seconds shopping around for the best mattress pad you really need to reevaluate your priorities in life.
5	1362009600	This is a great deal on a really nice breathable mattress protector.  There is nothing worse than the ones sold at the chain stores, those ones will make you sweat, not so with the Hanna Kay protector.  For this price I would recommend this for sure!
4	1362009600	We bought this for our almost 3 year old's 'big boy' bed.  We fortunately haven't tested the fact that it's waterproof but it fits good and is quiet. We plan to buy another to have a complete extra set for future accidents!
5	1362009600	With a fitted sheet over it, this protector is very quiet and causes neither of us to sweat. We haven't tested the waterproofness of it, but it looks very well made.
4	1362009600	I was excited when I found this mattress cover and ordered it for my bed. I was disappointed when it came in to find that it wasn't one that zippered closed. I was really looking for one like that and when I saw hypoallergenic I must have assumed it w
5	1362009600	I've bought these mattress protectors before and have been pleased. They fit well, wash well, and are made of nice material.
5	1361836800	Got this for my son's first "big boy bed".  He is well potty trained, so we have not tested the water-proofness of the product.  However, I can say I appreciate how well it washed and dried (1x only), and how soft and supple the waterproof layer is.  I have had cheaper waterproof mattress pads that are basically just a sheet of hefty plastic, loud and crinkly, hot and holding damp/sweat - Yuck.  But this is nothing like that.  Beautifully comfortable.  Would recommend as a safety net for a possible wet night, but can't say whether it would withstand constant heavy wetting - other reviewers seem mostly satisfied, with a few naysayers.... But I'm a "Yes!"
5	1361836800	Excellent bed protection for incontinent sleeper. Especially like the larger size, which keeps the pad flat--no bunching up as he tosses and turns.
5	1361664000	I needed a new mattress cover to fit my queen mattress. I have lots of spills and such from the kids and have to have something over my mattress at all times. This protector is better than expected in quality. Definitely would buy another if I needed to.
1	1361664000	I would love to give an accurate review of the product. However I can't considering I didn't even receive the correct mattress protector! The product I received was completely DIFFERENT. Different brand, consisted of different materials, poor quality, even a different COLOR. The only thing that was the same as what is pictured is the product packaging. Someone bought a Home Accents Decor Essentials ivory mattress protector (although it wouldn't have protected anything because it was so thin and cheap) made from 100% polyester and switched it with the product I thought I was buying. The Hanna Kay mattress protector I thought I was buying is made from 80% cotton/20% polyester as stated on the front. What I received was no where near what I intended on buying. Thankfully Amazon customer service was very understanding and I am receiving a full refund. DO NOT BUY THIS! The seller (Perella's)  is a scam artist!
5	1361664000	Product seems well made, does not have a cheap feel to it. Pockets are big enough for "deep" needs but still fits regular size queen well.
5	1361577600	I will admit that I haven't yet tested its waterproofing abilities. That said, this mattress protector is fantastic. I had previously gone to a big box store and just randomly grabbed a waterproof mattress protector thinking it would be adequate. I couldn't have been more wrong - it felt like we were sleeping on plastic tarp. Who knew that someone could sell such an inferior product? So after wasting $30 and throwing it in the trash, I went online to spend 30 minutes reading mattress protector reviews. This one seemed well-reviewed, and when it arrived and I put it on my bed, the difference could not have been more dramatic. This one is soft, thin, and you don't even know it is on the bed. We could actually feel the new mattress that we just spent a ton of money on. No plastic tarp anymore! Love it!!!
5	1361404800	So far, product appears to be worth every penny!  Purchased to cover new memory foam mattress. Fits perfect for a 12&#34; mattress.
5	1361404800	Better quality than expected. Well made and the fit is just right.  Looks good and the extra padding is welcome.
5	1361404800	I ordered 2 of these for my twin beds because I often have my young grandchildren visiting.  They are toilet trained, but occasionally, just occasionally, there is an accident.  These covers are soft and flexible and not like many other moisture proof covers on the market.  I highly recommend them.
4	1361404800	Update: My son has wet the bed a couple times and had a bloody nose once and nothing has permeated this mattress cover! So glad I bought two!We purchased this for my two-year-old son's bed.  I did a lot of research about mattress pads and knew I wanted one that would be quiet and waterproof.  This fit the bill.  It is thin and feels like terry cloth.  Not sure how well the waterproof protection will be since he's not potty training and doesn't leak through his diapers.  I hope it's enough, and I trust that it is based on the other reviews here.
5	1361318400	Just what I needed and there is no plastic sound or feel to this item.  Fits perfect also.  Would highly recommend
4	1361318400	This matress protector is as described and fits perfectly.  It's a bit thicker than most, but is still comfortable.  The waterproof factor hasn't been tested, but I would trust the durability.
5	1361232000	I purchased two of these for beds in my home.  Have worked great through a direct coffee spill to the bed.  Next up...potty training.
5	1361145600	I have 3 dogs who love to sleep on my bed. We all know what dogs do, so I ordered this product to help save my new bed. It is thick, and yes very waterproof. Already saved my mattress from a soda glass my dogs knocked out of my hand.
4	1360800000	Well to be honest, this is my first mattress protecter, so I cannot compare with other brand. I like the fact that it is covered with cotton so that the sheet on the top of it doesn't move around and feels good. But also, because of the cotton, you have to wash it(not just wipe it out) and dry it before use.. Several times pee leaked out of the diaper but this product saved our mattress. Overall I am satisfied with this product so I purchased 5 of them.
5	1360800000	This appears to be a quality mattress cover without the bulk and crinkle noise of most others.  Have not at the opportunity to see how well it works but it looks like it will do the job.
5	1360800000	I purchased this for a child that wets the bed.  It has kept the mattress dry when she wets.  It does just what it says it does.
5	1360454400	These bed protective run anywhere from 60-100 bucks in the store this is a great one for less.  It proctects my daugthers bed when they have accidents at nite and nothing leaks through to the mattress.  This will last you a long time if you follow the care instructions.  Remeber do not bleach it because it will eat away the plastic lining and do not put it in the dryer
3	1360281600	I should have read the description better.  It fits  mattresses 6&#34; to 22&#34; and my foam mattress is 6&#34; so there is  a LOT of extra material on all four sides.  I suppose it will be covered by a fitted and flat sheet and out of sight but I know it is not snug to the mattress how I intended.
5	1360281600	The mattress protector came quickly and is just what I need.  It fits over my thick mattress and my 4" memory foam with room to spare.  Very comfortable!
5	1360195200	This mattress pad is great.  It's super soft on the top and doesn't sound plasticy when you move around on the bed.  Fits my queen size bed perfectly!
5	1360195200	soft, protective, and the right size. shipped quickly.  It isn't possible to repack into the plastic zippered package, but I don't really see myself putting it away ever.
5	1360195200	After having previously purchased a vinyl mattress protector (and it ripping apart while putting it on the mattress), I decided to take a chance with this Hanna Kay brand cover. How pleased I am!!!!The material is very comfortable, and breathable, AND somehow manages to resist water.This was a great purchase. With a new baby coming, I'll be buying another one, for our other bed :)
5	1360195200	I haven't had anything spill in my bed yet but the material is quiet when on the bed and I can't notice it under my regular sheets. The mattress pad fit like a glove (queen) and the water protecting layer doesn't only cover the top but also the sides of the mattress. Fast shipping too!
5	1360195200	I have a 10 inch memory foam mattress. This mattress protector is a little big, but is able to fit snuggle around the sides. No comfort issues or any other problems
2	1360195200	I was expecting it to be softer but it will work for the guest bed. I will order a feather topper instead and pay a little more.
1	1360195200	i hate the fact that my  son's brand new mattress is now pee soaked.he peed and it ran from near the side of the mattress and into the area where the lalminate no longer exists.the urine travels until it settles and this has virtually no soakability, absorbancy. that is terribly lacking.if you anticipate an accident, better be prepared and use something in addition to soak up urine before it simply runs down the pad and reaches the elastic where it will soak in.bummer
5	1359849600	This is a nice quality item that fits over my queen size mattress and a 3" foam topper without being too tight.  In fact, it would comfortably fit over a thicker topper.  The mattress protector is silent, which is great because I am a light sleeper and toss and turn a lot!  I haven't washed it yet so I can't comment on that, but I've been using it since right after Christmas and I have no complaints so far.
5	1359676800	I don't even notice it's there but it's saved our very expensive mattress multiple times! I have a new baby and he co-sleeps. This is great for leaky diapers!
4	1359676800	I bought this twin mattress protector to go on a day bed.  I haven't actually used it yet, so I can't say how it fits, but the quality of the material looks to be nice.
5	1359676800	Finally, a comfortable, sturdy product that doesn't fall off the corners of the bed at night! We have had the mattress pad for a month and it has been great for protecting our pricey pillow-top mattress.
5	1359590400	Very happy with this mattress pad.  My old one had a plastic liner that would shift and cause big creases in my fitted sheet.  It also didn't breathe.  This pad doesn't do that at all - it stays put and is very comfortable.  Also, it is half the price of my old one!
4	1359417600	Bought this for kids beds.  They wash up just fine, but depending on how much liquid gets on the sheet/protector, it will be slightly damp (hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating).
5	1359331200	Tried this after two attempts with box box store purchases where waterproof liner started to deteriorate almost immediately. Has held up very well through 4 washings now. Covers entire mattress surface. Slight rustling sound that we don't find noticeable once fitted sheet placed on top.
5	1359072000	Soft, comfortable and easily washable. My kid likes to hold her milk at night and it drips everywhere. This mattress protector helps protect my mattress without that crinkly sound from the plastic ones. Plus the price is great.
5	1358985600	I'm satisfied with the mattress protector. It fits all the way around my queen size mattress. Haven't spilled anything on it yet, so I don't know if it actually protects the mattress like it says it does. But I have no reason to believe it doesn't at this point. Good Product.
5	1358985600	Received this item yesterday and put it right on the bed. We have a select comfort bed w/pillow top and I had put one of those plastic covers on it just to protect the mattress. I would get so hot; uncomfortably hot and I attributed it to the plastic cover. This new cover is just great! Not hot, no plastic noise as someone else posted (can't figure that one out), fits great. I am a very satisfied customer!
5	1358985600	Decent product for the price.  It doesn't feel too &#34;Plastic&#34;.  It's comfortable and does the job.  So far, it's keeping mattress clean.
5	1358812800	After purchasing our pillow top bed, my grandson wanted to nap in my bed of course, I knew sometimes he would cause a leak so I decided to purchase a protector that would not take away the feel of the pillow top.  After searching for over a week a friend mention Hanna Kay on Amazon and so I did.  The fit was perfect, the terry cotton top along with the waterproof backing was just what I was hoping for.
4	1358726400	This is one of the few products I have bought that actually comfortably fit my california queen size bed! Fast shipping! Very happy with my purchase.
5	1358726400	I ordered this mattress protector due to our dog being on the bed and having incontinence problems.  I put this over the mattress pad and mattress and it is great!  If the dog wets through the sheets, all we have to do is strip the sheets off, use a alcohol wipe on the protector.  A great value for a great product!  I will recommend this is anyone who wants a product that does what it says.  Thank you!
2	1358553600	for the price looks good and very soft. defintly not water proof . machine wash and dry holds it shape
5	1358553600	Within days of putting this on the bed our toddler wet it.  The soft, thin material absolutely protected the mattress!!  It's easy to wash, not bulky, easy to put on the bed.  I love it!
1	1358467200	Some of the other reviews said they didn't notice the plastic part underneath (the sound or feel of it). As soon as i took it out of the package i knew i was in trouble, but went ahead and put it on the bed anyway just to see how it felt. It was awful. I even took the next step and put the sheet on hoping that might make a difference. Wrong! Every move you make you will hear and feel the plastic! If that's something you don't mind, then this might be for you! I will be returning this, as much as it kills me to have to pay to ship it back, It will be worth it getting a different one!
4	1358467200	We've had it on our bed, it's comfortable and we don't know it's there.  Well constructed and easy to maintain - washes well.  I would recommend it.
5	1358380800	Excellent product.Affordable price and premium quality. Could not ask for more. I recommend this product over any other even more expensive protectors.
5	1358380800	This is an excellent product. Easy to launder. A boon to a household with five cats that have trouble with furballs and like to "present"  them on beds. Wish I could find one for twin beds.
5	1358380800	Very nice product and the waterproofness was tried out in it's first use and passed with flying colors. I like that it is a very thin product, no padding just protection. Good quick service.
5	1358380800	The mattress pad is soft and most important, it is waterproof. The pad fits well on the bed and does not have any lumps in the bed.
5	1358294400	I love this mattress pad. It fits perfectly on our deep depth mattress and is clearly well made. Bonus is it's hypoallergenic properties. Great value for the money.
5	1358294400	We'd gotten this when our new puppy was small and jumped on the bed. After a couple of accidents, we decided to get something to protect the bed.The mattress cover fits well on the mattress. Although she has not wet the bed since we've gotten it, it has protected the mattress when she threw up on top of the bed.I like the fact that the side that is on top is terrycloth like. It is does not get hot like another product we'd used before.We'd buy this product again.
5	1358294400	The product is roomy for extra thick mattresses.  It's comfortable to sleep on - no plastic feeling.  The quality is good.  I would order again.
5	1358294400	This mattress protector was purchased for my son's twin bed. It is soft and doesn't make that plastic-y crinkle noise when he moves in bed. We have washed it once so far and it washed very nicely.
5	1358294400	I was worried that this would feel like laying on trash bags, but was pleasantly surprised that you do not notice it under the sheets, I have put these on all the beds in my house and it is very comforting to know that the mattresses stay much cleaner and healthier. Great price on amazon, most stores near me were selling these for 129.99
5	1358294400	We found this item listed on Amazon and were pleased at the great value and quick service.  Our Grandson just moved from his crib to a queen size mattress and we wanted the extra protection.
5	1358208000	We've had this for over a year now, and it's holding up quite well. The last mattress protector he had on our bed shredded like tissue paper. This one is soft, and stands up under our large chocolate lab who jumps on the bed. We're not so sure about it being "water proof".
5	1357948800	Had to use this as a bed-sheet (with no sheets on top) for a few days, and it was still quite comfortable, no sounds or extra heat whatsoever. Does the water-proof job well too, been tested. surprisingly good for the price.
5	1357948800	This protector is not noisy, it is thin but seems adequate for mattress protection. This item Arrived promptly. I am happy with it
4	1357862400	I love it except it's a bit loud ... but you get used to that. 4 stars. It kept water from this leaking ice pack away from my new mattress, perfectly!
5	1357776000	Comfortable. Great asset for my son's bed. Worth every pennies. Not cheaply made and easy to put on. Washing machine clean.
3	1357776000	Bought this for my 2 year old's twin bed. She is potty training so this was a necessity. Had one accident on it so far, and it didn't leak through to the mattress, so it works. Only downfall, it seemed really cheap looking, and is very thin. It also sounds like plastic. I am comparing it to another waterproof mattress cover I bought for my son a few years ago at Home Goods (also really inexpensive) but it was fluffier and very quiet, and worked. Overall, it does the job. For the price it's a good buy. Just wished it was a little fluffier, for comfort.
1	1357689600	We purchased these for our children's new mattresses. Having young children, I tried to follow the advice of a fellow mom to get high quality mattress covers by reading the ratings on these. After the second use (and no bleach in the only washing-I followed directions on laundering), and a night time accident, the new mattresses were soiled with urine. Grr...I'm disappointed!
5	1357430400	The mattress pad appears to be a good quality item. It's comfortable, it fit well and I am happy with purchase.
5	1357430400	We bought this for our 2 year old after we potty trained her. It has kept her mattress dry each time she's had a nighttime accident.
5	1357171200	I got this as a gift and I was surprised at the quality when it came. For such a low cost I expected it to be a cheap plastic thing but it wasn't it has nice soft cloth on the top and a rubberized side underneath.  I bought one of these through a bed store when I purchased my queen size pillow top and it cost twice this. I am very happy with my purchase.
5	1357084800	I have this protector on all three beds in my household. Very strong, good quality and fits on the beds snugly.
3	1357084800	The top is waterproof but the sides feel and look almost like they are made of some kind of paper, visqueen maybe? But for the money it gets the job done.
5	1356998400	The old one I had for my roommates bed was worn after multiple washings so I got him this one as a gift and its a great product
5	1356912000	We've only had this mattress about a month but so far it has lived up to our expectations, my husband has a very bad back and we have tried more expensive brands but so far this mattress helps him more than any other brand we have tried.
5	1356652800	We have ones for our queen size bed and twins beds. We love them, other cheaper protectors would fall apart when washed. this one holds up great. Also we have had spills and accidents and nothing has gone through. Well made product.
5	1356652800	Was on sale. We have others and they last over 5 years. Super fast shipping.  Dropped water on it and did not penetrate bed
5	1356048000	This product works exactly as described and comes with a great warranty. I loved it so much that I bought another one for my mom to use!
5	1355875200	This a good mattress cover for anyone looking for something simple without all the quilting, extra padding. It works like the more expensive rain gear using a synthetic barrier that breathes but does not allow liquids to pass through.  It's also better than the coated barriers in terms of noise and does not make you feel like you are sleeping on plastic sheets. It has a elastic band to keep the cover snug which might be a concern for those with latex allergies. The packaging does not say latex free.
5	1355788800	This is a great mattress protector and the price was very reasonable! We received the item quickly too! It fits great over my son's pillow top mattress, the other ones we had kept ripping and this one fits very well.
5	1355788800	We are pleased with the mattress top we ordered. Worried about odor at first, but no problem at all. Perfect for our hard mattress - very comfortable!
5	1355788800	We are very much pleased that we found the right product at a reasonable price.It fits perfectly on the beds. We bought 2 of them. We haven't washed yet. Hopefully i think the product will stay as it is even after washing.
2	1355616000	I recently bought my young child a new mattress and purchased this (size: twin) to help keep it dry from the occasional bed-wetting accident.  I washed the mattress protector prior to the first use and was sure to follow the directions (I washed it in cold water, no bleach). I dried it on low with some towels I had also washed (it took practically all day to dry) and then put it on the bed. All went well the first couple of weeks... but that's because my child didn't wet the bed.  The first time he had an accident, I was surprised to find that urine went straight through the mattress protector.  It offered zero protection.  Good thing I had a vinyl protector underneath just in case or my brand new mattress would've been ruined! Would not purchase this again and would not recommend.
3	1355529600	The top seems to be of quality, but sides are flimsy, too big.  I will be very surprised if this lasts thru one washing.  Not a product I will buy again for my 90 year old mother in assisted living.
5	1355356800	Excellent product, as advertised. Make sure to use low or medium dry only to preserve the material. This is only for protection from accidents, the unexpected. Use a separate urine water-proof sheet for children or babies to minimize frequent laundry.
5	1355184000	It works what can I say) I wash it 3 times per week and it's like new one. Great product. Have no troubles with it. and cheap! I bought 2 protectors and totally satisfying!
5	1355097600	for the price this protector is great. it actually has a soft fuzzy top compared to other protectors that are all plastic. fits well on my queen bed. doesn't make any noise. can't even feel it under the sheets. highly recommend.
5	1355097600	I brought this cover for my little son who has a little bit of a bed wetting problem & it works great.
5	1355097600	The protectors are great quality.  We have already washed several times and they still look like new!  We received the order very quickly.  We would definitely buy again, if needed.
5	1355097600	i have dogs that like to get attention by peeing on my bed, i bought this skeptical if it would work or not, and it does like a charm! its the quietest one I've bought yet, also the 5th one I've tried and the last one ill have. it doesn't seem like it would be water proof based on the feel and touch of it, but it feels soft and comfortable and is as water proof as it can get!i trust this on my $1300 mattress, and you will be happy with the affordable and great quality purchase!it came very quick too!thank you amazon
5	1355097600	This cover fits nice and was half the price of ones sold in our furniture store. It was shipped fast too.
5	1354665600	Quality made and great fit also, I was impressed and it cost lots less than in local stores, After a few months it is stilllike new and I still think this is a great buy and the shipper is fast also,  I would recommend to everyone,
5	1354579200	I haven't dumped liquids on the bed, so I can't say how well it protects the mattress. But it holds the bed sheet in place, and preventing it from rising up. (I use a flat sheet, instead of a fitted sheet for the mattress.) Happy with the purchase.
5	1354320000	I bought this to replace a similar protector that I bought from QVC about 5 years ago. I paid 48.00 for that one. The plastic backing started to separate and tear, so I bought this one. It cost much less and has a 10 year warranty. This is very good protection from any moisture getting onto your mattress and there is no sound like you get with plastic covers. I have a very thick mattress and it fit great, no problem. I've had it on for about a month now and it does not pop off the corners, it stays put.
5	1354233600	I got this to protect my brand new memory foam mattress I purchased at the same time.  It works great, fit fine, and it is indeed waterproof!  I had accidents by the kids, and I just took it off and washed it!
5	1354233600	This Mattress Pad does really work. My husband at times does leak, and the mattress stays completely dry.  It is very easy to wash, and because it is lightweight, it drys quickly in the dryer.  I highly recommend this product!
4	1354147200	Ordered Queen size mattress pad for the guest bed, fits well and like the 10 year warranty.  Since I did not have any water spill so far and I don't know the extend of the waterproof function; therefore I gave it 4 stars.  It is thinner than anticipated but it is well made with a waterproof backing and soft feel on top.  The advantage of a thinner material is that it can be washed in non-commercial washer and will end up saving money in the long run.  Would recommend this product.
5	1354147200	This product was shipped in a timely manner and arrived just as described. It fits my mattress and I can't tell it's there. I'm not sure how waterproof it really is yet.
5	1354147200	I am most pleased with this purchase.  I recently purchased my first new mattress in over 10 years and, is part of the sales pitch, I was offered sheet sets and a waterproof mattress pad.  The rationale was that any eating or drinking in bed could result in a spill that could permanently damage my new mattress.  I thought this made some sense but I was not going to spend $79 for one.  I researched on Amazon and found this product with the same warranty and at a much lower price. I made my purchase and it was delivered when promised and I have it on my new bed and couldn't be happier.  It feels like an ordinary pad and in no way interferes with the comfort or fit of my sheet sets.I would not hesitate to make future purchases from Perella's.
3	1354147200	it definitely protects the bed. just be careful when you wash and dry this thing. a few years ago i dried it on the low setting and the plastic melted together and made it unusable..
5	1354147200	I think this mattress cover is a good value.  You can spend a lot more, but in my experience, it makes no difference in the comfort or quality.  This is comfortable under sheets, not crinkly like some mattress covers.  I have 3 of them in various sizes and will keep buying these as needed to replace the ones I currently have.  They are also very easy to put on.
5	1354147200	Very good value. Fits well to queen mattress. Haven't seen any leaks yet. Comfortable. No cracking sounds while sleeping.-Sam.
4	1354147200	I haven't had any major tests or accidents to know if this is truly 100% proof but for the price it is working well. I plan to order another one for our other new bed.
5	1354147200	This is a great waterproof mattress pad. It is soft and not plastic feeling like most waterproof mattress covers that are in this price range. I bought it for my 11 month old son's queen sized bed (he naps in his own bed, but still sleeps with us at night- hoping to have him sleeping in there at night within the next couple of months.). He has not actually leaked through his diaper yet while napping in the bed for me to be able to test its waterproofness, but after thoroughly examining it, I feel confident it would definitely be just fine. It is top of the line quality, at a very affordable price. I highly recommend it!
5	1354147200	I was very please when I opened the package containing the waterproof mattress pad/protector. The price was great and the quality of the product was, too. I would recommend this to anyone considering the purchase of a mattress cover.
5	1354147200	I really love this mattress cover. Would buy again and again. Why spend more when you can buy this one.
5	1354147200	Terrific cover, goes on easy, keeps mattress dry, we are in the middle of potty training so this really helps with the accidents.The item was sent out the day it was ordered, and I received it two days later, overall a pleasurable experience.
5	1354147200	The mattress cover seems to be good quality.  Water proofness has not been tested yet.  Came rapidly and was packaged well.  Would recommend at this time.
3	1354147200	We have not used-or even opened the package of-this item, but the shipping was fast, and the item appears to be exactly as appeared/described at Amazon's website. In conclusion, we will give it a neutral rating of 3 stars until we have the chance to use this item and rate is accordingly.
5	1353888000	we purchased the Hanna Kay Mattress Protector when we needed a mattress waterproof protector cover.  I know it works because I poured water on it to verify functionality before putting it into real use.We are very pleased going into the second month.
5	1353542400	This matress cover fits perfectly and it does not make any noise, like some of the cheaper plastic versions. My daughter has gotten sick twice on my bed since buying this product and it has made for very easy clean up.
5	1353456000	Great cover it is exactly as advertised and a grassy value. I received it right on schedule and it does a fantastic job protecting my mattress and it of hypoallergenic. Great buy.
5	1353456000	HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR EACH OF OUR BEDS.  LIGHT WEIGHT, GENEROUS IN DEPTH AND EASY TO USE.  NICE TO HAVE PROTECTION FOR OUR MATTRESSES.
5	1353110400	I like the sturdiness of this cover. It is also soft and for a waterproof makes no plastic sound which can be annoying.
5	1353024000	It's comfortable, inexpensive, and works as advertised.  My 4 year old son has an accident every few weeks and it's been standing up to all his little dinger can throw at it, thus far.
5	1353024000	So far I have thrown this in the washing machine twice and it is still together. Very soft and definitely protects my three year old's mattress.
5	1353024000	Very nice mattress protector for the price. Does not feel hot at all. Although we have not spilled anything yet, it seems to be pretty resistant. Would recommend this to anyone.
5	1353024000	I bought the mattress protector to help keep my mattress longer and protect it from pet hair. It works well and fits  the Queen mattress that we have perfectly.
5	1353024000	Very good quality and very pleased how well it sits on the mattress. This is my second one so I would say I am very very happy with the product
4	1353024000	Exactly what I was looking for. Almost identical to one I bought for my sons bed that was double the cost. Easy to put on and remove for cleaning.
4	1352937600	So I bought this for a new mattress and it works. I haven't tested the water proof but it covers the whole mattress.. cleans well and hasn't torn. it's basically undetectable i would suggest this product to someone.
5	1352851200	This was an excellent product for the price. Many items just like it were much more money and some weren't even as nice.
4	1352419200	Was looking for something better than the traditional type of mattress pad that poses a variety of problems in terms of dependability for leak prevention (?), ease of laundering and storage, etc.This relatively new style of mattress protector seems to fill the bill.It's lightweight, non-bulky, and easy to install over the mattress; ours is standard depth, but it appears to have lots of stretch room for deeper models.There's a thin layer of terry cloth on the upper surface, and a flexible, lightweight protective layer on the bottom.Waterproof factor hasn't been "tested" yet, but so far it's definitely an improvement over the older style covers.And the price seemed very reasonable, esp. compared with similar items currently on the market.
5	1352332800	I ordered two of Hanna Kay Premium 100% Waterproof Matress Protectors.  They are very nice, have a soft terry cloth type fabric, fit the beds perfectly, one a CA King and the other a queen.  We are very pleased with our purchase and would recommend these.
5	1352332800	I recently ordered this product because i have child with a bed-wetting issue. This thing has saved my mattress as well as saving me time steam cleaning my mattress. Really easy to use. Just slip in on like a sheet and slip it off to throw it in the washer.
5	1352332800	Great product.  Can't even tell it's on the bed...no unwanted noises when turning over in bed.Appears to be exactly as advertised.
5	1351036800	We have a two-year old who just potty trained but occasionally has accidents at night. Our baby is sleeping on a low IKEA queen bed. This is a great product overall and I don't have any complaint about it.
5	1351036800	I am thrilled with my Hanna Kay Premium Mattress Protector: it is completely silent, very comfortable, fits my mattress nicely and my sheets don't slide around on top of it.  After trying many different styles and brands, I have FINALLY found what I have been looking for in a mattress protector.  The top of the protector is waterproof, but the sides are not; construction is excellent and it launders with ease.  My second concern was controlling allergies and this protector does make a positive difference in my health.  This is a long way to say that I am THRILLED with my Hannah Kay Premium Mattress Protector and will buy another to keep for a backup.  A STRONG five stars for Hanna Kay!
5	1351036800	This product met all my expectations.  I didn't get to put it on the bed but my daughter-in-law said it fit well and the individual who needed it on their bed experienced no issues with the cover.
5	1351036800	This has been a couch saver for our fairly new sofas. Our dog is on some medicine that is making her incontinent and she doesn't even know when it happens. We just put this cover down where she hangs out and it catches everything with no leaking. It is easy to wash and dry and comes out fresh every time. Oh, and the seller shipped it immediately!
4	1350864000	I did some shopping around for a mattress protector and found that this one was the biggest bang for the buck. I compared it to the ones at sams club and costco and though the ones at sams and costco were slightly cheaper, this one had more protection and was quieter. It fit well on my memory foam mattress, and though I can tell that it is there, it is relatively quiet and does not bunch. Also I washed before I put it on the mattress and it held up well in the washer and dryer ( on low heat setting). Overall I recommend.
5	1350777600	We needed 2 mattress pads for our queen sized beds that our boys sleep on with us. One of the boys always leaks through his diaper. I don't mind always changing sheets, but when the mattress would get wet, it was a pain to clean. I needed something affordable since I needed 2. I ordered them and literally received them the next day. They fit perfectly and work as expected. The mattress doesn't get wet! Very pleased with the product.
5	1350604800	When you spend $2000+ on a mattress it makes sense to spend extra to get a quality water-repellant mattress cover.  After reading multiple reviews, we chose this one and couldn't be more satisfied.  It is a quality product. It fits our extra deep mattress perfectly, and makes absolutely no "crinkly" sounds. The top is a plush fabric, and before I put it on the mattress I did a water test and - no leaks!  Highly recommended.
5	1350518400	This mattress protector is just as advertised! Top notch quality and comfort and very stretchable. Also for a very reasonable price, they wanted almost double at the furniture store where I bought my mattress...
5	1350432000	Unfortunately, our cat has already put this product to the test.  The "accident" pooled on the mattress protector and did not penetrate to the mattress.  Can't ask for any better than that!
5	1350432000	Ordered to keep mattress warranty valid. Works as described and arrived fast. Would order again.  Not much more to say.
5	1350432000	Item was shipped very quickly, exceeding expectations. Quality is very very good. I will look to Perella's again in the future.
4	1350432000	Great as a mattress cover, but prefer to use mattress encasement. Quality item with a nice sheet like feel, not that vinyl plasticy noisy material some covers are like.
5	1350000000	First of all let me say that this order was received quickly (Prime member!) and the packaged in protective plastic bag within the Amazon box.The mattress protector is perfect with two small pets (who might have an accident) and frequent guests.  Deep corner pockets, smooth stretchy sides and soft fine terry material top make this an easy to fit on any queen size mattress.  I was afraid that the waterproof liner would feel plastic or hot but not at all.I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for an easy to wash and easy to use waterproof mattress protector.
5	1349913600	Works perfectly with my little boy who wets the bed every night!  Very light.  Does the same job as thicker pads that take 3 times the amount of time to wash and dry!
5	1349827200	This is soft, perfect for my needs, fits my queen mattress. Arrived on time. Good quality. Would recommend to anyone.
5	1349827200	My wife is 8 months pregnant and I bought this to protect our expensive mattress from possibly being ruined if her water breaks while she is in bed.  I read a lot of other reviews and chose this product because I wanted something that wouldn't sound like plastic every time you moved.  This is like having another sheet on your mattress.  We don't even notice it!  If anything it adds a little cushion because of the terrycloth material it has on the top.  I cannot comment on the waterproof portion of the product, as we have needed to test that part yet (and hopefully don't have to), but as far as comfort and piece of mind.  You cannot beat the quality for this price!
5	1349827200	Washed well and didn't get bally. Fits good too. Very happy with my purchase so far. I'd recommend this to my friends.
5	1348531200	I ordered a queen size and at a good price! It fits just right, like a fitted sheet.It is soft, comfortable and breathable. My husband didn't even know there is an extra layer underneath our sheets.It is not waterproof though. It is just an extra layer of protection. I doubt any of the mattress protectors in the market are truly waterproof anyways.
5	1348012800	This mattress pad fits my son's twin bed like a glove, is easy to wash and protects the mattress when he has a nighttime accident.  I love it!
4	1348012800	It fit my mattress well & is staying on nicely. Haven't had an opportunity to test water proof properties &  hope to never have to.  That's the only reason I went 4 instead of 5 stars- can't determine quality of water proofing without just throwing water on my bed
2	1347753600	Almost titled this review "I should have known better". This is a cheap product. The main part of the mattress protector is a terry cloth like material, which is strange. It doesn't crinkle like plastic but it still feels like plastic when you lie on it. Not sure yet about the waterproofing qualities. If you must have something cheap, this is probably okay, but if you're looking for an ounce of quality this is NOT a good choice.
5	1347408000	The product came in a timely fashion.  I purchased this for my toddler in case she pees on the bed at night and for my infant who has the occasional spit up.  Lifesaver!
5	1347321600	Prior to placing the cover on the mattress, we ran it though a wash.  It held together just fine, fits perfectly.  Satisfied customer.
4	1347321600	I though this cover was soft and well made. It is for my toddler and has seemed work really well. I like that it doesn't sound like plastic when she moves but you can tell that it is water resistant.
1	1346803200	Threw this thing away after a week. It was so hot I was sweating like a pig during the night. Avoid this product if you enjoy being comfortable.
4	1346544000	We have dogs, a cat, and kids so a waterproof cover is a must in our house.  This cover has a absorbent towel-like texture on top and the plastic waterproof part underneath.  I almost dislike having the absorbent part on top because then you have to wash it every time but I couldn't find a plastic-only one.  I'm not sure how it will hold up in the washer in the long term but it seems to be doing okay so far.
5	1346198400	Great waterproof mattress that I'm using for my son's bed in case if nighttime accidents. Unlike others waterproof pads, this one doesn't have that annoying crinkly sound or feel like you're laying on paper. It's soft, comfy and cannot be beat for the price. Highly recommend.
5	1346025600	I got this while I was pregnant to protect my mattress in case of leaks while I was pregnant and later accidents from my baby. I have a Tempurpedic bed and didn't want to risk ruining the mattress.Pros:- Fits great. My mattress tends to be a bit deeper than most mattresses, but we had no problem getting it on.- Didn't make us too hot as some other reviewers had complained about.- I hate mattress protectors that are noisy, but i never heard any noise from this one.- The price is great. Most other mattress protects cost a lot more than this one.- Didn't leak. We have had a few accidents since buying this, including spilling about 16 oz of water on the bed. We didn't have any problem with the liquid leaking through into the mattress.Cons:- There was a bit of a weird smell when I took it out of the box, but that went away fairly quickly.I will buy this brand again once my child is in a twin size bed and needs a mattress protector.
4	1345248000	I bought this to replace a mattress cover that had warn out. Just over a month of it being put on my bed it proved it self when my older cat had an accident on the bed. While I unfortunately had to take my bedding to a laundry mat, my mattress was pristine.
5	1345161600	The promptness of delivery along with the quality of the waterproof mattress pad is awesome! You do not hear the plastic sounds when you move around in bed.  A great product!  Amazon never lets me down!!!
5	1345075200	What to say about a mattress protector? Not much except that it is a great value. Waterproof, hypoallergenic, 10 year warranty, grips well to the bed and clings the sheets to it nicely. I will buy this item from the seller again next time I need one. Very happy with this purchase.
4	1343952000	I had to purchase this to protect our new mattress. My husband has allergies so we have all hypoallergenic bedding and pillows. This protector is nice because it is soft and stretchable to fully cover the mattress. It is thin, yet does the job. We have a dog that likes to sleep with us so just in case she ever has an accident I'm confident that this will protect our expensive bed! So far no complaints except that once in a while when I take our sheets off I noticed that the cover doesn't always stay put - it may be a little big for our bed even though ours is 12" queen sized (stretchable to fit up to 22"). But most likely it is because the mesh-like material that covers the sides and corners of the mattress slips off easily. It isn't a problem, just something I noticed. Plus it has a 10 yr warranty which is great coverage for something so decently priced.
5	1343347200	Purchased the cover as an extra for travel.  Very pleased as it is easy to travel with and washes well.
5	1342656000	Item works great. Shipped fast of course and haven't had any allergy problems since using it. Fortunately, haven't tested the waterproof quality of the protector yet. Fits mattress easily with some extra room. Seems well made.
5	1342656000	I needed a mattress cover to go over my mattress and a new memory foam pad I just bought. This fit perfectly and so far has held up well.
5	1342569600	The mattress cover does exactly what is meant for. We were able to stop soaking to mattress, thanks to this cover.
5	1342569600	I ordered the mattress protector from ABC Vitamins via Amazon. It arrived on time and in good condition. It fits well and is easy to place on my deep pockets mattress. The terry cloth top is comfortable to sleep on. It really protect the mattress. My cat decided to regurgitate on the bed. The contents did not reach the mattress. I'm quite satisfied with the product.Barbara Morrison
3	1341964800	I'd say the product has its quality align with price. It's thin and light. Wash in cold is fine to keep it in good shape (washed twice now, still okay). But if you are easy to feel hot, it might not a good one for you. I feel it's a little non-breathable and easy to get sweat with it.
4	1341964800	it fits our queen bed nicely.  Our toddler sleeps on this bed and often wets it.  This protector does its job well to keep the mattress dry.  It does not make a lot of sound or slip.  Need to wait and see if this will last.
5	1341964800	Surprised at quality for the price. FIt well. No noise when laying on it. Protects ben and launders well. Good quality. Comparable to ones I've spent $50.00 plus on in the past.
5	1341964800	This product is soft, washed well, and fits our bed just fine. We haven't had to "test" the waterproof aspect of it yet, but it feels like good protection without feeling plasticy. You can't even notice it is there underneath your sheets, which is a good thing! No crinkly noises either!
5	1341446400	As annoying as it is, we have a dog who once in a blue moon urinates on our bed.  Lucky us.  We love him, but it was getting really bad when the urine would pass through the mattress pad to our VERY expensive mattress more than once.  So, I found this reasonably priced queen size Hanna Kay 100% mattress pad that has a a soft top and a slim vinyl lining and wouldn't you know...our dog tested it out?  haha!!!  we were totally relaxed because the pad WORKED!  and washing sheets, the cotton blanket and the pad  is WAYYY easier (with Natures Miracle, you'd never know it was urinated on).I'm getting some back-ups and one for my Mom's house for when we visit there.
4	1341446400	I dont notice the noises that other reviewers have. I think the product is great and does a great job with protection. If you need protection form fluids you are going to have to trade off some of the benefits of a down pad or something without protection. Overall very pleased. Comfortable, good price, and protects my mattress
5	1341273600	I am not prone to leave feedback as I feel most items to be adequate to the price I have paid. However, I have owned these bed covers for over a month and they have surpassed my expectations. My daughter is a bed wetter and these sheets have protected my mattress 100%. I have washed and dried them numerous times and they are still as effective as the first time I put them on.I also was impressed with the fit as my mattress is a pillow top and sheets tend to slide and slip off. These sheets not only have an amazing fit but help in my top sheets staying snug and in place.I highly recommend these sheets to anyone dealing with a two year old night time bed wetter. If they can withstand her I am sure they can withstand little spills
5	1341273600	Deep pockets to fit very tall mattress. Terry cloth so feels nice, a bit less heat trapping which is expected with any waterproof protector. Prompt delivery. Hope it will last the washes.
4	1341273600	I bought this for the queen futon bed in our vacation rental.  Not too bulky, so it stores well when not in use.  Have not had a chance for anyone to sleep on it as of yet, but when I tried it on the futon, and laid down on it I was impressed.  No crinkle noise.  Hope it does the trick, and washes well.
5	1340668800	I have a special needs son and tried the plastic liners, and disposable pads, but he is getting older (9) and I am always striving to make life easier for us. This was one of those decisions, and it has already been tried and tested, and passed!! I recommend this product for youngsters and special needs to save your beds!Heather
5	1340668800	My dad has entered the incontinence phase of his travel down the dementia path, and we were having a terrible time with crib pads keeping the mattress from getting wet and ultimately having to be scrapped. I bought two of these fitted waterproof mattress pads and they've been wonderful! We have one on the bed at all times under the fitted sheet. We wash them with the rest of the bed linens every day. No moisture has gotten through to the mattress -- these have been a great find and at a great price!
5	1340236800	Looks to be of good quality. Slipped it on the mattress and don't even know it is on it! No hot spots, crinkly sound, bunching, etc. that I see so many complain about. And the price was fantastic too! No body else sells it cheaper.Just need to see how long it will last.
5	1340236800	This mattress pad/cover was exactly what I was hoping it would be. It held up in the wash just fine, the terry cloth top layer is very soft, and it fit my son's bed perfectly. Thankfully, no liquids have been spilled on his bed yet, but the water-proof inner lining seems thick enough to hold up quite well. The 10-year warranty is an added bonus, too!
5	1340064000	value for money! fits my queen size mattress pretty well, quality and feel is good too. I looked in-store for other mattress pads and was not getting half the quality at the same price.
5	1340064000	The item came on time, brand new, no problems at all with the seller. Will by again. The cover itself is well maid, relatively inexpensive and does the job.
4	1339200000	This fits nicely under our already snug bedding over a memory foam mattress. Though you can hear it "crinkle" it's not bad at all.
4	1338940800	It's a good quality mattress pad that fits pretty well. Minor issue: it's a little noisy when tossing and turning.
5	1338940800	I satisfy this item. I bought one and then order one again. It has towel like surface and vinyl bottom. So, when you spill something, it can't run through the surface or soak into the mattress. Overall, it is a good waterproof mattress cover. Gangchu!
4	1338854400	...it makes more noise than I was anticipating. We have a queen pillowtop and the fit is perfect, but like I said, the noise factor made me drop it down to 4 stars. I still recommend it, especially for the price.
5	1338508800	Received item super fast. Mattress protector works great.  It's easy to install.  Am very pleased with this product. Have purchased other mattress protectors in the past that were way more expensive.  This one is the best so far.  Will definately buy another.
5	1338336000	I've had this cover about three weeks and love it so far.  I was pleased to see how easy it was to put on our Tempur Pedic mattress, which is quite heavy.  I washed the cover first and it held up very well under the one washing.  I really couldn't tell it had been through the washer at all.  It still looks and feels new.
5	1337817600	Excellent quality product and cheap price. Shipped very fast! Fortunately, we haven't had to test out the waterproof capability, but seems very well built.
5	1337817600	I received this product exactly as promised, fits perfect and never works it way loose from the mattress time after time like other protectors. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone.Thanks USA Vitamins,LG
4	1337385600	This mattess protector is easy to use and looks nice. Don't know if it is waterproof yet, but it's enough for the first layer of mattess cover.
5	1337299200	Very quiet to sleep on. It's snuggly zipped around my 12" memory foam mattress. Haven't tested waterproof claim yet, hopefully my senior cat doesn't have another accident, but at least I'm prepared for it now!  Hope it works!
5	1336694400	I was a little hesitant ordering this product, considering the furniture store from where I had purchased my mattress tried to sell me a very similar mattress protector for $80. When I saw the price of this one, I was very pleased, but concerned for the quality. Let me tell you, I was very impressed!!! It does the job, it washed well IF you follow instructions. Not hard at all. I plan on ordering more for my Mom and siblings, GREAT BUY at a GREAT PRICE. Thank you!
4	1335312000	I was looking for something to protect my mattress and that is just what I got. It's inexpensive and does it's job.
5	1335312000	This mattress protector fit very well on my new queen size mattress.  It doesn't wiggle or move off of the mattress while I sleep, doesn't have any odor, and doesn't crinkle like some more plastic-y waterproof protectors would.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I feel like it was a good value.
5	1334793600	I must say this fit our Queen pillow top bed quite nicely. Haven't had any issues with liquids on the bed but my daughter seems to be sleeping better at night because of the hypoallergenic technology (she has allergies).  Washed it multiple times already and it fits just like it did the first time.  Will purchase again...in 10 years.
5	1334707200	I have a poor old dog who has slept with me for 17 years and she suddenly has had a few accidents so rather than banish her to the floor I decided to get the topper.. My only problem is that I cannot feel my awesome mattress when I sleep now, but this has helped stopped further unwanted liquid damage to the mattress.
5	1333584000	Purchased this to protect my new memory foam mattress.The quality is superb. You don't even notice that it is on the bed.My previous protector sweated a lot and kind of felt like sleeping on cellophane .I threw it out .  The Hanna Kay sleeps cool and silent.I have washed it multiple times and have seen no signs of deterioration.Highly recommended.
1	1333238400	I pre-washed this as suggested by the enclosed instructions, and dried on the lowest heat setting.  It melted together in the dryer, so there were many spots no longer waterproof.  It wasn't overdried, there were still items in the load that were damp.  So not surprisingly, it leaked the first time through the small holes caused by the melting.But beyond that, it didn't really suit our needs anyway.  It has an absorbent terrycloth-like top, so even if it protects your mattress it will need to be changed and washed each time.  We change the sheets multiple times a week for our potty-training daughter, and I was hoping for something wipe-clean and non-absorbent like our other (tempurpedic brand) mattress protector.
5	1333152000	This is a great mattress protector.  It's not the crinkly type. Quiet, much more like fabric.  We use these on all the beds in our house- with kids you don't want mattresses ruined from leaks or spills.  Works.  Simple.  Holds up perfectly in wash.
5	1332288000	Received it quickly and I'm happy with the product. Covers mattress and box spring. Got a great deal. Of course time will tell how it holds up .
5	1332115200	We bought this protector for our new Tempupedic mattress.  The store tried selling me a mattress protectr for over $100.  I am really glad that I found this brand on Amazon .  The material and workmanship is excellent. It has deep pockets and fits very well.  There is no crickling sound either.  I recommend this product i am very pleased with it.
5	1329091200	Item as described, fits mattress well, breathable material and a great value. I will purchase again when I set up my guest bedroom king size bed.
4	1328227200	This mattress Protector works good, fit perfect on my sons bed.thank you.  He has asthma, hopefully will help with that.
4	1326585600	I've been through a few mattress protectors in the last year because the laundromat attendant drys them too long, making the plastic melt to itself. This has made it through three washes so far and comes back looking exactly the same as when I dropped it off. There is no telltale feel of a plastic-y mattress protector when it's on the bed either.The edges of the pad aren't waterproofed. Sometimes, because the bottom elastic isn't especially strong, the edges ride up leaving the perimeter of the top of the bed unprotected.However, I got it for a reasonable price, it's held up through multiple washings so far, and it does what it was made to do. If I had to buy another I'd probably pass up this brand and continue on my quest to find the perfect one, but it's the best of the three I've tried so far.
3	1325808000	It looks really cheap, not sure it can promise everything it says. Granted I am in no hurry to spill water on my bed just to test it but so far so good.
4	1324252800	I'm embarrassed to admit that my old mattress cover was probably 10 years old. It had completely lost it's elastic from weekly washes and was stained with highlighter and ink (as were all of my old sheets from college... I had a habit of falling asleep while studying in bed!). GROSS.I spent a lot of time looking at reviews and was sold on this cover because of the price, the waterproof/hypoallergenic factor, and the reviews, which claimed that there is no "crinkly sound" when it's on the bed.Overall, I'm totally happy with the cover. It's a great quality, it fits my very deep pillowtop mattress with ease, and I love stretchy mesh siding. However, I did notice an ever-so faint crinkling when I sat on it for the first time, and hear it when I slide under the covers at night. It's not loud enough to irritate me, and my boyfriend never noticed the change (to be fair, he doesn't notice most things).I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could, and would recommend this to others. Can't beat the price!
4	1323216000	Liked it could fit my mattress and my 4 inch mattress topper. I wanted something to cover my mattress topper without the problems of a plastic mattress cover that makes you hot and sweaty.
5	1322438400	I have owned many mattress protectors before and this one is superior to all of them. My old ones would make noise and sweat a lot.  Not the Hanna Kay ,it is quite and cool . I barely realize that it's on the bed.The price is excellent too.
1	1322092800	First time my son wet the bed it leaked right through onto the mattress!!! Awful product I do not recommend.  It iis not waterproof!!!
5	1321574400	I own a memory foam mattress with an adjustable base.  This set-up was quite an investment and I want to keep it fresh.  I was looking for a mattress protector, rather than a mattress pad, because I didn't want any bulk to interfere with the way the memory foam reacts to my body.After researching, I decided to give this one a try, and I'm glad I did.  The upper surface is a very fine terry loop material and beneath that is a moisture-proof barrier layer.  The sides are a sheer nylon-like fabric.  It feels as light as a feather.  There is elastic all the way around to keep it in place, which is good,'cause who wants a shifting, bunched up mess?  This stays put, and that is especially important since I adjust the head and foot every night. When the bed is made up, you don't know it's there.There was a slight plastic or petroleum smell when I opened the package.  This worried me because I'm chemically sensitive.  I aired it out for 24 hours, and it still smelled the same.  So, I laundered it, per manufacturer's instruction, and it came out smelling great.I am happy that it has a 10 year warranty, and that it is breatheable and priced affordably.
5	1318291200	The mattress protector came very quickly. We've been using it for about 2 months for our toddler daughter.  She was sick one night and it kept the mattress dry, and so we've washed it and that went fine too.  So it is holding up and keeping it's promise of being waterproof. There was no strange smell to it, and it fit the twin size bed perfectly.  We had no problems getting it on and off for changing when needed.  Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5	1318204800	Doing what its made to do! We have had this item before it helps prevent accident onto the mattress I put it in the washing machine and about 10 minutes in the hot dryer then pull it out and let it air dry so that the heat does not stretch out the elasticity.
3	1316563200	Nice feel to the breathable terry cotton fabric base, but should be slightly larger because it does not cover the whole mattress. The thin outer fabric that keeps it in place comes over the outer edges of my standard mattress when it should only be around the mattress to keep it in place. The outer layer is very thin and rips easily. It's okay, but could be better.
4	1315958400	I received my order on time, early even, I think.  It was a quality purchase.  I was very happy that it allowed for a different mattress pad that I had underneath it.  It is forgiving.  However, it can rip if you are not careful as the sides of the mattress protector being reviewed here that generously allow for extra items underneath are thin.  I asked my husband to put it on as I am very pregnant and bending isn't easy.  He was a little careless with it, and he says it ripped.  I didn't see the rip, but it appears to stil be working fine.
4	1315353600	I had a really limited budget when I was shopping for mattress pads, and honestly I bought this one because it was the cheapest one I could find.  It does exactly what it is designed to do as far as I can tell: protects the mattress.  This theory hasn't been tested yet, but I'm hopeful.  I haven't had any problem with temperature, noise or anything else since putting it on my mattress about a month ago.  If you want a good basic mattress protector, that doesn't offer any extra padding, this one works great.
5	1314835200	I was very impressed by the quality and thick durability of this mattress protector.I got it  to cover our new memory foam mattress, and it fits great.  Its comfortable and  does not slip at all.Has lasted through multipe washings unlike some other cheap brands I've gotten at big box stores.  An excellent value.
4	1314057600	I've purchased this for my son in case he has accidents at night. The previous protector we owned was plastic so this is a nice upgrade. The fabric texture feels nice and I like the fact that this is breathable. Hope the proctor remains tear free...
5	1313020800	I have found this mattress cover to be a great product.  It has saved my mattress numerous times, as I often sleep with a newborn (leaks,spit ups).  Since it is so thin it doesn't take away from the comfort of the bed.  I was initially concerned that it might create hot spots, but it doesn't. It washes well and feels durable and well made. I would buy this product again if needed without hesitation.
5	1312156800	This mattress protector is awesome.  We recently bought some expensive mattresses and naturally wanted to protect our investment.  The Hanna Kay mattress protector is everything we where looking for.  Waterproof and dust mite proof yet breathable.  The fit is great with no bunching and the are is no crinkly sound when you lay on top of it.  As a matter of fact you don't even know it's on the bed.Just this week some  tea was spilled on the bed and no moisture seeped through.Excellent quality protector for a very reasonable price.  I would highly recommend to others.
