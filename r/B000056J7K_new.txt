5	1405036800	The lip on the front is high enough to keep everything in the potty and not on the floor. Easy for my son to use and easy to clean.
5	1405036800	Delivered timely, item as described, very nice and well made just as pictured, we are very happy.
5	1404950400	I buy a lot off of Amazon and I've yet to review a single item. I bought the Baby Bjorn potty chair over a year ago and love this thing. Who knew I'd love a product so much that I'd feel compelled to write a review about it a year later?!  Let me start by saying that I potty trained my daughter (now 6) using a Fisher Price potty that was terrible. It leaked all over the place, tipped over and was gross. The little bowl never fit properly and everything spilled out. Yuck! It was also so difficult to scrub/clean---way too many grooves and spaces.I was hesitant to spend $25 on a potty. My husband thought I was nuts. But the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair is amazing. First off, it is the perfect design. It is impossible to tip over and impossible to put the little bowl on the wrong way. It fits together perfectly and sits nicely on any surface. The little &#34;guard&#34; in the front works great for a little boy --nothing splashes out, and it's is also comfortable for a little girl (I ended up buying a second potty to keep in the back of my car since the sports fields my kids play on don't have potties). Also, the high back is very comfortable for my son --and doubles as a &#34;splash wall&#34; for when little boys are learning to go standing up. It is also so easy to clean. I spray and wipe with a sponge....no hard to reach spots. I also like that it's easy to pick up the little white bowl and it doesn't make a mess because of the handle designed into it. My 3 year old son even empties it himself!The  person who designed this is a genius. Never thought I'd feel so passionate about a potty seat. An absolute MUST for potty training. Well worth every penny.
5	1404777600	I use cloth diapers and was anxious to at least get the BM's into the toilet instead of having to wash them. I bought this for my son when he was 8mths old and we have been using it for BM's. I am fortunate to be able to stay home with my son so I am in close contact with him and can tell when he is trying to go #2. As soon as I see his BM face (starts pushing, and eyelids get red) I quickly take off his diaper and sit him on this potty. It works great. With him being so small you do need to sit directly in front him and entertain with a song or a toy as he does his business but it is worth it. I don't always catch the BM's but have to clean a lot fewer ones by using the toilet.This seat is comfortable and I like the back part because he can sit back without falling over. If he is not positioned quite right he might pee outside but for the most part if you are watching closely it contains everything just fine. :)
5	1404777600	My son was so excited when he seen his big boy potty! This has made training so much fun for him. I love that it's simple without all the bells and whistles (distractions!) and looks like an actual mini toilet. The gaurd on this is higher than most which is also great for boys to prevent spraying everywhere. Simple to clean too.
3	1404691200	It seems like a great product, but if you have a tall child or you potty-train really early, I don't think it's that great. My son grew out of it LONG before he was potty-trained. Too short in my opinion.
4	1404518400	So far we like this chair. It is easy to clean up and easy for my son to use. Very lightweightas well. A little smaller than I would have thought, and sometimes the seat sticks, but otherwise a good chair.
5	1404518400	Secure and well balanced.  Easy to clean.  Child had no problem using right away.
3	1404345600	We bought this because my youngest daughter won't train on a potty seat on the toilet, so we thought this might help her transition from diapers.  It's just plastic.  I had hoped there'd be a way to put a plastic liner in the hole part so we could just take the liner off instead of having to clean the plastic bowl, but unless we want her to sit on the liner, that's not an option.  Oh well, it's a big overpriced piece of plastic.
5	1404345600	Simple! Love it. Love the high back and the front lift. Very good price
5	1404259200	My daughter's short and most potty chairs are too tall and oddly shaped for her.This one is fabulous and she actually doesn't mind going to the potty.  The bowl is deep enough that even with a heavy stream or large load it doesn't overflow.
5	1404259200	Really easy for my daughter to use and to clean up.  She is 25 months, but she can lift off the top easily and dump it in the toilet, rinse it out, and reinstall by herself!  The lift off top is key - I had a different pott where the pee-collector slid out from underneath the seat.  Two problems there - 1) the seat can get messy and you can't easily clean it and 2) pulling the collector out is pretty awakward, definitely not something a child could do.
2	1404259200	looks cute but not functional for us.the depth of the plastic bowl is not deep.If the shit is coming out long and hard, it might push back up to the baby
5	1404172800	We practice EC and have used this potty chair and the toilet for pee and poop since our baby was an infant. Most every time the big people in the house  go to the toilet we put baby on her potty. We use cloth diapers and have changed very few diapers with poop.  Our baby has learned to tell us when she needs to go by pointing to her diaper or by removing her diaper.  A great tool for parents and kids!
3	1404086400	First wkend potty training we had no problems at all. We loved it. We let my son go diaper free (& underwear free) for a day & by day 2 he was sitting on his potty unprompted every time. My son went from peeing every hour to every two hours by day 5. The velocity & force of his pees were getting stronger & faster too. Which is why EVERY time he sat down to potty his urine stream went over the guard. I'm going to have to stop using this potty because it's useless now. I'm so upset & frustrated from cleaning up so much urine.
5	1403827200	The potty chair works great and is not messy to clean. My son loves it too! I will definitely recommend it.
3	1403740800	THIS  IS A GREAT PRODUCT. UNFORTUNATELY WE DID NOT GET  TO USE IT HERE AS HE STARTED POTTY TRIANING AT HOME AND PREFERRED TO SIT ON REG ONE WHEN HE WAS HERE.
4	1403481600	Great seat. High enough for my lil guy to have no issues getting on and off the pot. Now to get him to go on the potty is another story.
5	1403395200	This is a safe and balanced potty chair.  My two year old grand daughter loves it.  It is light enough to move around easily.  I highly recommend this chair!
5	1403308800	Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty.
5	1403136000	This is the nicest toddle potty on the market. I've had two and I wish my daycare had the same one!!
5	1402963200	This is a great training potty for toddlers. It's easy to clean and I like the light color. Very happy!
3	1402963200	This review is for the green chair only! The green that I received is not as pictured. It is much, much lighter, more of a pastel. Not very attractive for a toddler boy. Had it been as pictured I would have given it 5 stars. Returned and intend to order it in grey simply because I really liked the design of the chair itself.
5	1402876800	BABYBJORN Potty Chair is the best for potty training. they make some of the best baby products on the market.
5	1402876800	I got this for my 10 month old son.  We had previously been using toilet seat inserts, and while those worked, we had to hold him constantly and had the fear he would wiggle or fall off.  This potty chair was a great solution, it gave him the independence he wanted and also allows him to place his feet on the floor.  Definitely recommend this for other EC parents.
5	1402704000	Although potty training is still a work in progress, my daughter got over her initial potty chair tantrums and actually quite likes this chair now.  She likes to hang out and read here.
4	1402617600	We wanted a potty that was not going to be seen as a toy, meaning no music or toys attached; this fit that need. It's easy to clean quickly. My only dislike is that it doesn't seem so comfy for our little ones legs, as when she stands up she has red marks. She is only 17-1/2 months and is already peeing and pooping on the potty with some regularity! Perhaps, as it takes less time waiting on the potty for it to &#34;come along,&#34; the red marks will lessen!
5	1402617600	Much better than some of the more cheaply made models out there. Way better than the seat you attach to your toilet but not near as good as a nice free standing wooden legged potty chair. Those are insanely pricey though so this is what I'd suggest.
5	1402531200	Easy to clean, no hidden crevices that have to be cleaned out and my daughter loves it. I would recommend this to any parent.
5	1402272000	fast and correct love it no problems at all whatsoever so absolutely no complaints here thank you and you're welcome
5	1402272000	This potty chair went through two little boys and is now off to another for 'training'! Very sturdy and durable. I ordered late and was afraid I might not get it in time for a gift. Came just in time! I love being able to track my orders.
5	1402099200	After many review searches I settled on this potty seat for my then 10 month old. It's shape and easily to clean designed it what sold me. And 3 months later she was potty trained
5	1402012800	It fits snug on the tile floor and keeps the pee where it needs to be. Easy to clean up. Our son is tall for his age (99%) and weighs 29 pounds. He sits on this with room to spare quite comfortably. Happy with my purchase.
5	1402012800	This is just what we wanted in a potty chair.  Plain and simple like all the books are recommending.  Works very well.  Highly recommend it.  It is just as pictured.
5	1401926400	It does the job.  She was potty trained within a month I think due to being able to leave this in the livingroom so she could always see it.
5	1401926400	Our son would splash with the old potty but this manufacturer has a higher splash guard.  He likes the green color because it matches his Boon pod frog.  He did not want to use the potty at first and having pull-up diapers did not help.  We switched to training pants, used the potty timer watch and the book &#34;The New Potty&#34; and stickers for incentive reward.  Finally our son uses the potty all the time.  He will even use an adult toilet when we are out and about.  So this model of potty really helped us.
3	1401667200	This was the perfect potty chair in size and in convenience of use.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a potty chair.
5	1401494400	There's nothing particularly remarkable about this potty except that it works EXACTLY as it should, without ANY drawbacks. After you try a few potty chairs for your kids, you realize that is remarkable in itself. Easy to use, easy to clean, very sturdy, has NEVER tipped.
4	1401235200	If you're looking for a potty chair this would probably do the trick. We never ended up using it as we didn't want one more thing to transition from, and something else to clean. My daughter did think it was fun, but only ever used it as pretend.
5	1400976000	Love that its white and very easy to clean with no corners and creases. Worked very well. Very durable also.
5	1400716800	First time potty training for our 14 months daughter.  Too many choices available on the market, but trusted all the other reviews on Amazon. This no frills potty chair doesnt look like much, but I really think they did a wonderful job designing it.  Easy to clean, and my toddler isnt uncomfortable sitting on it to go potty.  The high back rest helps alot, because she tends to sit far back to get comfortable.  Its very stable and we dont worry about it tipping over.Good value, nice design, and definitely easy to clean.  Highly recommended.
5	1400716800	My 21-month-old son sat down and used it as soon as it came out of the box! Intensive potty training starts this weekend, but feeling confident because of his excitement about the big boy potty.
5	1400630400	This is the second of this particular potty chair we have purchased.  My daughter liked it so well with her son that when I needed to get one for my house I got one just like hers.  We are currently using it for child number two and it still is like new. No bells and whistles - so no distractions.
5	1399852800	I got this for my friend whose little girl was having trouble going #2 in the adult-sized toilet.  I suggested she use a little potty because it would make her feel more comfortable (my first son had the same anxiety).  It's so easy to clean and easy for little people to carry around to their favorite spots. Guess what? After just a couple days, my friend's little girl is fully potty trained. Yay!
5	1399420800	Best chair I found for potty training my son, the front of the bowl came up much higher than other models we had tried.
4	1399334400	When starting potty training, this seat was the perfect size for my toddler. It was comfortable for her height and she was willing to sit on it for more than a minute. The contents are easily to empty out and wash. There are rubber grips underneath the seat to prevent it from sliding around. No complaints!
5	1399334400	We've tried a number of potties for kids, and this is by far the best brand and design. There's also a version without a &#34;chair&#34; back that is equally good; we have them both.PROS:-- ergonomic, comfortable for toddlers and even infants if you are doing elimination communication-- all molded plastic design makes it easy to keep clean, no cushion to get soggy-- insert lifts out for easy dumping into adult toilet, fits in sink for washing clean-- sturdy base ensures your kid will not tip it over, even if wiggly-- spray guard works well for boys but still is small enough to let kids get on easilyCONS-- your toddler may not want to transition to big toilet because these are so comfortableI really can't think of any cons for these potties.  We have one in each bathroom, and when my son was learning, we kept one in his bedroom as well.  We have a smaller version of this one that stays in the back of our car for those unforeseen &#34;I have to go potty NOW&#34; incidents.  They are so sturdy, are easy to clean and maintain, and my toddler can even empty this one easily himself without making a mess.  Some potties have cushions and other moving parts, making it really complicated to disassemble for emptying.  This one is a breeze.Also, the bowl is oval shaped and plenty long enough to accommodate larger toddlers without having positioning issues.  I've seen some that have a tiny circular opening, which is really awkward, especially for boys, to make sure nothing misses...GREAT FOR EC - If you do elimination communication or infant pottying, these are great.  The insert can be removed and held in your lap -- used as a top hat potty -- until your child is old enough to sit freely on the potty.I absolutely LOVE these potties because they are so practical, simple to use, and child friendly.  My toddler prefers this style to all the other ones he's tried.  No gimmicks, just a potty.  What you need.
5	1399334400	My son is using this potty chair for two months already. He love it! The sit is comfortable and provides support. Depends how big is your child, she or he may need some support if they are not able to sit alone. It is easy to clean. This product has good quality.
2	1399248000	I bought this because I wanted a 'cool' looking potty that would look nice in my bathroom. I started trying to potty train my daughter around 18 months or so with this. She could not get on it on her own because of the big crotch hump (splash guard? I still don't know what that is for). After a while I became lazy about potty training. Now she is 2 and I am starting again. She STILL has a hard time with the hump. I gave up and bought another potty that plays music, has a lid, doesn't have a hump, can also be used as a stepping stool and was $10 cheaper. She likes this much better and so do I. I like Baby Bjorn products but I would not recommend this.
3	1399075200	Looks nice and easy to clean. However the shield isn't high enough in the front for boys. Was comfortable for my son to sit in with the high back. Hoping this works better for a girl.
5	1398816000	this thing is a lot of fun!  I am enjoying it very much.  Hours of fun for the whole family.
5	1398729600	Baby Bjorn products are the best. They are built perfectly for your toddlers and the fun color draws so much attention for potty training fun.
4	1398729600	Got the chair and the books and getting ready for the little bottom to be on the potty.  I hope it is a success and am looking forward to no more diapers.
3	1398729600	My son finds this awkward to sit on, and quite honestly uses it for a step stool instead of a potty.
5	1398643200	No fancy music, bells or whistles and that is okay. Great design in form and function. We would recommend this product
5	1398556800	I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).
4	1398556800	My granddaughter seems to like this chair,and is not bothered by the molded spray guard that cannot be detached for use by a girl.The chair has a crisp clean look and is easy to clean.  The bowl sits nicely on the chair and does not slip off.
5	1398556800	This product is second potty chair for my son. I bought a other brand one with lid but was not comfort to seat for my child, So I purchased this one and my son seat for long time. Seems like it's more comfortable for him.
5	1398556800	I absolutely LOVE this potty. My daughter is 9 months and we were trying to transition her to the potty early and boy is it working! This potty is so easy to clean, no bells and whistles to wipes messes off of. She sits on it like a big girl. The splash guard is nice and it keeps her from jumping off of the potty as easily. I highly recommended this product!!! Oh and it's really cute :-)
5	1398297600	My son learned to be potty trained and this is only potty seat he uses.  I had bought many others and this is the one he still uses and it's nice it doesn't occupy the big potty an he doesn't get the big potty messy. Great item!!
5	1398297600	We have actually purchased two of these potty chairs because we were so pleased with the product.  Our son seems to actually enjoy going to use the potty when we started training him.  Early on, it was very difficult and we tried using a step stool and one of the seats that fits on the toilet but that didn't work well.  After purchasing this, things started going much smoother.  Overall, a great product and I would highly recommend it to parents trying to potty train their kids.  And it is easy cleanup as well.
4	1398297600	Sturdy, serves the purpose, plus it is stylish in design. I can't get my 2 year old to use it for anything else than playing with, so we've reverted to the toilet seat ring on the toilet which she will use to go potty.
5	1398211200	The high back and sturdy base make this chair perfect for little ones just getting the hang of using the potty. Be aware that with a boy the splash guard might not catch all the pee, but you can help him learn how to sit correctly and then it doesn't happen!
5	1398124800	This potty chair is very affordable, very blue and shiny, and seems to be a perfect fit for my grand baby!
3	1398038400	It's your durable, pink average potty chair. I wish I had bought one that was also a stepstool. Our bathroom is small, so now I have to store both.
5	1398038400	This potty chair was great! Easy to clean, non-slip grip around the bottom, loved the pink for my daughter. It was a great starter potty, and she'd even help empty the little bucket. We actually only use this for maybe 2 months, my mom was babysitter at the time and bought a child's toilet seat chair that you just set on the seat...she felt more like a big girl and preferred that so I ended up buying a stool and potty seat with soft pad for our house.I do recommend this potty chair (any color you prefer) for the beginning stages of potty training. I specifically wanted pink for her, and Amazon came through great. I'll be having a boy soon and plan on getting a blue or green one when the time comes.
5	1397865600	It was a nice and sturdy training pot but my grandson, now 7 years didn't use it long a all. I had given it to my great grandson five years ago.
5	1397520000	I chose this chair based on its reviews, and I am glad that I did! I can't speak for how it works for a boy, but it seemed to be really comfortable for our daughter. It's easy to clean and looks nice in the bathroom, instead of looking like just another piece of baby gear. I also like that there weren't any crazy sounds or anything like that since it made the chair seem like a more realistic potty.
5	1397433600	I chose this chair because it looked to be stable for sitting and I liked the splash guard and removable potty features.  It's early days using the chair for our little grandson, but have every expectation of success.
5	1397260800	I bought multiple little potty chairs, but this is the only one my son felt comfortable enough sitting in long enough to accomplish anything. I definitely recommend this seat to parents of little ones.
1	1397001600	My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair. She's not able to sit on it without falling in. There's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she's having to hold her weight so she doesn't fall in. In addition, the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward. Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard. I can totally see how this can happen. It's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help.
4	1397001600	I like that this design is sleek without lots of crevices for dirt and germs to get into.  It's easy to dump and easy to clean.  My only complaint is that the front splash guard is not as high as another seat I have.  We're in the beginning stages of toilet training so if it'll be a problem is still up in the air.
5	1396915200	We started potty training my daughter at 2 and a half.  Right before her little brother was born.  We decided on the BABYBJORN potty chair because it seemed easy to clean, comfortable, and didn't have anything that would make her want to continue to use it as opposed the the real potty.We bought this when she was 2 just to get her used to it.  She sat on it while we were in the bathroom and read her books.  She was comfortable and nothing pinched her causing her to not want to use it. Eventually she got the idea and started using it herself.  At 2 and a half we ditched diapers and were exclusice to the potty training.She loved this chair because, gross, she loved to pick up the seat and dump the contents in the real potty.  Lucky for us there wasn't any huge mess.  We rinsed the chair out nightly with hot water and I cleaned her potty when we cleaned our bathroom, weekly.  She made sure I did as well.  She enjoyed using this potty, but when the time came to move exclusively to the big potty she wasn't sad to see this go.I'm very happy with this purchase and will purchase another one when we potty train my son.  Reason being I think I accidently tossed this in a made rage to declutter.Overall, cleans very easily, no weird places for poop or pee to hide, and she didn't become attached to it.
5	1396742400	Simple design that:- allows child to sit rather then have to support themselves (important esp when they start potty training at an earlier age)- the entire seat area comes off so it's easy to clean and dump into toilet and rinse- comes in many colors to suit your liking- bottom has a rubber gasket surrounding the entire outside lip so that it creates good traction- durable and so no worry about breaking this when a child is breaking or when you are moving it a lot
5	1396656000	Does the job. Son likes it. I would recommend it. I don't recommend the pottys with all the flashin lights and music. In my experience kids think it's a toy, not a toilet. This one is comfy and basic.
5	1396569600	This is the best potty.  So easy to clean and move from room to room.  My son loves it and at 2 years 8 months old took right to it and potty trained.  I love the Grey color option.
5	1396569600	I like the simple design. I just need tips on getting my grandson to actually go potty in it. He likes to sit on it, but likes to potty outside!
5	1396483200	No complaints, got exactly what we wanted for our 6 month old to get used to sitting on a potty. She sits comfortably, the back support is nice.
5	1396396800	Easy to clean potty chair.  Perfect size. I have a small bathroom and it fits just fine.  I like the pink color, decided to pay a little more for the color since I have a little girl.
4	1396396800	It's great. My little boy wants to go potty and he can do most by himself. Great for an accidental purchase.
5	1396396800	I love this potty for my 2 1/2 year old son. He really enjoys going to take care of his business on it. I would recommend this for any parent! It is the only potty that has a high enough pee guard.
4	1396224000	I really do like this potty, I'm just now introducing my son to it.It's very great, simple and sleek design, easy to lift the bucket out to flush it.The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is a little tall and that little hump in the front middle makes it hard for my babe to sit on his own.  He is tall for his age, so he doesn't have too much trouble but I could see it being a problem for shorter children.If there were an option for 4.5 stars, I would have done that!
5	1395705600	We are very happy with this purchase. I feel like i can really clean this unlike those other potties with all the gadgets and creases and crevices.
5	1395705600	I love this little potty.  I bought for my granddaughter, who is not even two, and she has been going on it consistently.  She even likes to empty it herself.  Much nicer than some of the other types out there.
5	1395705600	Bought for our 30 month old grandson. .He likes it. .He sits and holds a few toys while &#34;making&#34;..it cleans up very well..no issues..I should get 2 more
5	1395619200	I was going to go with the lower BabyBjorn potty, but was concerned that our son wouldn't like all the &#34;freedom&#34; that comes along with a no back seat.  So we went ahead and purchased the potty chair.  I couldn't be happier.  It's sturdy and gets quite the beating from our son, as it also serves as a step stool of sorts when its not in use.
5	1395619200	this is a very beautiful potty, looks very comfortable to sit on. my son is not quite ready for his potty yet. he does like his new 'chair'.  i would give him more time to learn about his potty.
5	1395100800	Very comfortable for my 22mth old. He can sit half hour on it reading books. We have had a lot of success with this potty trainer.
5	1395100800	Read the review on all the other potties - getting pee inbetween seats, messes to clean up, etc. This was worth the money spent. If he sits crooked and misses the guard, we have a mess, but my 2 year old boy sits well in the seat comfortably. He can stand up and sit in it on his own. Easy clean up.
5	1394928000	I had another potty seat I was trying to use that my daughter potty trained on and it didn't work so well with my son (things shot out that shouldn't have shot out...). This has a high enough guard on it so we've had no problems with things not staying in the potty.  It seems comfortable and I like the back on it.  My other potty seat didn't have a back and I think it's safer for the smaller kids.  This potty is a little bigger than my other, but it's not too bad.
5	1394755200	Great!  My granddaughter had one like this, so I bought one to keep at our house. This larger than usual &#34;seat&#34; area keeps all discharges contained....especially best for boys.
5	1394755200	This is a great product. It's easy for the babes to sit on comfortably. It's easy to clean b/c it only has one part. And it has that nice rubber ring on the bottom to prevent slides.
4	1394755200	My 20 month old seemed scared of it at first but he got used to it pretty quickly and now enjoys his new potty!
5	1394668800	My toddler likes the stability of being able to hold onto the sides when she's getting on or off the potty. Three are no hidden cracks for urine to hide like some of the others. She loves the bright pink color. Glad I chose a chair with no bells and whistles to distract her. She sits down and does her buisness
4	1394582400	This is a nice potty chair. I like the high back. However, my son tended to pee out of the front. I think the front lip needs to be a bit higher.
5	1394496000	This was great for potty training and then great for teaching my son to go potty on his own.  I would recommend this chair.
3	1394496000	My granddaughter is small for her age and this potty is actually too small for her. It is otherwise of good quality and will work for her. I just wish it were a little bigger/higher.
5	1394409600	Love this potty chair! My daughter hasn't actually started using it full time yet, I just bought it early to introduce to her and let her sit on it a few times before we kicked potty training into high gear. She can get on and off herself and the seat doesn't pinch her or anything. I am really happy with it!
5	1394323200	Well made, solid plastic, easy to clean.  Just the right fit for little ones who are learning to use the potty.
4	1394236800	I bought the Babybjorn Potty Chair because the first seat I purchased didn't allow my petite 2-1/2 year old's feet to touch the floor when she sat down. The last thing I want to deal with is the aftermath of a fight between my child and a very full and somewhat unstable potty chair. The Babybjorn potty allowed her the independence to sit (with her feet flat on the floor) and stand without a struggle.The chair itself is a nice design, no sharp edges and plenty of curves. It has rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around the bathroom floor. The removable bowl is large and the top flares out into a full seat. The other potty's bowl would sometimes stick to my daughter's legs and cause a spill when she stood. The Babybjorn seat stays put!Clean up couldn't be easier. Actually, it could be easier if my daughter would use the grown-up potty, but if she's going to use a portable kids potty seat this one is probably as easy to clean as it gets.  The bowl easily lifts out. I empty it into the toilet, rinse it, wipe it with a Clorox wipe, drop it back into the Babybjorn, and I'm finished until she decides to use it again.If the potty starts to get a bit dusty, it's very easy to wipe down. There aren't a lot of small spaces to keep clean like our other potty chair.Kids are so unpredictable. My daughter learned to go potty on this seat, but we still had the other potty around. As soon as she mastered the potty, she refused to use the Babybjorn and started using out other potty chair. Maybe it was because she grew taller and it finally fit. Maybe because she's trying to annoy Mommy. Maybe I'll never know.The one thing I do know is that in the beginning she exclusively used this chair and she did learn how to use the potty.  And the one thing I'm most happy with is the ease of cleaning up that I get from this chair.
5	1394236800	It has a simple design but great for the purpose of potty training. My son is using this chair and feels comfortable.
5	1394150400	Perfect size for toddler2 parts so no complicated set up (The bowl & seat)No small nooks or crannies that can build up moldDurable plasticPortableEasy clean upConCan potentially slide easily along floorCan also potentially be flipped over by toddler if not careful
5	1394064000	I was worried that my 14-month-old (10th-percentile) daughter would have trouble backing herself onto this potty, but she's able to mount it (unassisted) with ease.  I was also concerned she would hurt herself on the splash guard, but it's totally fine.  The seat size is just the right for her tiny tukkis.  Her legs are slightly red when she gets up, but she is not bothered by it (and is able to communicate and comprehend the concept of &#34;hurt,&#34; if necessary, so I know it is fine).It's very easy to clean (insert removes easily and fits in a regular bathroom sink for washing).  It's very sturdy and the skid-proof grippers on the bottom make tragic tipping accidents impossible (in our experience).  The nice high back and arms makes baby feel secure and comfortable.An excellent purchase which made potty training a breeze!
5	1393891200	When looking for something that is going to hold something disgusting, I wanted it to be easy to clean. We were given one as a gift of a different brand and WOW! too many escape routes for liquid! It also scared her as it made noise when she sat on it or when she would accidently kick the trigger to make the noise. For the Babyjorn; The price is high, but the simplicity of this potty beats any other. My daughter LOVES hers and runs to it with excitement. She is very comfortable in it and is excited to go potty even when she does not need to.
5	1393804800	my son loves this potty chair. The quality is good, steady, and very comfortable. No sharp edges, and it's large enough for my 3 years old.
5	1393632000	Pros:  Sturdy but light to carry around (by my toddler), ease of placing and removing the white part, easy to clean. It also has rubber on the bottom so it doesn't slip. Last (but not least), the back support makes it comfortable for my toddler to sit there for long periods of time.Cons? Non really; perhaps they could offer more color options (there are about five )?
5	1393286400	My 20 month old baby loves his new potty. I think he was more excited than I was when he first saw his green potty. Easy to clean.
5	1393027200	The chair is sturdy and does not slide, making the chair easy to introduce to a toddler.  The ease of cleaning could not be designed easier.
4	1392768000	This chair is the reason our 2-year old is now potty trained. So important to have them be able to independently sit easily on the potty. It's also easy to clean. But friends have bought a similar designed seat for about half the price...it does the same job.
4	1392768000	This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too.
3	1392681600	I find that the seat sticks to the child so when they are getting off it sometimes comes with them hence all over the floor. Even when you assistant the child off it pops up otherwise it is a good height and the child can sit comfortably.
5	1392681600	I have a 15 month old who is &#34;interested &#34; in going to the bathroom. Bought this seat so she could familiarize herself with it beforehand. She began using it the first day we brought it home. After a month she asks regularly to &#34;go potty&#34;. Perfect size. She seems comfortable- it is very stable and easy to clean.
3	1392249600	Overall this is a nice little training potty.  Simple design, high back for comfort and easy to clean.  My son seems to like it just fine but I wish it had a taller splash guard.  My son is 20months old, 3+ ft tall and weighs a little over 30lbs.  He fits on this potty just fine but he ALWAYS tinkles over the splash guard so I have to aim his weewee down for him.  I would not let my son use this by himself at this point (we've only just started potty training) because odds are I will end up with tinkle all over the floor.
5	1392076800	We've potty trained 3 kids so far with these, and recently bought this one to begin working on our twins. What can I say? These things are simple, stable, comfortable, and easy to clean -- everything you're really after with a training potty.
4	1391731200	Your basic, sturdy little potty. Kids don't need all the flashy crap on the more expensive potties. The big toilet doesn't cheer or play princess music when you pee. Why set them up for disappointment? ;PMy son has no butt so he kind of doesn't fit on it and gets scared but maybe eventually his butt will get bigger or he'll get over it. Who knows haha.
5	1391731200	We just got this product and we are excited to see how our daughter will like it, will keep you posted. Beautifully designed.
4	1391558400	I love the look and it's appears to clean easily, but we haven't used it much to give good feedback. Our 21 month old will go sit on it without guidance, but he wants to pul out the bowl and take it with him. Hopefully when we officially start potty training, it will be fine.
5	1391472000	I bought it for my 10-month old son who is extremely active. So when i got it, I was nit even sure I can seat him on the potty and keep him seated long enough. But the seat is so comfortable that he can sit in it and listen to a song for a minute or even two before he gets bored - that is usually enough to get him do his small business there. He even tries to play with it getting the white insert out and putting it back in like a puzzle though we try not to let him play with the potty much. Word of caution -  when I tried to seat him for the very first time, he tried to just walk out of it and went down head-first - he was not a strong walker back then but I was ready and caught him and put him right back so he did not get scared of the experience. We had to pick him up to standing until he was about 10.5 months old and became more confident standing and walking though. He can stand up carefully from it - no stumbles since then.
5	1391126400	My daughter is trying out her potty chair for the first time and this one works great!  It is simple and sturdy.
5	1391040000	My 1 year old used it successfully the first day we got it. Love this potty. Easy to clean. Very satisfied.
4	1390953600	This is a good potty chair, but my daughter prefers the baby bjorn seat that goes directly on the toilet! Go figure! Good quality product though and cute!
5	1390780800	Our son started potty training at about 16 months and this chair worked very well for him!  The back offers a good amount of support and the splash guard works well.  It's easy to clean and we are very happy with the quality.
5	1390608000	Well designed for baby of 6 months to sit on. I have been working on &#34;elimination communication&#34; and now at 8 months, our baby no longer likes to use her diapers. It was an easy transition with this potty chair. She loves sitting in it.
2	1390521600	This potty worked great when my daughter was just starting out because it helped her sit on the potty the correct way but after about 3 weeks this potty was pretty much worthless.  She would sit down to pee and the pee would hit the front of the bowl and then run down the outside of the potty.  A few times it even SHOT out of the bowl.  I was cleaning pee off the floor a few times a day and changing her pants and underwear because the pee would get on them when running down the front of the potty.  She is tall for 2.5 years old and I think that is part of the problem.  We have bought a seat that fits on the toilet for her because this chair is no longer useful.  It is easy to clean and I still take it with me in the van in cases of emergency but for an everyday potty it is done.
5	1390521600	I never know what i would have done without it...Potty training was a breeze with the help of this potty chair..My baby loves her little red potty...
5	1390348800	This seat is easy to clean, sturdy and a nice color. We bought a potty that had a face and would play music but my son thought it was a toy. With this it's just one thing .... A potty. So he can get down to business . Nice arch too for back support.
5	1390348800	I have two of the low-backed ones, which are great.  The only advantage I see to this one - and my parents have one for my twins and their cousins - is that sometimes my kids would sit backwards on the low-backed ones. There's no major difference, and the high back isn't necessary.
4	1390262400	I absolutely love the simple yet functional design. I love the color, the size, the ability to clean it so easily. The only problem I am finding is my child has more fun removing the white potty bowl and wanting to sit on it without it which obviously defeats the whole purpose. I wish there was a way to lock the white potty bowl in place which would then perhaps make the simple design not so simple anymore. My child who is almost 2 is showing all the proper interest in wanting to potty train but we just can't use this model at the beginning stages right now. I'm sure we will go back to it when toddler understands the concept of leaving the white bowl in place.
5	1390089600	This is the best potty chair in our (me and my toddler) opinion.  easy to clean and super comfortable for her.  plus, since lots of our friends use them, she has &#34;her&#34; potty when we go over.
5	1389916800	grandson who has spina bifida peed and pooped in it. miracle as my daughter has to cath him every 3 hours so happy
5	1389916800	Great seat to potty train. My daughter was trained in a week with this seat. It's very comfortable and because it's kind of plain, it was less distracting. Totally recommend it!
5	1389916800	This fits newborns great so if you are starting early, this is the potty to use. It has a nice high wrap around back to give support while sitting. The bottom is truly non-slip and the whole potty is so stable I use it to help stand up when sitting on the floor next to it!
5	1389830400	this was the perfect potty chair to start my grandson on his way to wearing his 'big man pants'thank u for a terrific product
5	1389657600	My daughter loves this potty.  It was great for getting started and she is now 3 and still prefers this to the big potty. We have gotten a lot of use out of it.
5	1389484800	We love this potty.  We tried three other potties before purchasing the BabyBjorn, and it is by far our favorite.  The previous brands all had some popular character design (such as Disney Princesses), made sounds, or otherwise entertained the little ones.  I thought for sure that's what we needed to induce our daughter to use the darn thing.  But, each potty was either too uncomfortable, too hard to clean, or a combination of both.  Finally, at the suggestion of a friend, I purchased the BabyBjorn.  My husband and I loved it and, more importantly, so did our daughter!  With the high back and sides it provides the little ones with good support and both my children loved relaxing against the back while using the potty.  Then there is the clean up......it's amazingly easy!  There are no crevices, nooks, or crannies, that I have to get into in order to clean the thing.  It's just a quick wipe down with a Clorox wipe and voila!....it's done!  Furthermore, removing the bucket to empty and clean is simple and quick.  Love it!  Additionally, this potty works perfectly for girls AND boys!  Not to mention that it's practically indestructible!  We purchased our BB potty chair back in 2009 when our daughter was 2.  We then used it with our son (we were smart and purchased a neutral color that would work for either boy or girl.  LOL)  The high splash guard in the front is perfect for preventing pee messes by little boys.  Our son, who is now 3, has just about graduated to the toilet, but the BB still holds a place of honor in our bathroom and probably will for a little while longer.
5	1389398400	Great potty chair. My daughter prefers this chair to the seat covers. It's easy to clean and the perfect size for a toddler to sit comfortably.
5	1389398400	I used this product to potty train two boys. It was comfortable for the boys and durable. The product was also easy to clean.
4	1389225600	Does the job, no fancy bells or whistles- it's just a potty chair!  Still working on getting my daughter to actually use it for its intended purpose but so far she does enjoy sitting on it to watch tv.  I do like that the chair is not overly lare so it is easy to find space for it in smaller bathrooms.
4	1389139200	My 2.5 year old just wants to play with this and not use it as a potty. She discovered that the seat insert makes a great cowboy hat and is also fun to stand in and push around the house and put her toys inside and underneath it. I tried every rookie mom mistake to get her to take it seriously and nothing seems to be working. She only wants to potty train on the real toilet and, hey, that's not a bad thing. Just wish I knew before I bought it! I'd suggest starting with the real toilet and a seat to fit on top before buying this. Otherwise, it's a great potty chair! I think it's well made, a good size and has a nice simple design. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
5	1389139200	We had different potty chairs at various family members.  This was the only one our kid would sit on.  I wish the little guard on the front were a little taller but he likes it, he uses it,  that is all that matters.
5	1388880000	Bought this one for my son. We previously bought another that was horrible.This one has a high enough guard for little boys! Must have!Comfortable! My son sits in it for a long time without fussingEasy clean up!Love the no-slip rubber guard on the bottom. Helps prevent it from slipping around on the floorWould definitely recommend!
5	1388793600	My 14 month old LOVES his new potty chair and goes potty just about every time we put him on it! This whole potty training thing is easier than I thought it would be with this chair!
4	1388793600	We got this one and the Summer Infant and they're so similar you might as well get the cheaper one. This one is definitely taller but our son hasn't had better or worse luck with either one.
5	1388707200	This potty served our little one well for training at 18 months and we still utilize it on long road trips;  we stick it in the back of the station wagon and have our pre-schooler go before we do and then take it along with us to flush - it is easier than worrying about little fingers touching all the weirdness in rest-stop/gas-station bathrooms!
5	1388534400	I tried potty training my baby girl on real bowel with little sit pad for babies. That didn't work. I was so nervous of my baby would fall due to the height. So I had to stand and hold her body make sure she wouldn't fall every time she goes to restroom and it sucks.So I found this one and bought it. My daughter loves it and she potty trained herself by 2...
5	1388448000	I have 3 grand kids all at potty-training age, the first day the Bjorn was in the bathroom they all wanted to try and there was even success! They can pull their own pants down and sit without assistance...all we wanted.
4	1388448000	I gave this to a relative. They seemed happy with it. I guess I'll know more later. Hoping not to have to return this!
5	1388448000	We also have the blue potty as well and love them both. We have 1 upstairs and 1 downstairs for our 2 yr old son who is potty trained..I love how high up the lip is on this potty, thus preventing any addicents. Very easy to clean as well and no leaking noted. We researched plenty of potty seats and found this to be the best for boys.
5	1388275200	I bought this for my girl since it had to be pink. I bought a few potty training stories that feature a pink potty just like this one, so it was great to find it and have her connect stories to the actual thing. Using it, as a mom, was a breeze. Light and easy to use, easy to clean and disinfect, easy to move around, comfortable for her and PINK! Did I mention it was pink? It made potty training a success story for us!
5	1388188800	I purchased this for our grandson who lives with us.  He used it very much during his potty training until he thought he was big enough to go on the big potty.  Very nice potty chair and I would recommend it to other parents. grandparens, etc.
5	1388188800	Potty chair is brightly colored.  Has smooth lines and is easy to clean.  Good for boys and girls to use.
5	1388188800	We put this in the back of the van for when the kids can't hold it. The better ones to use in the house attach to the toilet then you don't have to clean this thing out every time your child uses the bathroom.
5	1388102400	This is the 2nd one we bought (we found we needed one for each floor) and it's a nice sturdy potty chair. We have both the grey and green and are happy with both.
5	1388102400	This chair has been great. The high back gives him something to lean back against when a bit of support is needed. It is also the perfect height for my short two year old.
4	1388016000	I purchased another potty that was cheaper but my child would have nothing to do with it. Once I bought the baby bjorn potty he turned the page on potty training and did great. I think there is something about this one being just the right size and height that makes kids like it.
5	1388016000	We love this potty as it keeps all the pee in the potty for my boy. My kids also like this design and sitting on it.  My son has low muscle tone so the back and sides are nice. :)
5	1387843200	The tall back makes this comfortable.  The pull out bowl rinses easily and is also a great design. Very light and portable.  We bought two. One for the house, and another for the van. My kids have already moved to the big potty BUT would only use these in the beginning.  We still use the van one when traveling.  Great product!
5	1387756800	This thing is the perfect height for the boys (youngest has been sitting on it since he was 18 months, and the oldest is 4.5) to sit comfortably.  It is really easy to clean and there are no crannies for icky bits to get into.  It's pretty unobtrusive color wise, but it is kind of large. There was one incident where my older son pinched his fingers between the &#34;cup&#34; and the base, but he has since learned and we haven't had any more issues.  There is a band of rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around and it does a good job, but it seems to attract all the dust and hair in the bathroom and they stick to it pretty well, so I have to use a wet rag to rub the stuff off it every couple weeks.  Overall, great product and not too pricey.
5	1387497600	This was the third potty chair we used for our daughter and we liked the solid shape and simplicity. The previous one was a small seat which fit over the toilet seat and our daughter was far too short even with a step stool. The first had so many parts and pieces she continued to use it as a toy.  This potty has one moveable piece - the bowl - which you remove and empty. There's nothing toy-like about it. It appeared to our daughter as what a potty should look like thus making the training experience much easier. Of course every toddler is different and they all finally get it when they get it :)
5	1387411200	My son loves the color and seems very comfortable sitting on the potty. He can still play with his toys and be comfortable because there is a back a sides he can push up from.
2	1387411200	This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom, it's uncomfortable!  I'm going to order one with a cushy seat!
5	1387411200	I bought two of these for my twins when they were 14 months old.  My son was using it by 15 months.  My daughter &#34;practices&#34; on hers.  They are very simple and easy to clean.  Great for smaller tots.  Some other seats were much too big or wide for them.  And, they seem very comfortable to sit on.  The raised back adds support.
5	1387324800	large potty and great giftproduct as described. good quality- no complains. satisfied customer and will repeat order in the future. Would also refer to friends
2	1387238400	So the BABYBJORN product is decent.  But the supplier and their unconscious workers who pack the BABYBJORN products require training in packing items.  Item arrived in a box too big...wrapped loosely in plastic...with ZERO packing to prevent it from rolling around inside the box.  What's happened to training employees? Management appears to be asleep at the wheel.  Why would ANY company hire people to do lousy work?  I wonder if these same employees would like to receive their video games wrapped loosely in toilet paper...thrown in a box 4 times bigger than their precious video game? I suppose it's all about perspective, isn't it?
4	1387152000	My 2 year old son loves to sit on this potty. He's a smaller guy so he's got to really concentrate on sitting bad on the potty so he's all the way on it. Overall it's a great, simple easy to use potty chair.
5	1387065600	My son likes using it, the splashguard works perfectly... no complaints!  It is easy to clean and my son seems to like sitting on it.
5	1386720000	We have two of these - one for upstairs, and one for downstairs. It's great for our 2.5 year old boy who is learning to use the potty, and easy for us as parents to try to get him to use it.Pros:- There's a barrier/guard in the front so he doesn't pee everywhere. It's a huge improvement over other potties - sometimes boys just don't get that they need to hold it down.- The potty part removes easily for cleanup and pouring out.- It has a back so he doesn't fall off of it when trying to sit down. Sometimes sitting is a bit iffy at his age.- It's nonslip on the bottom, so it doesn't push around when he goes to sit.Cons:- A &#34;pour spout&#34; or something would be great along the back side.
5	1386633600	My 18 month old son enjoys sitting on his &#34;potty&#34;.  It seems very comfortable for him, and it is easy to clean.
5	1386633600	Our boy started potty training around 15 months, and this high back was great for him at that young age, plus it is very easy to clean and fits his small tush (he is only 25 lbs). We got one for each of the grandparents house because he loved it so much and wanted to use it there.
5	1386547200	We had a purchased a couple of other types of potty chairs for our toddler and were disappointed in the size or fit.  This one worked great - in fact we got three - one for each of the grandparents' homes as well as the toddler's home.  Easy to clean, good fit, the best we found.
5	1386547200	. I was not sure about this potty seat  when i purchased . I  am so glad I bought  this . it did the magic  for my 2 1/2 year boy .  there is a reason why this potty had over 900 review . thank you .
5	1386547200	My son took right to this potty seat. It keeps the pee in the bowl. Easy to empty and rinse. Very happy with my choice!
5	1386460800	My son loves this potty. It is very cute and comfortable. He likes to sit on it and play with his toys. While he is only 1 year old, he is already learning how to use it.
1	1386288000	My daughter would not even sit on this little potty so I had to buy a new one.  The middle part for between the legs is way to tall and uncomfortable
5	1386028800	The pink color is great! Motivated my very girlie 2 year old to want to start using the potty! Easy to clean, comfy to sit on.
5	1386028800	Our son is not potty training yet but, he loves to sit on his potty. We placed it in the bathroom and every time before he takes as bath, we take off his diaper and he immediately sits on the potty. With a high back, he looks comfortable and relaxed sitting on it. Lots of great colors to choose from. Simple yet smart design.
4	1386028800	My daughter likes this chair. My only complaint is that her urine sometimes splashes out. We have taught her to lean forward and touch her toes to minimize the problem, which seems to help.
3	1386028800	It's cute but why don't these little potties have a latch that prevents a toddler from lifting and flinging the potty bowl around? Whoa! We have a very active one who just wants to pick up everything and walk it around the house. Then again, I haven't seen a potty chair yet that has a way to lock down the bowl.
5	1386028800	The lip in the front of the potty great for boys so that it blocks any messes!!!!  Light, so can easily throw in your trunk when on the road, and easy to clean.  You can easily dress this up with character stickers or paint (my son wanted a particular color so we painted it) so that the kids enjoy the potty more.  I actually have two - one for my car and one for my house.
5	1385683200	This is really useful and simple to use. Just the right size / hight for little ones to do their business on their own. Really easy to clean. Would recommend it over the ones that go over the regular size toilet seats.. because those are too high.. and the kids would need a steps..
5	1385683200	Easy to clean, easy on my son's bottom. This looks great in our small guest bathroom by my son's sticker chart, Wee Pod Basix and potty book.
2	1385596800	I have had great luck with other BabyBjorn products and bought this potty specifically for the great reviews.  My 2 year old son is finally getting serious about using the potty.  He is so excited to sit down and use it, unfortunately his excitement is soon met with shock and surprise as urine gets all over his clothes and on the floor.  The splashguard is nowhere near high enough to stop urine from spraying outside of the potty.  We try to position him while he sits with about a 50/50 success rate for staying dry.  His grandmother purchased a cheap Fisher Price froggy potty for her home and so far so good.
3	1385596800	I like that it doesn't have a lid because my son would just play with the lid, but this also makes it too easy for my toddler to take this apart. If he ever went in the seat, he would end up spilling the contents. We never had that issue though because I couldn't get him to sit on this. He preferred a small seat put on the big potty.
3	1385424000	It's ok. It's well made, and doesn't slide on the floor. It's just not working out for my little one. It's a hard plastic seat, and my toddler doesn't care for it. My toddler is tall for her age, and has long legs. She's never been very comfortable on it.
5	1385424000	I really like this potty chair - the high back keeps kids from falling off the back, and the raised front is great for little boys. We had another chair but only the Bjorn seemed to be high enough to prevent a mess for our boys. I also have the shorter backed version, and they are both good for different reasons. This one feels a little sturdier, and the bucket is easy to empty. The non-skid on the bottom keeps it from sliding all around the floor.
4	1385337600	This is a really nice potty chair, I like the high back since my toddler is special needs and has trouble sitting up, this gives her a little extra support in the back.  The color is cute.  Really just your basic potty chair, no bells or whistles, but that fits our needs.  Four stars.
5	1385337600	Grandson loves this potty.  He had a different one with bells and whistles which distracted him from his goal.  First time he used this it was a success.  Seems to be much more comfortable than the previous one we had.  Definitely would recommend to anyone with a little boy to train.
4	1385251200	I would actually rate 3.5-4 stars.  Very easy to empty & clean.  And it's worked great for my little boy.  However, the actual &#34;seat&#34; portion isn't very wide so it's been ok for the shorter &#34;sitdowns&#34; but not as comfortable for longer periods.  He does like the higher back because it doesn't cut into his spine.
5	1385251200	I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair.  When we first started potty training, it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child, it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone.  By the time she was 2.5, she had no issues getting on and off.  The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean.  The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work :)Great little potty!
5	1385251200	This was the 3rd potty we bought and I wish we had bought it the first time.  It is the perfect size for my 2 year old son.  I thought the smaller BabyBjorn potty was too small.  This is the potty I will be buying to put on our 2nd floor.
4	1385078400	My child actually likes sitting on this so I assume it's comfortable. Haven't personally tried it myself! Easy to dump and keep clean so it's a winner in our book.
5	1385078400	This is my second BabyBJorn potty chair - we love them. Perfect height for little ones and super easy to clean. Enough protection in the front for little boys who are just starting out. Travels well. Quality is excellent.
5	1384992000	*Ever have your kid on the potty in a dim room and wonder whether he actually made anything yet?  I just realized I could stick my cell phone through the hole in the back of the BB potty, and it glows through the seat so I can see what's inside!This seat is an absolute must for potty training.  Right height, comfortable back to relax and let things happen etc, but let's get real - we care about the clean up, right?  NO POTTY beats this one for clean up.  The sturdy non skid big piece stays on the ground as you clean the bowl, or hold it up for a boy working on his stand-up pee.  I had one of those potties that had a little tray to catch the poop, but got rid of it because poop can exceed the height of that little tray, even for very little guys, if it's stacked just right.  If that happens, how are you supposed to pull the tray out without smearing it all over the potty?  This has a nice deep bowl that keeps everything dropping down.I've read reviews that said the front was too high and can hurt a baby, others say its too low and doesn't catch the pee.  I have two boys, and this was just high enough to teach them to point it down a bit, which was useful when they later used public toilets.  They have never had trouble avoiding it when sitting though, so have not hurt themselves on it.
5	1384905600	These are great pottys especially for early potty training I started sitting my twins on these at 6 months old. They perfectly supported them and they are so easy to clean. Great design too.
5	1384732800	This potty is an excellent choice. It is a good size and cleans easily. I love how bright it is and it will last through to my next baby girl. What more can you ask for?
5	1384646400	This worked great, my kids love it they are comfortable on it and its stable.  Very easy to clean and we've never had anything end up outside the bucket!
5	1384646400	We've purchased three of these now, one for every room in the house. They work great for boys. We've tried a few other brands and this is the best, worth the money.
5	1384473600	My tall son loves this potty chair. It's sturdy and very easy to remove the bowl for dumping into toilet. The non-skid material on the bottom is a great feature too!
5	1384473600	We wanted a potty for our daughter to start using once day when she was about 7 months old. This one has been great - it isn't so big that her butt falls through the hole, but it definitely has room to grow. She seems to like sitting on it and using it and it is very easy to clean.
4	1384387200	Good potty just gets 'grown out' of quickly.  My DD is tall but really prefers to use it, just a bit of a spill sometimes when using it.
5	1384387200	this is a nicely made potty seat.  we have been using this since my little was 6 mo.  I am bummed at the expensive price but the simplicity and quality are worth it.
3	1384387200	I understand that boys need a splash guard, but there's little chance that this bright-pink potty will be purchased for a boy.  And at least our little girl finds the splash guard uncomfortable, because she has to straddle it.  She has difficulty sitting down with her legs apart and often pulls the bucket out and turns it around to sit more comfortably.  I wish that baby bjorn made an insert for girls, but they don't.  Other than that (or if your girl doesn't mind this issue), it's a great potty.  It's the right size, the right distance off the ground for a two-year-old, and the back is high enough to be supportive.
5	1384300800	We bought this potty as a second one for our upstairs bathroom and love it!  It is so much easier to clean than our other potty.  It also has the little handle in front that works as a &#34;pee guard&#34;.  We loved our Babybjorn potty so we bought a second one to replace our downstairs one!
5	1384041600	I love this Babybjorn after reading the reviews, I decided to buy it, my little grandson loves it as well!  Good training potty for toodlers!  Get yours today.
5	1383868800	I bought the same potty but in pink color 4 years ago for my daughter and it has been one of the most  excellent and useful items, definitely the best! Thats why I bought a blue one, this time for my 8 months old baby boy!
4	1383782400	Very basic potty. The potty lifts up and dumps into toilet nicely. Been using it for over a year now. Easy to clean. Just wipes down. Little girl using it and the little lip that rises in the front blocks any &#34;high streams&#34; if she is leaning back.  No messes so far. I like the white for use with any child and It has stayed white. Has a nice rubber like rim on the bottom that won't slide around on my wood floors. Light weight for when I am cleaning bathroom I just pick it up with one hand. May be a little small though for bigger kids with the way it wraps around. Not sure. Will try and update on that later. She has just turned 2 and is 30lbs and is not an issue.
5	1383782400	Just for my baby. It may not have the bell and whistles but why do you need all of that.
5	1383523200	What can we say , other than this works great ! We bought this over a year ago and our son at 3 still uses it. Not only is he potty trained but this is so easy to clean . Great product so simple,easy to use,easy to clean takes up a very small space. All that you will ever need for your little one , we highly recommend this potty!This was a well worth purchase .
5	1383523200	My daughter likes to poop and pee in this.  It is easy to clean, and replace.  Almost too easy.  Sometimes, my two year old will try and do all that on her own, which can cause larger cleaning excercises.
3	1383436800	This is a really nice chair and is well made.  However, my toddler did not want to use it to go potty.  She would sit in it like it was a chair, but would not go.  We had to order a seat to put on the toilet, and she started going.  Yay.
5	1383264000	I had purchased a different potty chair, but found that it was too small to cover both business ends while seated.  This one worked out great with a larger potty area and it's more stable, too.I highly recommend this.
5	1383004800	My husband insisted that our son would potty train with those on the adult toilet seat inserts.  We bought all different types.  Potty training just wasn't working.  I actually researched many of these potty chairs right here on amazon and the Babybjorn had the best reviews and comments, so I managed to convince my husband that we should at least try it.  Best decision ever.  My son's potty training excellerated.  Now he enjoys sitting on this potty.  It's the best height for him and he even likes emptying the receptical into the big toilet.  Easy to clean. Now my youngest likes to just sit on this potty, even fully clothed.  He feels like a big boy copying what his brother does.  Very glad we made the decision to go with this basic floor potty.
3	1382918400	We also own a Prince Lionheart pottyPOD and a potty seat for the big toilet when we're out and about. My 2 year old son strongly prefers the pottyPOD, which he finds much more comfortable. He will not use this one for #2, and mostly only uses it when he knows he needs to get to the potty quickly and this is the one nearby. He says it is not as comfortable, and he has a tendency to sort of scrunch over when sitting on it. However, I prefer it as there is much less mess--he's never had anything not be totally contained by the potty. It is easy to clean and appropriately sized. I think if this was the only potty we had, he would be ok with it (though I suspect training might have taken longer, as he won't happily sit on this one for long stretches). Also, he usually needs help getting on it. He's just shy of 3' tall and weighs about 28lbs. He doesn't think he can just sit down on this one because of the splash guard (which is what prevents the mess) and waits to be helped. With the PottyPOD he just sits right down and then scoots to the best position.It does live up to most of the claims -- it doesn't move around, even when he is not sitting calmly; it is easy to clean; the high back is nice (though again, my son seems to scrunch forward when on this potty, which I think has to do with the high back); the design is essentially innocuous and not out of place in an adult bathroom (ours is in the main floor powder room, the only bathroom a guests use, so this is important).
5	1382832000	This potty I got for my 15 month old and she loves it!  It fits perfect for her and she thinks she is such a big girl using it.  It has a white basin that is able to lift out for easy cleaning, which is very nice.  The back support is perfect, as my daughter can sit back without turning around the whole time.  Fits perfect!
5	1382745600	My two-year-old daughter loves this potty chair and prefers it over her Prince Lionheart potty chair. The chair itself is very sturdy and extremely easy to clean. I love that it is ergonomic and that there is a "high back." There aren't many potty chairs out there that are comparable to this one -- trust me, I've looked!
3	1382659200	The idea of the higher front is great, I get it. My son hates it. He wont sit on it because it squishes his junk because its so high he can barely get over it. Mind you he is on the younger side so those of you closer to 3 maybe it will be better but not for us!
1	1382572800	I thought I was getting the same as the one I had. What a disappointment! Won't even work for a two year old it is smaller, lighter and a cheap version of the original
5	1382572800	Simple, Easy to clean and my little girl loves it! the best potty out there, and we would know...we have five different kinds and this is the only one which is simple enough to encourage her to wee on it. she plays with the others.
5	1382572800	We love this potty! We started potty training our son when he was about 14 months and it's really like a seat for a little prince--it's very comfortable and conducive to months' worth of training!
5	1382227200	A friend recommended this potty chair, and it was a great recommendation. The chair is easy to clean with one part and the higher area in the front prevents leaks. I also love that this chair does not have a lot of cracks and crevices to collect mess. I believe this may be the best potty chair on the market.
5	1382140800	The seat is the perfect size for toddlers, contoured to be comfortable, and designed to be easy to clean.  Your little one will sit and be situated as i the same body position as an adult on a real toilet.  The raised front of the white part serves as both a pommel/hand rest and a splash guard.  The white bowl is deep enough to prevent most splashes.  The back and arms are high enough to make your little one feel secure and allow him/her to rest against them.  The seat does not slide on tile flooring.  When your baby is done, just lift the white bowl and clean.  Perfect potty training chair.  Fits almost anywhere and is very light.
5	1382140800	We really like this potty. The high back makes it comfortable, the splash guard works, it is easy to clean, and the wide base makes it stable. We bought three (upstairs, downstairs, and for Grandma's house).
5	1381881600	It's the perfect size and fit for boy and girl toddlers.  The inside potty is reversible for either sex and is made of strong plastic--easy to clean and keep sanitary.
4	1381795200	We used a different potty seat with a lower raise in the front that had a little magical flush sound and a padded seat for the past 1.5 years. That has been fine, but I wanted something simpler to clean (the old potty had little crevices everywhere that were hard to scrub inside of). It was important that the new potty have a large bowl to hold a lot of pee or poo. Some brands have such small bowls I don't see the point in using them for a toddler. This one fulfilled most of my checklist.Pros:Large bowlSimple to clean, no crevices for nasty stuff to get stuck inHigh back so the kiddo can lean back without fallingVery stable (nonslip material on bottom edge) and sturdyHigh lip in the front keeps pee from arching out of the potty (whether it is for girls or boys)Cons:High lip in the front makes it difficult for kiddo to sit down by themselves if they aren't paying attentionThe nonslip material on the bottom edge is bright red and is a bit of an eyesore even when the potty is sitting on the ground
5	1381795200	This potty has been perfect for my twin boys.  They like the high back on the potty because they could actually sit back and watch tv or just relax.  I like it because the front guard keeps their urine from getting on the floor.  I would definitely recommend this potty to other mothers.
4	1381449600	It's nice and simple.  I have twins and they are stockable (not the twins, the potty chairs), so we can put them away together but it takes as much space as one would.  They are light, so children can carry them around and play with them.  The high back let's them relax on the potty.  We like it.
5	1381276800	Our little grandson uses this and it's the perfect size.  Love how it's designed so no potty gets on the floor.
3	1381190400	We have had this seat for almost a year now. I like that it is easy to clean, has a good back support and non slip base,  but I have to clean the floors and change my son's pants almost every time he uses this potty. Unfortunately, the pee guard is not working for us.
5	1381190400	my Grandson loves it and so does his Mom.  Makes potty training good.  Very easy to clean and that's a plus for parents
5	1381190400	I was completely against getting our son a potty chair just for the whole &#34;wash out/sanitization&#34; factor.  However, I'll admit that he is much more likely to use this potty than he is to use the toddler toilet ring we have that goes on our standard seat.  I think he is just more comfortable closer to the ground and likes being able to have his feet on the ground when waiting for the elusive number 2.  We've definitely had way more success with this chair than the toddler seat &#34;ring&#34; option!
5	1381104000	I bought this in green when my son was 20 month old along with 2 small old fashion babybjorn potty chairs(I see that they don't make the old fashion ones anymore).He really liked it(same with the other ones) and was potty trained in 4 days.We had the big one at home,and the small ones either in the cars ,or strollers.My son knew how to keep his pee-pee inside the bowl,so no problems with the pee going in the wrong direction,plus my son was on the skinny side.We didn't use it for long because my son preferred the big toilet.At age 2 he was going by himself on it,without a toilet trainer.Now,I'm using them for my 19 month old daughter,which is not very crazy about them.Even though she is very small (barely 17 lb),she prefers the big toilet.During the day she is 100% potty trained (she is the one saying when she needs to go,we don't ask her).When nobody is around to lift her and put her on the toilet,she will go to the green potty.
5	1380844800	This is by far the best potty chair I've found for little boys. It's big enough for him to be comfortable and it has a raised area in front to help prevent accidents. The bowl is completely removable, so it's super easy to clean. I'd buy it again!
5	1380844800	This is a perfect size potty chair for my recently potty trained grandson. It also has a non slip base.
4	1380758400	My boy was potty-training at 3 years old and it was a little small for him to sit on. But clean-up is easy (pick up the white bowl to make sure nothing has fallen underneath though).
5	1380758400	my son choose this potty chair , the baby is not born yet , he like the color and the size and the way the back support the baby , I would recommend it to my friends
5	1380758400	I bought this potty chair based on reviews I read here on Amazon, and I'm very pleased with it and agree with what others have said: a higher shield that is good for boys, only 2 pieces so it's easier to clean, comfortable for the child to sit on, great grippers on bottom so it stays in place even if the child bumps into it while trying to sit down. Now if only the potty training itself were as easy as choosing this chair!
5	1380672000	We got this one because our daughter's school uses them & she fits great on it.  She uses the arm rests to stand up & she even finds it easy enough to pick up & pour out herself with her barely 2-year old hands.  Easy to clean.
5	1380499200	It have good color  and it made with high quality. It is very easy to use. I do not regret that it bought.
5	1380412800	Purchased this for when my grandson visits. He is potty training and he loves everything blue! It's the perfect size for him and keeps everything in the potty (if you know what I mean). He looks forward to using it and it is well made with a rubber rim on the bottom to keep it from sliding around. Great price as well.
5	1380153600	Great little potty chair.  This is at grandmas house and unlike some others this one seems to be very comfortable for grandson to use.  It goes up in the front so pee doesn't splash all over it goes right in potty.  I would recommend this!
2	1380067200	I ordered this potty because after weeks of research, this was the only potty I could find that's BPA free. When it came my daughter was excited to try it. Unfotunately she pinched her finger on the pull out center. She also voiced that her bottom hurt because it was too hard. She's only 25 lbs and is a small girl but there isn't enough seat so it's uncomfortable. She now refuses to sit on it. It's going back.
5	1379894400	Seems perfect.  My son is small but can sit down & stand up without any trouble.  He's hit the splashguard a couple of times, but it's rounded enough that he hasn't been hurt.  The rubber bottom is great too - the potty does not slide around at all.
5	1379808000	We were able to potty train our LO before she turned 1. She is able to use this on her own now.
5	1379808000	This is a additional purchase.  We already had one and needed a second for the twin brother.  Now they use them together.
5	1379808000	I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :)
4	1379808000	We used a few other potty seats before getting two of these for our son- one upstairs and one downstairs.  It is easy to clean, and I love the splashguard when he is sitting down.  We used it for several months and I would have given it 5 stars... until he started peeing standing up. When he hits the back of the toilet instead of the bowl, urine leaks and pools under the potty. TMI- he is still working on aim, so nearly every time I have to wipe down the whole thing plus the floor. We've started putting a hand towel underneath the potty at all times because we were using a huge amount of wipes to absorb the pooling. The advantage of this model is the ease of cleaning, but it is a hassle to have to clean the floor too every single time too.
5	1379548800	My son hasn't had any issues so far with potting training with this BabyBjorn. That was my main concern was finding a potty that was good for boys to train in. I would definitely recommend this one. My son just sits there, reads his book and potties. We are taking it slowly (not a 3 day training or anything) and he seems very comfortable with it.
3	1379462400	The splash guard isn't the best for girls - my daughter hurt herself on it during one of the first uses.It's easy to clean and doesn't leak, but the &#34;pot&#34; comes up almost too easily - my daughter often tries to take it out herself, causing a mess.We have another potty (an Elmo one) that is tougher to take the pot out of.The high back is a nice feature, but I don't know if my girls really appreciate it or not.
5	1379116800	Love the color and design but best of all it is very portable!  We have taken it everywhere.  Also cleans well.
5	1379030400	OMG - my son is 12 now and I'm glad that this product is still out there. At the time we tried few models, but settled on this one. We loved it for our son and then daughter. It's comfortable, so we've heard, and easy to clean...
5	1379030400	Super simple potty seat, but seems to be comfortable for my son.  Shape is easy for cleaning and rubber on the bottom rim keeps seat from slipping when he sits down.  I would recommend this seat.
5	1378684800	I purchased this potty chair after reading all the good reviews. I am so glad I went for this one. In my opinion, there is no need for all the music gimmick stuff. My girl is very comfortable. It is very sturdy and no tip over. I like how the white bowl comes off and make clean up very easy. I ended up purchased two of them. It is highly recommended.
5	1378425600	Easy to clean, low enough for kiddo, hole was large enough for #2, backing made for a good reading position for the kiddo while we waited for the pee pee to come out.
5	1378339200	Excellent potty train chair, is a perfect size for a toddler, is a stable chair and adjust to their little bodies, easy to clean after used.
5	1378166400	perfect for potty trainingthe texture is smooth, comfortable for baby sitting.my son used it the first day I bought.
5	1377907200	I had a potty seat from hell and this one is simple, easy to empty and clean and my granddaughter sits on it easily.  I love it.
4	1377734400	This  helped potty train my granddaughter.  BabyBJorn has never disappointed.  The pink looks exactly as portrayed.  The product easy to clean.
5	1377561600	This potty is just perfect for my daughter.  She loves sitting on it and is getting used to the idea of the potty.  It's not intimidating and is easy to clean.
5	1377475200	works great, son loves it. works perfect for boys.  great quality. the high back supports my son so he wont feel like he is falling back
5	1377129600	Perfect for ECing younger babies. We started at 4 months and it's been perfect! Now at 9 months he is perfectly happy to sit there and is a pro ECer! Would highly recommend.
5	1376956800	We started &#34;potty practice&#34; at about 21 months for my daughter. She's small for her age but showing signs of readiness. We borrowed another seat to get started and quickly learned all the &#34;extras&#34; were a distraction -- the other chair had a removeable foam seat and a lid. Not anything fancy, but she was curious and explored the seat every time instead of doing her business. We've switched to this chair and does MUCH better. It's easier to clean and just the right size.
5	1376956800	This potty chair is perfect for my daughter as the back is higher up to support her lower back and it doesn't have all the music and sounds to distract her interest in truly trying to go potty.  She gets a toy or a small book and wants to go sit on it and try and has had off and on success with going at this point but I like how easy it is to clean too.
3	1376870400	So i really like this potty chair . But my son isn't ready yet !  I bought this 5 months ago .  He can sit on this for an hour and he won't go .
5	1376697600	I bought this because she has the same one at her house.  Easy for her to sit on and  easy for me to clean.  I also bought the one at her house .  Good product.
5	1376611200	This is easy to sit the baby on and easy to clean.  She doesn't get distracted or use it as a toy.  The seat is comfortable for her height and fits her bottom and legs very well.  It's not really breakable.  I like it.
5	1376524800	This is a great potty! Very simple, stable, easy to clean ,comfortable for our 1 year old! High back supports baby nicely.overall- great product
5	1376265600	when looking for a mini potty i didn't feel the need to get one that made noise or flash lights. We don't want to make a big fuss over the potty... everyone does it, and we just wanted something simple easy to clean, that wasn't mistaken for a toy.
5	1376092800	I EC my baby and often use the insert by itself on trips away from home.  It is easy to grip and fits my baby's bottom without him falling in.  My only problem with it is that my baby boy pees to the left, which makes the pee guard less useful than it would seem.
3	1376006400	The cup area just does not work good for little boys.  Needs a larger cup area to prevent urine from going straight out of potty chair .
4	1376006400	We started potty training our 10 month old twins on this potty first and it served the purpose wonderfully well for both our infants.  They were fully trained on this one by 17 months because it was so comfortable for them to sit and their legs started reaching the floor by the time they were 1 year old.
2	1375920000	I got this potty chair because of all the good reviews, but I'm really disappointed. First the good things are that it does have a high back and is simple which makes it easy to clean, but my son does not find it comfortable at all! The first couple of times he sat on it, he had big red rings on his bottom and when he sat up the bucket stuck to his bottom and when it fell off it scared him because of the noise when it fell back into the potty. I thought it was because he was sitting so long but even sitting only a couple minutes it was the same thing. He is not a big boy either, he is actually on the smaller end. Now I am trying a potty with a soft seat and is attached to the potty. I don't write many reviews but hope this review helps others.
5	1375747200	great , no leak, easy to clean perfect for the toddlers. very good product. I will recommend to a friends
4	1375574400	I was told by other Amazon reviewers that these are made in China, but at my local Babiesrus they had blue and white ones made in USA. The price was about the same with a coupon from babiesrus website, so I ordered online and picked it up at BRU in NYC. Originally I wanted to get the one from Prince Lionheart because we like their bathtub (made in Denmark), but it didn't have back support and was made in China.We tried using Bjorn with my son when he was 8 months but he didn't like it so I'm waiting to use it a little later, hence 4 stars. My friends swear by this Bjorn potty. If you want to make sure you are getting the one made in the US, check at your local stores.
5	1375228800	This is a great product.  It is light in weight, so it is easily moved from one bathroom to another if necessary.  It is sturdy andvery easy to clean.  I am a grandmother and would recommend it to any one who needs a potty chair that is portable.
5	1375056000	I have bought 3 potty chairs so far trying to find one my two year old will sit on without acting like a cat being put in a bath!  This is the only one so far that we have succeeded in getting her onto.  It is attractive in the red color (though I wish the removable bowl was also red instead of white).  It is easy to clean, difficult to tip over and the raised sides (arm rests?) help her to get in and out comfortably.  Great quality product!
5	1374883200	This potty seat is simple and sturdy. I put it in my toddlers room at night to avoid accidents. My son's legs were a bit long since this purchase and will look for something taller. It is perfect for my younger son they both prefer the toilet during the day. It is portable, sturdy and very easy to clean.
5	1374796800	Good for potty training.  Lightweight and easily transportable from the house to the van.  The best part is the potty can be placed out of the way when not in use.
5	1374710400	Bought this ten years ago to potty train my first. I'm now using it for my fourth. It has held up incredibly well due to it's heavy duty structure. I love that it has a wide base with grips on the bottom. This potty isn't going to slide around or tip over no matter how wiggly your toddler is. It's also so easy to clean! Great for boys, too!
5	1374624000	Very good material, nice and sturdy.  Smooth and rounded at all edges.  The design is simple enough to clean all the nooks and crannies and yet perfect for use.  Definitely deserves an award for design!  This potty is higher than a lot of the competitor's brands but it works for us because it's exactly what we needed for our daughter!
1	1374624000	Almost every time my son goes to use this potty his pee shoots out of the potty onto the floor.  Will not hold the velocity of his pee.  We are back  to square one on purchasing a potty that will be great.  If you have a boy...don't buy this potty.
3	1374537600	So far this product has been really great for my 7 month old. It's not too big and she can almost set her feet on the ground.The only downfall is that because the back is so high she likes to lean back and relax against it, which wouldn't be a problem except then when she pees the pee shoots over the splash guard!I feel like there could be a way to make the splash guard more efficient but who knows.Other than that it's nice, easy to clean and I'm sure it will last her a long time but it's short enough that she will be able to go by herself once she gets more coordinated.
5	1374537600	When we shopped around for a potty for my daughter, i was going through so many different reviews and all the seats with crazy additions to it. But in the end, I decided to go the old fashioned way, with no toots and horns. This seat is ergonomic and easy to clean. My daughter never once complained about it. I eventually even used to take the insert with me to parks, so my daughter would have somewhere to go and then I would dump it and wipe it with a baby wipe. Highly recommend this. Straight to the point of potty training.
3	1374451200	Although the design and maintenance are clean, the splash guard is not high enough. My 24 month old pees over the splash guard every time, so I had to go buy puppy training pads to place under the seat. He does not yet get the concept of elbows on knees and leaning forward continuously. Other than this issue (I am on my third training seat because of this issue), the seat is fine
5	1374451200	My boy is a big boy and it fits him perfect! His feet hit the floor perfectly too and great height for him. Somehow won't tip.. nicely engineered!
5	1374278400	Its just perfect for a toddler, very steady, easy to clean, simple, good quality. My 2 years old girl love to sit in the potty, its so easy to sit in there for a toddler, has the perfect size for them. I just recomended this item
5	1374192000	Great seat and It seems like it's gonna be super easy to clean. Now if I can just get my boy to potty in it.....
5	1374105600	Bought this for my two year old and she wanted to use it right away!  It's comfortable and stable for her and easy to clean.  Simple and well made--just what a potty should be.
3	1374019200	This is a very nice potty seat. We've had it since my son was 6 months old, and he's been sitting on it on and off since then. It's a good size, seems comfortable enough for him, is simple, and is easy to dump out and clean. He's now 21 months and potty training, and the seat is great for him when he comes running over saying "go potty, go potty" and can easily sit and pee.Why only 3 stars? Because theSummer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Whiteis essentially the same potty but MUCH cheaper. We have one BabyBjorn and 2 Summer Infants, and they're all great. I actually slightly prefer the cheaper Summer Infant.
5	1373846400	We have on chair on loan in our classroom and almost all of the children want to use it so we ordered a second one to support this desire and to support potty learning.  It is well made and the children use it regularly.  It was a useful purchase, and we really like to beautiful green color.
5	1373846400	What you're viewing is exactly what you get. This is a basic, lightweight, easy to clean potty. No bells and whistles, just another deniable BabyBjorn product.
5	1373846400	This potty is perfect!  So simple, no bells and whistles, no distractions, just a potty.  We've only had this chair a few days and our little boy is starting to get curious about what it is.  So far he's sat on it about ten times and gone in it 3!  We couldn't be happier.  Make sure you order &#34;Potty&#34; by Leslie Patricelli- it's the best potty book we've come across and our little one loves it.
5	1373673600	I have a small home daycare and this is the perfect potty for my toddlers.  It is easy to store and easy to clean.  I sympathize with the other reviewer who says her child is too large for the chair, it does happen sometimes.  In that case I would suggest buying a new permanent toilet seat that can also be used as a training seat.  You can buy these at Lowes or any large home store.  I had one of these but found that some of the kids are a bit afraid of using the adult sized toilet.  It is also not as easy to clean.  I guess you have to figure out what works best for your child.  In my case, I can let two children have potty time with the smaller seats, and they do seem to like to make a party out of it.  Bring out the books and enjoy yourselves!
4	1373414400	This chair saved the day. He has the feeling of being hugged; Therefore, he will sit longer and have better luck. Also, the cleanup is better. There is less spill.
5	1373414400	Fast turn on the product around but our son is 8 months so we really have made much effort on potty trainning.
5	1373241600	We actually started with the potty inserts that go right on top of the regular toilet (built in type, portable type, and a cushioned type).  My son was refusing to use that to potty train, and we decided to try this one instead.  It took awhile, but now he's using this exclusively.He likes it because it is just his size, doesn't require help from us, and can be put right in front of the tv (we'll have to change this last one soon!).  He will even wait to pee when we are out so he can use his &#34;small potty&#34; at home instead of public toilets.We like it because he uses it, it is easy to clean with the white part coming right out of the chair, and the splash guard is great for the boys.  There's a smaller version of this chair without the back that we take with us when we are out or on vacation too.
5	1373068800	We ordered three of these potties for our daughter. They arrived just wrapped in plastic inside an amazon box. No pretty packaging, no instruction manual in 20 languages. Just the product. At first, I was worried I had ordered a used one... but I guess that's just how the Sweede's do it. Now, I'm just a Tennessee redneck. I don't buy into all the fancy &#34;European&#34; pictures of the European couples with their kids in  front of some European landmark like you see on their website. I don't go around to all my friends and brag about my BabyBorjn purchase and try to pronounce it all European like to try and impress them. I do, however, like simplicity. I don't like buttons, flaps, lids, and all the gadgets on the other models I looked at. This guy is just a simple piece of plastic and should do the trick nicely. I'm surprised they didn't plaster it with warning signs that it should be placed on the floor and not the kitchen counter. I guess the Sweedes are smarter than us and just know how to raise their kids using common sense. In any event, we'll give it a try and see if we can stop keeping Huggies in business. If it works before her 2nd birthday I might even look up how to pronounce the darn thing.
5	1373068800	I like it because I have four grandchildren that are using the potty in my house when they visit, three boys and a girl. This potty chair is perfect for boys and girls, small, easy to clean and you don't have to deal with the little gadget for boys that keeps falling off on other potties. Kids love it because it is the same that they have at home.
4	1372809600	She learned fast with her potty chair, she's kind of tall for her age (3' 2&#34; tall and 2.5 yrs) but still resulted comfortable and easy to use!! Very pleased with the product. No mess.
5	1372723200	Baby Bjorn always seems to have great, thoughtful design on their products. I always look to them to see if the make what I'm looking for before I look anywhere else. This chair is the same way. The other chairs have a lot of little nooks & crannies to get pee or poo stuck in. I like that this chair is simple, two molded plastic pieces, no crevices to get nasty stuff built up in. Easy to clean and empty out. My son sits on it with no complaints.
5	1372723200	My 2 yr old son loved his new potty chair. It was easy for him to use. The backrest helped guide him on and off the seat easily. The splash guard was the right size for little boys. The design was appealing to adults, meaning it blended into the bathroom design, instead of sticking out as overly kiddie. All in all great little potty chair!
4	1372636800	It's a wonderful potty, very comfortable, easy to clean... I love it. My only dislike is that I also bought the &#34;Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty&#34; and it's almost identical, only half the price.
4	1372636800	If you are an adult male who likes bears, this is NOT the chair for you...it's simply too small! But if you are a young child, this is a great chair for potty training as it's stable and easy to clean. Of course if you are reading this review, you aren't a young child so again I caution you that this will not fit an adult.
5	1372377600	Our son just turned two and we have begun introducing him to his own potty.  This chair is great.Pros:1- Sturdy.  He leans forward to get a wayward car or his stuffed teddy and it does not tip forward with him2- Catches all of the day's product, nothing has escaped yet- the guard is tall enough.3- Easy to take the pot out and dump into the toilet but because he is sitting on it, no chance for him to pull it out and dump while he is sitting.4- Easy to clean (the most important?)Con:1- Once he has stuck to the pot and when he stood up quickly, it stuck to him and dumped.  A minor problem in the grand scheme of things and it has not happened since.We bought one for grandma's house and would recommend highly
5	1372118400	Just what I expected, I really like the high back she sits better on it because its more like a chair.
4	1371859200	We are just now introducing the potty to my toddler; therefore, have yet to use it in its full capacity. He appears to fit great on it and it looks as it it will be easy to clean.
5	1371772800	This chair had such wonderful reviews that I purchased this one over others. My little grandson loved the chair, and immediately started using it and the pullups, and going potty in the pullup stopped. He was immediately potty trained. He'd had other chairs but wouldn't use them. He just seemed resistant to wanting to be trained. I went ahead and researched, and figured his resistance would stop if he had a chair that was comfortable, and one he could use to coincide with independence and accomplishment. The chair could not be awkward, uncomfortable, have parts that didn't stay put. or the chair was unstable.This chair is the best!
1	1371686400	This is almost identical to the one I bought at Ikea for $4 just last weekend!! Way overpriced for what it accomplishes.
5	1371686400	I like the size and shape, it works well for my 18 month old that is slightly taller than average. It's sturdy and what I like best is that it only contains 2 parts. I just wish they had two versions because my little girl doesn't need a splash guard and it does get in the way. But not so much that I would say its a negative.
4	1371600000	My daughter just turned 18 months and we have begun trying to potty train.  Unfortunately she has yet to grasp the concept and has not gone potty in it yet, but she does like to sit on it for a few minutes at a time.  We are hoping to have her day potty trained by the time she is 2 years old, at which time we will move to a seat on the actual toilet.  This seat is a fine size for her now, but I think it will be too small for children over 2 years.  I do like that it is very simple and easy to clean.  The only thing is that it is very easy to take the white tub out, and my daughter likes to take it off and play with it.  It should have Velcro or something to make it a little harder for little hands to remove.
5	1371600000	This is the best potty that I could find out there. The size is perfect for our small bathroom, and our 19 month old sits comfortably on it. I am sure that it would be comfortable for most children who are potty training as well. I wanted something that was comfortable, compact, and without all the bells and whistles (lights, toys, sounds, etc.). This potty is perfect and I recommend it to anyone!
5	1371427200	My wife and I bought this chair for our grandson to use when he comes to visit us.  I believe there were 765 reviews of this product!  Amazing!  We've raised three daughters so the anatomical challeges of potty training a little boy were new to all of us. The pictures don't really do the chair justice.  The chair, from front to back, is actually much deeper than it appears, which is GREAT!  The shield up front is much higher than it appears, which is GREAT!  Our grandson was obviously uncomfortable using the &#34;conventional&#34; training toilet he had at home.  One visit and the toilet went home with our daughter and son-in-law.  Our grandson is completely toilet trained in less than 2 weeks.  We all agree that this toilet played a huge role in his rapid success!Quality product, well designed!  Highly recommended!
5	1371340800	Why I love this toilet....it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there...but really, why do you need them? This one is easy to clean...must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom...it is the perfect height...and has a nice seat back....best part, it doesn't tip over (yet at least). Not sure how it works for boys...but for a girl it worked well.
5	1371254400	Simple, clean design!Perfect size pee guard, easy to clean and replace.Great productWould definitely recommend to parents of boys and girls :)
5	1371168000	Hello all, to start off, I don't actually have any children.  Then why am I buying a toddler's potty chair?  Because they're convenient of course!  Fools, don't you ever have moments when you're watching such a gripping alfred hitchcock movie on television and there's NO COMMERCIALS (who would even think of such a thing? Everybody loves commercials!)  You couldn't possibly let your eyes waver from the screen, so what happens now?!  Well, I discovered the solution to that problem.....you simply buy a potty!  I installed mine into my couch, I cut a hole in the couch cushion and placed the potty in the hole.  It works marvelously!  Simple, easy, and efficient!  A word of caution though, make sure that you empty it after every other pee and poo.  I once made the mistake of not emptying after a particularly potent batch of doodoo, wow!  Did that make a mess!  And the smell was so bad that my mother barged into my apartment and said she could smell it all the way from her grave 10 miles away!  Nothing like mothers to help you out even at inconvenient moments in life!  Love you mom!
5	1371168000	Exactly what I was looking for. My 2yr old had no problem using it the same day we received it.
5	1370995200	This was the best potty seat for my 2.5 year old son and he refused to sit on ANY other potty, until his grandma bought an identical one (a tad bit narrower) from Ikea for $10!! Seriously, it was the same design in white with green trimming. This Baby Bjorn potty chair is definitely a great product and I have nothing but compliments, except that the Ikea chair works in the exact same way for 1/3 of the price. Just get it from Ikea and save yourself some $$$
5	1370563200	With my first son, i bought the boon potty bench, I did consider this one, but at the time, I wanted the step stool option.  The potty bench worked, but with my twins I needed another potty and got this one.  LOVE IT!  I wish I would've had it for my first son and just got a separate step stool.  I have boy/girl twins that are 2 1/2 years old.  They both can use it very easily, they don't have to take their bottoms off all the way.  That was something I couldn't tell with the pictures 'cause of the way it's shaped.  It's so easy to clean.  They like to dump it themselves in the big toilet and it's easy for them to do that .  There are no spills with the pee guard.  Funny thing was when I first got it, my four year old son wanted to try it out.  He's about 50 lbs and 47&#34; tall and even he fit on it!  It's so light and portable.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5	1370476800	This chair is wonderful! I didn't want a potty with bells & whistles & songs and junk. This potty is clean cut & to the point... lol.My son seems to be comfortable while using it. It's really easy to clean. I'd definitely recommend this chair!!! The grey color is tasteful & gender neutral!
5	1370476800	We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs (the ones that turn into step stools) because the back is higher and it has arm rests.  Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space.  Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler.  Also, despite its 'lack' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe.  The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature!  Highly recommend this potty chair!
5	1370390400	I care for my grand daughter Monday thru Friday and gave away the potty chair I had saved for years.  I went to Buy Buy Baby and checked out the currently available styles.I like this one, because it is stable, the construction is simple and there are no hidden places for soil to collect.
3	1370390400	This was the third potty I purchased in an effort to find the right one for my daughter.  While reasonably inexpensive and cute, the design did not work well for us.  Perhaps this feature was designed with boys in mind, but that plastic lip in the front made it difficult for my daughter to sit down comfortably.  And, she complained that the potty hurt her butt.  Instead, I would recommend the Summer Infant Step-by-Step Trainer. It worked brilliantly for us.
5	1370304000	I really like this potty chair. It fits perfect... My baby girl is really have when she sits on it. Its is comfortable. I would recommend babyjorn potty chairs.. Thank You
5	1370217600	I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS:- High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS:- Haven't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care.
5	1370131200	I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on. We didn't pressure her to use it, but would casually ask. She would run in and sit on it, read on it, and sing songs. Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose!  Still in the potty training process, but this is a great starter tool.  I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went.
2	1370131200	my daughter is 17 months old. I know it's early, but she sometimes will sit on her potty when mommy goes to the bathroom. however, if she sits on it without her diaper, it seems to be very uncomfortable for her. She squirms a lot and ends up leaning on the back of the potty so as to not have her butt on the seat. I'll have to update this review as she gets older.
5	1369785600	We have this in both green and blue for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms, respectively.  Son loves sitting on it and hasn't had any issues at all.  Very easy to clean and I like the high back because he can really sit there and relax a little while waiting to make a potty.
5	1369785600	I love that someone took the time to figure out how important it is for children to FIT their potty and feel secure! We now own 2 of these chairs (brothers wont share) and recommend them to everyone we know! They are the best out there in my opinion!
5	1369785600	just the right size. easy to clean.very nice. love the white color. toddlers like to use it. quick clean up
5	1369526400	I am a Bjorn fan.  I had a similar potty chair for my kids 30 years ago.  Now I have 2 Bjorns for my grandchildren who are at the potty training stage.  I have 2 two year old granddaughters who are training at the same time.  It is easy to clean.  No dripping because of the one piece construction and it is easy to take with you.  I love it.
5	1369526400	Our daughter loves this pottie! We are very early in the pottie training stage.and she's been only minimally successful in using this pot. She does like to sit on it, and when she has success she likes helping us with the disposal and cleaning. The insert is very easy to remove and clean. Some other reviews mentioned issues with the high lip in the front of the insert. We have taught our daughter to sit slowly and deliberately and haven't had any troubles beyond panties getting caught on it. Really, the only issue we've had is that she can easily get up and walk away rather than sitting still until she's done, but that is our problem, not the pottie's.
5	1369440000	I love this potty. The color is beautiful and my daughter loves it too.  She loves to play with it...I only wish I could get her to use it as a potty and not as a toy, but it's a start.  It is sturdy and well made and I am very pleased with it.
5	1369440000	Great size, washes well, like the red color. Not much else to say about a poo receptacle really. My son willingly sits and stays on it and that's about all I can ask for!
5	1369353600	This item worked well for my son because it has the pee guard on the front of the potty.  Light weight so it was easy to move from place to place.  Loved the color-we bought the gray.
5	1369267200	This has turned out to be a great little potty for our little boy.  He is tall for his age but still fits on here easily. Thankfully we have very few messes to clean up as the front shield does a great job of preventing any target practice around the bathroom.  It is also easy to clean, if still disgusting.  But really what potty chair isn't?  At this point I can't think of anything I would change about this potty chair.  Our son really likes the color and the fact that he can dump it out into the &#34;big potty&#34; and flush.
5	1369267200	Love the color, love that it is tall but not too tall, has no cover, easy to clean - dump and flush- after use. Would recommend!
5	1369180800	This has a very nice design and is not annoying looking like most potties. The high back is nice for my daughter because she can read her favorite book and lean back. Rubber grip on the bottom works well too, does not slide around.
5	1368921600	Excellent product.  My son is just a bit too small, but he'll grow into this potty.  It has a solid back if he leans back, and a little lip so he won't pee right at you.
5	1368921600	This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back.
3	1368748800	Our toddler still doesn't use it much, but the few times he has gone to sit on it, the white top with the weird hump on it trips him up and hits him in the wrong place. Horrible design flaw. However, we put the white bin beneath the blue chair, and it is a flat surface.
2	1368576000	I bought this for potty training my 2-year old daughter but she wouldn't use it.  However, all kids are different in their potty training likes/dislikes, so I'm only saying it didn't work for us.  She preferred using the seats that go on top of your normal toilet seat or the type of potty chairs that had a lid to close.  She liked the idea of closing the potty lid.
4	1368576000	I went ahead and bought this chair for my 9 month old who was having a hard time going #2.  Whenever I see her making &#34;the face&#34; I quickly strip her down and set her on the chair and she does her business!The only things that keep this from being a 5 star review is that I don't care for the splash guard hump in the front, and it's unnecessary since I have a girl, and it makes it harder for her to get on and off the chair.  And she loves to take the white potty part out of the chair all the time.  (This is not as gross as it sounds, because we use potty chair liners so it IS clean.)  So it would be nice if there was a latch or something to keep it together until it's time to dump.  Also, those liners are lifesavers!  Highly recommend them, even though we generally try to avoid disposable/plastic bag type things.It does have a nice rubber pad on the bottom which helps keep it from scooting around and the high back/sides makes even the littlest ones feel secure while sitting here!  Overall, I say it's a good potty.  Save your money and don't buy all the fancy ones that have too many distractions for the little ones.  This one is simple and streamlined and affordable. Buy it!
5	1368403200	My son and I both love this potty chair.  I like that it's only two pieces to clean.  We have another potty chair that has a pull out cup that you need to dump out and it gets really gross in that pull out part and it's hard to clean.  This potty, you just lift out the bowl, dump and that's it.  A quick wipe with a clorox wipe and it's looking good :)  We also like it because the splash guard isn't so difficult to work with.  The other potty has a splash guard that folded up and it was hard for my son to sit down around it and he would get upset.  The babybjorn potty has a build in splash guard that does the trick and doesn't cause any discomfort to my son (so he would actually want to sit on it!)
5	1368403200	easy to clean, easy to use, simple enough that my son doesnt get distracted & uses it like he's supposed to
4	1368403200	I started potty training my son at about 14 months, and he is short for his age.  This potty was a pretty good height for him, so it was comfortable and not too high, and it still fits him at 18 months.  The guard in front forces his legs apart a bit and is high enough to catch most of a boy's unpredictable flow.  Also wipes clean easily and doesn't retain any stains or odors.
5	1368144000	we got this chair for our son to learn to use the potty. its sturdy and comfortable for him which is great. i like that the bowl is big enough that there is no spraying on the floor and i can actually see when he goes as opposed to him standing up for me to look. its easy for him to get on and off of by himself which is another big plus. i LOVE how easy it is to clean, much easier than the other potty chair we have which is 3 separate pieces.it may not have any fancy extras but it gets the job done!
2	1368057600	The splash guard is not high enough for a boy and the seat is very small.  He is not a large toddler but he is 25 months old. I am sending it back and continuing my hunt for the right potty.
5	1367971200	We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase.
5	1367971200	I have found this seat to be the most comfortable for my 2.5 year old son since it has a high back that he can lean back on. The tray is also very easy for him to pick up and dump in the toilet himself. We actually have two of these since we live in a two story house and he will not sit on the toilet even with one of the those kid seats.
2	1367884800	I like the look of this chair. It is easy to clean. But there is a design flaw. When my son stands up the plastic potty part sticks to his legs and dumps contents out. Very messy. There is nothing holding the collecting cup on the base. I am going to have to buy a different potty.
4	1367798400	nice potty is easy to clean and looks alot like the adult potty so helps eliminate confusion. has worked well so far.
3	1367452800	I got this for my two year old so we could begin potty training. He HATES it and refuses to sit in it. It seems like the chair sits too low to the ground so his legs have nowhere to go. The design seems solid and it appears to be high quality but we will be shopping around for another one.
5	1367366400	The size is perfect for our bathroom (which has about 4x4' of walking floor space), and the shape is great. It has a nice &#34;splash guard&#34; on the front, so I'm not worried about the little man peeing over the top. He has yet to use it successfully, but he has been interested in it since the day it arrived! Training techniques aside, it's a solid little training seat.
5	1367280000	This potty is wonderful and perfect for boys. The design is incredibly simple and easy for the kid to pick up the bowl and dump it in the toilet, then return it to the chair. The little shield in front blocks the spray that can occur with little boys. We have two potties in the household and this is superior by far.
5	1367280000	fit as expected,,my baby love it .This potty chair doesn't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties. But is the best. When i was shopping for a potty, i read the reviews and then went to the store to &#34;explore&#34; for myself. i wasn't convinced of any other potty. why? 'cause all the others either didn't sit sturdily on the floor (and this is w/o a child sitting on it)or were difficult to clean. This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done, comfy (my picky daughter never complained, she likes the teddy bear logo on it), and so easy to clean. Never had a spill too. Besides, potty training should be as simple and natural as possible, so choose a simple potty. i have 2 of this item (1 downstairs and 1 upstairs, now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car).there's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too
5	1366675200	This is a solid piece and holds up well. We are in the throes of potty training and have had success with this product. Nothing seeps out...
5	1366588800	This is the only potty chair we used with our little one.  We didn't use bells and whistles.  We didn't use stickers.  This was all she needed.  It was very ergonomical for her little frame.
5	1366588800	We have really only played with it so far, but it is a nice sturdy plastic an seems to be steady.  My daughter is on the tall/skinny-side and the height is a little low, but it seems to be fine.
5	1366502400	Live the color options, the style and well thought out design of this potty. My son is 27 months and fits on the bjorn potty just fine.
5	1366416000	When I started potty training my child, we purchased this. We also purchased a book on helpful hints on how to start potty training. Between the two, it went great! The tips in this book were amazing! I posted a link below if anyone is interested. It really helps![...]
4	1366416000	I have boys and the raised front made it easier to keep &#34;potty&#34; in seat and not on the floor!  It's easy to clean and comfy to sit on
5	1366329600	This works good for a little boy. He's kinda chunky, but it's a good size for him and I don't have any problem with the urine guard not working.
5	1366329600	My LO doesn't mind sitting on this at 7 months (we're starting EC) with a toy or a book and we're good to go. Has great support. She was a little hesitant on day 1 but now does not mind at all although I still hold on to her. Easy clean up and very durable. I'm tempted to get one for downstairs for convenience sake.
5	1366156800	This is perfect for girls.  (I don't have a boy so I cannot say).  My daughter loves it.  It is easy to clean and the guard on the front prevents many messes.  Love it
5	1366070400	My son is 29 months and we have tried the flip-down toilet seat that is part of the adult version and he attempts but nothing happens.  Tonight, the potty chair arrived and within 10 minutes of him sitting on it, he pooped and peed!  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself!  I think it is because he can touch the floor really well and because I don't have to help him hold "it" down.  I am so proud and happy that I purchased this seat!
5	1365811200	Love it! Our boy loves it! He uses his potty every day. I recommend this to all parents potty training. This saves plenty of money on pampers.
5	1365811200	My son is 21 months,big  boy,he's not able to sit on other potty at the store because they are too aSmall for him. But this potty is big enough and sturdy for him, and easy to clean.
5	1365811200	My daughter is now 6 month old and she likes to pee and poop on it. It works very well.
1	1365724800	I bought this potty chair for my 15 month old little boy who has already started to potty in the big potty with help and loves it. I thought he would love his own potty, so I bought him this one based on the great reviews. Unfortunately he can't sit on it by himself because the splash guard is in the way. In addition his favorite thing about it is that he can remove the inner potty part and spill the contents all over the place. He figured that out right away and it has been a struggle to keep him from making a mess each time since. That may be fun for baby, but it's quite stressful for mommy!
5	1365638400	Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training. She has low muscle tone, so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her, and this one does the trick. She seems very comfortable sitting on it, I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position. I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth, without many little creases, nooks or crannies where, um, germs might get stuck -- so it's very easy to clean. That's a relief for me!
5	1365465600	We already have one exactly the same babybjorn potty but we figured we will need one more when our younger babies grow-up. The potty is very comfortable (it seems like) and the material used is very good. My kids like to use it.
5	1365033600	This is a great potty seat for toddlers. My son (17 months) has enjoyed practicing on it. I love that the chair is two simple parts that are easily cleaned. My son has a little trouble figuring out how to get on it with the hump in the front but that's not a big deal to me... I'd rather have that then the removable pee guards that they play with or lose.
5	1364947200	I love this potty, we have one upstairs and one downstairs.  My son doesn't mind using it, it is incredibly easy to wash, get one!
5	1364947200	This is the best potty chair for cleanup and for comfort for the little guy.  It is a little higher and wider than others so it fit my three year old well (and he is quite petite).  Also, the middle section stays put and doesn't stick to the bum if my little guy is sticky or wet like the other potty chair that I own.  I would highly recommend this!
5	1364947200	Portable:  We used to sit it in front of the TV when my son was being difficult to train.Easy to Clean:  There aren't many pieces and it is all plastic.Sturdy:  The base is wide and the bowl fits snugly into the baseThe only down side to this (for me) is that it was a bit small.  My son is a mini-giant!
5	1364860800	I bought this for my son when he was four months old. Yes! And he is number 2 potty trained!
4	1364860800	i like it. It is simple but fits the purpose). The only complain I have was that you have to make sure to position your child well (especially boys) so you do not have to clean around after he is done. Since this is the only potty we tried I am not sure if this is a &#34;all-potty&#34; problem
4	1364688000	My 17-month-old really likes sitting on her potty. It is just the right size for her to sit with her feet flat on the floor. We've used it for a couple months now and she always gets on and off it really easily. When she first started sitting on it she seemed a little uncomfortable, but I'm pretty certain that is due to the nature of the seat, not a fault of this particular brand. It's also reasonably small so it doesn't take up a bunch of space in the bathroom like some potties do.
4	1364342400	Bought one of these for &#34;grandmas house&#34; to match the one my granddaughter had at her house...right in time for her to pretty much out-grow it.  Good value for the money.
1	1364342400	I originally bought this item because of the high rating but soon found out that seeing/trying is believing. My son is 28 months and 3 feet tall, he has a strong stream when going potty and it goes EVERYWHERE! I have to keep a towel under the potty to clean up the mess, every single time. There isn't any kind of space to "catch" the urine, it's just an angled wall. so.. when your boy is sitting proud going potty by himself, he just pees all over. It is terribly frustrating. I will be purchasing another brand for my boys. Too bad because this would be an awesome potty for a girl.
5	1363824000	This item is great for boys.  It has the extra splash guard needed for pee wont pour out for the boys.  My son has only used it once, and decided that he was just going to use the one that actually sat on the toilet instead. So maybe his sister will start to use this here in the next couple of months.  Would recommend this to others and if i need to would buy another one.
5	1363824000	The seat and back support is great. The pee blocked is really just right. It's easy for our son to get up and off it on his own. We have a couple others and this really works well
4	1363564800	This chair arrived on time and is a bright pink color that I love. My little one loves to practice sitting on her potty. Not using it quite yet but will be ready soon!
5	1363564800	Design is simple and works well. My daughter does not seem to have any issues using it, and clean-up is easy.
5	1363392000	I was looking for a potty that was big enough for my son who was almost 4 years old and weighed about 35 pounds when he was ready to be potty trained. This potty worked great! He was able to get on and off the potty by himself. The potty compartment that holds the pee and poop comes right off, making clean up easy. The side of the potty raises up and my son holds onto it for additional support. The potty is very sturdy. Good construction.
5	1363305600	Great little potty.  Arrived quickly.  Nothing to assemble.  Easy to clean.  Sturdy but light weight.  We also love the green color we chose.
5	1363046400	Little guy loves it and it's easier to keep clean than some of those multi-part, animated potties.  Definitely recommend - we have 2 at home and 1 at Nana's!
5	1362960000	Perfect fit for those tiny little legs and bodies.My grandson loves it and he fits comfortably on it.I was worried since he is a smaller two year old but its just perfect!
4	1362960000	Shield at front of seat seems to be too tall but all else is good.  I have to lift child on & off.
5	1362787200	I love this potty chair!My son barely used it, just for the beginning month of his potty training but it had many very nice qualities and I would recommend it highly.The color is pretty and the chair is cute. I like my bathroom to look nice and it didnt bother me to see this in there every day.The skid rubber on the bottom really hung on to the ground well, even in those times when some bath water had gotten on the floor. It is very stable and wont move around on you or your toddler.the design is simple, which means that clean up is simple as well. the removable piece just comes out and is a breeze to clean.The high back and sides make it safer for wiggly toddlersI loved everything about this and am glad I shelled out the extra money... not only that but when it was time to sell it I got a decent amount of money for it because its a name brand and they are so expensive
5	1362787200	Nice looking potty, white insert is removable for easy cleaning. Cute color, yellow lining on bottom of potty. And is BPA free!!!
5	1362787200	Simple design that is comfortable for my little guy and easy to clean ,its not cheap plastic and is very firm and there's rubber on the bottom so it won't glide around when your child gets on or off.overall a good product and I'm satisfied
5	1362528000	So far it has been great. MY daughter can get on and off on her own. It is simple and easy to clean!
5	1362528000	This is really great potty chair for kids.The size is perfect for both boys and girls.It DOESNOT have seperated piece for boys like a lot of other potty, so it is easy to use.It is really easy to clean, sometime I didn't know that my boy pees in it, and next morning I just dump it and rinse with water and it gets clean agian, no stain at all.
5	1362441600	We actually had one already but my son insisted on having the SAME one for at Grandma's house...so we bought another. They are great potty seats, and actually come up far enough in the front to be helpful for a boy.
4	1362355200	When my then 14 month old daughter started to sign "poop" and then within minutes would start going in her diaper, we knew that she was ready to start potty training. It took me almost 2 weeks of researching different potty's, reading various reviews (good and bad) and then finally deciding on this one. Our little one took to it immediately (not to mention the 10 potty books she had to read helped quite a bit too).Eventually, she would say "poop" and we'd rush her to her potty chair. I read many reviews on this one and I took any reported problems that parents had (of both boys and girls) into consideration. I was nervous about her accidentally sitting on the splash guard or watching for her bottom having a red ring after sitting a while or the seat sticking to her bottom whenever she tried standing up and spilling pee everywhere. Honestly, I haven't had any of those issues. Her bottom does have a pink ring on it from the impression of where she was sitting on the potty seat, but it's not like it's sore or that it's an actual bruise. I get one too whenever I use the toilet, so can't really understand why parents complained about that.This is a really good potty seat. It has a rubber bottom edge so it keeps the potty chair in place. It has a tall back support and some armrests which is really nice. The little inner potty cup is easily removed and cleaned instead of needing to pick up the whole thing.I didn't give it 5 stars because the potty chair is kind of short. My daughter is petite and I'm surprised that she's still kind of tall for this. I think it's still one of the best potty's out there.
5	1362355200	I ordered the red babybjorn Potty chair for my 20 month old son bc after reading TONS of reviews on all kinds of 'cute, characterized' pottys, this one read up to be the perfect Potty chair for my little boy :) it was the ONLY one that had zero complaints about the splash guard for boys , meaning, it was actually able to do its job! Therefore, there is no splashing of urine except into the removable potty bowl! Which in turn means less mess and hassle of cleaning up after ur dear child finally goes p in his new potty! So u really can get excited and praise him/her after their accomplishment! AND..the babybjorn potty chair is the BEST when it comes to cleaning..2 simple pieces, so no multiple areas/crevices that can collect yucky stinky urine gunk! ;) and also the back  the potty chair is higher than other potty chairs , and also has to built in arm rests! This is so comfortable for my little boy, and he loves sitting on it! Just give him a book, and he's good to go, literally!! mfortable for my son and he loves sitting on it! I'm very glad I purchased the babybjorn potty chair. And they come in an array of brilliant colors; we got the red one which is so vibrant, but still simple but classy in ur bathroom! They also sell the step stools to match ur color potty chair for when ur lil one is ready to stand and brush their teeth!
4	1362355200	My three-year old grandson uses it; I clean it.  it's stable, easy to clean, and there are no parts to assemble.  It's all good!
5	1362009600	We got this to help us with elimination communication on our 6 week old. She really wasn't digging the in arms position and we weren't feeling confident holding her in it. When we first got this it was hit and miss if she would like it. Because she is so small still and can't sit on her own and the potty is a bit big for her to lean on the chair part, we sit her very close to the front and hold her upper body up. I realized when she has been bundled up and then we take her potty she didn't like the cold plastic on her legs. So we bought some leg warmers and problem solved. Now she is 9 weeks and on good days we are happily catching most of her potty needs. Right now we keep the potty on our bathroom counter facing the mirror and some lotion bottles, she's loves looking at herself and reaching for the bottles while going. When she's older we plan to keep it on the floor so she can reach it by herself.
5	1362009600	i like this potty chair it s nice , small, and functional..the most important part that u can take  off the small middle portion of it for cleaning, and my baby liked it as well, since he can use it without our assistance..and he put it actually in living room and set on it while watching tv, lol
5	1362009600	Very sturdy, easy for child to use and removable section makes it easy to clean. Plus I love the pink colour!
5	1361836800	Just got this potty today and my toddler did #1 the moment he sat on it. He enjoyed sitting on this potty so much that he actually tried forcing to do #2 :) I never even tried to potty train him, he is attached to this thing the moment I took it out of the box.
5	1361836800	This is perfect for my 11 month old! We were working on Elimination Communication quite seriously for a while & were doing great with it. Life got a little chaotic & we're ready to get back to business. Now that she's bigger, this is truly the perfect chair. I've had her sit on it a few times & she seems alright with it so far. Wish me luck!
5	1361836800	Great chair. I have twin two year old boys who are just learning to use the potty. So far so good. Love the splash guard. It's also very easy to clean.
4	1361664000	This is a very nice potty chair.  It is a sleek, simple design, easy to clean, no annoying sounds or other bells/whistles.  I ordered it to get my child used to sitting on the potty (not starting training yet).  I have a small (18 pound) 1 year old and this seat was just a little bit too tall.  I ended up ordering the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty, which is a very similar design without the high back/sides, and it seems to be a much better size for my needs.  It appears that the bowls are interchangeable. I posted side-by-side photo of both of the potties for comparison purposes.
5	1361664000	My daughter is barely 11months old and we just decided to introduce her to the potty. She doesn't sit on it for very long, but she doesn't mind it. She hasn't used it yet obviously, but it seems easy to clean. I don't see any complications with this potty in the future when she does start using it.
5	1361318400	Works perfect and is the best size that I have tried so far. Easy for the child to get in and out of!
5	1361318400	This potty is sturdy, easy to clean and seems comfortable to my child. This is a great potty. Thank you
5	1361318400	Bought it for my 9 month old baby girl, she can sit resting her feet on the ground and her back and arms are well comfortable too. This potty will grow with her.
4	1361232000	Let's see...what to write about the potty. It is easy to clean, my daughter uses it, and it has held up well so far. I like it because it doesn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter didn't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks.  Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat.
5	1361232000	It took us 3 intensive days, numerous accidents that I wouldn't care to count and endless encouragement but we've finally potty trained our 22 month old son. Thanks to this comfortable chair, that doesn't scoot or topple and is really easy to clean. Just dump the stuff in the toilet , spray with cleaner, swish it in the bath tub and it's good to go again. We've never had a problem with spills either. I contemplated getting the summer infant stackable potty instead of this because of the cost but that seemed lighter and prone to moving on the bathroom floor. This has a rubber lined bottom to prevent such movement. Good buy.
4	1361145600	We got this for our 14 month old boy and he quickly got accustomed to using this. It is very easy to clean and is low enough to be very comfortable. He grew too tall for it within six months and we had to get him to the baby potty seat, which was another training curve. I liked the product.
5	1361145600	We originally bought a cheap potty training chair, trying for -months- to help start my son on potty training... and got exactly what we paid for. It was not sturdy, every time my son kept trying to use it, it scooted along the floor making him feel uncomfortable and insecure. It was unwieldy for him to sit on because it was more square-shaped and unnatural. I got to looking at the &#34;regular&#34; toilet and it's oval-shaped for us to sit down easier, why I subjected my son to the square potty for so long I don't know. The Baby Bjorn was perfect. The high back gave him something sturdy and secure as leverage to hold onto as he sat down. The oval shape made it easier for him to get onto the seat. The rubber lining on the bottom made it much more secure against our tile floor. Overall, within days of having this, my son was finally potty training like a champ. Don't spend your money on &#34;cheap&#34; potty training chairs.
1	1361059200	Isn't the first law of potty chair construction to contain pee?  This splash guard isn't high enough for boys and I can't tell you how discouraging it is to have a child's best efforts be thwarted by pee splashing all over his legs and feet.  Really bad.  I wish I could give it no stars!
5	1360972800	I had been defecating and urinating in my diaper for I don't know how long. It had become a minor embarrassment as my friend Sam abandoned this nasty habit and moved on to the use of underwear and the toilet. Mama and Papa were expressing some disappointment and confusion as I alternately soiled my new drawers. The bulkiness of the diaper was interfering with my new-found attraction to sleek-fitting garments and a more carefree lifestyle.Bonus: I am working this urine/feces for candy thing like a Wall Street trader on steroids.---as related to me by HFW
4	1360800000	I was very satisfied with the quality of this potty chair.  However, my daughter used it as a piano bench for her toy piano and nothing else.  Then one day I took her to a family restroom that had a little potty in it and she ran for it to go sit down.  I immediately bought her a potty chair that looked more like a real toilet and found that she actually was interested in potty training, she just didn't realize this chair was supposed to be a potty.
5	1360713600	Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't "use" them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the "talking" potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.
5	1360540800	After going through the potty learning process with 4 kiddos, I've got a handle on it. Wipe, Flush, Wash is easy to say, tough to get down pat. This is my 3rd potty seat. My first was a gift, handmade from wood with a slide in insert that was a huge pain to remove without smearing you know what everywhere. It was pretty, but not practical. The second was a cute little Fisherprice one with a fancy electric sound of flushing when you pressed the "silver" handle. The silver quickly wore off and all the cracks and crevices were impossible to clean.When bubs #4 was ready, I was looking for a new seat. One that was portable, easy to use, and most importantly, easy to clean. With all those small parts and tight corners, some pottys really lose their shine after a while, both figuratively and literally. After some research, I decided to purchase this one. I can honestly say that it is the only potty I love. :) Simple, portable design, bright, fun colors, and a comfortable, easy-to-clean seat certainly do make this the best potty EVER!The BabyBjorn is easy to clean, and it's contoured seat is the most comfortable I've seen. (Honestly, getting a potty learner to sit on something with a hole in the bottom is hard enough, why make the seat uncomfortable?) The side handles help them to "aim" their behind better, and the insert easily lifts out for dumping and detailed cleaning, and their are no corners, anywhere, for dirt to hide in. It's made of extremely durable plastic AND has a non-skid base on the bottom so it doesn't slip when your kiddo sits down.One word of caution: Although it is difficult for the insert to be placed incorrectly in the base, it is possible. When this happens your little one's bum may get pinched. This has only happened once in our 2 years of using this potty. Generally it falls into place easily.Buy it. You will not regret it.

5	1360540800	Very sturdy and has rubber to grip the floor so it is stable! The best part (and the main reason I purchased this potty) is that it is PVC and BPA free!! No harmful plastic in our home!
5	1360454400	just what we wanted!!!!  Description was right on.  My Grand child has truly taken to it.  It won't be long now!
5	1360368000	I like how it is a basic potty with no frills.  Currently DS is not using it yet, but I can't wait to get out of cloth diapers!
5	1360195200	This is great, partly because it's low-profile and doesn't take up much space, and also (best of all) because it's SO easy to clean!  The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution.  Even the white doesn't discolor over time.  The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile, so that's convenient.  I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small, simple quality training toilet.  For boys, the pee guard lip works pretty well.
5	1360108800	My son loves this potty chair, so much so that we've bought three of them in different colors, one for each of our bathrooms. The high back is nice and the seat seems comfortable enough. My son is potty training at 2.5 years old and we've been using the potty chair for several months. The high back helps guide him onto the chair correctly. We've never had a problem with him spraying over the top of the splash guard. It's nice and high! Additionally, the seat is easy to remove for cleaning, and we haven't had any issues with other areas of the chair getting dirty and requiring cleaning. The mess is contained nicely within the seat. My son can even pour the contents into the &#34;big toilet&#34; on his own without any spilling. Lastly, the base is wide and sturdy, and the rubber bottom keeps it from sliding when he sits and stands. We've tried several of the seats that fit on top of a regular toilet seat, but both of them wobbled and fit incorrectly, and my son is too nervous to use them. This seat makes him feel secure and confident while he's learning this new skill! Overall, we are very pleased and have recommended this potty chair to several friends already!
4	1360022400	I got this for my 11 month old because she was starting to tell us when she was wet and needed a change by pointing to her changing table or upstairs. Sometimes she would even tell us ahead of time. We are not planning to put any pressure to train at this age but we thought it would be good to have it on hand and get her familiar with it.To our surprise she figured out what it was for without a lot of fanfare and will go and stand on it or near it when she wants to use it. She doesn't use it every time, but has a handful of times and for sure is on the path to diaper freedom.Pros:Comfortable for the little one (she is about 20lbs)The inside comes out for cleaning and there are not any seams to gather gunk.Looks like a real toilet.Cons:Won't work as a seat on a real toilet.The back is smooth, slippery and tapered with no handle which makes it hard to grasp.Pro tip: If you are going to wear the inner liner like a top hat to make your child laugh, be aware she may try it on herself at some point. D'oh.
5	1359936000	My two year old loves this chair. We are just practicing sitting on it right now. It fits her well and it's easy for her to get on and off it. It doesn't slide around on the floor and she seems to be comfortable while using it.
3	1359936000	This thing is ok! It's kind of bulky! I do however love the fact that there is a non slip grip ring around the bottom.
5	1359676800	Fits my toddler perfectly, easy clean-up with the detachable bowl, very well put together.  What else can you ask for?
5	1359504000	We have two other potties (hand me downs, etc) and this one is far superior.  My son prefers this throne to the others and that says it all.  Easy to clean, no silly lid that falls down, breaks etc. and very comfortable.  Get one for your little pooper.
4	1359504000	Everything as expected, but now that I have it, it would be nice if it had a lid to cover when not in use.The other thing.... when a child gets up, the insert part has the tendency to stick to the child's skin, but it does fall down back within a second or two.
5	1359331200	This item probably doesn't need another review but  I have to say this is really an excellent potty chair. When my son was about 16 months we got him an inexpensive safety 1st potty. At that time we just wanted to introduce him to the potty and see what happened. He had a few victories on the potty but they were few and far between. He wasn't really interested in using it and when he did he often peed out of it because the guard was not at all sufficient which really frustrated the both of us. He is now 23 months and seeing that he was becoming more interested in the potty I wanted to try another model. I ordered this one and I told my son he was going to have a new potty coming in the mail, on the day it came I got him excited and we opened the box together. He immediately loved it and used it 4 times successfully within the next few hours. It has been about a week now and I swear this potty is magic. He loves it and uses it all day everyday with ease and success. Definitely a very worthwhile purchase!
5	1359331200	This is a great potty chair.  We have a frog potty in our upstairs bathroom and my daughter complains that it hurts her bum.  This is her favorite and she says it is comfy.  It's the perfect size and easy to dump and clean after each use.
5	1359244800	Our 2-year-old-son is being potty trained using one of these chairs in each of our bathrooms. He's very large for his age, around 40" tall and 37lbs. He fits on the chairs with no problem, seems very comfortable on them, and they have been working great for us. They're very easy to clean, and the splash guard is useful, although it's not a substitute for gentle reminders to point the, erm, "hose" down when he's sitting down to pee. The grips on the bottom seem to work well on our tile/vinyl flooring. Definitely recommend.
5	1358899200	This potty seat is perfect. My daughter is almost 3 so a bigger potty was necessary. I love the back on this as well as the splash protector in the front. Even girls can spray and make a mess! LOL My little girl picked out the green color herself and it's very pretty. It's easy and convenient to lift out the white part and pour the pee in the potty. The bottom has a good grip so it's not sliding all over the floor. Excellent product.
5	1358553600	Bought this in blue because I have 2 baby/toddler grandsons and figured for the excellent  price, it might be nice. It appears comfortable, tall enough-I was afraid it would be too short but it is not. It is easy to assemble-two pieces!!- and easy to clean. Some potty chairs do not have a contoured area in the front to accomodate little boys when they are sitting, but this does thanks to the design.  Now if I could just get more consistency of use by the 2 yr old!! :)
5	1358467200	I bought this for my daughter so I could start potty training her. This is a great chair and I would recommend it for anyone looking for pottychairs
5	1358121600	Love this potty seat! My son showed zero interest in being potty trained but as soon as he saw this he dragged it out of the bathroom by himself and said pee-pee mama?!  He's been using it every day since for the next 3 weeks.  Good stability, easy to clean, has traction on bottom for hardwood & tile floors, good price point and comfortable for my 2 yr old to sit on.  He'll sit there for an hour or longer if he could and doesn't want to get up I actually have to fight him to get off it and he NEVER sits still.  Great seat.  I deff. recommend it.
5	1358121600	It is a very sturdy, and easy to clean potty chair. Not alot of parts, cracks and crevasses to clean. Easy to wipe down and keep clean.
3	1357948800	because while i liked how it looked my son didnt want to use it. i ended up with an elmo potty that flushes. he doesnt seem so interested in that one either. but the bjorn borg is very expensive for what you get. it is at least very sturdy.
5	1357862400	We started out with theSafety 1st 1-2-3 Teach Me Training System in Whitethat was given to us from a friend. Well my son couldn't even sit on it without screaming bloody murder! It was pretty crazy, actually.. He was about 10-11 months at the time, and the only thing I could figure was that either the hole was too big and hurt his bottom, it was too tall to sit on it correctly [he's usually in the 10-20ish % for height] OR he just couldn't balance his weight because of it. I heard several recommendations for the baby bjorn from other moms. I was able to find them at Target and Babies R Us to see them in real life, as well as a similar version by baby bjorn that was maybe 2cm shorter but had no 'back' to it.We received the larger version off his Amazon wish list for Christmas, by this time he was 13 months but size hadn't changed much. We tried sitting him on it several times right after opening and we had no issues AT ALL. He had no problem sitting and keeping his balance. He could also stand up easier by putting both hands on each side of the backrest, much better than the other potty we had. I will update more when potty training is in full swing and it gets more frequent use. But so far so good.
4	1357862400	I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better. Its smaller and more easily stored away. Other than that this one is easy to use as well, inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well. it's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well.
5	1357603200	This is the cleanest, simplest and most efficient training potty out there.  It doesn't have silly bells and whistles, but rather gets the job done well and fits my son comfortably.  It's super easy to empty/clean and doesn't distract from my clean decor at home.
5	1357516800	This is the most sturdy potty chair I have ever seen.  I highly recommended it.  The high back is perfect for long and comfortable encouraging sits.  The variety of colors to choose from is excellent.  I got this for my 1-1/2 year old grand-daughter. Parents have already introduced it to her and she had a good response.  More on the progress later!Great buy folks!!
4	1357344000	This works better then any chair I tried for my 18 month old son (3 total).  The seat is long enought to fit his butt, and the cup is tall enough to stop the mess, the back keeps him from falling off the back, the rubber keeps the whole thing in place, simple clean up.  However, I wish it also closed to a stool, my daughters did and she is 6 now.  We still use it as a stool in the bathroom.  It just seems that it would be nice if it grew with the kid.
5	1357344000	We love this cute little potty. My son loves it too. I really like the front part that comes up slightly for boys and its easy to clean as well.
5	1357257600	This is a great potty chair. It is simple but cute, doesn't take up too much space in the bathroom, and is very easy to clean because of the removable inner potty. The splash guard works really well for a girl, and we've had no leaks. Be careful, though, since the inner potty can get stuck to the child's bottom and create a mess if he/she gets up too fast. We learned this the first week, but since my daughter learned not to jump off her potty chair excitedly when she is done, we've had no accidents.
3	1357171200	The potty chair is easy to use, too low to the floor,  just not tall enough for my 2 1/2  year old grandson.
5	1357171200	I am very pleased that I went ahead and purchased this potty as opposed to what  I usually get at the local Wal-Mart. This potty is a great size and shape for my girls. I primarily use this for my youngest (now 7m) for EC, however my oldest (2.5) who is almost done potty training likes it also and has used it several times! I like the high back, makes it easier to keep the baby seated, and my oldest seems more comfy having a higher back to lean against. Am probably going to get another to keep at the grandparents' house. Would definitely recommend!
5	1357171200	Perfect.  Just what we were looking for. Simple, easy to clean, fits easily in any standard bathroom. Potty training, here we come.
4	1357084800	Works like a charm ans is easy to clean!  Granso even asks for it by name - i.e., &#34;Potty&#34;  This works very well and assists with potty training.
5	1356998400	This is an excellent first potty for a toddler as they are going through potty training.  My son loves this potty and the color.  He feels that it's his &#34;special potty&#34; and has taken to it very easily.  The fact that it's &#34;his own&#34; has made potty training a breeze, as he loves the experience of going completely on his own on a poty that's his favorite cover.  The little guard on the front ensures that there are minimal accidents and the plastic surface makes the potty easy to clean.
5	1356998400	I started using this when my son was 13 months, and the high back is perfect for smaller children.  He's 19 months now and still very comfortable using it.
5	1356912000	we havent learned yet to use on it but i love the color and looks nice in the rest room and
5	1356739200	We had another potty that was given to us and i now know why, it spilled everytime she used it. I bought this seat and never had an accident. The back of the seat is highly and the front is just right that there has not been any on the floor. Would highly recommend!
5	1356652800	I loved this thing. Very high quality made, has an attractive look. I will be ordering more stuff from this company.
3	1356652800	This helped our kid potty train faster, it really came down to going to the bathroom at specific intervals in the end but this did help although it wasn't a must have.
5	1356566400	This is a great potty for potty training.  I use this for my 2 year old, and it's a good size for him to sit on.  It also has a pee-pee guard (I'm sure there's a technical name for it), so he doesn't spray all over when sitting down.  It's very easy to pull the white part out and clean it with each use.  It's also very, very light, so I can carry it up and down the stairs to different bathrooms.  Good buy.
5	1356566400	We've had this for 2 years now and its an excellent product. My son is 5 already and he still using it because its in his bedroom and he doesn't have to go all the way downstairs to pee if he doesn't want to since there is no bathroom upstairs. I love how I can just remove the insert and take it down with me on my way down, its small enough it can be rinsed out in the sink. So we use it long after he's potty trained its just a useful little thing, and portable if you need to take it on a trip or somewhere. My only regret is not buying it sooner. This would make an excellent gift for a baby shower!
5	1356393600	I did plenty of research before ordering this chair and I'm glad I did.  This chair is great and my daughter has been sitting on it off and on all week.  Every day she is trying to get better at being potty-trained.  This chair is great, ESP. For the price!
5	1356220800	my son loved this, it was sturdy, easy to clean, great 'splash&#34; protection in the front, i would highly recommend this to anyone who is potty training their kids, great for boys and girls!
5	1356134400	We used this for both of our boys and am glad to say they are now successfully trained.  This is a low price, high quality option.
4	1355961600	Bought this for my grandson when he comes over. It's lightweight and easy to move. He seems to like it. The plastic shroud in the front is great. My only concern is that it could be bigger. If you have a boy and get this system, you'll learn what I mean.
5	1355875200	I love that this potty blends in well in the bathroom.  White just like the adult sized toilet.  My daughter really likes to sit on it and we are just starting the potty training with it.  Seems very easy to clean out.
5	1355875200	We bought this potty to train our daughter off diapers. At first she seemed like she was avoiding it. Then one day (just about 2 years old) she started asking to go to the potty by herself. It is easy to clean. It is stable. It is easy to move around the house and most importantly she likes it.
5	1355875200	kid friendly.....the right size for little bottoms and I sent it to my grandchild ......just in the nick of time.
5	1355788800	Compact, friendly to the toddler.  My two and one-half year old grandson likes to empty the bowl himself into the toilet, and it rarely spills.
4	1355788800	My older son would ONLY use this potty, which we had borrowed from a friend whose son was older. We moved and gave it back to them, as they had another younger boy and needed it. It is SO GOOD for boys especially, b/c the splash guard is HIGH and pee doesn't wiz everywhere. Also, it is SO SIMPLE to clean (just two parts) from an adult perspective. So, I bought this for my younger son (now 2.5 yrs and potty training) BUT, my younger son isn't really that into it. He sort of likes the other (cheaper and actually more annoying & more messy) potty. So, long story short, it's a good potty, especially for boys, but every kid is different and (as my older son says, &#34;Mom, kids like what they like...&#34;) each has their own opinion (especially 2 yr olds!), so you never know if this will be &#34;the one&#34; they want to use and get trained on!  GOOD LUCK with potty training!
5	1355702400	Our family is just starting EC (elimination communication) with our 5 month old son.  I take it back, we're coming back to it after a break due to some other events in the family that just made it too challenging.  While this potty isn't making the whole EC process any easier, it's certainly making it more pleasant for everyone involved.First off, this potty is wonderfully small, which makes it ideal for our purposes.  At the same time it's big enough that my 3 year old can sit on it and could quite likely use it, not that he does.  He prefers to use the toilet like a big boy, but I can see this potty being useful for long-term use in our family, and both for larger and smaller children.Our second favorite feature of this particular potty chair is the back.  We had looked at other potties without a back, but this one makes it ideal for our purposes.  Our little guy can sit on this potty chair on his own (closely supervised, of course).  Potty time is more enjoyable because he can lean back and won't topple over off the potty, which means our little one finds it so nice.  He much prefers it to using the toilet or another receptacle.  He particularly likes to sit on it while holding on to my knees, or to sit with his feet propped up on that rise in the front, putting him in a more classic EC squat without needing someone to hold him in that position.  This allows me the ability to sit in front of him easily to hold his hands while he sits, or as he seems to prefer, holding my knees while between my legs while I sit on the couch in front of him.I can imagine for EC purposes this may be challenging for potty time with a younger baby as the back could get in the way, but I think it could be managed to potty the baby while facing the back of the potty chair similar to the way you would sitting in front of a full sized toilet.  I can't comment on how it would work for a younger baby though as we got it when he was so much older.Overall, for both EC purposes and more traditional potty time, this potty chair is great.  It's pretty light, easy to transport, and easy to clean.  While it's not as small as other potty chairs that may be more convenient for on the go, it's easy to move from room to room as need be and could easily enough be put in the back of a car to be taken on the road.  We're probably going to look for a travel potty solution that may work better for traveling, but for the time being we can make this work.Since this potty is so small and incredibly stable (our 3 year old and 5 month old can both sit on it securely without knocking it over) I can see this potty being useful for not just the EC baby, but also for a smaller child learning to use the potty.  Small toddlers may find this ideal because it's such an easy, convenient size for self-directed use.  Both my boys love this potty.  For my family it was a great investment.
5	1355702400	We have been through a few different potty chairs, and this particular model from Baby Bjorn is our favorite!  It is big enough and sturdy enough so that it doesn't get knocked around by toddlers, but also not too big or obnoxious to look at.  It doesn't have the lights and sounds some of the others do, but we had those and a) they broke and b) our kids lost interest in them after a few weeks anyway.
2	1355184000	This potty is good if your child sits still and doesn't move and if its a boy can aim perfectly.  We have to clean up the potty whole seat inside and out ( not just the removable parts the seat underside and all) along with the floor at every potty time.
5	1355184000	We love this potty!! We're doing elimination communication (&#34;EC&#34;) with our daughter so we started &#34;pottying&#34; her almost as soon as she was born.  Because we didn't know any better at the time, we first used a toilet seat reducer or just held her in the infant-in-arms EC position. Luckily, at around 4 months, we found this potty and have never looked back.The high back is perfect for infants who aren't able to sit up yet fully unsupported. We still needed to closely supervise, as she would sometimes lean forward and, once, she took a dive and ended up bruising her forehead on the bathroom floor. I blame myself fully, as I had looked away momentarily. Now that our daughter is older (11 months), her feet touch the ground, so she's much more secure in the seat. She still needs close supervision though, as she likes to try and stand up out of the seat.I also love that the insert is easily removable. We just flush the &#34;contents&#34; and rinse the insert out with water in the sink. Every now and again we'll let it soak in warm soapy water, but if it's washed right away after use, it stays quite clean.All in all, this is a great potty and we're very happy with our purchase. Thanks Baby Bjorn!
5	1355184000	After attempting potty training with a different potty chair, this one is a dream. The first one we had was a chair that doubled as s tool. It had a very limited splash guard and the seat was completely flat. My daughter wouldn't have anything to do with it. When we finally got her to sit on it and use it the pee went everywhere! We bought this chair and she will sit on it and pee! Right out of the box she did! It is more ergonomic than most of the chairs out there and the splash guard is high which helps fight messes!
5	1355184000	I had read that this was the best potty for little boys. My son loves it so much he doesn't want to get off it. A boy and his 'throne'. We are very happy with it.
3	1355184000	Our almost 3 yr old boy prefers the toilet with the babybjorn seat this fits onto toilet seat. He prefers flushing and using the big boy toilet.We will take this in the car for emergencies
5	1355097600	This potty chair has far exceeded my expectations.  I now have two in my home.  The two most important characteristics of this chair are that it&#8217;s very comfortable and easy to use for the child, and SUPER easy to clean for the parents.  I would recommend this potty chair to any parent looking to make potty training as simple and easy as possible!
5	1355011200	Very happy! Its a must have if you have a boy! This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done!
4	1354579200	I gave this as a gift at a baby shower.  The mother likes it as well as the baby!  Simple to use and clean.
5	1354492800	We have been loosely potty training, at my daughter's discretion (self-lead...working beautifully) for a little over 6mos, and recently she has become very independent about it all -- she literally holds up her hand to stop us from following her to the bathroom to use the potty sometimes!  We have always just had a cushioned training seat on the big potty, and had recently gotten a potty seat with an attached "step ladder", but she had trouble getting her pants down safely once she was up there, so she couldn't REALLY go and do it by herself.  I thought I would give the floor-potty a chance, and got this one.  She immediately said "I want to go pee pee!" and so I showed her that she couljd stand on the floor, take off her own pants/pull-up and go...she did, and the potty is super sturdy, it's the perfect size for her tiny little hiney (she's only 23.6lbs at a little over 2yrs!), and she had no trouble at all getting on or getting up...the "arm rests" were a great way to help herself get back up - might want to consider that if you are considering the smaller Bjorn potty chair.  It emptied easy as pie, and was ridiculously easy to clean and sanitize...but once I did that, she grabbed it and put it back in the shipping box...she just prefers the seats on the "big girl potty".  Otherwise, great little chair, for sure.I would mention, the "lip" that is there to prevent issues for little boys or "forward spillage" during a pee, might prove a little tough to maneuver or might get a little boy caught on it...I'm sure they have to be high enough to actually prevent the spill/splash, but this one took my daughter a moment to get over the little hump, and being a girl she doesn't even have the "extra accessories".
4	1354233600	We used this through two kids and while they both only used it for a short period of time it was very easy to use and clean.  Not a lot of nooks or crannies so you only had to wipe it down.
5	1354147200	Loved it so much we bought another - one for both floors of our home. My son played with all the noise making potties and chose this one on his free will. I like the rubber grip for the bottom and that it doesn't have all the frills because in all seriousness its a training potty who needs frills or noises
5	1354147200	I have a 3 year old son and 2 year old daughter both potty training.  Due to multiple moves, my son was interrupted in his potty training and we thought we would have an issue with resuming it.  However, he loves this potty! He does use a regular toilet as well, but he loves that this one is low to the ground and not as shaky as his big potty.  It can be pushed over if they lean up against the higher back area but it has not tipped over yet.  It is still safer than the seats on the larger toilets.  My daughter immediately showed interest in the potty as soon as she saw it.  She likes to sit on it just for fun.It's easy to clean, lightweight and fairly stable.  The green is much nicer in person. Looks more akin to the VW Beetle's green color.  Very fresh looking.  It's also small enough to not take up too much space in the bathroom. My husband and I are very happy that we purchased this product.
5	1354060800	It's really durable and simple. I bought it in red so u could continue to use it or a boy or girl. Comes from a trusty brand.
5	1353628800	When our first daughter started potty training, she immediately picked out this pink potty seat and we really have no complaints about it. It does not tip over, it is super easy to clean (which I'm sure is important to most parents!), light enough to be fairly portable, and as comfortable as a potty chair can be I suppose. In fact, my daughter does not mind sitting in it for long periods of time which definitely helped during the whole potty training process. And actually we liked it so much that we ordered a second one for my younger daughter even though she's not quite ready to be potty trained yet. We had previously ordered the little bjorn potty chair for my younger daughter, but that one doesn't have any back support and is almost too lightweight. If it seems weird to write a review about a potty chair it's only because this turned out to be so essential for my daughter throughout the training process. Seriously, the whole potty training thing is such an ordeal anyway, you don't want to have to deal with any subpar products along the way. This bjorn product is just what we needed to get the job done.
5	1353456000	Our 16 month old loves this potty. It has been easy to clean and he can sit comfortably in the &#34;chair.&#34;
2	1353369600	We had been struggling with getting our 3 1/2 yr old to want to try and potty. I looked at all the potty chairs possible and read reviews and this one sounded perfect. So I got my boy excited about this one and let him pick the color out. He was so excited when it came and wanted to sit on it right away (this is what I was hoping for when I bought it) he probably wasn't on it more then 10 seconds and said it hurt his bum. We tried several more times and same thing. He is an average size toddler so I am not sure what size of kid this would be comfortable for. I ended up getting next the babybjorn toilet trainer and it is awesome. He loves it, it doesn't hurt him and the splash guard is great for a little boy.
5	1353283200	I wanted a pot for boys and one that could be used for a healthy (chunky) child. My son used this pot for the entire potty training process. He had one at home and at both grandparents houses. The pee guard did its job and the size was great for my "chunky" little one.
5	1353283200	My son loves this potty chair! We had another but the pee guard wasn't up high enough to keep him from making a big mess everytime he used it. The gaurd on this potty chair is one solid piece apart of the area he goes in, so the guard can't pop off. We tried potty training 6 months ago, but it became such a hassel with the other chair that he didn't want to use it. With his new Baby Bjorn chair we're having no problems, he actually wants to use it.
4	1353196800	I LOVE that this is "healthy" materials - HATE that it sticks to my sons bottoms when he stands and in 2 cases pee everywhere (one other case POOP EVERYWHERE!)I will keep the 3 that I purchased for him, but I did purchase one wood potty that I like much better too.Just trying to keep healthy the best we can.  I guess nothing is perfect...
4	1353110400	My daughter loves this potty. She is 17 months and we are just starting to introduce her to the potty. It is sturdy and bright. She can sit in it for a while, even if sometimes she doesn't do anything in it :-) I just wish it had a lid, it would make it a little easier to keep her from throwing toys into it.
5	1353110400	This potty chair is awesome! I have had this chair for about two weeks. I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter.  I also purchased Leslie Patricelli's "Potty" book in the same Amazon order. When the box arrived, I took it into my daughter's room (I had already cut through the tape) and we opened it together. She was so excited. We took this right into the bathroom, so she could see. I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the "Potty" book is on a stand next to her potty chair. She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I didn't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays. I have been trying to get her to say the words "potty", "poop", and "pee". She hasn't said any of those words yet. However, she is starting to comprehend the words. She loves sitting on this chair and reading her "Potty" book. On an even better note, she has peed twice in the past two days, while sitting on her potty chair! I was so impressed!About the chair:It's so perfectly simple! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into. The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard, but it's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated. So far nothing has splashed onto the floor. The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet. The bowl doesn't have anything to lock it into place, so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning. As the description notes, the design is ergonomical and stable. The chair is high, wide, and well-curved. It would be difficult to tip over.On the (barely) downside. The seat is hard plastic and doesn't seem comfy. However, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children don't try to take the bowl out.
5	1353110400	I researched which potty chair to purchase for our 18-month old daughter. This one definitely came with high marks, and I can understand why. It's simple, yet comfortable. Not obtrusive looking or frightening. Comfortable for them to sit on and easy to empty and keep clean. We started out by introducing our daughter to it by unwrapping her new potty and letting her play with it (clearly before she ever used it for its intended purpose) in the living room. We found 4 excellent potty books for her to read. She carted the potty around and got used to using it as a chair first so she could learn how to back up to it with out a problem. Then we moved the potty into the bathroom and have now designated as solely a bathroom potty. We know the whole potty training process will take some time, but I'm very pleased that she's used it at least twice since we moved it to the bathroom for its intended purpose. We will buy the exact same brand for our next child if this one is too worn out. Excellent.
5	1353024000	I got this potty after reading reviews on all the potty's on Amazon. What a great potty. My 18 month old son loves it. He is just starting out with his potty training. He pooped and peed on the second day of training and just loves the idea on sitting bottomless on this potty. He has had zero issues with it and I have no complaints. Great potty!
3	1352937600	My daughter is still only 18 months old, so perhaps I should wait a few more months before writing this review. However, I wish I'd bought a potty seat (BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Black) instead of a standalone potty for the following reasons:1. My daughter is terrified of this seat. I'm not sure why, but it is the only thing I've ever tried to sit her on that makes her cry and which she refuses to sit on. She hates it, and I'm not sure why.2. She definitely knows what it is. She comes into the bathroom to me and points at it and says, "Potty." every time we go in the bathroom. However, she stays clear of it. I think the hollow seat and restrictive sides may be traumatizing to her. She is much more interested in my potty.3. Now that I know all of this, I also see the benefits of a potty seat from a clean up perspective. If she'd prefer to use the adult potty, I won't have to clean up poops by hand like I would with this one.All in all, I thought this would be preferable to her than a potty seat, and I was totally wrong. I think I'll re-sell my unused potty, and buy a potty seat which will be easier for me in the first place!
5	1352937600	That's a very good product, I find it from amazon and all things that everybody write about it was good. I recommend it to. Because it's for my boy, and front of the pottery trainer was hight. Nothing splash out. I love it.
5	1352592000	When I first looked to get a potty, I asked a few friends with kids who had potty trained, and they said a seat is a seat, there's not too much difference. The first seat I bought, I just picked based on price, and the fact that it could double as a stool, and it works just fine. I then had someone hand me down this seat and realized how much better it was than the other that I had. It is simpler - only 2 pieces, no moving parts or ways to get pinched, like with the other one. It was easier for my daughter to sit on - the back, plus that splash guard guide her to sit in the exact correct spot so she is aimed over the bowl (the other one she moves around on it all over the place and sometimes doesn't sit in the right spot). Finally, she likes to empty her own bowl into the big potty, so this makes it much easier to do that, I have to help her with the other potty...although I realize this might not be a benefit to some families! I really just like this one a lot better, the quality is clearly higher.I have to say, my daughter is small, and after reading some other reviews I see it might not be good for very large children, but from my experience it fits her fine and she will not likely outgrow it!
5	1352505600	We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!
5	1352419200	This potty is simple, tough, and great for a boy. Helps keep the pee in, and won't kill his "bits" if he gets caught on it while sitting. It is easy for a child to take the bowl out, empty it into the toilet and put the bowl back into the frame.
5	1351728000	Easy to clean, attractive, nice back and side support and a safe urine catcher.  What more could I ask for.  Son likes it and the Potty book I got to go with it is great too.
5	1351641600	My daughter started using this at 6 months. All her poops goes in it everyday. She loves it and looks very comfortable on it
5	1351555200	I bought this chair as a second potty for my 1 1/2 year old daughter while I potty trained my son. I already owned a a white one for him.The great part of this potty is its simplicity. The high back is genius. The 2 piece design is perfect. My wife thought my son would like a "car" potty. It broke down into 4 pieces. My kids tore it apart playing with it.
3	1351209600	Easy to use and removable tray for fast cleaning. I like it how it's portable. I also like the high backing which gives my kid the back support when using the potty trainer.
5	1351209600	This is a great first potty. Our son can practically jump into it and it doesn't wobble or tip, even on carpet. He likes to be able to lean on the back and uses the sides of the back to help sit down. I was so glad we got the red version - the first thing he said was "Elmo's potty!" when we opened the box! It is so easy to pop the bottom out and clean the bowl, since it doesn't have any edges it wipes down in seconds. Also, this was the potty that had the tallest middle piece for little boys, tall enough to catch the pee without being so tall that it gets in the way. However, sometimes little boy pee has a way of going over the top, anyway. I would definitely recommend this potty to start, and also the Bjorn seat insert for later. They make very dependable and easily cleanable products for little ones.
5	1351209600	we used this for a short time and eventually it just collected dust. there's options out there that aren't as clunky if your taking it to go.
5	1350777600	My daughter loves this potty. She actually thinks using it is fun. My wife and I have bought a few other potties that just didn't work that well. This one is perfect. We are so happy we bought it.
5	1349308800	I purchased  this potty chair after researching and reading reviews for the most popular ones. I was concerned about comfort, how easy it would be to clean, and if the shield was tall enough so that my sonwould not pee overit onto the floor. So far, he loves sitting on his blue bear potty and has peed in it several times!! It is so easy to clean and there are no small crevices that would be hard to clean out. The bottom of the seat stays put on the floor and keeps my son from moving it all around the bathroom scooting it. It is small and fits great in our small bathroom, but still plenty big enough for my son who is 27 lbs and 33.5 in tall. He will still be able to use this potty for awhile! This potty chair is definitely worth the price and I would and have recommended it to friends! The only thing I would change about this seat would be to have all these same features but still come apart to have the seat sit on the big potty and be used as a step stool, but there are several seats that already offer that. I am so happy with this potty that I don't really mind that I need to purchase another seat for the big potty and astep stool. For now, this seat is perfect for my little one :-)
5	1349049600	Awesome!!!! My son who is 40lbs and only 2 years old can't fit onto any other seat. Plus this one is soooo  great for boys, there is plenty of space and the guard in front makes it really easy!!! I love it!!!
5	1348704000	Highly recommend this for training potty. Have a little girl and it has been so easy to use and teach with. Easy to clean and move around. No problems with splash back either.
5	1348617600	I tried the Cars potty, like this one:The First Years Disney Pixar Cars  Rev and Go Potty Systembut all my son wanted to do was play with it - colossal fail! Then, I tried a potty seat that fit on my toilet seat, but it required so much help from me that it removed the biggest motivator of all: being a "big boy". When I put this potty in the bathroom - my son immediately recognized that this was like "Mommy's potty" and sat right down! He has loved it ever since! He is comfortable sitting for long periods of time due to the shape, contours and material. It is a DREAM to clean - it gleams such a shiny white when wiped up with Clorox wipes. Such a breeze to clean, my son sometimes even cleans his own potty. He enjoys dumping his bowl into the big potty and flushing it. My next step when he gets a bit bigger will be to get a great stool like this one:The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stooland a toilet seat like this one:KOHLER K-4732-0 Transitions Quiet-Close Toilet Seat, White. But for now, this is all that a three year old needs! The pee pee barrier is wonderful - not too obstructive to mount but keeps pee from getting everywhere. And I love the non skid bottom. Overall, I rarely give products five stars but this one deserves it! Like the Puj tub, it is on my list of baby gifts forever!!!
5	1348099200	Great purchase! My son loves this seat. The splash guard is high enough for little boys who are learning to stay seated the entire potty experience. ;) The bowl in the middle is easy to remove and clean. I would definitely recommend this potty to any of my friends.
5	1348012800	I purchased this seat when my firstborn was a toddler. I'm guessing he was around 2.5 years old.It came with 2 pieces: a base and a cup.The base has a wide, stable bottom on it to prevent tipping and a nice back on it. There is rubber on the bottom to add stability and keep the potty from sliding across the floor. There are no sharp corners  - just curves which are very easy to keep clean. There is a hole in the base; the cup is set into this hole, overlapping the edges. The edges all slope towards the cup so any liquid drains into the cup.The deflector is not removable; it is all one piece with the cup. I LOVE this design. It is smooth so that it will not scratch tender body parts and it cannot get lost.The cup is removed from the TOP of the base! With my other potty, I had to turn it around and remove the cup from underneath the seat. If my toddler ever tried to empty it himself, he ended up making a big mess. With this potty, it was a lot easier for him to empty it without spilling.Having the cup on top also means that he is sitting on the edges of the cup. There are no gaps or tight corners for pee to get into. The deflector could be a little higher in our experience, but it wasn't too bad. I think if it was taller, it might be annoying for a girl so I can understand why it is the height that it is.An added bonus is that this potty chair is not an eyesore. It's rounded corners and pleasing colours are easy to look at.
1	1347840000	Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.  If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time.  Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell.  Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip.
5	1347408000	I love this potty.  Because it only has two pieces to it, its easy to clean.  The high pee-guard means no need to supervise when my son is using it. We don't ever have any splashing incidents.  Like most stand alone potties, it is very small and low to the ground so I don't anticipate being able to use it for much longer.
5	1346803200	It shipped fast and in perfect condition (new).  My little baby boy sits on it and seems very comfortable and with no problems. Perfect height, easy to clean and affordable. I highly recommend it and comes in many colors.
5	1345680000	My 13 month old has started to use the potty so I bought this chair and it's a perfect fit for her. I tried a different one and she couldn't quite get her feet to the ground. I feel like this is a perfect one. And I love gray!
5	1345507200	We started elimination communication with our daughter when she was five months old so we needed a potty that would give her support since she couldnt sit up on her own. This potty was perfect with the high back . We would place a hand on her tummy so she could Not fall forward but with the high back she was able to lean back and be comfortable. This potty has a non-skid bottom which is perfect for counter tops or wood floors. Some may think it  is a little bulky when traveling and we have found that if we go to camp we just take the insert with us and she just uses that. We are very happy with this product our daughter doesn't seem uncomfortable when using, it securely stays put when she is using it, and easy to rinse out reusable insert. We love :-)
5	1345420800	My daughter loves her personal pink potty. It's the perfect size for her (2 years old). It's very easy to empty and the surface of it is exceptionally easy to clean. The back on the seat is nice for when my daughter is having a longer potty experience, she just leans back on it.We have a fairly small bathroom but this potty fits with no problem!
5	1344988800	Our son loves this potty.  It was delivered quickly, it washes easily, and it is simply wonderful.  Only positive things to say about this potty.  Highly recommend.
5	1344816000	I purchased this because my son 4 uses the babybjorn toilet seat and it was such a great product. This is another excellent product from this line. It seems to me that my children are more comfortable on products from this line so to me it is worth the extra expense.
5	1344470400	This is a great little potty chair.  I like its two piece design, and how easy it is to empty.  I like the high back, and so does my son as he likes to "lounge" as he uses it.  The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess, but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs.  I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son can't scoot it across the floor.  All in all,  I would probably buy this chair again.
2	1344384000	I used this with my son, and it served it's purpose. The only problem is that its really uncomfortable. He complained about it, and my daughter absolutely refuses to sit on it for more than a second and complains that it hurts as well. So while this may be a good product, it just doesn't work for my children. If you want something comfortable on the heiny, this is not the one. Back to the drawing board...
3	1344297600	Although this potty did get my son interested in using the potty for a short time(because it was something new) the pee guard for boys does not really protect any accidents from spilling over, it is just a raised flat piece but I think it would be better if it had a lip to help keep the pee in the toilet.  It is made nicely that is why I did give it a 3 star rating but I just would not recommend to any of my friends with sons.
5	1344211200	This is the best potty on the market. Two seamless smooth pieces makes it easy to clean, and the splash guard is smooth unlike others which have rough edges. Compared to the Bjorn smart potty, my son prefers this one. We use the smart potty for traveling and grandmas house. This one is larger and easier for my son to get off.
5	1343606400	It seems like I've tried about every potty chair on the market.I had my son pick the color he wanted and in 1 day it was here!After months of resistance, he saw this out of the box and asked to have his diaper taken off.The pee guard is so much better on this seat.  It keeps the pee in the bowl AND doesn't crush my son's privates.Hooray for BabyBjorn!
5	1343520000	LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to "point it down"... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!
5	1343260800	Great for 18 month old.  Cleans easy w/ no seams or crevices to worry about.  Lifts up and sets in easily.  Love the rubber around the foot print to stop from sliding or "driving" potty around tile floor.  Very lightweight but doesn't tip over easily when little ones are practicing getting up and down.  I have two - one for each floor of the house.
5	1343001600	I first got this for my 6month old son, after reading the "Diaper free before 3" book. In India, the grandmothers start potty training the babies well around 4-5 months when they start sitting with support. In the same aspect, I got this chair just to make sure my son sits on the potty chair when parents use the bathroom and it worked very well. I am writing this review since I dint see any other reviews for kids as young as 6 months.The first day, as soon as me and my son got up, we went to the bathroom and sat on our own potty chairs, surprisingly, he peed in this, on the first day only! From then on we are repeating it every day and he seems to understand he has to pee to get out of that chair and hence does it. He likes to sit on this one, as it has the backrest, and armrest for both of his arms and his foot has not yet touched the floor but, its good enough for him. In a way, its good that his foot has not touched the floor yet, as he doesnt try to stand up :-). He has one of his squirty friends or a book in his hands to keep him happy. Even if he tries to reach for something on the either side, the chair doesnt trip and it holds well.Every single time, I put him on this, any time of day, he pees assuming thats what I want him to do. Pooping, we have not started yet, but so far it has been easy to clean and the splash guard does work great, remove the inner seat and wash it in warm water, and its even sanitized!Its been about a month since I got the first potty and here I am ready to buy my second one for the bathroom on the first floor. I got the Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty but he doesnt like it since it has no back or arm rest! He wouldnt sit on it even once, and its going back to Amazon today while I order my second potty chair!
5	1342396800	My son and I love this potty. I never had a hard time training him to use it. In fact, I only told him once what to do, and he was using it since then. He seems to be very comfortable with it that he seems to actually enjoy sitting on it while making poo and playing his toy ramp & cars at the same time. He also likes using it without doing something else so I know its not about the toy. He loves that he can be independent & his potty makes him feel that. My son is 2 years old and weighs 32 lbs. Cleaning is also very easy, even without a liner. This happens when my son would use the potty on his own without a liner. I only have good words to say about this potty. I have no complaints at all.
5	1342051200	My son is a very tall three years old.  We have been trying to get him to use the toilet for the past few months and we were meet with nothing but resistance.  I bought this chair because it was taller than most, it looked comfortable to sit on and most importantly, it would be easy to clean.  When the chair arrived he was excited that it was HIS chair and sat on it for a few minutes.  The very next morning he asked if he could sit on his potty chair.  So we did.  Nothing, but he was obviously enamored with it. (I had promised him that he could decorate it with stickers) He insisted that we take it to my mom's house and later that day, unprompted, he peed in the potty.  We were so excited! Now imagine how it was later that evening when he actually pooped in the potty, again unprompted.Now I do think that my son may have been afraid of our very tall toilets and didn't like the fact that he had to have help getting on and off. Little Mr. Independence is now doing it all by himself.  Yes! THIS is THE chair you need to get!  I am one happy, happy mommy!
5	1342051200	I love how easy this is to clean.  There are very few grooves for grime to stick.  Also looks great and matches the bathroom.
5	1341532800	We've been using it for my son since he started being able to sit (around 7 months) and having used it now for a few months I just bought another one for upstairs. No regrets here.
4	1341446400	Sadly, this product arrived warped and wouldn't sit stable on the floor. Had to box it back up (um, bulky) and send it back.Found it locally and purchased. Love the product itself now that it sits safely and securely. Easy clean up due to the lack of creased and only 2 smoothly molded parts. Would purchase again.
5	1341100800	At 9 months my baby is already using this potty in the morning.The potty is sturdy, comfortable and very easy to clean. I really like this product, it is well made and the baby feels safe when sitting on it.
3	1340582400	I love the back to this seat and the splashguard for my little man, but he is very uncomfortable in this seat.  In fact, he holds onto the sides with this arms straight so he can hold himself up off of the seat.  I assume this means that the seat digs into this bottom and could use more cushioning.  Since we're just starting to potty train, I want to encourage him to want to sit on the potty, so this is not working for us.  Continuing to shop around.
2	1340496000	I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY.
5	1340323200	I bought this potty chair for my 11 months old. He loves to do his business in this little potty. He used this potty 4-5 times a day with his grandmother's help!And as far as I know, both of them are very happy with the product!Great buy!
3	1340064000	The front deflector does not come up high enough for a boy. He pees right over the top and onto the floor.
5	1339891200	This potty was perfect when my daughter was around 12-15 months. She's over 2 now, and still uses it on occasion, and now she can take out the bowl and dump it herself into the big potty. She also likes to put her dolls on it when they need to go potty. :) It's a great height, seat is a good & comfortable size, bowl comes out easily and cleans easily.
5	1339718400	This toilet has worked great for both my daughter and my son (from ages 12 mos to 3 yrs). I've used 4 different children toilets and have liked Baby Bjorn toilets the best. Works great!
4	1339286400	This is a much needed tool for potty training! The only thing we would change is the "potty guard". It should be higher so that it covers the private parts on little boys. Sometimes we end up with a mess.
5	1338940800	Since we practice elimination communication we looked for a potty that would work well for a young child who just began sitting with no (or very little) support. We started using this when our LO was 5.5months old. From the age of 6.5 months or so, our LO was really comfortable on this potty (it was OK earlier, but only for very short duration). It is very steady, and super easy to keep clean -- you just take out the inner compartment and wash it out. We are very happy with the decision to go with this model.
3	1338508800	this is my first time writing a review but felt I should put my experience out there. I bought this potty chair bc it looked nice and seemed like it would serve its purpose well. But after heavy use for a week I found that it sticks to my daughters thighs and one time stuck hard enough that when she got up the cup toppled over spilling pee everywhere. Nasty to clean up. otherwise it is easy to use and empty but the sticking was annoying enough that I am now looking for a new seat for her to use
1	1338336000	This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money.
5	1337904000	It is very simple...but really comfortable, this is our second potty and I bought it for our second bathroom, my son feels so comfortable and safe that I moved it to his bathroom, putting the Fisher price Elmo potty in our guess room...the cleaning it is great and my almost 3 year old can do it by him self...As a suggestion don't go for the potties with too much paraphernalia choose a simple design one you won't regret....
4	1337040000	This is working great for us.  So far she's pee'ed (spelling?) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here.  Definitely a great product.
5	1336867200	This is a great potty chair!  It is simple, easy to clean, and nice looking for a potty.  Contains messes well, even with a boy.
3	1336435200	I bought this because my current potty will not catch my boy's urine.  The reviews for this said that is was good for a boy.  It is not, unless your boy naturally hangs down.  My boy points out.  I miss the potty chair that I used for other son 13 years ago.  It had a soft and perfect deflector that worked perfectly.
4	1335830400	Other than the fact that this potty chair doesn't sit flat on the floor, I love it (and so does my son). I guess either this one was made wrong or the plastic got too hot and warped at some point before it got to me. It's a great little potty, and keeps my two year old son's "tee-tee" from spraying out all over his pants and down onto the floor. My son is a skinny little guy, so his bottom is very small. I had a tough time finding a potty chair that he wouldn't fall through the hole, but this one is just right!  Again, my only issue is that the bottom portion of the seat that touches the floor is not flat, so it wobbles and rocks back and forth when used. It's not my floor, because I tried it on various surfaces, including my counter top (which I'm 100% sure is flat). I think it might be a flaw in the one I purchased, NOT a design flaw. Perhaps the reason it's selling on Amazon is because it's a "Quality Control reject" from the factory?? I would still recommend this seat to friends.
5	1334793600	I wanted a potty that my daughter would feel secure and comfortable in so that she could actually focus on the reason why we were having her sit on the potty to begin with!  This potty was perfect!  I love the high back and sides.  The seat comes out and is so easy to clean!  I also appreciate the rubber around the bottom that keeps it from sliding on the tile floor.  She can easily get on and off of the potty without it tipping too, which is a comfort to me!  The only "complaint" I would have is that it is hard to hear when she pees (which I listen for because I'm trying to praise and reinforce this).  I don't know that a singing potty would have really been a good thing for my daughter, but I think it would have been a helpful cue for me!  :)
4	1334620800	I just bought this potty and the first time my 20 month daughter saw it she said "potty" and promptly urinated in it! Can't beat that! Looks very comfy too.
2	1334620800	I bought this potty chair after reading reviews on many potty chairs. My daughter had red marks on her bottom after sitting on it.  The seat is hard and rough. Sadly disappointed by this babybjorn product.
5	1334534400	Wonderful! It was exactly what we were looking for - no more pinched legs or bottom! He actually likes getting on his potty chair now.
5	1333324800	So tired of all the products with sounds and lights, etc.  Love the simple design, easy to disinfect, easy to put in the car, and yet big enough for chubby little bums! (have had size issues with other types of potties)
4	1333152000	It is well made potty but my son's pee is all over the place except potty. I dont know what to do in order to keep pee where it should go. Front part may build higher.
5	1333065600	This is a great chair.  Very sturdy.  The white piece in the middle easily comes out so you can empty the contents when needed.  The bottom of the chair has a non slip rubber so it stays in place.  Materials seem high quality.  The shape of the chair seems to be comfortable for my child.  I give it a thumbs up.
4	1332633600	I love the simplicity of this potty.  It doesn't have a bunch of distractions, or anything to 'scare' a toddler.  My only issue is that my little girl always wants to pull the little bowl part out and wear it as a 'hat'.  She has yet to potty in the chair, but I'm nervous that when she does, she will still pull it out, and make a huge mess.  I didn't consider that before I bought this.
5	1332460800	I've been deciding betwieen this one and the smaller version, and I'm so happy I went with the one that has taller back support. I started using it with my 5.5 month doughter and she loves it, she seems very comfortable on it. We've been using it every day, for over a month now. She goes between 5 to 11 times a day. I still get to change 2-3 wet diapers a day, but for the past 16 days she went #2 only in her potty and not even once in the diaper.It's very easy to clean. Perfect size. Love it.
5	1330905600	I just love this potty. It is the only potty I've found for my 2-1/2 year old son that is both easy for him to use and SUPER easy to empty and clean! We had been using a different potty with a cushioned seat for awhile before realizing the cushion was soaking up urine, yuck!! This one is so easy to clean; I can't say enough good about it.
4	1330041600	My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations.
5	1329782400	I love this chair- it's a lovely shade of blue.  I don't think it's any cheaper than I could purchase at Target, however, that would be the only (if any) downfall.  It's the perfect size for my 18 month old son, and he will grow into it easily.
5	1329782400	It seems comfortable to sit on it. My baby loves it and starts to try to sit on it often. It works great for us to do training.
1	1329436800	I don't know if it's the pressure from my daughter sitting on the chair, or if she has an allergy to the plastic, but since we started potty training with this chair she has developed a horrible horrible rash. By process of elimination, and the fact that she has bright red stripes on her butt from where the plastic meets her bottom, we figured out it was the chair, and nothing else. She does have sensitive skin, but NOTHING would help her, and I tried EVERYTHING. We bought two and are returning both, and had to go with the safety first chair that has a cushion. If it weren't for the rash, I would give it a good review, because she liked it and used it, but the problems she has had are just ridiculous.
5	1328918400	We really like this potty chair, got this in pink color and it looks very cute. It's stable but at the same time very light. The back part is very comfortable i think, it lets ur baby lean back relax and concentrate on the important process :) also its very easy to clean, just take the white part out and wash it. We are very happy with this product.
5	1328918400	I was looking for a potty to use for baby potty training, he's 6 months old and in the 25th precentile. I saw that some people commented that it was small, which is what i was actually looking for, and it works great for us. The back is great, he can sit on quite comfortably, so long as I entertain him!He has used successfully, and it's really easy to empty. I just add some water if needed and flush it, the seat just lifts out.There is an imprint on his bum after he gets up, but he doesn't seem to mind.Here's a tip: since he still pretty short and his feel don't reach the floor, I use something to put his feet on for leverage, and it really helps. The baby wipes container is perfect.
5	1327190400	We have used many Potty seats. By far, this one is worth the buck! My daughter is now 3 and started using the potty at 2 years old. She showed an interest. We were so concerned about using Elmo and something fun and forgetting what "practical" meant and "usable" for a 2+ year old. I have Babybjorn upstairs and downstairs in our home. My daughter loves it. She is getting a bit older now for this potty as she has grown, so we are looking for a good step stool for our toilets. If you are looking for a potty, this is the ONE TO BUY. The pee does not get out of the potty, its easy to clean and the shape of it works great for when they sit.
5	1326499200	We bought this for potty training for child #2.  It's the best thing around.  With our oldest, we bought the chairs with all the gadgets, gimmicks, etc as well as some others.  Hands down, this simple, easy-to-clean, comfortable chiar is all that's needed.  Best you can get!
3	1326499200	love the high back and easily accessible to dump and clean. the front is skinny enough for him to sit with his feet positioned nicely. what i dont like is my little one keeps saying his bum hurts and doesnt like to sit on it. when he sits for more than a few seconds and gets up, he has a red mark where the plastic touches his bum. he opts for the real toliet, even though it is awkward for himto sit.
2	1326240000	While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable.  My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time!  He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat.  Wouldn't buy this one again...
2	1324771200	We bought this chair when our daughter was 12 months old because her doctor said she was ready for potty training. We had been practicing EC and having plenty of diaper free time. She was using the words and ASL signs for potty training and had been telling us when she had to go and squatting. We chose this seat, because it had many great reviews and seemed simple and attractive, but this chair has set us back in training! She used it a couple of times with assistance, but on her own has hurt herself on it quite a few times. It's terrible for a younger toddler girl. Our daughter is now 17 months and refuses to sit on this chair. When she has to use the potty, she says she has to, then yells "no!" if you attempt to have her sit on this chair. The urine guard is VERY big and hurts her thighs unless she sits on it just right. The chair is also long and narrow, and can only be sat on from one perfect angle. We've had to go out and purchase another seat, the Hopop Donut. I believe our daughter would be much further along in her training if we'd bought another potty to begin with. Do not buy this seat for EC or diaper free training or for a young or small girl!
5	1324598400	I have had great success using this potty chair. The shape is what makes it the best. It juts out in front so that small kids can just back up and plop down onto it without any effort. Before I purchased this I thought it was a lot to spend on a toilet, and I guess it is, but its been worth it to me. Kids are so much more open to new things when it isn't stressful and when they can succeed early on without help; they want to be independent so badly. The type of chair with a lid is too difficult to climb up on and then turn around, etc. Its very easy to clean as the hat is removable, the splash guard is way high (and provides a handle for you to carry the hat to empty it). Also, its cute.  =)Oh, I noticed several of the low star reviews complained that the seat left a red ring on the child's behind. Having been a nurse for 10 years, I have helped hundreds of people on and off toilets and I can tell you that every toilet leaves a ring on every behind if you sit on it for more than several seconds. If you don't believe me, turn around and look in the mirror the next time you spend more than a few seconds sitting on the throne.
5	1323734400	We have this potty in green.  I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!!  If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child.  I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts.  It makes cleaning much easier.  No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean.  Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices.  I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!
5	1323302400	This is the best potty ever.  My daughter feels so comfortable with this potty and actually prefers this potty over her princess one that makes sounds.  When we first started potty training my husband bought her the princess potty which plays music when pee hits the sensors and she liked it but used it only a couple of times because she preferred her "white potty."  Great potty and love the back support.  In fact, we have to convince her to get off the potty after she's done going to the bathroom otherwise she will want to read or watch a video on it for an hour (if we let her).  Definitely recommend!
5	1320710400	I originally started with a small seat to put on the toilet for my toddler, but this works way better. He is able to sit in it comfortably and I don't have to worry about it tipping over. I like the white color so I can easily see spot and make sure its clean.
5	1320537600	Item as described. My grand daughter likes it she thinks it great just to sit on very comfortable for her to just it on. Not ready for training yet
5	1320192000	We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!
5	1319414400	My 20 mo old is on the taller side, and the potty seems a little on the shorter side. However, it is the most comfortable seat we have tried (I have 4 boys) and the least likely to leak. Overall, I am well pleased and would highly recommend it for anyone with boys.
5	1319241600	If you have a boy buy this potty chair. My son (3) uses this potty chair all the time and I'm happy with it. The pee does not spill out of the potty, every time he has used it he has never once made a mess on the floor. There is also room for him to grow. His bowel movements stay in the potty, I don't have to scrub every surface to clean out his BM. It is easy to clean, i just rinse it and then use a disinfectant wipe. Cons: My son wants to empty the potty after every use, he hasn't yet spilled anything, but if he is careless or clumsy their is potential to drop and spill the removable pot. Update(11/02/2011) if my son doesn't sit straight forward he will pee over the edge (space for legs to go). He has peed on the floor twice since he started using this potty, but compared to the other potty seats we've used and bought it's not a big deal. I still love this potty chair! I bought a second one as we live in a two story house.
5	1319155200	I have two different pottys. This is my granddaughters favorite. It is very easy to empty and clean. I love it.
5	1318982400	We just bought our second one of these.  We tried several different potties when training our oldest daughter, but the simple, sleek, easy to clean design of this one is superior to all the others we tried.  We keep one in the house (carrying it around to whichever room she is in) and the other in the car.  Would strongly recommend this potty!
5	1318550400	I have a son and this is perfect!!! He doesnt pee out of the potty and its easy to clean since it is solid plastic.  It isnt distracting like the cartoon pottys so he just used it for its purpose and that's it!!
5	1318550400	I have been looking at all different kinds of potties with my two kids and so far this one is the favorite (for all of us) !First off, it comes in so many colors they can pick from !Secondly, it is sooo easy to clean and keep clean. Only two pieces to the whole potty chair !Seat is very comfy for smaller OR bigger children.Spray guard works well, while still leaving room to teaching the child to point down.I have had more success with this potty then any other !
5	1318204800	The first time I put my 15 mo old on this potty, she peed!  She only has once since, but she does know what it is for now only a couple weeks in.  So far so good!  Would definitely buy this again!
5	1317772800	This potty is perfect for my 22 month old. I have had it for a few months now and she really likes to sit on it (even though she hasn't gone in it yet). She looks very comfortable sitting in it for long periods of time (which is where we are right now). I love the ease of the removal bowl. The size is not too big or bulky. I'm glad I made this purchase.
5	1317081600	I've decided to start my 9 month old on her potty training with just simply sitting on the potty and getting used to it. She has actually peed in it a few times and while she doesn't understand i'm hoping she'll be used to it by the time she does..anyhow as for the potty itself it is a perfect fit for my tall and skinny 9 month old. I did see some reviews that said it was too small for some toddlers and I can see that now that she has used it. It's got a far enough seat in the back as well as a perfect-height seat back that she can comfortably sit on the potty while I read her a book and wait..It is easy to remove the bin and rinse out and I don't have to worry about things getting into crevices and cleaning the whole potty. It's lightweight and has a nice slip resistant rubber grip on the bottom. I researched and read reviews for every potty and found that this was the perfect fit for us. I've decided to stay away from potty's that convert into a seat and keep the potty and toilet a separate experience. I'll be buying the baby bjorn toilet seat trainer when the time comes for her to use the toilet.
4	1316995200	Our three year old son immediately loved this chair (we ordered it in his "favowit" color green).  He is fairly tall for his age but can still sit in it comfortably and it looks like shorter children could as well.  My only complaint is that when he stands to tinkle, the urine inevitably hits the back of the seat and the design is such that it leaks underneath.  It's easy for us to clean because we have mostly hardwood or tile floors but I can wouldn't recommend this for homes with mostly carpeting.  I know our son likes to have his potty chair in various rooms in the house so it could make quite a mess.  Other than that, though, it's lightweight, easy to transport if needed, easy to clean/dump in the toilet and my son loves it.
5	1316908800	We have just started potty training my 33-month old son and he likes this potty chair very much. He loves it because his favorite color is red (his favorite car character is red), the cute bear(that what he said when he saw the potty chair first time) and comfortable to sit on it. I love the Babybjorn products and I love this potty chair too. No leaking,an integrated splash guard is working well and easy to grip the armrest when he stand up from the chair. And also the inner potty is easy to grip to remove and easy to clean. I'm very satisfied with this product. I would definitely recommend it!!
5	1316649600	I practice Elimination Communication (EC) with my child (boy). We started with this potty when he was 5 months old, and it has worked great. He wasn't quite able to sit up on his own at 5 months, and the high back provided both of us with a lot of security. (Disclaimer: I would NEVER leave a child this young to sit on any potty without an adult within arm's reach.)He is now 7 months. I sit him as far back on the seat as possible so all important parts angle down, and his feet still don't touch the floor, but he seems very stable and comfortable. The seat was also small enough for him at 5 months. I would definitely recommend this potty for anyone practicing EC or Infant Potty Training.
5	1316131200	My daughter has loved her potty. She is 10 mo old and has enjoyed sitting on it. The second day we had it she went pee pee on it and we are now a week into having it and today she went potty 4 times on it at 10 MO OLD! I am so glad we have our BABYBJORN to help us EC.
5	1316131200	I like the design and sturdiness and simplicity of the Bjorn potty and would recommend it to others. My 1 1/2 yr old is able to sit comfortably enough on it. He has not yet grasped the concept of actually using the potty, at this time he only sits on it, so I am not yet able to review how well it works for keeping the urine from splashing out when it's a boy baby using it. It is very sturdy and has rubber on the bottom edges to keep it from easily sliding on the bathroom floor. My son likes being able to grab the arm rests for support when standing himself up. It is easy to clean. I choose the white potty because it most resembles an adult toilet, and because I want to easily see any stains and be able to properly clean it once my son grasps the concept of "going potty" and really starts using it. When he starts really using it, I will update this review at that time.
5	1316044800	This is a pretty good design and we especially like the high back, which makes it possible for babies/toddlers to sit unsupported.
4	1314921600	Like this chair. It's small, convenient and gets the job done. The back rest really helps the baby. Would certainly recommend to others.
5	1314748800	My daughter is 6 months old and I decided to start potty training her:) best idea ever! the back support of this particular potty is great, since she cannot sit by herself all that good. It's great that you can remove the "dirty" part and not worry about the whole thing every time. I already started saving diapers, she loves sitting on it EVEN if she is on the move all the time. A book or the favorite toy also helps!
5	1314576000	This chair is the perfect height for our 14 month old grand-daughter.  She can turn and sit on it perfectly.  It is easy to clean and very light weight so we can take it anywhere.  Took her a while to get used to getting over the cup but has since had to problem.  I would recommend this chair for little girls.  Works very well.
4	1313971200	We have just started potty training my 22-month old, and haven't used this chair very much.  It is sturdy and doesn't look like it will slide on the floor or accidentally tip over.  It is a good size for a toddler and comes in lots of great colors. I bought this because I read many lukewarm reviews on the potty chairs that sing and light up and do fancy things like dispense stickers...we wanted something simple and basic, and this fits the bill. My only complaint is that the inner bowl, while very easy and quick to remove and clean, can be a blessing and a curse: when my daughter sits on it for any length of time, it sticks to her skin, and has almost spilled when she stands up too fast.  That is the only thing to watch out for.  Other than that, it is great!
3	1313625600	Pros: Super-sturdy, easy to clean, attractive (for a potty)Cons: Splash guard on front is not necessary for girls, and can be troublesome for younger potty trainers.  My daughter (a fairly young trainer) has a tough time navigating that splash guard on her own; she usually needs help to sit down properly on this potty.Overall: Probably 5 stars if you have a boy or a potty trainer who is older than 2.  If you have a girl, especially under 2 or small for her age, you might want to try other options.
1	1313280000	I puchased because of the great reviews but never really looked at the design. When my little girl tries to sit on her own she can miss and hurt her vagina or bottom on the front point. Does not recommend.
4	1313193600	My daughter is 18 1/2 months old and we just got our potty on Wed and by Friday, she had gone potty twice.  I read everywhere that this potty was the best and it is.  She loves to sit in it, it does not slip on the floor and is easy for her to sit down and get back up.  It low enough to the ground that she can play with some toys while she waits to go potty and doesn't have to get up off the potty to pick up something should it drop on the floor.  The only thing she doesn't like is the spill guard, but on her own, she turned the insert around (so guard is in the back and yes, does not lay perfectly flat, but works just as good) and has had no problem since (but this is why 4 stars and not 5).  Yes, this means she can't sit back and use the backrest, but she leans forward when she sits on it anyways.  The insert is super easy to take out and wash up.  We LOVE LOVE LOVE our fabulous potty chair!!
4	1312416000	We are taking a soft approach with potty training our 21 month old. He likes his potty chair and can sit on it comfortably, though isn't really using it much yet. Like the chair, purchased 2 of them in different colors, good size for tall 21 month old and easy to clean. I knock off one star only because I can tell the "splash control" on front for a boy isn't going to be perfect, but I think that is likely to be a problem with every potty chair out there...and no big deal since I plan to keep the potty in the bathroom only. If we do decide to take it to another room I will absolutely put something under it to protect the floors.
5	1312070400	Be for i bought my son his potty I did my research and I just knew this potty was perfect. When it was delivered i was happy. When my son saw it he was thrilled and took to it right away. But the good part for me is that the middle of the seat is just high enough to cover his wee wee and the potty is just short enough for him to sit on. His feet is touching the ground. Ps: i learned a little trick while potty training my 2 1/2 yr old. I let his big brother use the potty also from time to time tohe's 6. So my 2 1/2 yr old is like i wanna b like my big brother!.
5	1311811200	We highly recommend this potty, especially for boys. We have started potty training our 22-month-old son recently. When he was first introduced to the seat, he loved it immediately and sat on it to watch TV. This potty is very easy to clean b/c the insert is a single molded piece. No cracks & edges to trap anything. The guard works very well in preventing leaks. The high back provides good support for our son, and the high sides help him get up from the potty very easily by providing support as he pushes off the potty. Overall we are very happy with this potty. We have not tried other brand, but picked this one after reviewing customer reviews for the other brands. 1 improvement Baby Bjorn could add would be to allow locking of the insert. Our son imitates everything we do like any other kids would. B/C he knows we would take out the insert after he makes a deposit, sometime he would lift the insert up himself before we can get to it and spill on the floor.We just purchased a baby bjorn potty trainer seat, hopefully it will work out just as well!
3	1311552000	I run a children's consignment shop and this is the most popular potty to buy/sell second-hand. That said, there are two design flaws that I'd love to see fixed: One, when a boy pees standing up into this potty and hits the splash guard in the back, the urine runs into the cracks between the blue and white pieces and onto the floor. Why not make it so that the potty seat somehow slips *under* the blue spash guard so that the inevitable misfires are directed to the right place?  Second, the bottom of the potty consists of two edges with a void inbetween -- if the bottom edge were instead solid, it would prevent liquid from getting up in that void, and cleaning would be easier.
5	1311033600	We have a small bathroom so I was a little worried how this would fit in there without getting in the way, but it fits great. My toddler loves to go & sit on it & at 18 months has already did 1 & 2 in it! It's a wonderful simple design that makes it super easy to clean. Love the green color, I think the picture displays the color accurately on my computer.
2	1310601600	I bought this after reading many reviews for different products.  I am disappointed because my son cannot sit on it for more than a few minutes without complaining that his bottom hurts.  When he gets up his bottom is completely red.  If he gets on, does his business quickly and gets off there is no issue but anytime he needs to linger on the potty he becomes very uncomfortable.  I am now looking for a softer seat to set on the bathroom toilet.
5	1310601600	I got this potty for both my two year old and 9 month old girls.  I used the little BB potty for an older child and it worked great.  I love that their feet touch the floor when they use it.  It is easy to clean also.  This is a good potty to use at home for the beginner.  Highly recommend!
5	1310428800	After trying 3 other potty chairs finally found the correct one!!  The Babybjorn Potty Chair is stable and has lots of support and is very easy to clean.  Bought this for my 2 yr old Grandson and he really likes it.  He has no problem using it and we are potty training with great results.  I highly recommend this potty chair.
5	1310342400	This is a great potty. It seems very comfortable for my little guy.  He's only 9 months old, but we started potty training at 6.5 months. He loves it and stays put there.  Easy to clean.
3	1310342400	I wish I could give this chair 2 1/2 stars, but since I can't, I'll round up :).Pros: It is sturdy and does not tip easily.  It also comes in many colors and is aesthetically pleasing.  There are only two pieces (as other reviewers have noted), which makes the chair easy to use and clean.  Lastly, the white part is deep, which is important for #2.Cons: It is VERY narrow in the seat.  VERY -- as in barely-five-inches-across narrow.  This was a deal-breaker for us.  Our toddler son fits in, but his legs are wedged together and his thighs are pushed into the seat.  Our son is not yet two, but he's in the 90th percentile for height and 75th for weight, and every single time he gets up from the chair, the removable white part comes off with him.  If we're not right there, the seat will bump into something as he gets up and fall off, spilling stuff all over the floor.  The seat also leaves deep, red mark on his cheeks.  Additionally, the splash guard is not as high as other products, though, to be fair, this has not been an issue with our son thus far.  Lastly $30 for a potty seat seems rather high, though I probably would not think that if this had worked out better for us.We bought this seat and the Fisher-Price frog seat at the same time, and we like the frog one much better (it's almost 50% wider, just as sturdy, and 1/3 the price).  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), our son was fully dressed when we tried out these seats at the store, so we didn't realize how much the Bjorn chair would stick to him.  And if you don't have a big baby, this might not be an issue with you at all (in fact, there are so many 5-star reviews, that it's clearly a well-liked product).  I just wanted to put it out there for those of you with bigger children.
1	1310342400	We bought this chair for our son due to the high ratings it had, and we hate it. Our son complained that the seat hurt and we saw that it left red marks whenever he sat down. The splash guard in the front isn't hallow so when he did pee it went all over the place. My son freaked out because he didn't like getting his feet and chest covered with pee and we had a hard time getting him to sit on it again. We ended up getting rid of it because it was making potty training harder rather than easier.
5	1309305600	This is the only seat we have used so I can't compair it to other seats, but my son is 3.5 and uses this seat just fine the splash guard works and it is easy for him to sit and aim. I like the colors as they are not obnoxious and my son loves the teddy bear. Simple like a potty seat needs to be.
5	1308787200	My 23 months went potty on this by himself.I couldn't be happier with this product.Works well for me.
2	1308787200	Started using this with my son when he was 6 months old.  He refused to keep using it once he turned one and picked his froggy back up potty instead.  That was fine with me, because around that time his urine started to leak over the splashguard and get all over the floor in front.  This looks like a great potty and has awesome reviews, but it definitely did not work for us.  The curved top of the splash guard allows the urine to flow right over and out of the potty onto the floor.  Maybe if your son doesn't have a strong flow, then it would be fine.  But, for us, we retired this seat very quickly after a few messes.  I brought it back at 2 years, but we still had the same problem.  It is super easy to clean if all the waste stays inside.  This would probably be an excellent seat for a girl. My son seems to prefer the froggy seat though since it has little nubs sticking out each side to use as handles when sitting down and pushing back up to stand.
5	1308528000	I had a great experience training my son on this potty. It helped him get comfortable with potty training and within a week he transitioned to an adult potty. I think having a comfortable place to start really helped lay the ground work for his successful training.Pros:-Sturdy (never came close to tipping over no matter how much my son bounced and played around on it)-Easily removed potty bowl (Never easy for small hands to pick up, empty and replace)-Easily cleaned (The design is simple so there are no little cracks or wholes that are hard to clean)-Comfortable design (No sharp edges to make little bodies uncomfortable)-Easy to store (Because it is small, compact and comes in only two pieces it is easy to store)-Comes in a selection of colors (My son got to pick the color, and I think that helps children warm up to the potty easier)Cons:-Maybe a little small (my son was almost 3 when we potty trained him. The seat seemed just a tad smaller than would be perfect. It wasn't a problem, but that's the only thing that could be considered a possible con for this item)
1	1308441600	Unless your little boy has perfect aim, don't purchase this one. Leaks around the edge of the seat to the floor below.
5	1307664000	The BabyBjorn potty chair works very well with my little boy as the guard is excellent for blocking urine from getting out of the stool. My niece uses it as well and loves it.  It is a good height, stable base, easy to clean and I love that it has a back for their comfort.
5	1307491200	Don't think or look any more, just buy this one.  So easy to use, my son took to it right way.  That's after he had a not so pleasant experience with 2 others we tried first. This potty is lightweight my son can carry it from one room to another; super easy to clean no crevices to trap urine; and nicely designed.  No need for all the bells and whistles, they were distracting to my son too. He's been using it for about 6 months, now I just have to figure out how to transition him to the big potty.  BABYBjorn also makes a potty for that, which I will be buying too. Perfect!
5	1307318400	We bought a different, 3-in-1 style potty initially and boy, was it a pain to keep clean. This made it (and the bathroom) stink to no end. It also had a removable pee-guard that our son loved to remove and drop in the toilet.I LOVE how simple this potty is. Two pieces, plus a built-in pee guard (which our 18 month old has had no issues with). We haven't had an issue with him peeing out of the potty. I think the high seat back makes him feel more secure while he's sitting there doing his business. It also has no-skid rubber on the bottom, so no more scooting around the bathroom.Buy this, you won't regret it!
5	1306886400	This is a great potty chair. I like it because my daughter can carry it around the room and play with it without it falling apart. My son had one with a lid and it fell apart and was cumbersome every time he tried to move it.
1	1306540800	I bought this potty mainly due to all the positive reviews. It's a good size, sleek, and simple. Unfortunately, my daughter became so excited to use it that she ran to the potty and sat down on the splash guard, which is hard plastic. We ended up at the doctor with a laceration, and weeks of screaming every time she needed to urinate. She's never used ANY potty ever again, and she's 2 1/2. This product is okay for very small children whose parents  can seat them. For older children that will seat themselves, choose one without a splash guard. They will splash regardless. A little pee on the floor is better than a traumatized child and stitches. Trust me.
5	1304640000	We have started using this with my son who is 6.5 months old and it's a great size for him with room to grow.
3	1303948800	I wanted to love this potty. I loved the BabyBjorn Little Potty, which we still use sometimes (our baby is 9mo; we have been putting him on the potty since he was 6 weeks old). But this potty just slides around on the floor so badly, and the rubber on the bottom does nothing at all. As he's pushing it backward with his feet, I'm trying to hold onto the thing and keep him from falling off, while he then tries to stand up...seriously, it's like a circus. We're using this on hardwood---maybe it would work better on some other surfaces? Dunno.
5	1303430400	This potty is very nice. I bought this because of the sleek look, high back. It will work fine. My daughter turns 2 yrs old soon, I will then try her on it if she is ready.
5	1303430400	This is the perfect potty in my opinion. It isn't too big and its easy to keep clean (not a lot of nooks and crannies like the Fisher Price one).  I also like that it is very stable, it would be nearly impossible to tip it. I would definitely recommend this potty, buy one for each bathroom and to keep in the car for those inevitable emergencies!
5	1303344000	I bought this product too early for my baby to use but now that she is 2 she is teaching herself to potty. I have this in the restroom and when my child would see me use the toilet she decided she wanted to use her babybjorn potty and she actually is in the process of training herself. For now she only pees in it and she even empties it out by herself in the toilet and she is 2 years old. This product is cool she sits on it she does not fall in she fits perfectly even tough she is petite. It does not tip over its perfect. I love this babybjorn it is awesome there are no cons to this product.
4	1303344000	I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really can't complain.  My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it.  I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday.  I didn't make a big deal about it and it didn't seem to bother her.  I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad, just incase, so nothing got on my carpet.  But she seems very comfortable on it.
5	1303257600	My daughter has been using this since her tenth month. Although the potty offers no frills: no loud colors, extra thingamajiggys around but it makes her sit in her potty comfortably until she has done her business. She is now in her 37th month and this potty endures her daily output everyday. Since the design itself is so simple, the whole thing is easily washable when you have little accidents. She sits there for full 20-30 minutes at a time and there is nothing there to pinch her chubby legs or make her back uncomfortable when she chooses to lean. My baby will sometimes take her own by-products and dump it herself (she thinks it's fun). I have not gone wrong with any of the baby bjorn products. The shipment of this one was little delayed but amazon responded by sending another one immediately upon my complaint. Thank you. Your product has made potty-training much more manageable (it was actually the offer of using panties when you become a big girl that really got her motivated)
5	1302912000	My son is 30 months old and I was trying to train him on the big potty with the ring insert with no luck at all, he hated it. So I read all the potty reviews and this potty stood out as being the best, and it is!!! My son is a big boy and he fits on it perfectly. The pee guard works very well, so far no spray over. He loves sitting on it so much that he does it all the time. He will even pee when he barely has to, and it's super easy to clean. My son was completely trained after just 2 days, it was amazing, I never thought it would be this easy! There are a lot of cutesy character potties out there that talk to your child and come with all kinds of bells and whistles, but this simple design ensures that your child will use it as it was intended and not think it's just another toy to be played with. I highly recommend this potty!!!!! *****
5	1302825600	I am so happy with this potty chair.  My daughter potty trained at 2 1/2 years old and we have been using this chair for about 8 months.  It is wonderful!  The high back is great for the times she needs to sit for a while.  She can relax in comfort.  One of the best features of this chair is the removable bowl.  It makes cleaning very easy.  The main reason why I purchased this chair is because I didn't want a character potty in out 1st floor bathroom that guests use.  We are very happy with this potty chair and would highly recommend this product.  It costs a little more than some of the other potty chairs on the market but I would say this chair is worth every penny!
5	1302307200	My twin three-year-old boys both easily use the Baby Bjorn potty chair. I love it for its easy to clean surface, stable construction, and how user-friendly it is for my children. We own two: one red and one blue.The potty is made of hard plastic that is smooth and well fitted. There are no crevices or hard to reach areas that make the potty difficult to keep clean. A simple rinse in the sink clears most waste and a swipe with a baby wipe is the most it ever requires. The surface dries quickly and easily; I use a paper towel to dry it instantly. I occasionally just want to really clean it and even a full all-over rinse and wipe down takes less than two minutes and leaves me feeling like it's truly clean---something I never thought of my cushioned potty seats.The seat is well proportioned for my boys who are 36-38" tall and 32-34 lbs. I can't see that they will outgrow it soon. The base has a rubber seal that holds the potty firmly in place on the tile floor; even when they plop down it doesn't slide under them. The back is high and supports them well when they sit for an extended time. The bowl fits snugly into the base; neither one has ever been pinched in literally hundreds of uses. The pee guard in the front works well for my son who prefers to sit while the oblong shape allows my son who prefers to stand to get close enough to the bowl. We have no issues with them missing other than when the stander turns around to talk to me...not sure what I can do about that.My boys both empty their own bowls into the toilet and then rinse the bowl in the sink (standing on our Babybjorn Safe Step). They then replace the bowls into their potties and are done. All I have to do is dry the seat with a paper towel if we're going to be using them again soon. From the first time they used the potties, they completely understood what it was for, how to remove the bowl, and how to replace it. I would never have thought my kids would clean their own potties, but with this material and design, they figured it out after watching me do the rinsing over just a couple of days.I highly recommend this product.
5	1301875200	Our son who hasn't actually used this potty yet does love to sit on it and he also loves to move it around. We love that is it has a simple bowl for the pee and that the pee guard doesn't come off. With its ease of cleaning and easy to move design we would easily recommend this potty to anyone.
2	1301270400	I bought this potty chair thinking it would be a great solution for us, but the splash guard splashes everywhere. My son is 28 mos old and it is just not shaped right for his body. It is great for cleaning and seems comfortable for him, but he is peeing everywhere! So, I am constantly cleaning the floor and he gets upset because he is getting wet everytime he pottys making potty training nearly impossible. FYI he does the same thing with the fisher price musical potty and the potty rings you put on the toilet. I would love a solution that works for us!
5	1301097600	honestly, i was going to get the smart potty instead, but this was eligible for amazon prime and thus a few cents cheaper [every penny counts these days!] but, im glad i got the potty chair. on a quick note, the green is not a bright lime green, its more of a muted lime green if that makes sense. [more natural-leaf-looking than neon.]were not getting too serious about potty training, just yet, but we do set our daughter on the potty after naps. shes peed in it a couple times, now. the center "potty bowl" removes easily and doesnt force you to touch anywhere the pee has touched since it has a "lip" to grab up under the front "horn" of the bowl. you simply remove and dump the bowl part into the adult potty, maybe put a lil water in it from the faucet to rinse it and dump the contaminated water into the toilet, too. very, very easy to use. my daughter can sit on it herself [shes 13m] and stand up unassisted, as well. the back chair part aids her in sitting down so she doesnt plop down [like every child this age does] and lean back too far.the only down side i see with this potty is my daughters curious and wants to touch inside the bowl while sitting on the potty. but thats just a learning curve of whats "yucky" and shouldnt be touched. ;)overall, i recommend the baby bjorn potty chair because it doesnt have any bells and whistles [which i find pretty pointless for a get-down-to-business type of personal business,] its fairly inexpensive compaired to others out there, and its functional and safe [no leaning back too far.]
5	1300579200	This is the first potty chair I have ever bought and was a little nervous despite the great reviews....& I realized it was all for nothing.  This is such a great product; my son absolutely loves it, willingly sits on it, and there are no messy accidents when he is using it.  & best of all, it is made in the good ol' US of A!:)
5	1300060800	I bought this for my 19-month daughter and she loves it! This is her first potty, and she loves to sit on it and put her animals on it. Its lightweight enough for her to carry around. The inner section fits securely and lifts out easily for quick clean up. The back is high enough so she can sit back and be comfortable. She has no trouble sitting down and getting up. This is the first potty I've tried for her and it's the only one we'll need. She loves it! Great product.
4	1299801600	We got this potty chair in pink and it has been well used in our house!  My daughter was introduced to the potty at a very early age so that she could take her time in getting comfortable with it.  I love how it is a simple, uncomplicated, yet stylish, chair.  Not at all garish or intimidating for the baby.  My daughter recognized pretty quickly what this potty chair was meant for and we have had no problem in having her relieve herself in it.  Its purpose is clear because there are no distracting sounds or cartoon figures detracting from it.  The high seat  back has proved to be useful.  My daughter holds onto it for balance as she is sitting down.  It also seems to be difficult to tip over. The only thing that I was concerned about was that the high seat back invites my daughter to lean her back up flush against it so that half of her bum winds up resting on the back rim of the potty seat. Not good for free flow of bowel movements.  Thankfully she has had no messy accidents with this. Somehow she learned to scoot forward enough in her seat so that all her waste drops freely into the bottom of the bowl.  My mother-in-law bought the same potty chair to keep at her house after seeing just how well it has been working out here.  I'm thinking of buying another for our second bathroom. Love it.
5	1299801600	This is the most comfortable potty chair around! My daughter loved to sit on it for a chair when we first got it and it didn't take long at all for her to start using it as a potty ..she's almost 3 now and still uses it because she says it's more "comfy" than the big potty I think the biggest plus for her is the smooth back rest and the biggest plus for me is it's so so easy to clean!
4	1299715200	My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog.  It's known as "ribbit".  Well "ribbit" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it.  So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back.  I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge.  I am very pleased with the depth of this one.  It fits him really good now.  I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months.  I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom.  It also has a really good front potty blocker.  I would especially recommend this for parents with boys.
5	1299456000	I am very happy I decided to buy this one. It is tall, comfortable for my daughter and so easy for me to clean.My baby is only 4 months but I can tell that she already loves her new yellow potty chair and she likes to use it (with my help of course) every day.Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
4	1299110400	My kids love this potty, but it does leave a red mark. It doesn't seem to bother them and it goes away rather quickly. They like this potty better than sitting on the big potty.
4	1298764800	We love this potty...it's not complicated like other pottys. It's easy to empty and clean...the seat seams comfortable for my daughters tiny butt... She loves to sit on it...glad we chose this one over the other cheap pottys.
5	1298764800	I bought this item because I had previously bought the 'comfy cushy' potty by Safety 1st which I discovered was extremely unsanitary and GROSS! This potty is so nice compared to others I have seen.This potty chair is not like to ones you see in stores. The store ones have pictures, characters, buttons, and sounds.  I don't want my child to be distracted by that kind of stuff. This potty is definitely plain and simple. I got the white one because it looks more like a real toilet. So far it is VERY easy to clean. The splash guard works pretty well for my little boy (18 months), and the seat fits him well, in fact, he still has lots of room to scoot back if he wants. So far I have not had a problem with the seat moving around or pinching his skin. I am glad I finally found the potty that works for my little boy!
5	1298419200	Okay so I ordered this potty from amazon based on the reviews. I have 16 month old boy and figured why not get this started. I looked at many potty chairs and spent days reading reviews before deciding on this one. I just received it today and my son has made tinkles on it 4 times in 6 hours. He absolutely loves it, the last two times he sat there for about 10 minutes waiting to tinkle a second time. It was super easy to clean and at first impression I'm really happy!!!One week later and nothing but success I love the simple design it is so easy to keep clean and the splash guard works great!!! This is an awesome product and I would recommended this to any parent trying to potty train a boy.
5	1298332800	We tried a few potties (mostly second hand, free) and this one has been the best. It's worked from 4 months or so (whenever he could first sit up, and we'd plop him on it at the first sign of a bowel movement -- he had us changing him 5 times a day then due to runny poops that escaped any diaper we put on him) until now (18 months) and I don't see any reason it shouldn't work for the next 2 years as well.  Our little boy loves sitting on it, because it's so sturdy and he has a good support for his back.  We also have the flip-down potty seats on our adult toilets that he uses but he really likes his baby-bjorn potty the best.
5	1298246400	I am potty training my 19 month old daughter. She is my 6th child and I have owned a league of potties over the years. The problem with so many potties that I find is that there are too many bells and whistles that make potty time more of playtime than getting down to business. This potty is super simple to clean which is a BIG bonus over other potties. You simply pick up the insert, dump it into the toilet and rinse out the insert. I usually just use a clorox wipe to clean it out. The shield is high enough that a boy will not pee all over himself, but short enough that a little girl will not jab herself while trying to sit down. My daughter is 19 months and 24 lbs and this seat is the perfect height for her. As said, my twin 3 year old sons have used this a few times (when both just gotta go at the same time and one is already on the big potty)and had absolutely no issues with it at all. I wish I would have bought this the first time instead of spending hundreds on other potties over the past decade.
5	1297987200	I bought this potty chair after looking at several other brands/styles because of the high back and arm support. It has a great "wrap-around" design that is perfect for my 4-month-old who is just getting familiar with the potty. For those working on infant potty training, I highly recommend this chair. My little one has no problem sitting up in this chair by herself (of course I'm holding onto her for security). She has already made many, many poops and pees in the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair! It's also very easy to clean. Just dump out contents, rinse, and wipe with a disposable disinfecting wipe. Definitely easier than changing a diaper!
4	1297900800	I purchased this potty chair for my daughter. We practice elimination communication and wanted a potty as she got a bit bigger to use. This potty is wonderful. We've never had an issue with the insert pinching her legs or anything like that. However, I would suggest it for an older EC baby, such as 12 mos+. It's a bit high up for my 7 month old. We purchased a Baby Bjorn Little Potty afterward that she loves and we will be using for a few months if not longer. As she grows we'll move back into the Potty Chair!
4	1297814400	The product is simple and gets the job done.  No frills, but nothing to break either.  Looks cute.
5	1297209600	The guard works perfectly for our son!  I wish we had bought this for our upstairs bathroom as well.
5	1297036800	We did MUCH research on potty chairs and decided on BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Potty Chair,which I have NO regrets... Our son wasn't quite ready to start but the sturdyness will be useful as he approaches his 2nd birthday and we start full force. The reason I bought? No bells and whistles, sturdy and of a quality name. Id buy this again!!
3	1296864000	My son became afraid of this potty chair when he bumped his... parts on it the first few times we had him sit on it without a diaper.  He refused to sit on it after that and the potty training was set back until I was able to get a potty chair with a removable splash guard.I cant say much more about the chair because I dont believe he ever actually went to the bathroom on it.  I would advise if you have a boy to instead get a potty chair with a removable splash guard.  Once my son had become a pro at sitting on his other potty, I was able to attach the guard and he didn't care/notice.Even though we had success with his other potty, I had issues with that one too.  It had a soft seat that he loved to take off and a bucket underneath that did not completely fill the hole that it sat in.  I had to take that thing apart again and again to clean it out.Hopefully there is a better solution out there!
5	1296518400	With some help and patience, my 14-month-old son does stay in this Babyjorn potty and does a really good job doing his business. It is so easy to clean. Just pour out, use soap and water to rinse, then whip down. Done!
4	1295913600	The potty chair is great!  My 14 mo. old has not used it yet, but she does sit on it and explores--a great first step.The design is sleek and easy to use.  No sharp edges and easy to clean.
5	1295395200	I purchased 3 different potties for our son so that we could begin potty training.  I wanted to have them in various parts of the house.  One was an Elmo chair and the other a construction truck chair, and then the simple Baby Bjorn chair.  This chair is FAR AND AWAY better than the other chairs.  It is smooth on all sides, so that my son doesn't scrape himself when trying to sit down on it quickly.  It's very easy to clean, and I like that the front guard is higher up to help avoid accidents.  The other chairs either don't have enough of a guard or they have sharp guards that can injur your child.  All in all, I would say avoid any potty chairs with characters or gimmics, and just stick with this one.  It is simple and the best chair out there!
5	1295049600	Very nice little seat.  My daughter has tried to use it a few times.  She likes to remove the white portion of the seat but I just need to teach her to leave it alone.
5	1295049600	The Baby Bjorn potty chair is so easy to clean, and that is the biggest reason we purchased it. It is 2 parts, the seat and the removable bowl. My 2 year old daughter can feel comfortable as she uses the bathroom, and then she can dump her pee pee into the big toilet all by herself. I then rinse the bowl in the bathtub and place it back into the seat. When she uses the chair for pooping, I always assist her in her clean-up. The seat and bowl are easy to sanitize, with no cracks or crevasses for gross stuff to hide in.I can't imagine having a potty chair with a padded seat or one that required the child to lift or unlock anything to empty the bowl. This is a simple and easy to use potty chair that I'm certain will last through years for multiple children if needed. And it's not ugly. We have the white one and it doesn't stick out as a tacky child's toy potty chair. Some people think the child should pick out their own seat, and my vote is to pick this chair, and let them pick the color if you want them to have a say. YOU are the one that has to clean and maintain it!We also have the toilet seat topper made by Bjorn, and I feel that is an excellent product for when the child transitions to the "big" toilet.
4	1295049600	Over all I have loved this potty(as much as you can love a potty). But My son has started to stand when he pees and the result is a flood on the floor every time.  If the pee hits the back of the chair it flows out under the bowl. Yes I know it is an aim thing which is why I still highly rate this potty.My fix is having him use the toilet when he pees which is a lot less messy :-)
5	1294444800	This is the best Potty Chair I have ever had. I have gone through many potty chairs in my child care home and this is the best. This is great for little boys and girls of all sizes, even the chunkier hineys! Cleans easy too! :)
4	1293494400	This is a great potty seat and very easy to manage, however the potty disassembles quite easily from the base and does not have a cover.  I was not able to find a babybjorn with the aforementioned essentials. Would buy the same brand, if they made a new version that covers and did not come apart so easily from the base (my daughter take out the center all the time)which can become a problem if she empties the content.
5	1292198400	Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.  If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.  No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.  The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine.
5	1291939200	I bought this potty based on the reviews and absolutely love it! I thought I would try out potty training with my 8 month old son and its been a breeze so far. No messy clean up and he sits on it with no problem. He's a little taller than most 8 month olds. I am definately satisfied with my purchase.
5	1291766400	I have this for my almost 3 year old son who is around 30lbs and very tall.  He loves this seat.  He fits in it just fine, we have had no trouble with leaks, and he finds it very easy to use on his own.  The potty is very easy to clean, and we have never had a problem with pee getting everywhere.  The one thing I would change is that sometimes the removable seat does get stuck to his thighs when he stands, but he's learned to be careful, and we've never had an accident due to that.  Otherwise, great potty training seat!
4	1291161600	has a larger "drop" opening than a convertible potty that fits onto a toilet seat and step; better chance of your child pooping into the potty as opposed to pooping on the rear of the sitting area.  However, the sitting area on the rear is also wide.  If your child sits all the way back, there's a chance he/she can poop on the seat.
5	1291161600	I have 2 of these for my twins. Having gone through the search of a good one with my first child, I found this and bought 2. It's simple to clean, you take out the wipe potty part by hooking some fingers to the front and dump the contents into the toilet. Rinse it and you're ready to go. You can sanitize it with some clorox spray and just put it back down until the next time.  It's portable so you can have it anywhere. There is an anti slip rubber on the bottom so no worries about pottying children ending up somewhere else than where you left them.My twins are now potty trained, but I still keep one in the back of the van for emergencies. You never know if you'll make it to the next toilet, you know?
4	1290988800	This potty is the best. My daughter can fit on it easily unlike her previous potty. It's not the most attractive potty, very simple/plain. Overall it serves it's purpose.
5	1290384000	We bought this several months go so our now 20 month old daughter could "get used" to it being around. Two weeks ago she started using the potty and we've had great success with it. The splash guard in front keeps her from sitting too far to the front. I highly recommend this seat!
5	1290384000	I purchase this BABYBJORN to replace another potty chair that I purchased first for my son.  This one has a great shape that accommodates little boys without having to worry about "overshooting" or "spills" as my son calls it.  He is very comfortable using this and I would purchase this product again in a heartbeat.  It is very easy to clean and doesn't have many nooks/crannies that would make cleaning difficult.  This potty chair has been a great training tool!
5	1290297600	Even though it's on the expensive side, we now always by this chair for boy baby showers!  It's absolutely the easiest to clean chair out there, and the one that gives the boys the room they need!  Boys have a very hard time finding potty chairs that are deep enough for their parts to avoid squishing and touching the guard (yuck!). My son was able to dump the potty himself from about 18 months old (we didn't encourage it, it just happened), with no spilling.  The high back is great for those long waits; my son likes to use the back and arms for leverage when going #2.  The firmness of the chair has NEVER bothered any of the kids that have used it here.I was really worried about spending my money on it... but it's one of the best baby items we have every had.
5	1289088000	This potty is great. We use diapers and EC. Started with the baby bjorn travel potty at 7mo, but she started to outgrow this at a year. Moved that to the car. She is much more comfortable on this potty. She is 18 lbs now, but it really seemed to be more of a height thing. She was too tall for the little one, and much better with this one starting at about 28 inches. Easy to clean of course, especially with a diaper sprayer, and chlorox wipes if needed.
5	1288656000	How can the simplest of potty seats be the most expensive?  In this case, you must pay for the simplicity and functionality of this design.  We looked at many other potty seats with music, lights, lids, and countless other useless bells and whistles.  You would have to clean those things at a car wash to get in all the crevices and moving parts.  This seat is stable, simple, and easy to clean - just like the one I had when I was 2.  I guess no one but Baby Bjorn thinks simple functionality is the way to go.
5	1287273600	I let my 24-month old son choose the color (RED!) of his new potty chair.  When it got here I let him sit on it before and after his bath and he went potty that first night!  Since then he has gone 5 nights in a row--he loves this potty chair!  It is so easy to dump the potty in the toilet and rinse out the basin (I do it in the tub).
3	1286928000	When our old faithful potty cracked after fifteen years, I was frustrated to have to buy a new one for our very last child.First, we tried the Baby Bjorn Little Potty, which was closest in design to our old potty.  What a nightmare!  If only he was a girl, it would have been great, but the anatomy involved guaranteed a "puddle" every single time with the little potty.  Too darn tiny.Since size was the problem, I figured this "full-sized" potty would definitely do the trick.  I guess Swedish kids are smaller than ours, because frankly, this one STILL isn't big enough.Sometimes, it works fine.  Maybe even most of the time.  We did try it out at a friend's house before buying (rinsing it well afterwards!), so I knew it was comfortable and worked.  Sometimes.The front-to-back length is simply not generous enough.  I  like almost everything else about it, and I LOVE the removeable potty portion, but if he's not sitting exactly right, well, our floor still becomes one big "puddle".He's not an overly large child, but he is three years old, and his bottom is getting bigger right along with the rest of him.  As much as I try to have him squinch to the back and grab his ankles, the curvature (or lack thereof) of the inner potty is going to create spray at certain angles.Our old potty worked amazingly well, but sadly it wasn't a brand name, so I can't buy another.  Honestly, I don't see how this could be so hard to design:  it was big enough to hold a typical child's bottom.  It had a slight curve to the "guard" so the puddle went DOWN instead of OUT.And amazingly enough, at the time, it only cost a dollar - though I'd be happy to pay a little more for a new one just like it.If your little one is a girl, and you're sure you'll never have a boy, this is a great potty seat - very sturdy and comfortable.  But before you buy, you'd better think about boys... because clearly, BABYBJ&Ouml;RN didn't.
5	1286150400	I can't believe I'm writing a review about a potty, but this is one great little toilet.  Don't waste your time with any others if you're trying to potty train.  We read "Toilet Training in Less Than A Day," and my 3 1/2 year old daughter was truly trained the day we got this potty using those methods...after several unsuccessful attempts using other, more complicated potties.  This seemed comfortable for her to sit on with a place to rest against if she needed to be there a while, and she was able to empty it herself without making a mess.  It is easy to clean and the white is refreshingly not obnoxious looking for those trying to maintain the illusion that your bathroom is a spa.  I've got nothing else to say; this is a well designed product we will use with all our children.
5	1285891200	No "nooks and crannies" for "stuff" to accumulate. Sturdy, simple, perfect. Our triplet boys played with them when they arrived and just started using them. Easy to clean, easy to stack (we have three), right size, what else is there to say? Great item.
5	1285200000	Love this potty.  Not only is it cute but has some great qualities.1) High back and stable base - toddler isn't likely to tip over in this. (have had other potties where this was a problem)2) Simple design means no extras that mean extra crevices, joints and leak points.  As a result easy to clean.  (Have had others that I dreaded to clean-up after use... practically needed an old toothbrush to get the gunk out of the crevices.)
4	1285113600	I bought this for my 2 year old daughter to help with potty training. We also have theMommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Upbut that is a little difficult for her to get to the top step and turn around on her own so we wanted something she could use a bit more autonomously and that we could bring with us for potty stops during a driving vacation. This potty fits that bill however, my two concerns with it are making sure she sits square on it so she doesn't land on the spray guard and hurt herself. Also, one time she was sitting on it and stood up to adjust herself and the white potty part stuck to her bottom so when she went to sit down again, somehow she got a tiny bit of her skin pinched between the white removable part and the red main body part. It really hurt so now whenever she uses it, I make sure to un-stick the seat from her skin before she sits down again. Other than those two points, it seems like a good enough potty. I don't know if it's helping her learn to go any faster than any other potty seat but it had good reviews and she fits well on it (she's very tall for her age).
5	1285113600	This is a great potty. Comfortable and safe for the child, easy to clean. Buy it.I would like to refute those those who say it's not for boys, because this is an excellent potty for boys and for girls.The complainers are unrealistic in teaching a boy to stand to pee in a POTTY. OF course it made a huge mess!! Too low, wrong shape and size of container, etc.  Teach your boy to stand to pee in the TOILET. I can't imagine letting my sons stand and pee into a potty. That's just rediculous. My sons have never even tried to pee standing at the potty. Makes no sense.All the little boys I know learned to "go potty" peeing and pooping sitting down on a potty. Then later they transition to sitting on the toilet sometimes, (body size makes the difference here) and at some point starting to stand to pee at the toilet as they have seen Daddy or big brother do.I started training just under 2 years. After they were fully trained (it takes a few weeks/months) my sons used both the potty and the toilet, whichever they felt more comfortable with. By age 4, they used the toilet exclusively. just FYI.
3	1284768000	Our floors end up all wet half the time my 2 year old pees in this potty - the front part isn't sufficient blockage.  We've had better luck with the Fisher Price froggy potty, which is also $10 less and contains the same general ease of convenience.
3	1284595200	I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms.  They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived.  Also, it arrived in one day.  But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one.  I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose.  I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design.  I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning.  We'll be using these for awhile I expect.
5	1284249600	I ordered two BABYBJORN potty chairs, one for our grandson and one as a gift for another baby.  After researching many designs on the web, this product seemed the best.
2	1283904000	I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I was pretty disappointed over all.  My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby.  In any case, every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum. I thought it was a little narrow for her.  Sometimes when she stood up, the white part actually came up with her. I personally did not think this was a great potty chair.  I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy, since there seems to be issue with other potty's splash guards.  In my case, my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all.  I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings. It's a little lower, but wider and the seat cannot come up with her. She loves the songs, though it's lower and it is actually wider, so even though she is tall, no problems. Again, don't have a boy so can't speak to the splash guard issue, but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me.  It's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now.
5	1283904000	This potty arrived super fast..( I live overseas in Japan). I think it arrived here in less than a week! This potty is as cute as a button, super easy to clean, and my son LOVES it. The first time he saw it he wanted to sit..I had him peeing in it on his second try of sitting on it!! Best potty on the market! I am so relieved at how easy potty training is with this thing! Thank you Baby Bjorn for coming up with this amazing design!!
5	1283212800	The moment my daughter saw it, she started to use it. It catches her attention right away. The potty is sturdy and comfortable for young kid.
5	1282867200	I bought this for my 2 year old grandson.  He loves it!  I liked the height, color choices, ease of cleaning & the non-slip bottom.  He removes the bowl & empties it into the big potty by himself.  Anything that encourages him to use the potty is a positive thing.
5	1282435200	I am very happy with my purchase. This potty chair is sturdy and easy to clean. The splash guard seems to work very well for boys. Also, I like the simple yet "fashionable" design, and so does my son.Since it's made of plastic, you may get some (mineral?) buildup from urine.  I put vinegar in the potty to soak it, and it came out very nicely. After using for almost 2 years, it still looks brand new.
5	1281744000	I purchased this potty after I bought and returned an Elmo potty and  Safety 1st potty from Wal-Mart. The Elmo one looked too much like a toy (my son just wanted to play with it) and the Safety 1st one was an awkward square shape (my son actually cried out of discomfort the first time he sat on it.) I read lots of reviews and decided on this one and it did NOT disappoint! I love that it actually looks like a toilet, not a toy! The high back and arm rests provide extra support for getting on and off. The contoured front is great for boys. It is VERY easy to clean. Oval shape is similar to a real toilet which makes it easier to transition. Best of all, my son loves it and seems very comfortable on it. I would highly recommend!!!
5	1281484800	This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to "keep it all in" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size "bowl", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!
5	1280880000	This potty is great! My son loves to sit on it and the splashguard is definitely tall enough so that he doesn't spray the floor. :)
5	1280534400	My father had made my daughter a potty, but it had the pot that slid from behind under the seat.  So there were little spills from time to time.  I bought this potty and my daughter loves it!!  It's so easy for her to pick up and flush and there is never a mess.  Definitely worth every penny!
5	1280275200	My son is about 2 and he started showing interest in using the potty, so after much research I decided on this potty chair. This chair is very durable and doesn't slide around the bathroom floor like most potty chairs. Also, it is very easy to clean w/removable pot and the splash guard actually works. My older son had a fisher price royal potty seat when he was younger and it was a joke, very hard to clean, splash guard didn't work & the music was a real distraction. Keeping it simple is the best way to potty train. When my son goes to the bathroom I reward him with a popsicle and I make a big deal about him going potty each time to keep him coming back :)
5	1279670400	We'd tried other potties with no success. The stable base and high back on this potty make it comfortable for my child. Since he can easily sit on the potty and feel secure, it is easier for him to go. Clean-up is very easy with this potty, because there are no crevices. Highly recommended!
4	1279324800	This was the second potty that we tried, and we finally found it. Definately great for boys! Also, very stable. My son sometimes sits there for a while just because it's comfy, definately a plus when you starting potty training.
3	1279238400	I bought this in preparation for my son's potty training and unfortunately it didn't work out for us due to the fact that he preferred to pee standing up. When he does this it hits the back of the chair and goes underneath the lip of the removable piece. This caused a lot of really messy pee rivers and lakes on my bathroom floor. I would not recommend buying this for the boys that you know are going to go potty standing up. It would be great for girls though. The base seemed very stable and not tippy and the seating area was smooth and shouldn't pinch.
5	1278979200	After trying a potty chair that always ended up with a mess due to an inadequate splash guard for boys, I did my research and purchased this one. He has no trouble using this one and I have no messes to clean off the floor or walls!
5	1278547200	My son is VERY tall for his age (he's almost 3 and is 41" tall) so it has been very hard finding him a seat that he fits on comfortably.  This seat is great and he enjoys sitting on it.
5	1278201600	I am so pleased with this potty. It is very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old. It is also very easy to keep cleaned up.
5	1277769600	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this potty. . .I found one in a garage sale, and had to go out and buy two more for upstairs, and my parents house.
5	1277596800	Excellent product, especially like the high back for support.  This worked like a charm and within one week our grand-daughter was using it.
5	1277424000	I went throung various potty training chairs and seats, and the potty training was not successful. After I got this one, my son pretty much potty trained in a few weeks. He loves it, it is very comfortable and there is a support for childs back. I am a first time parent and I wish someone would have told me about this potty chair earlier.
5	1275609600	a miracle! my 3 year old son refused to go near any potty chair but after reading all the great reviews I decided to go ahead and order it anyway. unbelievable but true, he sat down as soon as I unpacked it and is using it every day now. I cannot believe it and don't understand why but this potty chair really does work. easy to clean, sturdy, he can sit down by himself without any problems and it is big enough for him (he is a very tall boy for his age). I can highly recommend this!
5	1275004800	I purchased this for my 16 months just to get started. She is still trying to figure what is this. Sometime she think this is toy. We are still trying to teach her to sit on and I am sure she will learn pretty soon. I feel like 16 months is little bit early for potty.I like this product as it has high back rest. With the value this items I paid, it worth.09/20/2011:Just to give you update:She started using this after 18/19th month and NO MORE DAIPERS>>>>WOW she still loves this....
4	1274659200	The potty arrived in great condition, thank goodness, but not the box. It was taped all over, hard to open, and it didn't have any packaging on the inside so the box was crushed.I also found the item to be misleading. The page that had the toilet showed a picture of a blue toilet (royal blue) for sale. I received a light blue. I'm keeping it because it doesn't matter that much, but I was really looking forward to the royal blue. I just wanted to mention it to other people who might only want the "royal blue".The Bjorn product itself is great. My 20 month old son loves it and sits on it all the time without trouble. He is short for his age too. We have a red one as well and are very happy with them.
5	1274313600	My son is a big kid (tall, 28 lb, one year old with chubby legs) and this potty fits him perfectly. He has already used it for #1 and #2. He does not mind sitting on it at all so it must be comfortable to him. Mess cleans out of it easily too.
5	1273622400	i have read several of the reviews for this potty chair, both good and bad, and i have to agree it is a great potty chair! great size for a larger toddler. my son is 36 inches tall and 40lbs and finding a potty chair that is big enough and sturdy enough has been a challenge. this one fits him great with room to spare. it also has a large opening so no worries of him missing and making a mess. i also saw some bad reviews where they had problems with the pee guard and pee going over it onto the child's leg and floor. so far i haven't had that problem. i just tell my son to make sure it is pointed down, which needs to be taught to little boys when potty training anyways. also having the options to pick a color made the experience much easier and my son loved the moment it was delivered and was able to open it and see the color he picked. overall this has made potty training a great experience!
1	1273536000	I bought it because of the wonderful reviews, but am very disappointed.  I've had messy experiences every single time my son uses the seat.  Even with sitting back as far as he can go, leaning slightly forward, aiming his pee-pee down, the pee goes up the splash guard onto his inner thighs, down the front of the seat and onto the floor.  We've only been using it for three days so far but I have had to clean my son up, myself, the potty seat, and the floor every single time.  I know potty training is daunting, but with these messes, diapers were way easier!  I'm going back to the simple potty ring on the big toilet now.
5	1273363200	I have been providing daycare for over 30 years.  This means that I have tried many many potty chairs.  The Baby Bjorn is the best!!  It only has 2 parts.  No grooves for liquids to collect.  Deflector cup is molded to the bowl so it will not detach when child is lifted off the potty chair. Lip on bowl is wide and very easy to clean!
3	1273190400	This chair seems all right but we haven't done anything but sit on it with clothes on. I think I would probably buy a potty chair with a cushion next time so my baby's rear end didn't get cold but it works for the intended purpose.
4	1272758400	i returned a different potty same day to purchase this one. the other potty seemed more comfortable with a cushion seat but my daughter slid off the back side and seemed like if she went in it she would squirt out the front. this potty chair she could lounge in comfortably without me thinking she's going to fall off the back, i thought it would be hard but she enjoyed looking at a book on it. the only issue i had was she got excited and tried to get off of it by herself and hit the front guard, flipping over and going facefirst into our bathroom shelving. at first glace we thought she broke her nose right across the bridge. luckily she isn't scared of the potty and her nose is ok....i'm sure as she grows a little she will be able to get off easier but just a warning, i do love this potty a lot better than the first one we got.
5	1272499200	Comfortable, wildly easy to clean with no nooks or crannies, attractive in an adult designed bathroom. My daughter loves to use it and can sit on it for a very long time without being uncomfortable. We also bought the matching safe step stool and the set was very much worth the money. We get compliments all the time and I'm happy we didn't have to buy yet another chunk of pink plastic on our journey to potty training perfection.
5	1271980800	I just got this potty yesterday, and I already know that it is everything that I expected!  I have a three year old son and for weeks he has been using a Safety First potty that I am now going to happily throw in the garbage because that is exactly what it is and where it belongs.  It is such a poor design that every time he went pee it would leak all over the place.  I had to take it all apart and wash it in the bathtub after every use.  Not to mention all the pee that ended up on the floor.  UGHHH!  I finally used duct tape to seal all the seams between the parts which worked marginally, but I was going through tape like it grew on trees.  After one days use of the Baby Bjorn potty I have none of these issues.  My son does his duty and there is no mess to clean up other than the waste that properly ends up in the potty!  Now I can spend my time praising him for a job well done rather than bending over the bathtub cleaning up the mess.  The joy of potty training is back!  The potty is very easy to clean and just lifts right out of the base.  It looks nice and fits well in the bathroom.  My son loved all the color choices and picked his favorite color - pink!  I would definately recommend this potty seat to anyone who was having the same issues I had.  Thank you Baby Bjorn for being in tuned with end users' real needs!!
4	1271721600	Great Baby Bj&ouml;rn quality of course. Provides my little on with back support as well.  And the color.. well it's her favorite shade of PINK!  Awesome!
5	1271635200	I am the grandmother of a very active 2 year old boy.  After assessing the reviews of potty chairs I decided to purchase this chair.  It is very sturdy,.. hasn't tipped or teetered when he tries to sit on or get off.  I love the ease of 'dumping' the potty.  It doesn't leak between the pot and the seat like most rear assessible potties.  He has wet the floor by spraying over the cup but only because he hasn't pulled his pants down far enough to sit correctly on the potty.  It is less than a week of training and I am sure we will master this shortly.  It is VERY easy to keep clean.  The oval seat seems to fit his behind and is comfortable.  I am the mother of two girls (who are now in their 30's) and it looks very different than the potty chairs we used in the 70's-80's.  But don't be alarmed by it's modern looking design.... the improvement are worth the price!
5	1270857600	I bought this chair for my 19 month old potty training toddler. The 1st day I brought it home he was so excited and so was I. On his 1st attempt my LO made poo successfully!!! He was so proud... this chair is terrifc!!! He's always so excited to "go potty"... It makes potty training easy.
5	1270771200	This potty works very well for us.  My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).  It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.  I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.  Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child
5	1270166400	This Potty chair, is a bit different from others on the market. While priced on the high scale, it seems much more comfortable for the kids, having a higher back support.Cleaning is very easy, and my kid loves it ...
5	1269993600	Our daughter loves using this chair.  It is stable and very easy to clean.
5	1269561600	I did a lot of research before making the purchase. And this one turned out to be the best!!!It is perfect for a boy. No spill at all. Ever since we got it, my 2-year old son has been using it every day. He loves it! He has never pooed in the diaper ever since.Highly recommend!
5	1269302400	We LOVE the baby Bjorn potty chair for our THREE MONTH OLD.  Seriously, for those of you that are interested in infant potty training/elimination communication this is definitely the potty for you.  Our daughter can sit in it without us holding her up even though she is not yet sitting up on her own.  And she doesn't mind it at all.  The high rounded back and the front splash guard help hold her in place similar to the way a BUMBO seat (not for potty use) does it.  We also really like the fact that the actual compartment that she pees/poops in is detached so that you can just take that to the sink/toilet and rinse it really easily.  There are TONS of colors to choose from and right now the price on AMAZON is a good deal (like 22$ no tax or shipping).  Totally get this seat!
5	1269216000	This potty came highly recommended from a random potty testing blog I found and that review is proving true for my 11-month old girl.  Obviously, she is younger than many of the children of the negative reviewers so maybe size will become an issue later but she's approximately 25lbs now, and there is no size issue.Baby loves to sit on it and is using it regularly.  I do notice the red line on her little bum after see gets up, but she gets red lines on her legs from socks too and neither seem to bother her.Bottom line: simple to use, really easy to clean.
5	1269216000	Great potty for girls! My daughter is 23 mo-old and took right away to her yellow potty! She is still at the early stage of just sitting on it to get used to it but it is great! I used another brand for my other daughter and it wasn't as easy to clean. Also the seat doesn't pinch like a few others that we tried that are the more 'character' style. I wanted to distinguish it from being another toy.
5	1268611200	This is the perfect size for little ones! Many potty seats require them to remove their pants in order to straddle the seat - a pain! Other seats have a removable potty guard - which means that it just ends up IN the potty. This one is easy to dump, easy to clean, easy to use. Plus, it looks great! When we train, we keep ours in the kitchen (where we seem to live) so as to be more consistent. As the child improves, we can make it to the bathroom in time so the potty seat can be free to go outside with the child. We've found that children often do not want to come inside to potty, so by taking the potty outside to them, no more accidents! For our first child, we took this in the car when we traveled, but now we take the Pottette - another MUST HAVE purchase.
5	1268352000	We have a 2 year old boy who is just getting interested in the potty, so we opted to gear up the bathroom for him. I got this type of potty over the other options because the white 'potty bowl' cannot pinch him when he sits down, the 'little boy guard' in the front is all one piece with the potty bowl making the contruction more sturdy than other options. With that he can experience all the wonder of potty training without getting scratched or pinched when he sits down or wiggles on the set. The design is pretty basic, easy to clean and durable. A little more than I wanted to spend originally, however the few extra bucks were worth avoiding having to deal with the potty 'biting (pinching) him' or the 'little boy guard' braking off, and having to clean urine or worse from little seams and cravaces. I also ordered the Bjorn step stool for boy to more easily wash his hands and also stand and pee like Daddy if he wants to. A matching set, so no too much of an eye sore in the bathroom.Mom loves it and boy loves it.
5	1268092800	This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this.
5	1268092800	I bought this potty chair to replace a Winnie the Pooh combo potty chair / step stool which my 3yr old son complained about using all of the time. He would say that the Pooh potty hurt his hiney all of the time. The moment this Baby Bjorn chair arrived my son was ecstatic to say the least. He wanted to use the potty chair right away but it was a bit cold on his tush after having just arrived from the cold UPS truck. After 1/2 hour he was still so excited to use this new chair that he disregarded the cold seat and, amazingly, not only completed his business - both #1 and #2, but also stayed on there for some time afterwards saying how much he loved his new potty. My wife and I were shocked - we had worked so hard each day to try to get him to use his Pooh potty, but he absolutely hated it - he preferred the experience of straddling the regular toilet with the occasional hiney dunking to his Pooh potty. I even purchased the book "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day" from Amazon in hopes of getting him to use the potty, but I've never even had to open the book with this new Baby Bjorn potty chair. This thing is a miracle! I'm guessing it must be comfortable for his tush because he loves to sit on it during the day even with his clothes on. What amazes us even more is that he now tells us when he has to go to the potty and he does all of the work himself - pulling down his pants and diaper, wiping, and yes even pulling up his diaper and pants (or even putting on a new diaper).  I can honestly say this is one of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon.com and my wife and I no longer dread the thought of having to potty train our 3 month old daughter when the time comes.In regards to the regular toilet, I purchased two different types of potty seats that go over top of the regular seat prior to purchasing the Baby Bjorn potty chair but my son rarely ever used those either - on the rare occasion that he did he he would either complain that they were too cold or that his legs would stick to the squishable cushion.The chair is easily cleaned (I bought the solid white one) and is so lightweight that my son can move the potty to his favorite spot whenever he wants.
5	1267228800	We purchased the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair to begin introducing our 16 month old to the potty training process.  We figured since he was so young we would just slowly condition him to use the potty, starting right after the evening bath.  After a couple of weeks he now knows to go directly to the potty chair once his diaper has been removed at the start of his bath and again after he is out of the bath and we are getting him ready for bed.  We did have a couple experiences with him going on his own into the bathroom to potty in his potty chair after a morning shower with Mom; not realizing until we heard him clapping for himself in the bathroom.  We haven't started the morning potty time yet, but we probably will in about a week.  We were originally considering getting one of the potty chairs that looks like a toilet and you can flush it and then it sings to you, but we decided to go with something not so chaotic, making the learning experience as simple as possible for our son.  While we still have a ways to go in the potty training process, the start we are off to seems pretty solid.  We both highly recommend the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair.
5	1267056000	This potty chair is Perfect for BOYS!! We have tried a couple other potty chairs that just didn't work. He has no problem with using this potty at all and I love the elongated bowl. It really helps to make sure little boys have enough room to sit back and make sure the pee stays in the potty. We love this potty very much.
5	1266624000	This is working just fine, no regrets, in fact I purchased two.  I originally bought one form my home and when my daughter saw it, she liked it better than the one she had purchased.  So ofcourse grammy bought her one too.
5	1266278400	We received this item last week in the mail and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the quality.  This is a very sturdy chair with a nice no-slip rubber coating around the bottom edges, and this seems like a chair that will be super easy to clean.  My daughter is not quite ready for this but I am sure this is a great purchase.
5	1266192000	This is my daughter's first potty and she peed into it the very first time she sat on it!  It is easy to clean and fits well in a small bathroom, very user friendly!
3	1266105600	It functions. If my 2 year old boy pees in it the spray is minimal, the rubber pads keep it from sleeping, and its easy to clean. However he hates the potty. The seat sticks to his butt and is made of hard plastic so is very uncomfortable. He will perch above the seat using his arms to hold him off the seat rather then sit on it. I have since gotten the boon one and it is much more comfortable and he sits on it much better.
5	1266019200	There are "fancier" potties out there, potties that serve as a potty and also double, triple, or quadruple as a step stool, "big" toilet trainer seat, toilet paper holder, or provide positive reinforcement in the form of cartoon characters, music, and who-knows what else. This potty does none of that. It doesn't even have a lid to cover the bowl. But those other potties, the ones with the neat designs and features, they are good at a whole lot of things, but not so good at being potties, in my experience. This potty is just that - a potty...but it's a really terrific potty. It's comfy for kids of different sizes to sit on, isn't huge, and is a cinch to clean. And most importantly, with our old potty, my son never peed without spraying out of the bowl...since we got this potty, he's never sprayed pee anywhere but in the bowl. That pretty much says it all!
5	1265846400	My son is only beginning to potty train, but he instantly felt comfortable with this seat.  I had purchased a construction truck potty for him because he likes that sort of thing, and he thought it was neat, but he hated to sit on that potty.  I failed to realize how important comfort and feeling secure are in the potty training process.  He was successful the first time he sat on this potty and tried to pee!  Great product!
5	1265587200	This is a great potty chair.  I wasted my money on a cheaper one at first only to be disappointed by the size and the ablilty to scoot.  This chair stays put.  The toddler can easily get on and off on thier own.  Additionally, I no longer have messes to clean up on the floor because the cheaper chair did not provide a sufficient "shield" for little boys.  Don't waste your money on a cheaper chair -- get this one the first time!
5	1265414400	I bought this for my 6 month girl, she was actually scared when I seat her in at the first time, and tended to lean forward so I have to support her, but she did pee&poo in it. And after one or two uses she totally got used to it and loves being on it.
2	1265328000	I just bought this potty seat and my son will not sit in it more than 5 minutes.  He complains that it hurts his back and bum.
5	1264809600	This potty chair is wonderful! It is very comfortable for my son and easy to clean! He absolutely loves it!
4	1264809600	This is exactly what I expected.  This chair is a good height for our daughter.  The molded chair doesn't have any seams, which makes it very easy to keep clean.
5	1264550400	I just have to say that this potty chair is wonderful, especially for boys.  No more accidental "spraying" when sitting on this chair.  The splash guard is nice and high, and it doesn't have any sharp edges that might injure little boy parts.  Also the way the potty chair is designed requires them to sit with their legs spread a little bit which helps to get things pointing down.Also another bonus is the one piece bowl that lifts easily out for cleaning.  No more lids to lift or bowls to slide out that always leave drips.
4	1263945600	This potty training chair is the best one I have used for my 2 yr old son.  He can easily get on and off of it, which is a problem with other chairs.  The ONLY thing I wish it had was a hole on the back of the chair to put your hand in to lift and move it.  Just grabbing the top of it to move where the potty is located is cumbersome.
5	1262995200	This potty is stable even on slick surfaces due to the rubber rim on the bottom.  It is SO nice to be able to simply lift the bowl out to clean.  We use this with our daughters ages (almost) 2 and (almost) 3.  They both love it and often race to see who gets to use it first!  The backrest and roomy feel seem like a great design, and my kids must agree, as I have never noticed them to care much about other potties.  The colors are great too!  I like the splash guard as it helps the girls to sit in a more natural position to go potty (legs apart).  Also, being solid plastic is a plus for me as our last seat had the "soft-seat" style top and would literally absorb urine.  This seat will ensure you a clean, odor-free potty for your little one.  I love it!
5	1262995200	We love this chair! Our daughter is sixteen months, she is not totally potty trained yet, but getting there and she is very comfortable on the chair. It is easy to clean and very stable. I agree with some of the other reviews that I have read that a potty chair shouldn't be a toy that plays songs or lights up... it should be what it is, a potty. Also, we got the chair in white, which is the color of our toilet and I think that helps also... when we first gave it to our daughter she immediately knew exactly what it was.
2	1262304000	Although many people have given this high reviews, I simply do noy like this potty.  Everytime my son sits down to pee it sprays everywhere, even when he "aims" it down.  The splash guard is simply not high enough, it should also be made of softer material so he doesn't hurt himself when sitting down.
5	1261526400	This seat is stable, easy to clean, and a good size.  My kids both like it. The front part comes up just far enough to keep them from peeing out of the potty seat, but not so far that it gets in the way when they are trying to sit down.
5	1260921600	Love this potty chair!  After potty training with it, I purchased a second one for a second bathroom.  I have only potty trained girls and cannot attest if it works for boys as well.  It's smooth, easy to clean and easy to dump the pee and poop.  The whole potty doesn't get messy in the process.
4	1260576000	Our daughter loves her potty! It is very sturdy - doesn't tip over because of the rubber on the base.  Very easy to clean.  Wish it had a cover to prevent it from getting dirty (dust and hair). Waiting to see how the splashguard will work once our son starts using it.
5	1260316800	I bought this potty for my 2 yr. old boy after wasting money on a cheaper 3-in-1 potty. I thought I would be saving money by getting something that was a potty, stool, and separate seat all in one, but my son hated it for various reasons. I ended up buying this one after being unsuccessful with the other one for months. I opened it in front of him when it arrived and made a big deal out of it, and he immediately sat on it and stayed there for a while, pretending. Within the next week, he started running to get it and bringing it into the living room so he could sit on it while he watched his Elmo's Potty Time DVD. Within the week after that, he began wanting to try to go potty in it, and did! I should have just listened to the fantastic reviews and gotten this one in the first place!I love this potty chair because: It only has two pieces, making it very easy to clean immediately after use. It comes in a variety of colors, so you can get it in your child's favorite. It has a rubber-lined bottom edge that keeps it from slipping around, so it is very stable while your child is still wary about sturdying him/herself to sit down onto it. The bump that helps your boy keep his pee in the potty is small enough so there is no trouble sitting down. It has a sleek design that doesn't look too childish sitting in a shared bathroom, yet is still appealing to children. It was small enough so my son fit snugly in it, yet it had enough room so he could readjust to find a comfortable position for his bottom. My boy is very tall for his age and he had no issues with it being too short for him, though he is also lean. If your child is quite thick, Baby Bjorn makes a large potty seat that might be more appropriate.
5	1259366400	We bought this potty chair after much research and also owning another one - a Winnie the Pooh Potty chair with a removable urine shield that pops off too easily and just asks to be lost.  This chair is so much better that it doesn't even compare.  Our son has been using it to go to the bathroom (so far just pee pees :) ) for several months and loves it.  In contrast, he is lukewarm about the other chair.The best things about this chair:1)  Simple two piece design means that it is easy to clean.  The bowl lifts out and rinses easily.  Other potties seem to have 5 or more pieces, just asking for places to trap dirt.  Not a good thing with a potty2)  built in urine shield (into the bowl) works great and our son loves sitting on it.  It is a nightly ritual before his bath.3)  inexpensiveDownside?  We haven't found a downside yet.
5	1258416000	Well, since this is just a potty seat there isn't a whole lot to say.  It works great.  We bought two of these and three or four of the smaller Baby Bjorn potty seat.  Both kids were happy with them.  The three year old sometimes will still use her Baby Bjorn instead of the regular sized toilet, and it still fits her fine.
5	1257033600	My son was showing interest in going to the potty.  We bought a toilet seat that had a smaller seat inside the lid.  He was not too thrilled.  So we bought this chair and he instantly loved it.  He talks to the bear whenever he goes and we have been accident free for 2 weeks.  He is even coming around to the big potty!  Love this chair!!
5	1256947200	I bought this potty when my son was about 9 months old thinking I could potty train him early.  Alas, that was a huge failure.  However, by around 2.5, he got the hang of it, thanks to this great potty.  He could sit on it for hours as he read his little books.  We later bought him the Baby Bjorn toilet seat (also a great product).A few months later, his little sister started potty training.  And by 8 months, she was pretty much potty trained on this toilet.  It is comfortable for both him and and her and it is easy to clean (very important).  No bells and whistles and flushing noises, just good old-fashioned design.
5	1256256000	I bought this for my 9 month old daughter just to have somewhere to put her while I was using the bathroom.  Well she ended up loving it and using it on a daily basis. No she is not potty trained (or even close) but she enjoys going peepee while mommy does. Perfect height and easy to clean.
5	1256169600	My nineteen month old daughter loves this potty chair.  We even bought another one for her grandparents' house.  My daughter quickly adapted to the raised splash guard, so that was not a concern.  The potty is very easy to clean, as well.
5	1256083200	My 19 month old daughter and I love this chair. She grew quite fond of it the moment I introduced her to it. She peed in her new chair almost immediately after sitting in it! It was so exciting. Since then she's peed and pooped in it a handful of times. Not only that, but she sits in it almost every day.It is cute, comes in several different colors, very light,and is easy to use and clean!
5	1255564800	This is the best potty chair!  My son used it for the first time at 15 months and will still use it now at 2.  It is the perfect size and he always looks very comfortable on it.  It's easy to empty, easy to clean, and we almost never have a problem concerning the height of the splash guard.  This is one of the best purchases I've made for him!
4	1255392000	I am getting ready to potty train my 2 year old girl.  I've owned two other potty chairs for my 4 year son, but wanted to try this particular chair.  It looked more durable, simple, and I love the colors.  I have no need for the bells and whistles of the new chairs.Also, I have been a fan of Bjorn for their infant carriers and their AWESOME plastic bibs.  So far, the chair seems stable and sturdy.  My girl sometimes has a hard time getting her leg over the 'splash guard' - which I think would be great if Bjorn made the bowl versitle, with the splash guard on one end for boys and one without on the other end for girls. I've tried to turn it but it doesn't fit in the chair right.  But otherwise, so far so good.
5	1255305600	I looked for a few days and read lots of reviews. The potty chairs I thought I'd like had horrible reviews. I have a boy so I needed something is a higher guard. This has a nice high guard. He doesn't have a problem sitting down on it. Its simple and easy to clean with no hidden spots for potty to hide, like a lot of the potty chairs I looked at. He likes to stand up to potty and he has no problem with that either. I have had it a couple months and still haven't found anything I don't like about it. It even has a skid-proof bottom so it doesn't slide around on slippery bathroom tiles when he's trying to sit.If you want a simple design, easy to clean, reasonably priced potty, I would recommend this one. If you want to entice your child with their favorite character/s get some stickers. There is ample blank space to decorate it.
5	1255219200	This potty chair is wonderful. I went through three other potties before I found this one. I have a little boy and there are no more accidental mistakes on the floor.
2	1254268800	My son is 50th percentile for weight and height, so pretty average sized for a 2 year old.  As lots of reviewers have mentioned, the height of this potty is great, the handholds on the side are a help, the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there, and the back WOULD be nice except...There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat, so that when my son sits on it, the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back.  The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this.  Even when he does not get pinched, he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs, and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all.  Therefore I cannot comment whether the pee goes into the bowl, because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting, I thought it would be really easy--just pull the bowl out, dump it out, wipe, disinfect with clorox on occasion...BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl, necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well, which is just a pain.Finally, the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son's legs and he stands up.I cannot say, however, if there is anything better out there--we haven't found the "perfect" potty yet, but if this is the best of the portable potties, I guess we're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet, because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us.
5	1253145600	That's not true for all potty seats (some seem better designed for girls than boys), but since we have B/G twins and ideally wanted matching seats, we researched exhaustively. The Baby Bjorn Potty Chair was an excellent purchase and made potty training relatively easy.It's also attractive, comfortable, and cleans easily. 5 stars.We had red and blue but there are more color choices now, and note also that certain colors go on sale from time to time.
5	1253059200	My goal was comfort and safty for my son and cleaniness; this lil potty accomplishes that and more.  There are no frills with this potty except its safe and oh so easy to clean.  There are only two pieces, i love the lil cup that is attached to the front of the potty (no flying pee-pee accidents), safe smooth lines no cuts (yes I've read some pottys cut a babys bottom!), no messes (pick up the cup and flush.)I can't think of any cons to this potty.  I love this potty.
5	1252713600	This is the potty chair to get. It doesn't cost that much more than the Target one we originally got, but it is way, way better. It really is ergonomically superior. I completely recommend it.
5	1252713600	This is the only potty chair you will ever want or need!  My two children (ages 3 and 2) loved their chairs and were potty trained in no time using the Baby Bjorn potty chairs.  I previously purchased one that played songs when they went potty, but I quickly found it was very difficult to clean and to move around the house (too many parts). I loved the fact that is was so very easy to clean - no cracks or grooves or lids to worry about!  And I loved the portability of the chair.  It is lightweight and easy to move around the house (I would use it in the children's playroom when they could not make it to the bathroom). The Baby Bjorn could easily be used in your vehicle as well. Great simple design and very comfortable for the children to use as well.  Two thumbs up!
1	1252195200	I started out my son with elimination communication (EC aka early start potty training, of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject) when he was 6 wks old.  We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was "weird" - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers.  I could really kick myself now that he's 2 and many many poop diapers later!  Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down.  The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family, TERRIBLE for toddlers!  After he bumped it sitting down I couldn't get him near the potty for weeks.  I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead.  I didn't put batteries in it - too much for me.  I love it.  My son actually uses it.  It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd.  Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face.  I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now.  And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training.  Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways.
5	1251676800	Son has only sat on it a few times. Slow going in getting him potty trained so don't have a ton of info to give.
4	1251676800	its a good potty seat.Could have been much better with a lid that is why 4 stars..other than that great item
5	1251158400	i used this to train our third child.  this is by far the best potty i have ever used, especially for a boy. save your money and don't get roped in to buying one with all the "extras"- they come in too many pieces and the flip up and down shields serve as a distraction and can cause injury.  this potty is simply designed with a built in shield that is high enough to block the stream.  just lift out the bowl and empty-very easy to clean.  i bought two so i could have one upstairs and downstairs.  my child was trained in one week! well worth the money.
5	1250985600	This has been our saving grace on the road, anywhere when your kids wait until the last possible minute to go to the bathroom and then your running frantically, while they are crying. Keep it in the car trunk- you won't be sorry, along with some wipes- It's been the smartest thing I figured out as a mom.
5	1250726400	We used this mainly as a car potty because my son did not like loud flushing public restrooms.  It is very lightweight but sturdy in the back of our SUV, seems comfortable and we never had any leaking/tipping/splashing issues.  This chair is super easy to clean thanks to its lack of moving parts.  I'd buy it again.
5	1250553600	I orignally bought the baby bjorn seat for the toilet. My daughter was afraid to go on the big potty, so I bought this potty. She sat in it right away. Now that she is getting older, she alternates between the two units. I prefer the seat, since it is less clean up but I let her choose. As long as she is going potty, I don't care.I haven't had an issues with this unit and I like baby bjorn products. I also have 2 step stools, which are great and the baby carrier, which I loved when my daughter was smaller.
5	1250035200	This is the fourth style of potty we tried and the first one without a major problem. As others have noted this is especially good for boys. If you have a boy, don't waste your time on the other choices. This wins easily.
5	1249948800	This is a great potty.  The biggest issue to me was cleaning.  This chair has no seems or corners to trap things.  The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth.  The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on.  The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all.  It also looks comfortable with the arm rests.  My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it.  He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book.  Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise.
5	1249862400	My little girls likes using this over the other potty that we got, personally i think it works better than other, cheaper ones, i like the hard seat so she doesnt want to sit there forever, and it forces her to get in the proper "position" which she doesnt always achieve the other potty.
1	1249171200	So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty.  I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean.  But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt.  What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep.  Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared.  She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her.  Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it.  It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt.  I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success.
1	1248307200	I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably.
5	1248134400	Our first potty for our daughter had one of those squishy foam-type seats. We thought that would be more comfortable, but soon realized it just irritated her bum. It had a huge reservoir, was a pain to dump and clean, and that foam part was always getting dirty and could never be completely cleaned.A friend had a Baby Bjorn, and seemed happy with it, so we gave it a try. My daughter chose her own color - I love that there are so many options - and we ended up with a green one. She loves this potty. It seems comfortable, and she doesn't get that red ring around her bottom from sitting on it. And best of all, it's SO EASY TO CLEAN. The reservoir is compact and can be rinsed in a small bathroom sink, but holds plenty. If you forget to dump it once, it won't overflow on the second use.My first daughter still prefers this potty over using the adult one. She's 3.5, and big for her age. The size of this potty is very versatile, and I think it will last her a good while longer if she needs it to.Now my second daughter is getting to the potty-training age (18 months), and we've invested in a second one in her favorite color, yellow (it's actually a lovely shade). The same potty that can accomodate my preschooler works just as well for my little toddler, and that's a great feature.I have zero complaints about the Bjorn potty. It's absolutely worth the extra money.
5	1247270400	For nearly a year, I have been struggling to help my now three-year-old become potty trained.  We have tried four other potty seats, and all have proved difficult to use:-We first tried the Primo Ducka toilet seat (looks like a duck), and while it was cute and engaging, he could not climb on the toilet to use it by himself, and it often directed the liquid flow right between the toilet and seat (what a mess!).-Next, we used an old-fashioned wooden potty chair (the kind with a high back and arm rests), but this had a separate plastic guard that hurt my son and also allowed liquid to leak.-The third potty chair we tried was the Baby Bjorn Little Potty, which slid too easily on our bathroom floor, was too low to the ground, and always allowed liquid to drip along the outside when tipped in the toilet during cleaning.-My son did enjoy the next potty - a "Peter Potty" toddler urinal.  It was great fun to stand like Daddy, and it even had a water tank so that it could be "flushed" like a real potty.  After several months, however, the top water tank started dripping often, and the bottom reservoir was so hard to pull out that when it finally let loose, liquid sloshed out!Frustrated, I set out to scour Amazon for one final shot at a potty that would work for my son and would be easy to clean.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided upon the Baby Bjorn potty chair, allowed my son to be involved by selecting a color (blue)...and couldn't be happier with our choice!My son has been excited about his new blue Baby Bjorn potty chair since the UPS driver brought it to our house, and I am impressed as well.  This potty chair is tall enough that it is comfortable for him to sit upon, there are no separate guards that pinch him, the rubber bottom prevents it from sliding on our floor, it has a back and armrests that help my son stand up after going potty, he can use it by himself, AND it's super easy to clean!  I have found that if you pour the liquid out the back of the potty chair insert (where the white bowl curves upward), the liquid does not run down the outside of the container like other potty chairs.Overall, while a bit pricey, this is without a doubt the best potty chair we have found for our toddler boy.  I would highly recommend that other parents try this chair before wasting their money on any others!
5	1247184000	My two and half year old son loves the potty chair.  It's our second one and I'd recommend it to anyone.
5	1246924800	This potty is just great.  My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old.  I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she doesn't need me to physically support her when she's on it.  All I have to do is watch her nearby.  It's really well made and very sturdy.  Also, the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess.  She doesn't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing...and she does pretty much without fail.  We haven't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now.  One of the most useful items I bought for the baby!
4	1246320000	I've owned one of the Baby Bjorn potties before, but must have lost it during a move or maybe even given away? This is a replacement for a potty I already had and was greatly looking forward to using again with my toddler son. As others have said, easy to clean and sterilize due to simple design, and comfortable to sit in.I did want to say, though, that the packaging was weird. The potty arrived very quickly thanks to my Prime membership, but upon opening the box I found just some paper filler, and the potty in a plastic bag. No baby bjorn box. I'm sure it's new - I examined the pieces closely and found nothing suspect. I'd just feel more confident with this had it arrived packaged in an original box. This is not the sort of item you'd want to buy if you knew it had been returned already used. Amazon's description does say they don't accept this on returns, so okay, but still....
4	1246320000	We got this in hopes of potty training our 2 year old daughter.  So far she's loved to sit on it and read.  Hopefully once we start training it will prove very useful.
5	1246233600	This a nicely molded piece of plastic- simple, no sharp edges.  Just the right size.  Our son started sitting on it for pracice at 11 mo.  His feet can be on the ground and hye likes to sit on it.  The pail comes out easily to  dump and the bottom has rubber, so it doesn't slip on the floor. Shield is also high enough for potty.
2	1245974400	this potty came highly recommended and its pretty well made FOR GIRLS. however my son never sites for peepee, the pee goes between the removable part and the chair and ends up on the floor under the chair! when he sits down to make #2 his pee goes all over the place since the peepee "high" part is not high enough. if you have a girl this should not be a problem but if your boy is just starting to to go to the potty and you dont know if he will be standing or sitting, I WOULD NOT GO WITH THIS POTTY!!!!
4	1245888000	She's still being potty trained, but she likes to sit on the chair. Easy to clean. The only draw back is that she can play with the removable bowl. She takes it out. It's simple.
4	1245024000	This potty is small but portable. Works well with boys since it has the high guard in front. Easy to clean and the white color is nice so kids can see what they've done. Another plus is that the plastic is able to be recycled when you are finished with it. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.
1	1244937600	My son stands up when he pees (instead of sitting on the chair) and because this bowl is removable, the pee gets thru the cracks and gets all over the floor.  If you have a stander, this is not for you!  I originally bought it because it's a great size, but I found the best luck getting the Baby Bjorn step stool(Love it)and putting it in front of our toilet for him to step up so he can stand and a potty seat with the handles on either side for when he needs to sit down
4	1244851200	My son is just getting started, but he is now wanting to sit on the potty with clothes on about 5 times a day and today he did when he first woke up. The base is nice because it has a grip and does not slide easily. I like the pull out cup too. We got white so it will be the same as everybody and maybe he will feel he is doing the same thing as everyone else. I DO reccommend this potty.
5	1244505600	This is a great potty chair.  I love how it goes up in front for the little boys. The pee shield's not a separate piece so you don't end up cleaning urine out of any cracks or anything.  (The white part is just once piece.)All 3 of my sisters have this same potty chair & also love it!
5	1244332800	I have one upstairs and one downstairs for my twins. I bought this becasue it does not have a stupid character on it, dowes not play stupid music, and doesn't look ridiculous. It looks like a little real toilet. Baby Bjorn is a great company.
3	1244332800	If your son has learned to stand up to go 'peepee', then be prepared for clean up beneath the potty, EVERY TIME he has to go.  Sure, you can teach your son to aim at a sticker or some other object at the bottom of this potty, but if he is in a rush, or I'm not with him every time he has gone, then he'll shoot towards the back of this potty, which then leaks out from the detached piece.  It is a great potty, but I wish I just taught him to go in the big potty from the beginning.
2	1244160000	I bought this potty because I wanted something simple with not too many thrills, but I am disappointed. This potty is very uncomfortable for my daughter. She sits only a few minutes and then she starts complaining that it hurts and when she stands up, she has lots of big red marks. I think it is also small for her, even though she is not a very big girl. Anyway I am getting rid of it and getting something better. Maybe with some kids might work, but I don't feel to recommend it.
5	1243728000	We love this potty.  We've had 4 other potties and this is my favorite.  It is super easy to clean up and the bright colors are great.  My son still loves to sit on his green potty.  He is 28 months and can easily pee, empty it, and rinse it by himself.  I'm not sure what the people who are complaining about pee going over the place but he can do it by himself with no problems.  Just teach the child to sit properly in a chair & make sure it's not hanging out of the potty (taught my son to tuck it in at 18 months so there really is no excuse).  He is about 32 pounds and 36 inches & I'm sure he will be using it at home for a while.  While he's been using the regular toilet for a while too at home, he loves his green potty.  BTW, baby bjorn makes 2 potties (and a ring too) this is the larger one.  If you are wanting a smaller one, there little potty is great but would not recommend it if you are starting with an older child as it is rather small (my son loved it at 15/16 months and will use it now but I don't think I would buy one that small for an older child).
4	1242777600	After reading several reviews I purchased this potty chair. Here are the positives and negatices and why I think is good but not great.Positives:1- REALLY EASY TO CLEAN. This chair is just two pieces both solid plastic. Super easy to wipe down or rinse out with bleach.2- DOESN'T COLLECT ODORS. Because it is solid plastic and no soft foam, it does not collect odors.3- SOLID WON'T TIP. The design is great. It doesn't tip over when child gets in or out. It grips the floor well and is hard to shove around4- SUPER PORTABLE, LOW PROFILE. It's a small, but not the smallest potty out there... they make a smaller one piece potty and it is super portable because of that. It also does not take up much room in the bathroom.Negatives1- BUILT IN SPLASH GUARD. Because the splash guard is built in, it can be hard for little ones to get on and off. My infant son started potty training at a year and even though he was a walker he could not get his leg over the splash guard to sit down - which discouraged him from sitting.2- BUILT IN SPLASH GUARD AGAIN. The spash guard can hurt a little guys parts when they stand up. My son bumped himself several times which discourages him from using it. Now that he is a bit older (17mo) this is less of an issue but be aware of this for the young ones.
5	1242691200	We've had several potty chairs and I'd say I like this one best. It has a high back and armrests, making it comfortable for my daughter to sit. There aren't a whole lot of cracks and crevices, which makes it easy to clean. The chair is sturdy and doesn't tip over. It is larger than some of the other chairs, which were a little too small as my daughter grew. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this chair first._________________UPDATE:  This chair eventually went to my niece and nephew.  It had been a good potty chair and I was happy to share my good find with my sister-in-law.  She agreed it is a good chair.
5	1240963200	I chose this potty for my son after reading the glowing reviews online and I was not disappointed.  It is sturdy, easy to clean, easy for my son to get onto and the splash guard in front keeps the pee in the toilet.  What more could I ask for?
5	1240876800	My son loves this potty and I love it since it's so easy to keep clean!!!  My 2 year old can even dump it himself without making a mess.
5	1240704000	I resisted shelling out the dough for this chair for as long as I could. I have twins and paying this much for potty chairs was something I wasn't going to do if I could help it. So first I bought the potty chair from Ikea. While the cost was amazing, I mean who can beat $4 (!) it was waaaaay too small and my son and daughter just wouldn't sit on it (and they aren't even large toddlers). Then I bought the Bjorn junior, and it also was too small. So I finally broke down and bought the full size chair. Wow! What a difference! My son immediately wanted to sit and go potty. It was the first time he peed in a potty and he was so proud of himself. He sat for quite awhile and read a book. So did my daughter. It was obvious that they were comfortable on the chair and that made mommy happy, too. I also like the high back on this chair, as my kids are given a sticker every time they goe potty and they stick them on the back so they can see them. I would definitely buy this chair again!
1	1240272000	we bought this one for my son who is 3. it is too small for him. the pee comes right over the pee guard. they should have made the pee guard a little bigger and the seat bigger too. my son weighs about 39 lbs.
5	1240099200	I got this for my 14-month-old daughter.  Right now it just sits in the bathroom for her to get used to... she hasn't "used" it yet.  It's plain, simple, and unintimidating.  I think it will be a good potty for us.
5	1239667200	My son hasn't used it yet, but I'm sure it will be great when he does.  It had a lot of good reviews.  The only downside I see so far is that he always wants to lift the tray out and play with it.  I'm hoping he won't do that when there is "stuff" in there.
5	1239580800	This potty is perfect.  Has the right size for a toddler (my son is an average size boy for his age- 16 months) and it is easy to clean and use.  My son used it immediately after getting it and was not afraid of sitting on it.  I'm very happy with this purchase and will totally recommend it to anyone.
5	1238889600	I purchased a couple different potty chairs, with no luck.  The splash guard would fall down or off, so when I saw this one I bought it.  It works the best of all I've found.  Plus, it's nice for "reward stickers".
5	1238889600	We've tried two before...the on-the-toilet, a branded version (Dora) and this version is so clean, simple and fits the little toddler body perfectly. Easy to clean and small enough to put anywhere in the house. I've since purchase multiple versions for each location and even drop shipped one for a vacation.
5	1238803200	I was worried about finding the right potty seat for my son when I read all the reviews about them hurting or scraping their "privates".  My mother-in-law found this on at an outlet store for $7 (brand new) so I wanted to try it for price alone.  It is wonderful!  My 2 year old learned quickly and now goes by himself.  We have a potty seat too, but with this he can go completely on his own.  I highly recommend this product!!!
1	1238716800	BabyBj&ouml;rn Potty Chair - BlueMy baby is 12 months and 24lbs.  The splash card is not even close to being tall enough to work. Seat is also small.  He just fits with no room to spare.  Very disappointed
5	1238716800	Before buying this potty I read a review that it was not designed for boys in mind, and that the deflector is hurting boys...well we had to buy a potty anyway, and after my first purchase almost a year ago, when I got Safety First potty, I really took time looking both in the shops and online. The problem with the Safety first potty is that they should have called it Hurting first potty, because the deflector there is just horrible- thin, with sharp edges and literally looks like it is designed to deprive boys of their private parts. Besides that, it just can not stay in place- I tried sticking it with tape, and the hole was way too small- my baby could fit either the back or the front side, but not both. So keeping the fingers crossed, I decided to try now Baby Bjorn potty- we had a carrier before, and it was perfect , and when the potty arrived I knew I made a right choice- it is very ergonomically designed, and my boy absolutely loved it and sat there from the first time without hurting himself on deflector- plus it is much harder to hurt yourself on this kind of deflector that "hurting first" one. And since that he sat there many many times, and never even touched it- and he goes into it also without any mess, as some of the reviews say.It is very comfortable and the hole is oval shaped and large enough, and it has space for him to grow- and I 've got a big boy, 27 pounds and 90% on his height...
5	1237593600	we just started potty training and are doing great on this potty.  very smart design can remove the middle and wash it seperately.
3	1236729600	My little two year old daughter is...well...LITTLE.  I bought this potty based on the excellent reviews here and for the most part, it delivered.1. It was relatively inexpensive.2. No bells and whistles to distract.3. Easy to clean.But, being that my kiddo is a shrimp AND a girl, the molded splash guard thing kept poking her in a highly uncomfortable way when she'd try to sit on this thing and it got to the point where when she'd see this potty she'd scream.  As a test, we got the pink girly version of the Summer 3 stage potty trainer and the screaming stopped.I'd recommend taking a look at this thing at a local store before buying.  It's a pretty good product, it just didn't work for us.
5	1236384000	This was my second purchase of a BabyBjorn potty chair.  I had bought my daughter one when she began potty training my 2 year old grandson, but not one for my home.  I was using a potty insert and a stool and found little Ben was having trouble getting on.  I asked how the BabyBjorn was working and she told me he uses it only.  She was so right, I am so happy to have purchased this; mine is blue and her's is red.  He loves it; it is sturdy, easy to clean, and does not move when he sits down or gets up.Wonderful item and I highly recommend for the daunting task of potty training!  I plan on this being my number #1 baby shower gift from now on!
5	1236211200	I bought both the little potty and the bigger bjorn potty simultaneously for my 10 month old son about 3 months ago.  We had started doing EC as it was pretty obvious when he had to go.  Anyway I think the little potty is a nice size and great for travel but much prefer the bigger potty at home as it has anti-slip stuff on the bottom of it an the back frame it a little more supportive.  Given his constant movement at this age it is a big help on my tile and wood floors having that extra grip.
5	1236124800	My son was being very stubborn about training. We finally go him this seat in green (now dubbed the nighttime potty) and in red (for mornings of course). He loves using them, and we are thrilled that he is finally finally training.They are a snap to clean. we use clorox anywhere to spritz, wipe and disinfect.I highly recommend these!!!btw, my older son is egging the little one on. THey have decided to make good use of our two potty living room. They Wii while they wee.anything that works.
5	1236124800	I originally bought a seat that fits on the toilet and a large stepping stool to save myself from having to clean out a potty seat. This worked fine when I was placing my daughter onto the toilet, but she is too small to climb up by herself, especially with pants around her ankles.This potty is much better as it allows her to develop the skill of taking her pants down herself and sitting on the potty. We got the white one to match our bathroom and my daughter loves the teddy on the front. She is comfortable sitting on it, and empties it into the toilet herself. The potty comes out of the seat easily, and is very easy to wipe clean.
5	1235865600	I got this potty chair for my daughter when she started potty training at 19 months. She never complained about sitting on it and I loved how high it sat because she is extremely tall for her age. She is able to pull the little bucket out and dump it herself now without making a mess. We recently started toilet training with the baby bjorn toilet seat and it was a good transition for her and she still likes to use her little green potty for her #2's because she doesn't like people helping her in that area. It is a great chair and worth the extra few dollars.
5	1235433600	I was so happy when we got this chair delivered! My daughter loved it instantly. We took it with us on vacation and it was easy to stick in the car and so great to have when needing to stop and have in the hotel room. The easy to pick up potty bowl makes dumping and cleaning so much easier. I love all Baby Bjorn products!!
5	1235260800	This is by far the best potty chair out there! It comes in many different colors and my daughter picked pink. It is very easy for kids to sit on, so easy to empty, and no room for leaking on the floor like the models that have the slide in catch area.I have a daycare and all of my parents have purchased this potty after seeing how great it works! Great chair at a wonderful price!
5	1235174400	I love the simplicity of this potty.  It has a nice high back.  The removable seat makes it easy to clean out, but is nice and secure when my son is sitting.  The bottom has a rubber no-slip trim which is great for any kind of flooring. Perfect size for a toddler.
5	1235088000	Thanks to this potty, my son no longer looks like a gorilla sitting on a donut (husband's words)!!! I love that I don't have to keep telling him to "point it down" anymore because of the design. He sits very comfortable on it despite the fact that he's only 2, and the size of a 3 1/2 year old. The best thing is...it's super easy to clean!!!
4	1235001600	For the most part, I really like this chair.  My son is an average size two-year-old, and he fits really well on it.  I also LOVE that the guard is permanent, rather than a flap that can fall off or be played with. Also, this chair is really easy for my son to get on and off of by himself, with the rubber lining on the bottom for holding the chair in place.The only thing I don't like is that if he sits on it for more than 30 seconds, it leaves a red ring around his bottom.  He'll sit on it through a whole book or two, but if he hasn't done his business by then, I'm usually out of luck because the potty starts hurting his bottom and he wants to get off.All in all, a great, simple product.  Not sure it's totally worth the amount of money I paid (kind of expensive), but my son likes it for short periods of time, so that's helpful in the potty training experience.
4	1235001600	This is the second one of these we purchased on amazon for our second daughter.  I wish I had bought one of these for my first!  They are the best!  Super easy to clean, very stable- much better than all the others. We've had many others and they all went in the trash when we got the second one of these.  Try it- you won't be sorry!
5	1234396800	This is great. My 11 month old girl loves it. She does not want to get up until she does something. Easy to clean. It would be even better if it was little bigger.
5	1234137600	Great Potty. I got this to get my son used to the idea of using a potty and he loves sitting on it. It's nice and roomy and is easy to clean. Just 2 pieces.
4	1233792000	Right now the potty is still a toy to put things in and take things out of, I'm sure it will function fine as a potty when we get to that stage.
5	1233619200	This is the 3rd potty seat we've tried - others failed because the cup in front was not tall enough for a little boy, no back support for him to sit there for a while, etc. I wish we had gotten this one first - don't be fooled by it's simple design and the extra money. You're going to save more than that by just heading straight to the one that works. This one was also much easier to clean than the other ones.
4	1233273600	My son is 20 months and figured it was time to start to potty training. The best thing about the chair is, he's not afraid of it.Just be aware it has some size to it. Other than that it's been GREAT!
5	1233014400	This is the best potty chair design i have ever seen.This is the simplest one to use.It is only two parts and makes cleanup a breeze!
4	1232928000	This product replaced our old chair which came apart to be cleaned and somehow always had urine seeping to places besides the bowl. The Baby Bjorn only has one removable piece, and everything is always in the bowl. I love how simplistic it is. The sizable "horn" on the front of the bowl keeps the firing zone covered for little boys which is a major bonus.My son is on medication which causes difficulty going. I decided that he may have success (and better health) if he were able to sit on a potty and relax. My concern before I ordered the chair was that it would not fit him properly since he is only 14 months old. Needless to say, we now are proud owners of a Baby Bjorn potty, and my baby puts a proud "poo poo" in it every day. The design is perfect for any little person to straddle, and their feet can rest on the floor so that they are confident and not afraid to fall off. This also gives them leverage for a "good push".
3	1232496000	I purchased three of these chairs so that I could have one on each floor of the house. It was the best chair I could find on the market and had some of the best reveiws I saw.  It is overall a decent potty chair.  I have two young boys. One successfully potty trained on this chair and one is still in the process.  While my overall view is positive and I would buy it again, here are my areas of concern:-My kids didn't want to sit and go potty. They wanted to stand like daddy and big brother.  On occasions where they have missed the bowl and hit the back of the chair, the liquid leaks underneath the bowl and goes right to the floor/towel/mat whatever happens to be underneath at the time.-While this chair only has two pieces, there are many ledges that urine can get to that can create colonies of bacteria.  I just wanted to mention this because I have to clean the entire chair every single time just to make sure nothing was missed.- The bowl could be a bit deeper for #2.  Enough said.This is otherwise a great seat and I would buy it again.
5	1232496000	My 18 month old daughter loves her new potty. She sits in it a couple times a day. I love the fact that it has the rubber bottom so it won't slide around on the kitchen floor. And no matter how she climbs on it she can't seem to tip it over. Its great. We have the green one, its a little lighter in color then the picture online.
5	1232409600	My 10 months old bay just likes this potty. It is a very good choice.
5	1231718400	This has worked great for our tall average weight 20 month old girl.  She can easily sit on it herself.  The pull out bowl and simple lines make it very easy to clean.  Sculpted handle in back allows easy carry to other parts of the house if needed.  Very stable.
5	1231632000	This product is so awsome I acually bought 3 of them for my daughter. One for home, and one for each grandparent's house. Adorable, practical, easy to use and clean. Also very durable if you have one of "those kids." Good price, ready for potty-training. You can't go wrong with this product.
4	1231286400	my 13 month old likes to sit on it, even though we're WAY early...also wears the removable potty part for a hat.  maybe in a year or two...seems like a nice comfy product though - look forward to using it when the time's right.  maybe i can review it again then.
5	1231200000	We started out with the BabyBjorn Jr. and advanced to this one.  These are the best potty chairs made.  The kids feel really comfortable sitting in them and they feel safe since their feet can touch the floor and it is very stable.  At 9 months my 2nd granddaughter is already using the Jr. version and my 2 and 1/2 year old potty trained at a year and has just now switched to the regular size model.
5	1231200000	It took some searching but finally I found a potty that didn't sing or dance or have a mini toilet roll holder, and that was large enough to be comfortable for a nearly 3 year old boy.  This potty is perfect and simple - doesn't slip, doesn't topple, has a slightly elongated shape which is great for the older toddler, is easy to clean and thank goodness - doesn't sing!
5	1231200000	Baby Bjorn Potty Chair - GreenI went through two pottys for my son before i came across this one. it fits him perfect, and he just loves it. would recommend it to everyone.
5	1230681600	We used this potty chair for both of our daughters, who potty trained at about 2.5 years old.  Its simple design is absolutely ideal for use and cleaning.  It's comfortable for toddlers to sit in, as well as easy for them to lift out the bowl and empty into the toilet themselves.  The splash guard molded as part of the bowl is excellent, providing protection as well as not being an impediment to the child sitting down.  (I can't speak for how much protection it offers for little boys, however.)  The smooth plastic without any real corners or edges makes cleaning effortless.  Plus, the rubber bottom really does keep the seat from slipping across the floor.  Plus, as an added bonus, it resembles the potty seat depicted in the "Once Upon A Potty" video, so the kids can easily connect the concept to real life.  I highly recommend it, and can't imagine using any other seat!
5	1230508800	I love this potty chair.  My son is very tall for his age and was too small for the other chairs.  When he would sit on them his little hoo-ha would hang over the edge and he would end up peeing all over the floor.  This potty is such a great chair.  The oval shape allows plenty of room for boy's parts.  He can even swirm around on the chair and I don't have to worry about pee on the floor.  It's great.
5	1230336000	I bought this potty seat for my second child.  It is the perfect size and it is easy to clean.  Nothing fancy which is perfect.  I really like the no skid surface which prevents the seat from sliding around on the floor.
5	1229817600	I cannot believe I spent so much money in potty chairs and potty training solutions before! My son, who is three, had been potty trained at school for over a year yet will not go potty at home. We bought everything you can imagine to motivate him and get him interested. Nothing worked. I read somewhere that kids may find some potty chairs uncomfortable or too baby-like. I read the positive reviews about the Bjorn chair and, since it was so inexpensive, I decided to give it a try. My son chose the color he liked (green) and started using it since it arrived. He was so comfortable when using it that he would take all the time he needed (sometimes he would even read a book while seated). He was off diapers in just a couple of weeks. It is also great to keep next to his bed during the night while he gets night trained as well. It is very easy to clean and disinfect, both the bowl and the frame, and it actually has a sleek design. I give it five stars!UPDATE:My son is still using this potty chair TWO YEARS LATER! We keep it in his bedroom for night use. I keep spraying some Chlorox to disinfect it every day and it is still in mint condition. Cannot believe it!
5	1229644800	I really love this potty chair. We are potty training our 20 month old son and this chair is awesome. It is very comfortable and my son loves using it. I have heard that other chairs cause problems for boys, but this chair works perfectly for my son. The pee stays in the potty and it is super easy to clean. I would recommend this potty to anyone wanting to potty train!
3	1229558400	Our 21 month old uses this potty all day long. She was potty trained early and seems to like it pretty well. I bought it b/c of all the great reviews! The only problem she has with this potty is that it pinches her when she sits on it wrong. The bucket part would come up a bit if she moved around and that's when she would get pinched. It's happened a few times. It pinched her finger as she was sitting down and then it happened to her little leg. That's the only issue I really have with it and that's why I'd give it 3 stars. Before that, I had no complaints.
5	1229472000	This is the second potty that I bought. I started with the Fisher Price Fun and Learn potty. My son hated it. I bought the white Bjorn potty chair. I let my son put Thomas the Train stickers all over it. Now, he loves it.
4	1229299200	I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design.
5	1229299200	This potty chair is great!  My son is a big kid at 2, and the other chairs I purchased were way too small for him to get his whole behind on.  Plus, this seat is oval so it gives him plenty of room for his "baby boy parts" without scraping or squishing him, and plenty of room to keep the potty from splashing out.  He has never complained about sitting on this chair, and will sit there for ages while we wait!  A great product!
5	1229040000	My son loves this potty and I think it's easy to clean.  we have several around the house and even have one for the car.
5	1228694400	I had very high hopes for my son in terms of potty training so this pretty and sleek BabyBjorn potty was purchased when he was less than a year old. Needless to say, it stood unused for quite some time until he realized that in order to become a 'big boy' he needed to master the very adult art of toilet training. Here are the reasons why I think this potty served as a positive enforcement in his determination to achieve this complex task:1.  The potty has no useless bells and whistles. I remember going through the toilet isle at my local Babies'R'Us and could not comprehend why a child would need flashing lights and music to sit on a potty.  Toilet should serve one purpose and one purpose only (I won't spell out exactly what), and too much stimulation takes away from the real function of the apparatus.2. BabyBjorn people really understand male anatomy. My mom got another potty for when my son visited and returned it after the first try when her living room rug ended up covered in you know what. Boys need higher tabs in the front of the potty, and BabyBjorn is an excellent example of good design.  We've never had an accident at home.3. The potty is easy to clean. It consists of two parts: the base chair and a removable bowl. There are practically no nooks and crannies for dirt to accumulate making it very useful for a busy mom.4. My son is very comfortable sitting on it. The high back support and no slip rubbery bottom make it a happy and easy experience for him.  It's so durable that he usually just uses it by himself without me present when the inspiration hits.  I just leave it in the family room where he plays and he calls me after the deed is done to clean up. Works out for both of us :)So overall, this is an excellent potty. The BabyBjorn products are usually on the expensive side, but are well worth the extra couple of dollars. The higher price accounts for exceptional design, which other companies tend to forego.
5	1228521600	Really like it.  The front barrier needs to be a little higher for boys but otherwise, it's easy to clean and my toddler loves the red color.  It also helps that it matches my bathroom!
5	1228176000	After countless searches for potty styles and reviews, I decided to purchase the babybjorn potty chair for my 2.5 yrs toddler boy.  I wanted something simple with no frills/noises/characters, plus I wanted an easy on/off for the potty insert.  This one is great with one piece insert vs. others with 2 parts for the insert (splash guard).  My toddler and I went on babybjorn's website to see the various screens of toddlers using their pottys.  I let my toddler pick out the color, he wanted orange which they didn't have, so he decided instead on the blue. The potty is very roomy and there's no worry of a tip over.  To start, I have my toddler sit on the potty every evening before his bath....he loves it and can't wait to sit on his very own potty!  I would definitely recommend this one vs all those others that are too distracting to any toddler.
5	1228176000	This is our daughter's second potty chair, and I'm so glad we bought it.  We started with the Safety 1st Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty, because I thought she would like the soft seat.  That seat, however, is a ring that does not stay in place very well.  She always chooses this Baby Bjorn potty over the other chair.  It is simple to use and very easy to clean.
4	1228176000	I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.
5	1228003200	BabyBj&ouml;rn Potty Chair - BlueThis potty seat is awesome.  I bought it for my nine month old and he loves to sit on it and pee in it before bathtime.
5	1227916800	We love this chair.  We used a couple of other chairs with our older daughter and they just were not as stable or as easy to sit down on.  This chair is also very easy to clean.
4	1227916800	This seat has a large oval opening which allows plenty of room for little boys to scoot around.
4	1227398400	This is a great potty chair.  It's comfortable for my son to sit on.  However, it could use more of a "splashguard" in the front.
5	1227312000	We threw out another brand to get a second one of these for our upstairs bathroom.  Little to no extra mess to clean up.
5	1226620800	This is an excellent potty chair. My grandson isnt afraid to sit on it at all. I think potty training with"his special chair" will be a breeze...One can only hope!
4	1226534400	My son loves it. Only problem is he does not want to get off of it. Makes it a little difficult to clean but at least he has not rejected the idea of using it.
5	1226448000	If you need a potty chair BUY this one. My son is 2 1/2 but very tall and a "big boy"- this chair sits up higher than the othe baby bjorn seat-which is nice, he looks comfy sitting in it -which is all helpful when learning to go potty. I tried other seats ( too low, not comfy) and read review on how this sat higher and it has a built in splash guard style seat and it seperate so it can be dumped and cleaned easily.
5	1226361600	I have a 2 year old son and he loves this potty.  We have one for our house and one at his grandparents house.  I thought it was a little pricey compared to the other models but I just didn't like the other options.  I love that there are just two pieces and it's a cinch to clean. My little boy loves dumping it himself in the big potty. The pot is one piece with a built in boy shield that is just the right size.  We have tried another potty with the removeable shield and he could not back into the seat and sit down without knocking off the guard.  I would highly recommend this Potty to everyone, try this one before you try anything else.
5	1226188800	Best potty chair for little boys. After buying several potty chairs and returning them because the font shield wasn't tall enough ,we purchased this chair. We are hapy to say that are no more messes to clean up. Grandma in Iowa.
5	1225843200	I love this potty chair.  It's been very simple to clean and my 14 month old daughter seems to be comfortable sitting on it.  She's more than willing to sit and go potty whenever she is sat on it.  It doesn't move around much on the floor as it has a rubbery strip to keep it from moving.  I also enjoy the fact that the bowl in it doesn't move around inside the chair so no accidental spill, misses, etc.  The edges of the bowl are slanted and when you dump the contents into the toilet you don't get drips like you would on a flat edged one.
5	1225670400	If you are looking for a bigger potty, this is it. I don't think it's possible to find a larger one. I am so glad I bought this potty. I went to several different stores and put my son on so many potties after I had already bought 3 and took them back. They are all so tiny it is ridiculous!!! I was getting so ticked off. My son was just over 2 1/2 years old and he is skinny. I guess they make the potties like everything else in this micro mini world we live in. This fits my son well and he likes it. I love the built in pee pee guard, he can't remove it. He loves to bring the insert to me and show off his accomplishments. My son is now 31 1/2 pounds and just over 37 inches tall and he is very comfortable on this potty. Thank God and Baby Bjorn for this potty. I don't know what I would have done.
5	1225584000	We have tried four different potty chairs for our sons and this potty seat far surpasses them all!The seat has been a perfect size for our two year old,but it is also big enough for our taller three year old to use.The actual opening is great because instead of being small and round like many potty's, it has a much larger oval opening which seems to catch everything much better.  Also has a nice urine guard on the front(although it is not as tall as I thought it would be) that they have NEVER urinated over the top or side of, which is pretty amazing!All the other potty's we had a problem with b/c they had the guard that can detach and it always ended up down inside and I would have to dig it out,gross!I also like the removable pot to dump,makes it very easy to use/clean.The bottom has grippers so the chair doesn't move around,which makes them feel more stable.Has a high back and sides for feeling more comfortable as they can rest their backs and hold on the sides.My 2 year old didn't like other potty's b/c they pinch or were uncomfortable, but this seat he said is "comfy". Overall a great chair,although I wouldn't mind the "pee guard" being a little higher just to be safe,wasn't as high as expected based on reviews!
5	1225238400	i love this potty.  baby bjorn makes great products.  the quality is fantastic.  this will last all of my children's potty training years.  my son was 8 1/2 months old when i got it.  i put him on it immediately.  he really liked it.  i want to make potty training fun and introduce it early to make it familiar.  i have not put it in the bathroom yet, just in his bedroom.  oh, and it matches the colors in his bedroom.  i like the fact that the white bowl can come out to dump in toilet, rather than just a one piece potty.  he has not really USED it, so i cannot comment on the actual functionality.  but i am looking forward to potty training with this potty.
5	1224892800	This "potty chair" is light weight, yet sturdy.  It is easy to clean and has simple lines so that the entire chair can be cleaned easily, if need be.  It stays put with the rubber stoppers on the bottom.  Great chair!!
5	1224806400	If I were to design a potty chair it would look something like this one.  It's simple, big enough for boys (I hate those tiny bowls that somehow boys are supposed to pee in) and easy to clean.  Perfect, what can I say more?
5	1223510400	Bought this training potty to start introducing our 16 month old daughter to the potty.  She loves this little pink seat and took right to it.  It's easy to clean and easy for her to use.  The little bump in the front of the seat can be a little tricky for her but other than that, we are really happy with it!
3	1223164800	I bought this product but ended up sending it back because it didn't have a lid.  My son loves saying "bye,bye pee pee" and shuting the lid so this wasn't the one for him.  I ended up buying the primo seat which is a multi-use seat.  The seat comes out and can go on the big toilet, it has handles and you can use the potty for a stool.  My son uses it to brush his teeth and to get up to the big potty.
5	1222992000	We all love this potty, my daughter tries it everyday. She carries it around and has her dolly use it also. Great Shape, color, and durability.
5	1221782400	This potty chair is easy to clean and kids love to use it!  It is convenient and easy enough to take on the go.
5	1220918400	Nice design and easy for child to sit on.Does not take up much room in bathroom.
5	1220572800	I highly recommend this product!It did meet all my expectations!Easy to clean,sturdy,comfy and most of all my daughter loooves it!As soon as I put her in it ,she knew what it was for, rather than those other ones with all the bells and wistles that just distract them! Great product
5	1220313600	My son loves this potty seat. He even dumps his pee in the toilet himself and then flushes. No more diapers at home at 18 month. Can't thank the manufacturer enough.
5	1220227200	An excellent product.  Well designed and sturdy.  Our daughter tried several other chairs before finding this one that works perfectly for our grandson, so we bought one as well.  At nearly 3 years old, he is well on his way to being toilet trained thanks to this chair.
5	1219622400	This potty chair is very nice, no cracks or crevices that need to be cleaned.
5	1219104000	I bought this potty as a travel potty for my 3.5 yr old.  He fits on it perfect and it fits in the back nice.  I had a fisher price potty in the back of my SUV before, but the "pee pee guard" kept falling in and the toilet seat lid kept falling down as he went to sit down ... so I really like that this is all one peice. However, we've had one accident with it, my boy forgot to "point it down" and it surged upward and out :o(  gotta watch that!
5	1219017600	Love this potty. No messy parts to clean. Rubber feet grab the floor to prevent slipping when the kid sits down. Large bowl with lip for boys is a  nice feature, no more "flippy" to fish out of the potty bowl. Can't say enough great things about this potty! Buy it already!
5	1218326400	BabyBj&ouml;rn Potty Chair PinkMy granddaughter loved the chair.. at 16 months, she immediately took to the seat. Very easy to keep clean and sanitary, comfortable for little behinds..
5	1217980800	I have a 29 pound, 11 month old and we are beginning to introduce the potty. We've encountered problems with other potty chairs being too small, not sturdy enough, and having a virtually useless splash guard.  After reading reviews on the Baby Bjorn potty chair-it sounded like it had the biggest splash guard in comparison to other potties.  So I ordered one-thinking that if it didn't work, I'd just have to hold my son on the potty each time until he was big enough to go alone.  I didn't like that thought because I think it's important for the potty to be an independent kind of thing.  When it arrived-I loved the design!  It is super easy to clean!  And YAY-the splash guard actually functions as it should.  The whole thing is only 2 pieces.  The base and then the bowl& splash guard.  I put my son on the potty the very night it came in-and it fit him perfectly.  And to make it even better...he went in the potty & NO MESS.  No more mopping the floor each time.  I love it.  I'm so glad to find a potty chair that is suited for big boys!
5	1217376000	As a Mom, I wanted a simple to clean potty.  Just a frame with a removable bowl.  No sliding bowl underneath; no music; no paper holder.I picked up one at the store that was very simple to clean.  It also converted to a stool and seat for the toilet.  Well, we had it about a month before the little boy urinated in it.  It shot right over the top of the guard.After reading other reviews on Amazon, I ordered the Baby Bjorn.  My 2 yr old (26 months) trained himself in about 8 days after we got the new potty.  No messes.  Easy to clean.Side note - 3 weeks later, he prefers to use the 'big potty' and the Baby Bjorn sits idle as an option.
5	1216944000	This was our second attempt at a potty chair. We have been pleased with the design and the size which is larger and therefore more comfortable than the first one we tried. Our toddler likes using it.  A big plus- no bells and whistles and obnoxious cartoon characters. Worth it.
1	1215993600	I bought this potty because it had the best reviews, but almost every time my 2-year-old son uses it, he pees all over the floor instead.  I've tried every position - from putting him way at the back to putting him right up close to it so the shield will "hold" his penis down - no luck!  I actually think it hinders the process since my son freaks when he pees all over himself and the floor.  In addition, we have a marble bathroom floor and I worry it's staining/etching the marble.  I'm throwing it in the dumpster and purchasing a new one!!
5	1215475200	Dont look anywhere else you have found the best potty chair! This is my 3rd child, and I have thrown out all the other seats we have tried with our first 2 because I just was not happy with them. I have tried multiple potty seats, and none of them compare to this one!My 2 year old loves going in and sitting on his chair and feels like such a big boy! I love that the splash guard does not come off where it could easily get lost. I also love the simple clean look to it, very easy to clean no hidden cracks to clean.This item is a must! I wish I had it 7 year ago when I was potty training my first.
5	1215043200	I love this potty. The only problem with it is that I only ordered one! I have twin boys who are 15 months, and after purchasing this potty, I realized I needed 2. I went and bought a different brand at a local store and did not like it. The splash guard made it uncomfortable for my boys to sit on and the seat was so small I didn't think they could go 1 and 2. I took it back and got a another brand and still was not happy. I will be purchasing at least one more. This potty is perfect for my boys!
1	1214352000	This potty chair is terrible.  Small and unstable.  Use this only if you want to have more pee on the floor than in the pot-the splash guard acts more as a projectile ramp for pee than a guard.  it is difficult to clean and the plastic seems to absorb bathroom smells (gross).  I would recommend just getting a mini-toilet seat and putting your kid up on a regular toilet.
5	1214265600	I just LOVE the baby Bjorn Potty Chair.  We have so much baby stuff, some of which we didn't really need, but this is one of the best things we ever purchased.  So easy to clean, doesn't take up too much space, our daughter fit in it from when she was 18 months up to now (she is 4 years-old and about 42" tall), and it provides just enough back support for her to sit without being afraid to fall backwards (when she was younger).  Now our 20 month-old is using it, too, and it still looks almost new!
5	1214265600	BabyBj&ouml;rn Potty Chair - BlueMy daughter had purchased another potty chair with all the buzzes and whistles.  It actually talked.  The baby enjoyed playing with it but that is about it.  With the new chair, which looks like a  real potty he has already started doing his business. What else can you ask for?
5	1214265600	This chair was given to us but I would've bought it sooner myself if I had known how much I would love it. It's simple, it's cute, it's obviously comfortable, and it's very easy to clean. My daughter loves this chair and it aided in her training very quickly. She would sit on it in front of the tv for as long as I would let her! We went on vacation to a hotel last week and took it with us...I am almost sure she would have "regressed" on vacation if she did not have her familiar seat with her. It was easy to take along, unlike some of those fancy bells and whistles seats would be! She can pour the contents into the big potty herself which she likes doing. I love how easy it is to wipe out and sanitize. I cannot recommend this seat highly enough...daughter #2 is due in August and you can be sure I will go to the trouble to store this seat for the next 2 years until she needs it...wouldn't use any other!
5	1213747200	We have both the bjorn potty chair and the potty seat. Some days my 18-mo-old wants to have baby doll on the chair and herself on the toilet. I mainly bought this one so we'd have one for traveling. It is made of hard smooth plastic and the white bucket comes out. Close to the floor means she can get on and off by herself...that's a pro and a con.
5	1213574400	My 3-year-old daughter is in the 99 percentile on height and weight--she's a big girl. This potty is the perfect size for her.  Also, the design of the front of the potty allows for no "splashes" or messy streams outside of the potty.  On some other designed pottys she had to be sitting perfectly or there was a big mess; not with this one.  I highly recommend it.  Also, I put it in the back of our vehicle when we're travelling or for ballgames, and it will work in this way for another year, I think.  (Then she'll be too big for the chair by the time she weighs over 45 lbs.  Besides, by then she'll be able to "hold it" until we find a toilet.)
5	1212969600	This is a wonderful potty.It is long/big enough for my son( 3 years ) to fit in properly . It has very few joints/seams for stuff to get stuck in and it does not slide and slip across the floor. All in all it is a wonderful potty and i am glad i found it after buying 3 other unsuccessful ones .And best of all my son loves it.
5	1211155200	My daughter-in-law had purchased a potty but was keeping upstairs next to her "big" potty.  Rather than keep running up and down the stairs every time the urge to go came, I bought one that could be kept downstairs.  It is far more stable and easier to use than any other I have encountered. I highly recommend it.
4	1211068800	My son really like this potty chair.  He is not quite one but we have been using it since he was seven months.  Makes for easy clean up.  Once he can walk and stand on his own it will be perfect for him to use.
5	1211068800	Following the other great reviews of this potty chair, I purchased it from Amazon.I have been so satisfied with it that I've already recommended it to 2 of my friends with similar aged children.My just 2 year old son has been potty-curious for a couple months.  He gets stir crazy on the toilet seat that goes on top of the toilet (and legs fall asleep, I fear) and completely rejected the cheaper potty seat I bought locally (it pinches, is too small, etc.My son is very big for his age (39" tall) so I needed a potty seat that wasn't too small.  Being a boy, the shape and 'guard' in the front are also important.Like so many others have reported here - my son also will sit on the potty chair forever.  He is fond of getting up in the early evening to use it, so it resides on the floor at the end of his bed for quick night-time use.  Like the other baby bjorn products, it is very smoothly shaped so is very easy to clean and comfortable.Buy it!  You will not be disappointed.
5	1210636800	This is the best potty for boys.  My son rarely pee's out of it and the splash guard in built in and comfortable. He loves this little potty! The only downfall is having to clean the insert, but that would be the same with any potty that doesn't attach to the toilet.
5	1210550400	I bought this potty chair for my 20 month-old daughter who we are attempting to potty train.  She loved that she had her own potty chair to sit on while we were in the bathroom.  She started out just sitting on it with her clothes on to get used to it.  Since then, she has gone in the potty 5 or 6 times.  I like that it is comfortable, simple, and easy to clean.  After she pees in the potty, I just dump the contents into the regular toilet, rinse out the basin and we are ready to go again.  The white color also makes it very obvious to me when she has actually done something on the potty.  I had difficulty deciding between this chair and some of the other ones with all the bells and whistles, but I eventually decided I didn't want her to have all the distractions of the sounds and gadgets while trying to learn to use the potty.  I was afraid she would view the fancier pottys as toys and not understand what the purpose of the potty chair was.  In hindsight, I feel I made the correct decision for my daughter and ended up buying a second one to have one upstairs and one downstairs.
5	1210291200	This is the BEST potty chair you can buy!  For my first daughter I tried 2 brands of potty chairs.  One would leak and the other was just uncomfortable.  This Baby Bjorn potty chair is comfortable and easy to clean.  I loved it so much I got 2 of them.  One for each level of my home.  My daughter loved it so much she was trained in 24 hours!  You will NOT be disappointed with this purchase.
5	1210204800	I tried a over the toilette seat for my 2 year old but we have the chair height toilets in our house and I think being that far up off the floor scared him.  I purchases this potty seat to try and he likes to sit on it and has pooped in the potty several times.  The splash guard is built in so it is not uncomfortable as the splash guard on the over the toilette seat one I have.  We are still in the learning stages but so far I think I made the right decision after researching so many different potty chairs.
5	1210032000	Easy to clean, perfect size, welcoming, stable, great looks.  My daughter started to sit in it at 18 months and was almost fully "potty trained" at 25 months.  It is the best for BMs.  She has a big bottom, so she is starting to use the big toilette now, but this still works like a charm for her night time potty visits.
5	1209686400	I purchased several potty seats before buying this one. This is the only one the my son can sit on comfortably. Several are more round therefore being better for a girl, some of the boy splash guards are to sharp. I highly recommend this seat to any parent with a boy.
5	1209340800	This potty chair is great but a little pricey.  Easy to clean and no complaints from my son regarding comfort.  Overall a great chair for the beginners.
5	1209254400	Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own. This was for my first child, now 3 and we bought this over a year ago. He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he'll be using it for a while to come. It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new. He's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit. It was a year ago, and it still is. For the novice parent of boys, it doesn't matter how high they make the splash guard, boys need to point it down. That took some learning on my part. We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too, but we've hardly used it. He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own.
5	1209254400	I have bought several potties for my son! I wish we had bought this one first and we would of been able to save so much! It's the best! So good, we bought another one to keep at grandmas house. My son loves this potty and it's so easy to clean. My son is almost 4. This one is the most comfortable one he's ever tried too!
4	1208476800	This is the best of all the potty chair options we've tried.  Its sturdy, stable and looks to be pretty comfortable.  There are no distracting bells and whistles and my daughter can't fall out of it.  My one critique is that my daughter loves to remove the white bowl and sit on the empty hole, but that's more a problem for me to deal with than a design flaw (still, if you have a child who might do that too, this might be a factor for you because it just lifts off).
4	1207440000	The Babybjorn Potty Chair has many nice features. Easy to clean--supports child, compact sturdy and simple. BUT if your child is small (like mine) the  guard on the front is cumbersome. My child can't not mount the potty himself and must be placed on the potty. When he tries to get on the potty he has hurt himself in ways that makes any male member of the household wince.
5	1206662400	Excelent, well built product. Very easy cleanup. Our daughter loves it and we would definitely recomend it to others (actualy we already did).
5	1206576000	This is perfect for a toddler that is taller or male.  My son is over 40 inches and just turned 3 so the other potties we purchaed just did not do the trick.  This one works great and helped us transition him to the big potty.
5	1205971200	What a surprise!I kindof assumed that I would have to bite the bullet and buy something not made in the usa.. but this actually is made here!!!I can't wait till my lil guy uses it! Finally a company that hasnn't sold us out!
3	1205366400	I bought this potty chair and the coordinating potty seat for my 2 year old son on the recommendation I read that the splash guard really worked.  And I'm frustrated to madness that the splash guard really DOESN'T work for him unless he sits on it just right (a little to the right and leaning forward). So he can't sit in the seat comfortably and not make a mess.On the up  side, it's easy to clean.  Still looking for a good slash guard.
5	1205193600	We really like this chair for our little boy!  He enjoys sitting in it, and seems very comfortable, as he reads his books or watches tv waiting "to produce."It's a good height, has a good ergonomic design, and the splash guard in front is perfect for a little boy.The plastic basin cleans up very easily, so the poo slides right out into the toilet, and then washes up quickly!I think you'll be happy with this chair; just note it has no adapter for a grown-up toilet seat.We also like this shade of red, it's a nice bright, rich red, which I think would work equally well for a little girl, or a little boy.
5	1204848000	I purchased this potty in blue after reading so many great reviews on various websites. I'm so glad we went with this one. It's perfect. Easy to clean, nice looking, and seems comfy for my son. The guard doesn't always work perfectly unless he's sitting just right, but at least it has one! Love this potty and highly recommend it!
5	1204502400	I bought this potty chair to replace a potty I bought last year.  I chose this one because of the reputation of Baby Bjorn products and I feel that this chair has made good on that reputation.  This potty seat is simple, just the base and removable pot which is a feature I was looking for since we move the potty seat from room to room.  The splashguard is part of the removable pot so it cannot be removed or misplaced, another feature I was pleased with since the splashguard on the other potty has gone MIA.  This potty chair is sturdy and does not have a flimsy base like the previous potty seat I bought. It also has a rubber strip along the bottom so it stays in place.I have read reviews of other people's toddlers not being able to fit or boys hurting their sensitive parts but we have not experienced this.  My son is cautious when he sits on the seat and I am there of course to supervise and help.  As for not being able to fit, I had my 7 and 10 year olds sit on the seat and my slim 7 year old fit with room to spare and my average sized 10 year old was able to slide right in but it didn't stick to her hips when she stood up, so my average sized 2 1/2 year old fits on it just fine.
5	1203984000	This is our 2nd potty seat.  Our first one was a Winnie the Pooh potty.  It was too small for our 2.5 year old son.  His privates would always hit the splash guard.  The Bjorn is the perfect size and cleans very easily.  He loves sitting in it with little coersion involved.
4	1203724800	We purchased this potty chair and another one in pink for our b/g twins.  They are very easy to use but our son has a bit of a problem keeping the urine "in" the potty chair, so the only thing I would change is making the shield a bit higher to give a better chance of it preventing "overspray."  Otherwise I love that the chair only has two parts, rather than a separate seat from bowl from base, like we had with our older children.  I also like that these two chairs stack easily so we can bring them with us for day trips and vacations, etc.  Overall I am completely satisfied with my purchases.
5	1203638400	I love this potty chair, it's perfect for my 2.5 year old.  We still aren't trained yet, but he loves sitting in it and emptying it is a breeze.  It has a high back so he can recline some and get comfy while waiting and it is a little higher up than most potty chairs, so if you have a taller child, that's great.  Nice big opening for everything to go in....I have found with other potty chairs the opening is so small that pee and poop would splash everywhere, but this is nice and big and open to catch everything.  Also has a little shield for boys.
5	1203638400	This potty is perfectly shaped for my 2-year-old daughter.  The design is simple and easy to clean.  It's just right.
5	1203379200	My son started showing potty training ready signs at 16 or 17 months.  I didn't know much about potty chairs so I just went out bought a "simple" cheap chair.  The cheap chair was a great introduction for my son but when the time came that he was truly ready he needed a real potty chair and for him it was the BabyBjorn potty chair.  After we received this chair (after doing much research on potty chairs)I spent two days potty training my son with much success.  My son was just under 23 months when he was potty trained and although I give the trophy to my son for being ready, the right potty chair only made my son's job that much easier.  This chair is perfect for boys with the rounded edges of the potty guard so their delicate bits are protected.  The high backing provides support and offers comfort for the child.  The tub of the chair is just the perfect size for little bums.  My son always fell into his other potty chair which made him leary but this just fit perfectly.  And as a plus for the parents-there are only two pieces to this chair which makes for easy cleaning.  My son has been potty trained for a month and even when taking a bath he will get out of the nice warm tub to do his business in his favorite blue chair.  I have already recommended this chair to 3 of my friends who have boys and although I recognize that every child is different and you have to find what works for your child, I would highly recommend this chair to anyone in the potty training stages whether you have boys or girls.
5	1202860800	This is a solid and staple potty that is exactly the right size for my daughter. The pot is easy for her to remove, empty, and replace without spillage. I don't think I could ask for anything more.
5	1202860800	I love this potty chair.  My daughter uses it all the time.  It is very easy to clean, having no little crevices to collect grime.  The little splash guard is probably supposed to be for little boys, but it's good for her too - when the flow hits the hard plastic it doesn't splash out on the floor.
5	1202688000	I had bought a different potty for my little girl and she would not even sit on it. I bought it because it played music and had a flushing sound. She did not like it at all. She LOVES this one. It has a back on it (unlike some) and she sits on it just like a little chair. It is comfortable for her and easy for her to get up and down on.
5	1202515200	My son loves this potty. After some introduction time, he is excited to use it and usually stays seated (he is 19 mo) We have been doing light potty training since he was 12 mo old, and started with a crappy but simple potty from Target. The old one often pinched him and sometimes he was able to poop on the back of the bowl, but not with this potty. It's sturdy, seals nicely and easy to clean. Wish I would have found this one first!
4	1202515200	My daughter is 18 months and used this potty chair for the first time this evening.  It's a decent seat.  It fits her well, and she seems comfortable with using it.  I'd say it's a decent value as well.
5	1202428800	Great starter potty for toilet training.  Just the right size, plain and not intimidating.  No destractions.  Great rubber bottom so it does not slide on bathroom floor.  Very easy to clean!  I loved this one so much, I bought 2 more.
5	1202342400	This potty is simple, sturdy, and easy to clean. Works great for my 18-mo. old son. We haven't experienced any of the problems with the splash guard that some other reviewers have mentioned. We're happy with this potty, it's much better than others we've used.
5	1201737600	I love this potty chair.  It's easy for my child to use, easy to clean and simple.  I've tried purchasing chairs that "flush", "talk", etc., and don't like them because it's just not good to mix electronics with a little potty chair!  Usually they are defective or more complicated.  I was happy when I bought this because it's simple and easy for my little one to use.  It's also made very well and has a nice skid proof bottom.  Great product!
5	1201392000	We had one of those cheap pottys we bought at Walmart, I think Safety1st.  My son hated it and so did I. The hole is too small and it's just flimsy. So I ordered this potty based on reviews.  I kid you not - when my son saw this potty the first time, he expelled "potty!" pulled down his pants and sat on it.  Just like that.  Now I don't plan to potty train him until the summer, but he just likes sitting on it and that is fantastic.
5	1200873600	This seat is the perfect size for my son. He's about 37 pounds and over 3 feet tall (almost 3 years old). It made potty training so much easier. The "pot" is easily removed from the top of the seat (rather than from the back of the seat like other potty chairs). My son uses this potty, and then dumps out the pot in the big potty by himself. I love this seat!
5	1200787200	I bought the green Baby Bjorn potty based on the reviews that far surpassed any other potty here on Amazon as well as Target.com.. I totally trust Amazon reviewers!  I ordered the product just a few days before Christmas and didn't need it FOR Christmas, but it was still under the tree when my 1 year old opened her presents. She only sits on it for 2 seconds at a time, but we'll be patient. She's only 15 months, afterall! It looks great in our bathroom next to the tub and rug.I look forward to baby *using it* more and more really soon!
5	1200700800	This was our second try to find a potty that my son would sit on long enough to try to go.  The other chair we had hurt his little butt.  This chair is very comfortable for him and he will sit on it for longer periods of time.  He's still not trained yet, but at least he does not refuse to sit down on it now.
4	1200700800	After 2 potties that my son wouldn't use, we found this one and he took to it right away. Very easy for him to use. Also easy to empty and keep clean. Would recommend this to anyone who is trying to potty train!
4	1200614400	I have a 14 month old. He sits on it. He doesn't scream. he's not using it as a potty yet. He climbs on it and listens to his echo while putting his face into it. Seems comfortable, will be easy to clean, not to big and akward. I'm sure it will do the job
5	1200182400	I am so happy I purchased this potty for my son when he was 14 months old. Though I knew he wouldn't be potty trained that early...I wanted him to become familiar with the potty. I bought a white one (so it resembled ours) and put it in our bathroom in front of "mommy's potty". Whenever I was in the bathroom sitting on "mommy's potty", I sat my son on "Aidan's potty". I sat him on it with his clothes on and even let him take it out of the bathroom to play with it. I just wanted him to get comfortable. Well...much to my surprise, I've been able to notice lately (he's now 16 months old) when he's going to go "poopy"....so I took him and sat him on it naked. I sat on "mommy's potty" in front of him and just talked him through what he was doing. Verbal communication and consistant key words really help. He made me so excited when he actually went #1 and #2....This potty...is so comfortable for little guys because it is smooth...nothing will pitch or scratch their important pieces. The best part however was I was able to rinse it with hot water and use a clorox wipe to clean it. Soooo easy to clean. Simple Potty....Simply Perfect.Great for beginners...No bells and whistles....keeps them focused.
2	1200096000	I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said "oh mommy my legs!" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children.
5	1199664000	He loves this potty chair.  It's easy for him to use by himself and it's VERY easy to clean up when he's done.  He can even dump it on his own.  Great buy!
5	1199577600	This is the only potty we've had, but it has been great. Cleans easily, is sturdy and won't tip, and my daughter (18 months) likes it.
5	1199577600	I like this potty chair for my little boy because there are no lids to open and batteries in it. It's perfect. Nice and simple and the piece that comes up in the middle helps when you have a little boy! I recently bought another one for another bathroom. I wouldn't buy any other potty chair!
5	1199318400	Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy.
5	1199318400	My daughter does pull the pot out and pee inside with out the pot inside. lol But other wise holds up to my kids. Easy to clean also.
5	1198886400	This is a great potty.  My daughter has no trouble getting on or off of it and the guard isn't a problem for her.  The entire bottom of the chair has grippy rubber that keeps it from sliding across the floor.  The "bowl" has no seams, creases or other scary places were nasties can lurk.
5	1198368000	My mother brought a few potty for my daughter and they are either too small or just so uncomfortable for my heavy built toddler, she ended up kicking it around the house. When we saw this at the store, we knew we have to get it because my daughter wouldn't get off of it. I started actively potty training her at 27 months. She loves sitting in it so much that she would make excuses just to sit in it. She is a big girl (38 lbs) and the high back is perfect for her to relax and go about her business. And after a week, she is pretty much day trained and she started taking me to go potty with her every morning. This potty makes her feel like a big girl as well because she can help Mommy emptying "the bowl" into the toilet all by herself. And I found it very easy to clean.
5	1198108800	This design couldn't be any more simple!  Two pieces of plastic. An insert that removes easily to empty out! Must have been designed by Apple's JONATHON IVE!  Now, if I could only get my little boy to use it a bit more often!  Still working on that one!  Great chair.  Highly recommended!
5	1198022400	I actually went to B R Us and had my twins try this out before I bought it online(which was cheaper).  I looked at other potty chairs-some had musical flushes, soft chairs, lids, etc, but decided agaist the others because I didn't like the idea of cleaning between little nooks & crannies and/or putting in batteries, etc.  I bought 2 of these, one for each of my 19 month old twin girls.  It is extremely easy & simple to clean.  My twins can eaily & comfortably sit on it for minutes at a time, even though they are on the small side(31 & 32 inches tall). I especially like that it stays in place and doesn't scoot all over the floor-unless the twins are behind it & pushing!I highly recommend this potty chair.
4	1197331200	I bought this potty chair for my 20 month old daughter. She loves to sit on it but for some reason she likes to sit on it without the bowl. She is short for her age so when she sits on it the splash guard gets in the way. So I put the bowl underneath the potty and it works great for us. Overall this is a great potty. No distractions, portable, and seems to be comfortable to sit on. I would recommend this potty to anyone looking for something to train their child. Good Luck to all the moms and dads!
5	1197072000	My daughter got this potty a few days ago for her 2nd b-day.  She has been using it non-stop since and is fully trained!  Other reviews complained that because of the guard it wasn't a great girl chair.  Well my short 2 yr old girl has no problem plopping down on it with zero discomfort. She can also easily pick up the pot and empty it herself. I love that it is so streamlined: no cracks, crevices, lids, batteries, decals or buttons.  Easy clean up!  And lastly the apple green is adorable.  I get sooooo tired of pink and purple!
5	1196726400	This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first. My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty, which costs about $5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle. My son thought it was a toy and constantly "flushed" to hear the music instead of sitting on it. When this potty arrived and I took it out the box, he grabbed it and said "mine" and immediately sat down on it. He started using it the very next day and it's been a success so far. I don't know if it's the potty or if he's just ready to be potty trained (he just turned 3) but I do know that he loves his potty. I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model.
5	1196467200	We've had this for 7 months!Well designed...easy to clean, and easy on the tush.We just empty, rinse, and wipe with a lysol wipe to sanitize.My 3 yr old son has anxiety about big toilets, and still uses this even though he's been potty trained with NO accidents for 6 months. He'll use a "big potty" if there's nothing else, but he loves the independence of using this one...and frankly so do I.We're buying another one for my daughter and I'm actually excited about potty training!I read all the reviews, but I was still scared about buying this one, we had already tried 2 others, and this one is more expensive.IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY!!!We plunked this sucker in front of the television, and sitting for the long wait for #2 wasn't torture for him.The front is nice and high...although we still had to teach him to hold his [...] down to avoid messes. Nothing is mess-proof during potty training, but this one DEFITELY cut down on the spills.We used stickers as rewards, and he put them on his potty.The container is big...the other products we tried had tiny containers.Okay, I know there are more awesome things about this potty, I just can't think of them right now.
5	1196294400	I bought this chair for my almost-14-month-old son to get him used to seeing it and sitting on it.  I usually put him on it with his clothes on and he thinks it's funny to stand up and sit down over and over again.  I've put him on it a couple times without his diaper and most times he actually uses it!  I think it's more likely due to lucky timing, but I'm still so proud!  I'm not pushing the potty-training idea yet since he's not quite 15 months yet, but so far he seems happy about the chair.  I am a little worried about him outgrowing it before he is fully potty trained, but I'll probably just get him the BabyBjorn attachment to a regular toilet if that happens.
5	1196121600	We just started using it on our 9 months baby girl. I've always holded her for pee and poo poo. However, she's a big girl and has gotten so heavy that every time she poos, it takes forever to wait. My arms are always ended up very sore each time. I said, well, maybe it's time for potty! I know it's quite early for potty train but it's good to setup a regular poo poo time for infant so they can be easily potty trained later. I've always been a fan of Babybjorn, its baby carrier didn't disappoint me. So I immediately bought this potty. For the first time, she cried when sitting on it. I said, maybe it is indeed too early for potty. Yesterday, I tried again, guess what? She didn't cry! She had her first poo poo in the potty! Today again! She didn't cry at all! The only to becareful with infant tho is that you have to hold them and make sure that they don't fall... Other than that, it's fine... Great potty! Highly recommend!
4	1195948800	This is a great potty for bigger kids.  My Daughter is on the tall side but more slender and I found this to be a good "fit". It was even easy for her to empty herself!  We ended up getting the white one though, since we wanted it to look like the "big potty"
5	1195344000	I bought two of these potties on the recommendadtion of a friend.  They are neutral in color and look like our adult "potties" which our daughter loves.  Easy to clean, removable section makes it simple to empty and wash.  We're very happy with our choice.
5	1195344000	My son has just started potty training and he is very comfortable on this one.  I love that you can take the inner part out and wash it.  Very user friendly.  The color is amazing.
3	1194998400	I just received my son's potty chair two days ago and he absolutely loves it.  He sat it in it like a chair for an entire day the first day but when he took a pee in the potty chair, it went all over the floor instead of into the bowl.  The downfall of this chair is that, the front piece that's suppose to block the pee from spilling out, is not high enough.  My son is a 2 year old and he's rather tall for his age but height has nothing to do with the front piece.  It's just not made high enough to block the pee from spilling out.  However, it is easy to clean because the bowl just pulls out easily.
5	1194652800	After purchasing 4 other potty chairs with different bells and whistles it seemed that the hole was rather small on alot of the potty chairs.  My child is of average size so I couldn't understand why.  I noticed them using this potty chair at the daycare and was immediately on a mission to find it.  I have the yellow one and it is perfect. Just the right height, just the right size hole.  Best of all super easy to clean b/c it only has 2 pieces to it!  I want to buy another to put in the spare bathroom.
5	1193875200	I have been trying to use the old potty chair I used for my older children, but just like it didn't work for them, it didn't work for my youngest son either.  The old one had a small round shaped container, the baby bjorn has an oval shaped container which makes it possible to get it all in there and not all over the back of the chair.  The splash gard is the perfect size for my little guy.  It is very stable and doesn't tip over when he stands up.  The fact that it doesn't turn into a step stool is just one more perk!!! He can't pull it apart!!!  It's just the right size for my almost two year old.  I read many reviews and went back and forth about this chair and the smaller one, and concluded that this one would be best considering the size of my little guy.  He's not huge, but he is taller than most kids his age.  I can't believe I waited until my last baby to find this chair!!  Hindsight really is 20/20 isn't it!!!!
5	1193270400	This chair is so easy to use and comfortable for my tall two year old son.  It was hard to find a potty that is tall enough for him, so he didn't feel like he was sitting on the floor.  The base is really wide and I have no fear of it slipping or tipping over.  It was a little more on the pricey side, but the quality is worth it.
2	1192492800	My daughter has 2 of these potty chairs and one of another brand. She refuses to sit on these chairs the majority of the time and in the off chance she does use them, she has a bright red ring around her bottom when she gets up. Generally she gets up out of discomfort, not having finished using the potty. If anything, these potty chairs have been more harm than good in potty training for her.
4	1192492800	This is well-designed and comfortable to use. The seating area is seamless and the removable pot is large enough that my toddler can place himself on it and be "ready to go" with no help (unlike other potty seats where it was difficult to place himself correctly over the tiny pot). There are only two pieces, the seat itself and the removable pot. Easy to use, easy to clean. If only there was a lid, I'd give it 5 stars. Great chair!
5	1191369600	We have tried a number of potties before I came across this product. The ones we purchased prior to the BabyBjorn were either uncomfortable for sitting or difficult to empty out. What I like most about this potty is the raised round support. it makes it easy to start early with the child. Our 15 month old girl uses it as her chair in the bathroom. The raised front of the bowl serves as handle for emptying as well as to prevent splashing from boys. This is a functionally designed potty in every respect.
3	1190851200	I was excited about this potty - very stylish, simple, cute.  However, my son refuses to use it.  He pushes it all over the house as if it were a car.  He will only use the "big potty."
4	1190592000	This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up.  Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it.  I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat.
5	1190592000	My son is 1 year 8 months. We recently tried to start introducing him to this potty, and the very first time he sat on it, he peed! Granted, we have to keep an eye on him when he is around it (apparently the bucket part makes a good hat.) But it is really encouraging for both my husband and myself to see that he not only likes, but will use this potty. The babybjorn potty is a Great Buy, not to mention I received it very quickly.
5	1189555200	Originally, I had bought the Boon potty chair. It looked cute but it's really not for boys. What a disappointment. The shield is too small and the seat is not comfortable.  As soon as I bought the Baby Bjorn, you could see he was more interested and comfortable in this seat. Also, the shield is high so there isn't a big mess to clean up every time. This seat is the best seat on the market in my opinion. Highly recommend.
5	1189468800	GREAT POTTY CHAIR.  The built in splash guard is so nice for little boys, but this chair is fine for girls as well. Reviews I read before I ordered the BabyBjorn potty chair remarked how well the BabyBjorn suited larger toddlers. My 2 1/2 year old grandson is very small for his age and this potty chair is a fine size for him, too.  His feet reach the floor comfortably when he is sitting on it. The removable oval bowl design is a great feature, as it allows more room for the child to sit comfortably and "complete their business". The bowl is also easy to empty.  I highly recommend the BabyBjorn potty chair.
3	1189296000	My daughter is only starting potty training, but she doesn't like the bowl of this potty.  I'm not sure why, only that she takes the bowl out of the seat before sitting down.  She's ok if I put the bowl underneath the seat so that she doesn't go all over the floor, but for some reason she doesn't like to sit on it the way it's designed.
5	1188950400	I got this for my daughter after reading all the great reviews and they are all accurate.  The fact that the potty was only two pieces and easy to clean was the selling point.  No nooks and crannies to catch dust and other yucky stuff.  My daughter has been potty trained for 6 months now, but stills prefers this potty to the big toilet.  A++
5	1188604800	Great potty. We had the BabyBjorn Little potty and loved that, but our daughter was getting a little tall for that one. This one is a good height for her (small, 21 months) and is so easy to clean. Our daughter took to it well, and puts her "FooFoo" dog on the little potty while she uses this bigger one.
4	1188604800	Seems to be a very sturdy and comfortable chair for my 19mo daughter.  No frills design makes for easy clean up and no distractions.  It's rather light and tends to scoot on the floor as she's trying to sit, but I'd still buy it again.
5	1187827200	This was the second potty I bought after I realized the first one I purchased was not user friendly for a 2 year old.  The bowl of this potty removes very easily allowing your child to carry it to the toilet and dump on their own.  I was a little concerned with the "spray guard" in front as I have a daughter but as it turns out it seems to help her get situated on the seat.
5	1187654400	Love it, love it, love it! We have had it less than 24 hours and my 18 month old daughter has used it about 6 times. It is perfect for us!
5	1187222400	We had the Safety First chair and were excited, because it was the same one that Elmo used in his Potty training video.  Quickly I found out that the opening was too small. Even for my daughter. The opening is a circle not a oval. If she didn't sit all the way back and lean forward her urine would leak all over the front making a mess to clean up.  Let's not even talk about the way she had to sit on that chair to "poopoo".A friend bought the Bjorn chair and highly recommended it.  I was a little shocked at the price, but after the things I had to go through with the first chair I was willing to pay that price if it worked.  It worked like a charm.  She loves to sit in it and it is so easy to clean and disinfect.  It's a very well made and well thought through product.
5	1186790400	Our son loves to read while sitting on this potty, and it's quite stylish too!
5	1186704000	The first potty chair I got for my son was the kind that converts from a chair on the floor into a step and seat that goes over a standard toilet seat.  It was ok for practice, but the first time he actually peed while sitting on it, the splash guard on the little center cup did not do its job, so some got on the floor, and my son refused to try after that.  Also, for a boy to successfully pee in that style of potty, he would have to be sitting up straight, with his bottom all the way back, manually aiming into the potty receptacle.  With the Baby Bjorn potty chair, my son could relax and slouch any way he wanted to, and the pee would stay in the potty.  I'm happy to say that after three weeks of practice on the Baby Bjorn, he finally felt confident enough to try again, and was successful.  It was the breakthrough we needed for him to feel comfortable peeing in something other than a diaper.
4	1186531200	i really like the simplicity of this chair, with potty training my first, i tried all the chairs with buttons, noises, etc. which didn't really appeal much to my toddler after the first couple of times.  they were harder to clean because of all the little pieces and were uncomfortable and left marks on him.  this is much easier to clean, keep clean, and very comfortable for the little ones to sit on.  i gave it 4 stars because i havent started potty training my second yet, other moms who recommended it to me, say they love it.
4	1186358400	I purchased this chair for the training of our 2-year old twin boys. I liked that it was a neutral white color without unnecessary bells and whistles. It is very easy to clean, and has a rubberized non-slip base, which is great for tile bathroom floors. If you have tall toddlers, you may want to skip this chair and go right to the flip-down toilet seat, though. Our boys are both very tall and this chair was too small for them. The chair sits quite low to the ground and their knees would be up too high when they would sit on it. The bowl is also quite small, making it difficult to "hit the target" and we would often end up with leakage onto the floor. With girls it might work better? If I had to do it again, I would probably skip the chair. Overall, this is a nice product, but best for smaller-statured toddlers.
5	1186272000	my son loves this potty chair.  we also bought a royal step stool which he disassembles everytime he uses it....which is a problem.  I am going to return it and buy another Baby Bjorn.
5	1185667200	We bought this potty when my daughter started showing interest in the potty at about 18 months.  The only possible drawback here ws that I chose the potty for her and there's "no frill", whereas I know there are other potties that sing or whatever when the child uses it.  That said, we loved this potty.  It is very sturdy - it's not cheap, flimsy plastic, so it's very solid.  It has rubber grips on the bottom so it doesn't slide all over the floor (in fact, my daugther had a hard time moving it when she tried to!).  The bowl itself was very easy to keep clean and I never felt like it was dirty or grungy.  Because it is made of smooth plastic, we just emptied the weewee and poopoo easily into the big toilet, ran water from the sink and bathtub into it and emptied that into the potty as well and flushed. Finally, the part that sticks up at the front was very usefull since sometimes when our daughter would sit, she would really have to go and the pee would come out quickly and forcefully.  Now that she uses the "big potty" that usually means it shoots out of the front but on the little potty, that piece kept it from doing so.So, this is a great purchase - we will be using it again when our baby boy is ready to do so...
5	1185321600	This is the best Potty that I've found -- and I've tried many of them out there.What makes it SO great is the ease with which you can clean the bowl that comes out.  It is the perfect height & width too.I have read other reviews where some parents complained that the potty bowl sticks to their child when they get up from using it.Simple solution:I put 3 pieces of velcro strips on the underside of the bowl about 2" each, as well as on the base, under the bowl.  A simple fix !  When he gets up - the bowl stays in place.This is a fantastic, well-worth the money potty.  Don't bother looking at the others.  I wasted my money on so many until I tried this one.
5	1184803200	After seeing all the reviews I decided to purchase this potty for my son. It's very sturdy and easy to clean.
3	1184630400	I bought this potty chair for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. I already had a Graco soft seat potty chair but I decided to buy this one to see if she liked it better. She did like it, but only to sit on as a novelty, she never actually made pee pee in it. The high lip in the front gave her some problems as she tried to sit down. I definitely think this seat is more "boy friendly", in the sense that it will prevent any misses. I'll keep it in my truck as an on the road emergency potty. I think she likes the Graco potty because it resembles the seat of a toilet and the BabyBjorn does not.Graco Soft Seat Trainer11/15 -Since my initial review, my daughter has used this potty and seems to like it. I do have one big problem with it, the inner potty bowl is too light weight. When she get's up quickly the inner potty bowl get's stuck to her behind and then drops. This can create quite a mess. They need to make the potty insert heavier.
5	1184457600	I purchased this product beacuse of the fabulous reviews it had with other Amazon customers.  We started early with our 14 month old.  She isn't distracted by unecesssary toys attached to the seat and enjoys the comfort of sitting down in it.  The bowl comes out for easy cleaning and the seat has fabulous grips on the bottom to prevent sliding.  I would purchase this product again over anything else on the market.
5	1184371200	I have found that Baby Bjorn potty products are the best on the market and doesn't break the pocket book! It's oblong vs round so urine and poop stays in the pot. The built in splash guard is great! It's easy to clean and light weight, but built tough. Variety of colors. My triplets are all different shapes and sizes. We have a very large boy and has plenty of room for him. Our other son is a bit small for his age and because the pot is oval there is no leg stretching and no "falling in". Our daughter is long and very thin. She has no problems what so ever on this! Her tiny behind doesn't fall in or slip or anything. The splash guard never gets in her way! It's just the best! Other moms who see this ask where they can get one! Highly recommended!
5	1184284800	We tried another potty first, but we had a problem with pee not being kept in the bow because the lip at the front was not high enough.  So far no problems with this one.  Our son loves it.
5	1183075200	My son is a big 20 month old so finding a potty chair for him has been very hard. This one is perfect in size and there is additional room to grow. If you are looking for a plan jane potty seat that does what it says then this is the one.
4	1182816000	I bought this for my granddaughter as she is starting to show an interest in getting those diapers off.  She likes it.  It wasn't boring or scary.  Which is one reason why I decided on this chair, bright colors are more interesting to a tot.  She has been sitting on it.  But we aren't at the take off the diaper stage yet.  I do think this will be perfect for her!
3	1180742400	I bought this for my daughter and she has had so much trouble using it that it just collected dust.  The splash guard in front is much to high and she is not able to sit in comfort.
5	1179360000	I was looking for a potty seat that would fit my son - he's a little big for his age and all the other chairs had teeny tiny holes for the...poop.  Plus, all of the deflectors would end up hurting him.  This chair definitely fit the bill.  The hole is big enough, the deflector is built in and doesn't hurt him at all and on top of all of that, it's SO easy to keep clean.  I would recomend this potty seat to everyone!
3	1179360000	I like the seat, it came quickly & is just like in the picture. Seems comfortable to my 21 mos old. The nice wide lip on the bowl looks like he won't be bothered with any edge cutting into his legs. Easy to clean!I'm not sure about the splash guard. He doesn't seem to like it, and it seems to get in the way when he pees standing up.
5	1179187200	I love this potty seat. It is VERY easy to clean, and I love the splashguard in the front. I bought this potty after I tried another brand that I purchased at a garage sale, that one had a horrible splashguard, my son's penis rested on top of it and the pee went everywhere but in the potty. This Baby Bjorn potty is oval and the splashguard works well, which seems to make it easier for my son to pee in the potty, not in front of the potty. Also, I haven't seen a potty that is easier to clean: dump, rinse, and wipe with a baby wipe and it is as clean as the day I bought it. I also like that because the potty is oval, my son doesn't cover the entire seat and he can see into the potty and is interested in what is going on. An unfortunate side-effect of the gap between him and the front of the seat is that he can reach his hands and his toys into the potty, but maybe that is true whatever seat you use?
5	1179187200	My first three children were born in Sweden.  We have used this potty for ever!  My oldest is now 20 so we passed it along to friends some years back.I will definitly buy one for my grandchildren.  It is easy to keep clean and even easier to store!  No extra parts/nothing to break either!
5	1179100800	This potty is perfect for super busy parents.  It does not have a lid.  So you will never forget to pour out the contents.  It is nice and curvy, and that makes clean up a cinch.  Wonderful price for a wonderful product.
5	1179014400	sturdy, baby loved it, easy to clean. used it for a short time since potty training was rather quick.
5	1179014400	I have a 2 year old in the potty training phase. I first potty we bought him was terrible, so I decided to try the Babybjorn. We ALL are so happy we did! It's a perfect potty chair. There are only 2 pieces and NO nooks to squeeze into to clean. it's very simple in design. It has a wonderful pee guard for my boy and he never gets the pee on the floor. He actually sits back a bit and watchs himself pee. I just love this potty for the ease of cleaning it. I just lift out the bowl, dump and rinse. It's good to go.At the end of the day, I just spray a little Clorox anywhere on it and let it dry for the next day. My son loves it, too. Its very comfortable and easy for him to use on his own. When we were doing the naked potty training (now we hav emoved to underwear! yah!) he was able to get to the potty and go all by himself without trying to get a lid off like the previous potty we bought. He would sometimes just sit there for a decent period of time just waiting. He was totally comfortable. LOVE this potty and we will be using it again with our second boy due in a few months.
5	1178928000	I bought this for my 18 month old daughter to get her used to the idea of a potty.  I love the fact that it is simple, no bells and whistles to distract her from the task at hand.  It's comfortable for her to sit on (the higher back allows her to relax) and easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product.
5	1178928000	It's silly how much though effort and research went into our purchase of a potty chair for my daughter, nonetheless it paid off.  Is she trained yet?  No.  But, that doesn't make this any less of a good purchase.  We have the full size Baby Bjorn chair in the bathroom and this is our travel option.  My daughter likes this chair, however it isn't comfortable to sit on for long periods of time.  It's one piece construction makes it easy to clean and prevents the child from getting it on them too.  Baby Bjorn has done it again!
4	1178928000	This is a nice simple potty without a lot of silly gadgets.  I would prefer it to have a little bit of cushioning around the seat, since toddlers who are just learning have to sit on it for so long.  However, I'm still very pleased with it.
3	1178928000	I bought this based on researching other reviews & products.  This was the only product I could find without all the bells & whistles and distractions offered by most other products.  It is a simple potty & was the most like mommy & daddy's.  While the potty is easy to use, my 2 yr old son pees on the floor almost everytime when using it.  If he's not positioned just right, he goes over the top or to the side of the guard.  We have stopped using the potty after a couple of weeks & switched to the babybjorn toilet seat.  My son likes going on the big potty better & there have been almost no overspray accidents with it as compared to nearly 100% of the time with the potty chair.  As an added bonus, there is no clean up with a potty seat.
5	1178668800	This blue potty chair is used in our toddler rooms at our preschool. Children and teachers like them. Fast delivery.
5	1178668800	These potty chairs are used in the toddler rooms of our preschool. Very nice colorful chairs. The children really like them.
4	1177718400	Would be nice if the white container was made with a little cushion for the small tush, but it's nice in that it's easy to clean and easy for the little ones to sit on.  My 12 month old has no problems sitting in it.
5	1177632000	I purchased this potty chair for my 2 year old daughter. It arrived today, upon opening the box and setting the potty on the floor, my daughter was so excited she sat down and went potty in it within just a few minutes. She loves it. Arrived in excelent condition and is very sturdy. My daughter has no problems getting on and off of it by herself without the risk of it tipping over. The removable bowl is great, it's so easy to clean. She loves to just sit on it. Excelent product and I would recomend it to everyone who has a little one getting ready for the next step in becoming a big boy/girl.
5	1177200000	"me love mine potty! mi mommy liks it also and got me too of dem!!! even dough mine fwends wowe undies,me didn't kare-me liked diapers but wen mommy getted me dis comfy potty,i never gonna go in mi diapers ever again.i luv it cuz i can do it bi miself like mi mommy and daddy!!!weneva i need to go i just go an sit down.it is so cozy dat me dozent mind sitting on it for while.sinc it is ony too peices,when im dunn i can just spill it in da toilet and wipe itwith potty wipes*and its all cleen for next time!"Mom's Commentary;This potty is really fantastic!I bought two of them-one for upstairs and one for downstairs.I especially like the white one because it gives a clean look.All the other pottys I've tried either had lots of grooves and peices that were hard to clean and deal with or were only one piece which we would have a whole "operation clean-up" after each use. As my child mentioned,she can spill it in the toilet and then clean it with CLOROX WIPES.(she calles them "potty wipes"*) The rubber strip on the bottom makes it stay where its put.I also bought the  matching stool so that she can wash her hands and that stool proves to be great as well!I think that this potty deserves five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	1177200000	This is a great potty for boys.  We had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty, in the potty.  Easy to clean, too.
5	1177113600	This is a great potty!  No place for it to leak at, we had the Royal Potty but it leaked very badly.  But this one is great!  Plus it is cute!!
3	1177027200	My son was excited about going potty and we got this just before Christmas. He went three days without going potty in his pull-ups but he never like to sit on this potty. He would sit, stand, throw a fit, start peeing, and I would sit him back on it. One problem is that when he sat the splash guard was in the way which I'm sure was very uncomfortable. It wasn't really high enough to work properly so either way he would end up peeing on the floor. Another issue is that the seat was really too short for him. He was 37" tall when we got the potty seat (he was only 20 months). Oh, and one more FYI...when the white part is out there is just a big hole. Once when I was dumping the pee into the toilet he sat down to go #2 and once again...it was on the floor. (Which makes me wonder again if the splash guard was the problem because he would sit on it when the white part was out).This item has lots of great reviews which is why I purchased it so I still thin kit is a good product but you might want to think again if you have a taller child. I think he needs to use a ring that goes on the toilet or a urinal.
4	1176508800	and hopefully our last!  Son liked it from the beginning.  Although we haven't had success on it yet, it is comfortable enough and roomy enough that he can sit on it for a while to get used to it.
5	1176422400	I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining.  I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking.  I never could find the place that is was leaking.  So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair.  My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box.  He wanted to use it in the family room.  I love it because it is only 2 pieces.  It's so super easy to clean. And it is green my sons favorite color.  Great price and great size.  I recommend this item.
5	1176163200	I LOVE this potty!! My 16 month old daughter sits on it for a long time before wanting off, it seams comfortable. Her little feet touch the ground so she feels stable. I would recommend this chair.
5	1175644800	I am very happy with this potty.  It has a high guard which works well for a little boy.
5	1175472000	This chair works extremely well and is worth every penny. It is extremely easy to clean, and comfortable for a toddler to use. I would strongly recommend this potty chair to every parent.
5	1175126400	This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces.  It is also more stable than others we used.  We like it.
5	1174780800	I spent quite some time online researching on a good, reasonable potty and found this product. It's a bestseller and even better - most of the buyers are very satisfied with it. It's functional, sturdy, easy to clean and seems comfy. My son had some success with that one. :-)
5	1174608000	This is the third potty I've purchased for my son. The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it. The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts. This one is great. Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it. The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard. The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up. It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too. The back and arm supports fit well also. It's a solid construction and good buy.
5	1174608000	My son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this, but my impression is that it is VERY simple to clean up (which I LOVE the idea of).  It seems comfy, he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes :)
5	1174348800	I purchased two big boy potty books that arrived a few days before this potty did.  We had a different potty that did not work well for boys at all.  Once this potty got here he has not had one accident!!!  He just turned two yesterday and he loves his potty!  He gets excited every time he goes and claps for himself proclaiming that he is a big boy!!!  I would highly recommend this potty!!!!  Don't keep searching buy this one!  I threw his other potty right in the garbage.
5	1174176000	I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front.  I broke down and bought this.  This doesn't have the bells and whistles like some other potty.  But it's beauty is its simplicity.  he is able to sit and do his business, carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself (he was not even 2 yet!).  I would highly recommed the potty training book "Potty training in less than a day".  it's out of print but you might find an used copy on [...].
5	1173657600	With five young children in our home, we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties. With constant use (and abuse) they still look brand new! They are easy to clean (I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher) and easy to transport. My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier :) Well worth the money!!
4	1173571200	I DECIDED TO POTTY TRAIN MY SON USING JUST A POTTY TOPPER AND A STOOL. HE REALLY LOVES TO DO THINGS ALL BY HIMSELF JUST LIKE MOMMY AND DADDY SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR HIM. NO MATTER WHAT I DID HE CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCIDENT AFTER ACCIDENT. WE WOULD SIT IN THE BATHROOM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HE WOULD ALWAYS PEE AFTER I TOOK HIM OFF THE POTTY. I DECIDED THAT GETTING HIM HIS OWN POTTY SEAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SIT ON THE POTTY FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, INFRONT OF THE TV OR IN THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE FAMILY, OR IN HIS ROOM. I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE JUST THE THING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO PICK ONE OUT. I PICKED THE BABYBJORN POTTY CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN, EASY CLEAN UP AND THE DEFLECTOR. MOST SEATS HAVE VERY SMALL DEFLECTORS OR NONE AT ALL. SOME HAVE DEFLECTORS THAT DON'T STAY PUT. I ALSO LIKED THAT IS WAS DESIGNED TO STAY ON THE FLOOR AND NOT SLIP, SLIDE, OR GET STUCK TO THE CHILD.THE DAY THIS ARRIVED MY SON HAD HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS TO SPITE THAT FACT THAT WE HAD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE BATHROOM. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PUT HIM BACK IN PULL UPS WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED. HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST BUT I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS HIS VERY OWN NEW POTTY CHAIR AND THE SECOND HE SAT DOWN HE PEED IN IT!!! I LET HIM TAKE THE POT TO THE BIG POTTY AND DUMP IT WITH ME AND THAT WAS IT! HE WAS HOOKED. I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM ANYMORE OR HARASS HIM TO SIT DOWN. HE WOULD JUST RUN RIGHT OVER AND PEE AND THEN DECLARE "I DID IT!!!! MOMMY HELP ME DUMP IT." HE ONLY USED THIS POTTY CHAIR FOR ONLY ONE DAY BUT IT WAS DEFINETLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET THE IDEA. THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO USE THE BIG POTTY NOW AND HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK. WE USE THE POTTY CHAIR NOW FOR OUTINGS. IT IS GREAT! EASY TO CLEAN AND EASY TO BRING ALONG IN THE CAR!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEFLECTOR IS JUST A BIT LOW. IF MY SON WASN'T LEANING FORWARD TO WATCH HIMSELF PEE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CALL.THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THEIR CHILD'S LEGS WERE BEING SQUISHED BECAUSE OF THE DEFLECTOR BEING SO WIDE...MY SON WILL BE 3 IN 2 MONTHS AND HE IS A BIG BOY IN THE TOP 75 PERCENT FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND HE FIT FINE WITH LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE!!! THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNED ME WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS.
5	1173312000	Just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and "practice". So far so good.......
5	1173312000	we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on. he wouldn't use that potty, but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it. the bjorn is shaped perfectly, with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee. it's so comfy that he will sit and read a book! looks great too. simple and easy to clean.
5	1172880000	With five young children in our home, we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties. With constant use (and abuse) they still look brand new! They are easy to clean (I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher) and easy to transport. My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier :) Well worth the money!!
3	1171929600	It's a cute and very easy to clean potty and my 16 month old has had no problems with it, but in the mornings her pee sometimes splashes out from the bottom of the potty bowl.It is also shallow enough where she can stick her hands down and grab whatever it is inside there!Would I buy this product again? Maybe not..because if there is one thing I want my child not to do it is playing with the stuff inside the potty and not have to clean splattered pee.However if you have your mind set on a potty this may just fit your needs, but beware! Still I am satisfied with it.I think I will try toilet seats for kids instead.
4	1171670400	We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool, Potty Chair, Little Potty, and now the Toilet Trainer. Hind sight is 20/20. The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need. Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips. The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the toilet when she wants. The Toilet Trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean! The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start.
5	1171584000	I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair.  It doesn't have a lid or removable splash gurad.  I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with.  Putting the lids up and down, taking out the removable seat and catch basin, etc.This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges.  It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin.  The catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty.  It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with.I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys.This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet, which I think doesn't work anyway - on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe.  I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that.
5	1170979200	I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son. We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it. The first night I got it, he went pee pee and boo boo in it. I screamed and clapped and sang a little song. He really likes it. He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size. He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. One reviewer said the sprout was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable sprout and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull of the sprout and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty. With the baby bjorn there are no distractions, no music, no removable pieces(except the bowl)which allows him focus on going potty.  I just really like this potty chair. I would highly recommend this chair.

5	1170547200	We initially bought a potty chair from a local store. Each and every time my son used it I had to take it apart and clean every crack and crevice. I read the reviews on this potty and am I glad!! We ordered it from Amazon and the day it arrived my husband called me to tell me it was the best purchase we had ever made!! It's simple two piece design make it a breeze to keep clean. With the first potty my son would end up going everywhere because the splashguard was not high enough. This potty chair is almost oblong in shape and it keeps everything where it should be. It it large enough for my avearage size 2 1/2 year old boy. This is worth every penny we spent on it.
5	1170460800	What a great potty seat!!  The molded plastic makes clean up a breeze so you don't have a residual odor developing.  My son loves it.  It is also small enough it doesn't take up much room in the bathroom.  And the color blends in nice.
4	1170288000	When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward).
5	1169856000	This is the second potty seat that I bought for my daughter. She loves this seat. The first potty seat was one that could turn into a stepstool. You could remove the top to put on the toilet if you wanted. Well, we thought that was great, until we realized the top and bottom were constantly separating. It was making us crazy and annoyed. It was also awful to clean.Being a big fan of other Bjorn items, I decided to buy the (what I thought was overpriced) potty. Well, I wish I had just bought this in the first place. It's a cinch to clean! Just so easy to pop in the shower if there is an awful mess to clean.It has no whistles or bells. Instead of a sticker chart, I told my daughter I'd give her money everytime she used the potty. She was excited to "feed her piggy" pennies.My daughter (now 3) also sits on this chair when she is playing. Its that confortable. Also, small and portable enought to take with you when sleeping over someones house.
5	1169769600	I purchased this potty because it was very simple in design.  I knew the ones that looked too much like toys or played music would be distracting to my daughter.  The first time I put it out she sat right down by herself.  After reading other reviews, I also agree that this is a small potty and one of the reasons it works so well for us is that my 18 month old daughter is very petite.  If she were on the opposite size of the growth scale, I can see that it would likely not be wide enough.Still, for us, it's great!  Simple design, easy for her to get on and off of herself, easy to clean, it has a back that she can lean back against, nothing to fall or pinch her.  If you have a smaller child, I would recommend this potty!
4	1169424000	I like the simple design. It's also easy to clean, portable, and my son likes to sit in it. The only reason why I didn't give it a five star rating is because when my son gets up, the seat sticks to him. I would have to hold it down in order to prevent a mess from occurring.
5	1169337600	We had bought a potty chair when our son turned 2, when he started using it a few  months later I was greatly disappointed, I spent so much time trying to keep it clean, it had lots of little cracks and crevices and it was not really big enough. After reading reviews on this potty I decided to buy it. ..boy am I glad I did, this potty is larger than most of the ones I have seen and it is so easy to keep clean. My son is not a large 2 year old and he had trouble with the one we originally bought. We have no more messes on the floor and this simple two piece design makes keeping it cleaned a breeze.
4	1168300800	My 16 month old son enjoys sitting on his potty chair. It suits the contour of the body but unfortunately for boys, the tip of the front guard is a bit shy in height, he needs to sit very still to prevent a "waterfall" from going over the guard. I still like this chair, its very easy to clean, he seems to find it comfortable.
5	1167955200	And he sat on the weee little chair, and it fit him just right.  I purchased this potty along with the Once Upon a Potty DVD, which at 22 months my son wasn't too excited about, but at 25 months and just today infact, he woke up dry and was ready to use the potty for the first time.  I chose white to match with our Big Potty and love how all the curves are soft on it.  It also has a back rest so they are encouraged to sit all the way back.  Also, the seat just lends itself to pinch-free comfort.  The little cup is easy to pour, clean and put back for little hands.  We bought two, one for upstairs and one for the downstairs.  Good Luck!
5	1167782400	This is the only potty chair my 2 year old Grandson will use. My daughter had to cart it back and forth to day care once a week. Before his visitfrom KS. to MA. I purchased this particular one. I lined up the new one and 2 other ones I had prior for his sister's potty training and he only used this new one. It is easy to clean also. It's on Grandma's favorite's list.Grandma from MASSACHUSETTS
5	1167782400	We bought this after reading the reviews on it. It's very sturdy and easy to clean. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other seats but I don't think it's necessary personally. We bought this one also because it looked like a real potty. My daughter started showing an interest in training at about 18 months but we bought two of these (one for each bathroom) probably at about 14 months. She started sitting on her potty with her clothes on and so when she began to show a real interest, the seats were there and she was already comfortable with them. We also wanted her experience to be like that of what she sees her family do. Afterall, the real toilets don't play music. We have just provided her a good amount of books to keep her attention when she is just sitting there.
2	1167264000	I LOVED the design of this potty when I saw it at the store.  It only has 2 parts which would make it easy to clean.  I loved the solid color because I thought we could decorate it with stickers when we used the potty correctly.  It seemed perfect until I brought it home and showed it to my daughter.  This potty has a built in splash guard that is not removable.  My daughter has a difficult time sitting on this potty because of the splash guard.  She tries to sit to the side to avoid sitting on the bump in the middle.  We've been practicing sitting on it for several weeks now and she just doesn't seem comfortable with it.  I'm so disappointed because this potty seemed perfect but I think we're going to have to find something different.
5	1167091200	Purchased this potty for my 2 year old daughter. She enjoyed just sitting on it.  It's comfortable and fits her just right. She'll even sit and read while she goes.  Love the pull out bowl feature.  Great for dumping and cleaning in a jiffy.  My daughter even feels proud because she can help dump it.  Easy to use.  No buttons, no whistles, no ways for it to fall apart. Thrilled we picked a terrific potty the first time.We're getting a second one in a different color for her bedroom upstairs since she's starting to use it more often.Highly recommended.
5	1166400000	This is the third potty I've purchased for my son.  The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it.  The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts.  This one is great.  Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it.  The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard.  The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up.  It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too.  The back and arm supports fit well also.  It's a solid construction and good buy.
5	1162512000	Baby Bjorn consistently combines great design with simple products.  No bells or whistles but it does the job.  I would greatly recommend this product; my daughter loves it and got motivated to start potty training.
5	1162080000	I started out with a less expensive potty when I began toilet-training my son, but every time he sat on it to pee, it went all over the floor in front of him.  The splash guard just didn't do its job very well.  My friend's son had the Baby Bjorn potty and so I immediately went out and purchased one and it's been GREAT!  No more clean-up after he uses it because this potty is deeper and the splash guard is higher.  It's also more comfortable for him to sit on and doesn't irritate his skin like the other one.  As other reviewers have said, this potty is also heavier so it doesn't tip over as easily.I higly recommend this to anyone in the market for a potty!
5	1161216000	I used this seat with my son, and now with my daughter. He started potty training at 12 months and was pretty much done at 15 months, with his very last accident at 18 months. He was a small toddler and the seat was just the right size to sit on.Now I have a six month baby girl, we are E.C.ing (Elimination Communication, or Infant Potty Training). She uses the pot part separate from the chair to pee in. We have been using in with her since she was two weeks old, and she is very comfortable sitting over it in mommy's lap. She recognizes the pot and knows what it is for. I look forward to the days when she will recognize the pot in the chair and sit on it by herself.Great seat, easy to clean, nice for early starters, and also for older kids who want their own chair and want to empty the deep pot by themselves. (Very low risk of spilling.)Mrs. Meg Logan
5	1159747200	As a "first time" mom of a 13 month old boy, these reviews have been so helpful! Not only do I know which potty seat works best for other little guys...but I also know the ones to run away from! Thank you Moms!!!!
5	1158624000	We were given this potty (in blue) by a neighbor, and my son has had some great early success on it. It's comfy, and the fact that the splash guard is a unibody construction with the removable pot is a godsend, in terms of how easy it is for my son to get on and off the chair. Within days of his first success, he was able to use this potty with no help and carry the pot in to me in the next room to show off his latest success! However, we didn't find out how truly great it was until we tried to buy a second potty for upstairs use. We've purchased two others. One had a splash guard so low and poorly designed that my son's "privates" landed squarely on top of it every time he sat down. Another had a high splash guard, but it was soft and movable and flopped down underneath my son every time he sat down. He's become very upset each time we try a new terrible potty and I feel awful for putting him through it. No more. We're buying a 2nd Baby Bjorn right now and I'd highly recommend that anyone about to embark on the potty training journey with a boy do the same. Simply the most well-designed potty chair out there.

5	1155945600	I ordered 2 of these- one for the downstairs bathroom and one for the upstairs bath.  My daughter has taken to this seat right away.  I had a musical potty seat prior to this one that did not work as well.  This potty seat has a large opening for the children to comfortably sit on.  There is a rubber backing on the bottom of the chair so it won't skid on your bathroom floor.  Potty training has been much easier since I ordered this seat!
4	1155340800	This potty chair is wonderful.  It has a nice, easy to clean design that blends well with any bathroom.  It's a good size too.  I also like the fact that it doesn't slide around.  It has rubber on the bottum that grips any type of floor.  I would recommend this item.
5	1154390400	This is our fifth piece of potty equipment.  We have two potty chairs and three potty toppers.  The Bjorn ones are the best of both.  Our old potty chair, a First Years one, is just too small for my 2yo son.  He's just a little above average in size and just turned 2 a few months ago.  He doesn't fit on it at all.  Not all of his "parts" fit into the bowl and pee goes everywhere.  With the Bjorn chair, he can easily sit down himself.  All his parts fit inside so there is never a mess.  And there is plenty of room for growth.  In fact, my 4yo can sit on it also and fits fine.  He's a bit on the tall and skinny side though.Unlike our old potty, it is very easy to clean.  The bowl is all one piece of smooth plastic, with no grooves or indentations to hinder cleaning.  The bowl sits fully on the base, so the pee doesn't leak around the seam and onto the floor like our old potty.  The bowl is contoured and comfortable.  We have never found the splash guard to get in the way of anything.  It performs as intended with no problems.  There are also grips on the bottom which keeps the seat in place on the floor.  Our other potty could easily tip over and slide across the floor.  The way the front of the seat is contoured makes it comfortable to sit for my son, his legs sit comfortably on each side of the potty chair.  The bowl itself is also easy for my son to carry because of the way it is shaped.  I have him carry the bowl to the big toilet to dump its contents.We also have the Bjorn potty topper which I also highly recommend.  All one piece which makes it easier to clean.  And nicely contoured again for comfort.  The adjustable knob in back also keeps it sitting securely on the toilet and it doesn't slide around.  It is much better than our old one that was actually two pieces and just awful to clean. You can imagine what got in between the two pieces.  Yuck!We have the Ocean Blue Bjorn potty seat and it's quite attractive (considering it's purpose!).  The white bowl is easy to clean.  Obviously, if you can get your child to go straight to the big toilet with a topper, that is ideal, but not every kid wants to do that.  My first son was scared of the big toilet for 6 months!  Also, our bathroom is a fair distance from the family room, so having this potty in the family room allows us to catch our son quickly when we see that he has to go.  If we had to carry him all the way to the bathroom, he probably wouldn't make it.  You can also use it in the car for travel quite well.My 2yo son has only peed on the potty (little or big) a few times until we got this one.  He peed on it within an hour of pulling it out of the box.  And in the week since we've had it, he has started to do the big job on this potty once a day too, in addition to peeing on it several times a day. Maybe this one will learn to use the potty quicker than his brother!  One can only hope.
5	1153872000	I have had wonderful luck with this potty seat. I got it for my son at 20 months when he showed interest in the potty, not expecting him to actually use it for some time to come. As soon as we got it out of the box he was so excited to have his very own potty, especially one that looks so much like Mommy and Daddy's (we got the white one). He went potty the first time he sat on it and has been enthusiastic about going ever since. I love it because the base is wide and sturdy, there are no bells and whistles to distract the child, and clean-up is wonderfully easy. Wash the bowl out, and there aren't really nooks and crannies that you have to worry about getting dirty and cleaning. All in all, a wonderful product. My son and I both love it.
5	1153353600	I am so grateful that I found this potty for my son. It is really the perfect potty chair. It is so well designed. It is sturdy and does not tip at all, even if he leans on just one of the arms or kicks it, etc. It has a nice high back to give him support and is the perfect height. It has a deflector that is part of the bowl, so that it is all one piece, which is very important for little boys. (Due to this design feature we have not had any problem with the pee going anywhere but in the bowl) It is also super easy to clean. Just remove the bowl, dump in the big toliet, wipe with tissue and a Lysol wipe and you are done. Simple, simple, simple. Best of all, my son actually uses this potty and is very successful with it. Once again, Baby Bjorn lives up to its reputation.We had also tried the "Once Upon a Potty" potty chair, but it was too hard to clean out (no removeable bowl).

4	1152835200	I have a 13 month old daughter and she loves to sit on this potty. I must say that the smooth surface is easy to clean/wipe. The back rest is convenient b/c it keeps her/him in place.  The middle leg divider has a Pro/Con. This part makes it a little difficult for her to stand up. This is a good thing if you want her/him to stay put, bad if you want her/him to get up on their own. Over all, my daughter loves it and that's what is important for me.
5	1150934400	This potty works wonderfully for average size boys since the basin is one-piece molded plastic.  (i.e. not detachable). My little boy was average height/weight when he started using it at 2 1/2.  The urine stayed inside the basin, didn't splash out, and the basin is very easy to clean.  However, my son outgrew it within a few months, and actually started having accidents in his diaper again because he was being pinched.  We bought the Potty N Step Stool, removed the pee guard, and it has worked well as a "just for #2" potty.I would not recommend it for larger boys:  A friend of mine bought this potty, upon my recommendation, for her 90th%tile [...], and he was too big for it from the get-go.
5	1150070400	This chair is larger than some of the seats out there, and fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well. Some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use, as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats! The seat is shaped just right for splashes, and it seems comfortable. Now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day, we'd be in business! I love the simple design, my son loves the color (he picked it out himself), and it's so simple to clean. It also has grips on the bottom so that it won't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it -- a must!
5	1149724800	I looked at several potties before choosing this one.  I like it's simple construction and the fact that the splash guard is "built in."  My son is over 30 lbs and has no problem sitting on this seat.  I would highly reccomend using this potty for boys simply because it does not have a flimsy splash guard like so many others.
4	1147046400	If you are looking for a smaller sized potty LOOK NO FURTHER!  My girls are consider very small for their ages. My 21 month old daughter (She is the one the seat is for) weights about 19lbs and wears a size 3 diaper with room to grow.this seat is PERFECT for her. she doesn't fall in.  I love Graco and i have the training rewards potty from my other daughter but the little one slides through the seat w/ a diaper.I find it easy to clean too. She has only went #1 once so far but that's another story LOL.I give it a 4 only because I don't think it would be good for older kids or babies big for their age trying to train. I'm thinking from the looks of it, it can hold a child up to 25 lbs give or take. Nor can i say how good or bad it is for boys.
5	1145923200	We love this potty.  It's easy for our son to use and easy for us to clean.  The splashguard is the best!
5	1145923200	We bought 2 of these potty chairs. They were so easy to clean and stayed brand new looking that I sold both of them for 75% of their original list price when we were done with them. How cool is that? They maintained their value.Note: When potty training, don't forget to buy the character underwear. We bought Elmo Underwear with the baseball cap (sport theme) from ebay and it worked great. Trained within days!!

4	1145836800	This potty is very good, for sitting.  But now that my son likes to stand and go... Well let's just say his aim is less than perfect. If he hits the back of the seat, or anywhere other than a direct hit, it rolls straight down and under the rim of the removable bowl.  I'm constantly cleaning up the floor and pretty much the entire chair.So if you've got a stander, maybe not the best bowl.Thanks for reading!
5	1145318400	We purchased this potty for our son after the potty we borrowed from my sister consistantly leaked urine when he would potty on it.  This seat is great--only two pieces and super easy to clean.  The splash guard on the front is one solid piece with the bowl so it doesn't have the gap that caused the problem on the other potty.  The splash gaurd is also high enough so it gets everything in the bowl.  This is by far the best potty out there!
5	1144627200	I keep this potty as a spare in our master bath (we have other potty seats by Bjorn). My son loves this potty, and so do I. The simple design makes it easy to clean and use. Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper potties made of thin plastic. I returned every one of them and purchased all Bjorn products. I love how sturdy their designs are.
5	1144540800	I started potty trainingg(Elimination Communication method) my 4 month old with this potty. The design makes it easy for the child to go to the bathroom. I swear it puts pressure in the right areas to help express the pee and poop! My baby is already potty trained at 6 months! She loves the potty. The back and side rests give her the support she needs. She sits on it like it is a throne. It is easy to clean and very sturdy. The best potty in the world!
5	1144022400	I love this potty chair!!  It is so simple, and that is what I like about it - simple to use & simple to clean.  My little boy loves it.
5	1144022400	After extensive research, I finally settled on this potty chair and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I, like many other reviewers, was intially put off by the $22 price tag.The problem I have with many baby products today is that companies try to make something a "new concept" by adding bells and whistles or attempting to make things multi-purpose.  Don't get me wrong, I love technology and my daughter has tons of electronic gadgets, but potty chairs should not double as toys.  Nor do I care to have my child using her potty in the future to stand on to reach the sink.This is exactly what a potty should be... a potty and nothing else.  Its ergonomic design and rubber bottom makes it comfortable and stable, even on carpet.  It looks remarkably similar to a real potty because if its smooth, white finish.  When I got it home my 16-month-old daughter immediately knew what it was and wanted to sit on it.  She now loves to sit on the potty and this one appears to be very comfortable for her.In a nutshell, it is simply made, easy to clean and perfect for potty training.
5	1143158400	I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works.  Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things.  She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read "the potty book for girls" She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.  We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself.  It is very basic and sturdy.  My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.  I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the "big" potty.
5	1142985600	I love the design of this chair.  It's all one piece (except the bowl) and it's very stable.  I like that there is a back for support.  The removable bowl is convenient to empty and clean.  I bought this for my third child, but I wish I had had it with my other two.
5	1142899200	This potty chair has a great design that is easy to use and clean. The Baby Bjorn Potty Chair is simple and sanitary. There are no places for bacteria to hide, and the design is much better than some of the other potties out there. My parents have a different potty at their house for my daughter to use, and it's very difficult to keep clean and to use. My daughter likes the Baby Bjorn much better. I'd highly recommend the Baby Bjorn to anyone. The price is a little higher, but it's definitely worth it.
5	1142640000	We read the reviews posted about the BabyBjorn Potty Chair and based on all the reviews for boys we thought we would give it a try. We purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Chair for our 2 year old son, we had the potty for about a half hour and our little boy went potty two times the first day, and 4 times the second day.  This potty is easy to clean all you do is simply wash the potty and take a lysol or clorox wipe to disinfect and your done. The best thing about this product is that it only has two pieces. With the inside base being white is a great feature when your teaching kids to potty, they can actually see what they did in the potty unlike most of the other potty products on the market that have a colored inside base. Needless to say we have also tried the Graco potty and it is now with the city dump yard. I recommend this potty for it's simplicity. Five stars all the way.
5	1142380800	I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product.
1	1142208000	My 19mo daughter was SO excited to receive her very own potty and her and I were both very disappointed with the potty the very first time she sat on it.  The built in guard made it difficult for her to sit on the potty w/o assistance.  She needed handles to hold on to while she sat down and this potty doesn't really have handles.  The arm rests are too far back for her to hold on to while sitting on or getting off of this potty.  The collection bowl is very narrow which isn't an issue however the molded plastic is very rough on that sensitive little tooshie.  She only needs to sit on it for 30 seconds and she has a bright red ring around her bottom.  Getting off of the potty is difficult as well as I stated before she likes her handles.  Before the potty arrived she was asking to sit on the big potty several times a day and now that she has her own to sit on she is not asking nearly as much.  It is obvious that she is very uncomfortable.  I tried turning the collection bowl around so that the guard is in the back but the potty is not made to be in this position.  It does not fit correctly and she is not able to sit back against the back rest.  It is however slightly more comfortable for her legs.  My daughter likes to pick the potty up and carry it around (silly girl) and I do like how it doesn't fall apart when she does this.  I think if she were to do this with any other potty on the market they would fall apart.  I must say I am not at all impressed with this potty and am very disappointed with baby bjorn.
1	1142208000	I bought this potty after reading the reviews thinking this sounded like a great potty chair.  I am not happy with it at all.  My son is 30 lbs and almost 3 feet tall at not quite 2 years old.  The potty seat is too small, it leaves a red ring on his bottom and when he stands up, it sticks to him.  However, that's not the worst part.  My son is afraid to sit on it by himself because he's accidentally sat on the splash guard and poked himself more than once.  Also when he pees it goes up the splash guard and right out of the potty.  There's more pee on the floor than in the potty.  My son freaked out the first time it happened because he had pee all over him.  I would not buy this potty seat for boys especially larger ones.
5	1142121600	I bought this for my 1 year old daughter and I must say that I love it! I like the fact that it has a back to it. Sitting on the potty can be very uncomfortable for a little one when there is nothing to support their small backs. My little one is doing good with her potty training. The seat appears to be comfy for her and the receptacle is very easy to remove and clean. The chair itself is easy to clean as well. I also like the fact that they come in different colors they are really cute.
5	1142121600	I went thru 3 other potty chairs and my son did not like any of them. I was especially impressed with the oval opening versus the usual circular opening on other chairs. I found this potty to be the easiest to clean. This was the best potty I have found and works especially well for a boy. Highly recommend this.
5	1141689600	There's no need for buttons that play music or a 'play' flusher that makes sounds.  My son was very distracted by all the bells and whistles of another brand, that he didn't even want to try it.  He absolutely loves his Baby Bjorn potty chair!  We got one in white and a stool to match.  It took him one week to learn how to use it!  He's only 19 mos. now and only uses it before and after the bath (which is a great start!)  It's a simple design and he looks pretty comfy in it.  The part you take out and clean doesn't lift up when he stands up (like other chairs I've heard of).  I just throw out the waste in the toilet, rinse it out in the sink, then wipe clean and dry with a Clorox disinfecting wipe.  So easy... buy one now!
4	1141430400	My son was 17 months old when I ordered/recieved this item.  He was just getting interested in the potty and trying to take his  clothes off. When I got the package he was right there and he tried it out right away.  he fits perfectly on it, but it is a little ackward for a beiginer.  Now a month latter he is seasoned at sitting down on it and getting back up.  He is almost potty trained and I am convinced it is because of this potty chair.
5	1141257600	This is a great potty chair. I had a Safety 1st potty chair/step stool combo chair that didn't work out because my son likes to dump the potty by himself and in order to do that he had to lift the chair apart and then pull out the bowl. It was always messy. This chair is wonderful in that the bowl fits nicely on top of the seat so he just lifts it straight up and out and is able to dump it easily. With the Safety 1st model and others, there are lots of spots and crevices under the bowl where the spills get caught. This Bjorn potty chair is simply constructed so it is easy to clean.
5	1141171200	It's an excellent potty for a 6 month old like my baby. The potty is small enough for a 6 month old to sit on it, and at the same time big enough to serve her for at least 3 years. The seat is comfortable and, evidently, suggests what is supposed to be done while sitting on it. The back is comfortably close so that it supported my baby when she did not sit yet confidently on her own. And, the potty is sturdy and does not slide. It's been over a month now, and we are having total success with this potty: we have not had a single soiled diaper, just a few wet ones mainly at night. I highly recommend this potty chair: it's simply and ingeniously designed, it's compact, sturdy, easy to clean, and super-comfortable for the ones who are learning to sit.
5	1140739200	I BOUGHT THIS POTTY AFTER READING MANY REVIEWS ONLINE.  WE HAD A FISHER PRICE POTTY THRONE WHERE IT PLAYS MUSIC AND LIGHTS UP, AND MY DAUGHTER DID NOT LIKE IT, IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO GET ON AND OFF AND THE MUSIC JUST PLAYS AND PLAYS!  THE BABY BJORN IS GREAT, I LOVE THE RUBBER ON THE BOTTOM, CAN'T BE PUSHED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE, AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT.  SHE WILL SIT ON IT AND READ BOOK AFTER BOOK.  THE HIGH BACK IS GREAT TO SO SHE CAN LEAN BACK AND RELAX, VERY EASY TO CLEAN, NO CRACKS OR CREVICES. IT IS A GREAT SIZE AS WELL, WE GO CAMPING A LOT AND IT IS A PERFECT SIZE FOR OUR CAMPER  THIS POTTY WILL BE HERE FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN TOO COME
5	1140652800	I purchased this potty for my 21 month old based on the other reviews I read.  She's very tall (97th percentile), and I realized the smaller Bjorn Potty Chair would be too small for her.  This one is perfect.  It has a rubber rim around the bottom so it stays put on the ceramic tile floor.  It's super easy to clean, and it's very plain looking so it blends in with her bathroom.  She loves it!  She puts all her dolls and stuffed animals on it so they can go potty, too.
3	1139184000	I bought this potty for my 26 month old son.  I agree with the other reviewers that this potty is a breeze to empty and clean, with no hidden cracks or crevices to collect bacteria.  However, this potty just doesn't work for little boys.  The pee guard isn't high enough and, even though he aims down, every time my son pees it runs down the front and all over the floor.  The guard needs to be higher for little boys!
5	1137974400	I just got this potty chair for my almost 10 month old son.  Like another reviewer said, I don't intend to potty train him now but just let him get used to sitting on a potty chair.  He loves to sit on it and look at a book.  It is the perfect size and shape for little ones just learning to sit on a potty.  I like how my son can sort of straddle it and sit securely with the high back to support him.  Other chairs seem like they would be awkward and hard for toddlers to keep their balance when getting off.  Not this one-my son can stand right up without scraping himself on the splash guard.  The design is great.  It is easy to pick up the bowl part to empty it and then rinse it right out.  My son looked really comfortable sitting on it and to my surprise he's even pottied on it 3 times already since I got it, about 3 days ago. I highly recommend this potty chair over the other ones, even though they might look nicer and cost less.
5	1137888000	This is light, safe, easy to clean and attractive.  My daughter likes it and is having no trouble so far using it.  She can easily and safely get on and off it by herself or with help.  It is also easy to clean.
5	1137283200	We bought another potty with a detachable soft seat which can be used on a regular toilet and the potty can convert to a step.  Fisher Price maybe?  We thought it was great and put up with the pee leaking out and the guard that didnt work untill one day no matter how much I cleaned it, it smelled like pee.  We found out the cushion detaches from the handles and was a nice little pocket for pee to dry in.  After reading recomendations from Toddler Bargains (the best book!) we decided on the little Bjorn potty.  Mainly due to the one piece construction.  Once it arrived we were a bit surprised to see how small it was and my sons knees were nearly up to his chest.  Oddly enough, he LOVES it.  It goes to show you, they know what they like better than us.  The straddle design is so much smarter than the stupid splash guards.  We rarely have flyaway pee to deal with now (though thats normally due to sticking issues... boy stuff I dont understand cause Im a girl).  The entire potty is nearly the same size as the removable bucket from our other one, so carrying the whole thing to dump isnt an issue.  I really just love how there is no cracks or anything to clean.  Its a simple swipe with a lysol cloth and were all done!  Leave it to Baby Bjorn, they always know what works best.  (oh, by the way, we often forget that its easier to push things out when our knees are up, but think child birth, and the stomach flu...) We have decided to buy three, one for the car, one upstairs and one downstairs.  It works wonderfully in the car too!
5	1137196800	This is by far the best potty chair. I bought the  BabyBjorn because I wanted something no-nonsense (no music, flushing sounds etc).  This potty chair is sturdy, has a large splash guard, and very sanitary---only 2 pieces.  It  has never leaked, unlike some others I had when my older children were potty training. It must be comfortable, because my son sits on it in his clothes to read books. I would definitely recommend this potty chair.  Great purchase!
5	1137024000	Love this potty! It's white and matches our bathroom nicely...it blends in. EASY to use and clean, SIMPLE too. Recommended also by "Toddler Bargains". Have not been disappointed!
5	1136764800	We just bought this seat today and I am already soooo glad that I bought this one and not one of the other cheaper models I was looking at. The other models may have been cheaper but they were much more complicated, having three seperate parts to make keeping it clean quite a challenge.  The BabyBjorn has only two pieces and the whole thing is a nice, shiney clean looking white.  My daughter is comfortable when sitting on it and she gets on and off of it with no danger of tipping.  I am so pleased with this chair.  And if you are like I was and having a hard time spending $22.00 on a potty chair when there is another available for $12.99, give yourself some perspective:  how much are you spending on diapers EVERY WEEK???  I think this chair will be our family's ticket to waving goodbye to the diaper portion of the weekly grocery bill =)
5	1135987200	I love this potty!  It has a high back for support and is the most comfortable chair that we've tried!  A WORD OF CAUTION, our son was hesitant to try this new potty as we'd tried several of the cheaper ones first.  As the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  Start with this potty.  It really is a great purchase.
5	1134345600	I just received my BabyBjorn potty last week, and my daughter is only 15 months old, so I can't write about her being successful at potty training yet.  But she has already gone #1 in her potty the first time she ever sat on it bare-bottom, and I am thrilled.  I bought this potty early so she would see it around and get use to it before being expected to use it.  As soon as I took it out of the box she wanted to sit on it, and cried when I took her off or took her potty away.  And because she likes sitting on it so much, she has started sitting on it immediately after I remove her dirty diapers during her diaper change, before I put her new diapers on.  And about half the time she goes pee in it while she sits there.This potty is so sturdy and sanitary cause it is easy to clean.  I love how long and deep the opening is, and how there is no chance for leakage.  When it comes to potties, the simplest design is definitely the best.  My daughter can lean on it without it tipping over, and she loves to comfortably lean against the backrest while sitting on it.  The shape of this potty ensures that kids sit on it correctly every time.  I am so happy I read the reviews before picking a potty, and bought this one from amazon instead of just going with whatever I could find at my local stores.
2	1132099200	I got this potty because I found it the most simple and aesthetically pleasing.  While my daughter used it at first for a few days, she has since complained about the seam between the "bowl" and the "chair" (She points to the seam along the back of the chair, wiggles the bowl, says "back and forth . . . don't like. . .owwie".)  As a 30 lb. 2 year old, she's on the big side and I think that this chair is just uncomfortable for her.  She actually now refuses to use it and has asked me for a "new potty"
5	1132012800	My wife just purchase this potti chair and we can`t be happier with the results. The same day she brought it home, our son did number one immediately. I don`t know what made him do it so quickly, but it works. It so easy to clean with no mess. This is a must have if you are experiencing trouble in making your son go to the potti.
4	1131926400	We just got this potty after trying the Safety 1st potty for a couple of months. As soon as my son saw it he knew just what it was. We watch the "Once Upon a Potty" video and the old bowl style potty in it was throwing him off I think. THis is close enough to that style that he started quoting part of the video upon first site. He then stood up backed up to it and sat down without any assistance, a great improvement from the other potty. He can get up and down from it without maiming his privates. His only problem with it so far is that he's apparently gotten use to having the back pressed against his rear so he pushes all the way back on this potty too. This is a little odd given its oval shaped bowl. Hopefully our stalled potty training will get a jump start down. Just in one day he is much more eager and willing to sit on it and he giggles over quoting the video while he sits there.
5	1128124800	I had purchased at first just a regular potty from a local store and didnt think it would be a big deal a potty is a potty.. well i was wrong after buying the first one my daughter would turn herself around on it and it had nooks and cranies where germs would stay since it was hard to clean... i then read the reviews for the baby bjorn potty and knew this was the one my daughter is small and it fits her like a glove and she doesnt do the spins anymore and it is so easy to clean with everything a smooth surface... i would highly recommend this one to anyone who is looking for a good potty
4	1128038400	It is one of the most stable, comfortable and "consistant" seat I have found.  My 18 month old daughter can get on and off by her self and hits the target every time.  The hole is larger than any other I've seen.
5	1124668800	We had the Royal Potty by Fisher Price before this one and were not happy with it at all.  This potty is better in every way.  Forget the bells and whistles of the fisher price potties and go for the simple, efficient, easy to clean, and pretty Baby Bjorn.  My son wouldn't sit on the other potty because it wasn't comfortable, he also had trouble backing up onto it him self.  He can get on the Baby Bjorn all by himself and he's comfortable sitting there for a while.  We are so glad we made the switch.
2	1124064000	I bought this potty based on the review of others.  I purchased it for my son who will be turning three and was very hesitant about training on the normal toilet.  This potty does have a larger seat, however, it's urine deflector is not tall enough and the urine leaks through the bottom.  It is very easy to clean but I would recommend this potty for girls only.
5	1122422400	I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.  It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.  Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.  The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty!The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.  There are no little places for bacteria to collect.The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.  This alone would have sold me on this potty.The splash guard is great for boys.  No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!
5	1122249600	We are currently training our 2nd child.  With our first, we had 3 in diapers, giving us MAJOR motivation to get him potty trained, so we tried almost every seat out there.  Most of them were okay, but just got nasty quckly, were hard to disinfect, or were uncomfortable for my son.  The ones with the removable splash gaurd are not gentle and can scrape a child's sensitive parts.  Those were awful.  We were "potty training" for a full year before we finally saw the BabyBjorn potty chair in a local botique, and DS immediately sat in it.  He chose blue, and we took it home.  Within a week, he was trained, and began using the "big boy seat", so we saved the seat for our daughter.  It was incredable!  Now our 23 month old daughter is training.  We bought her this white babybjorn seat for our downstairs bathroom, with the blue upstairs.  She has been "training" for 6 days now, and is almost completely day trained!This seat is by far the best in our experiences.  Here's why:  1. the seat has a higher back and sides, which gives the child support while sitting down, standing up, or simply sitting there.  2. It is NOT easy to tip! several of the others we tried tipped without much effort when our child was putting pressure on the sides trying to sit down or stand.  3. It is super easy to clean - there aren't a bunch of seams to gather gunk, it's easy to wipe down with a clorox wipe and be done.  It's also super easy to take the little bucket out, and soak in clorox or hose down.  4. Kids can choose what color they want!  This was such a big deal to my children --- also, they are solid colors that can look nice with your bathroom.  The surface is also nice that your child can decorate the back with cute stickers if wanted.  5. It works for children of all different sizes!  My son was 40" and 42lbs when potty training, and my daughter is 25lbs and a little shrimp, and this seat fit them both WONDERFULLY.Overall, having tried MANY seats, this one was the absolute best for both our children, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone in need of a seat for potty training success~!
1	1034899200	I am VERY disappointed with this potty chair! It got rave reviews on this site- so I rushed right out to my nearest Babies R Us store and purchased it. Now I wish I hadent! First of all, my son has used it seven times in the last two days. And, ALL seven times... we had pee all over the floor- down his legs- on us (we were in front of him). It's not even a result of 'position' on the chair. I sit him all the way back-... I'm at whitts end with this darn thing! He doesn't even like sitting on it. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers... it's is WAY too narrow for children of potty training ages. My son is 14 monts old, average size... and it's small for him... VERY disappointed. I guess the only advantage I can see to this one that the splash guard is attached so my son can't rip it off. Although, what good is it if the pee goes up and over the top?! Oh- and when my son stands up- the potty collection bucket sticks to his rear and wants to pop out with him. Then, when I safely get the collection pan back into the pot,it's a fight to keep him from taking it out (and spilling contents) all over. Never thought of those problems with this design, but something to consider when contemplating purchase of this product. So, if you have a [small child],don't mind pee all over the floor, and don't mind the pot (and it's contents)coming up with your little one, by all means... rush right out and buy it!
5	1030060800	We had to buy 3 potties before going for this one. We tried: Graco with soft seat, but its splashguard comed right off; the 1st years 3-in-1 potty had a hole that was located too close to the back thus making it very uncomfortable for a boy, because everything got mashed; and a musical potty by safety 1st, which leaked. This potty finally works! But I am so surprised to find that there is no perfect potty on the market! Looks like consumer reports haven't done much job; one way or the other, big brands have left out our little kid's bottoms with POOR CHOICES, of which the best(truly) here to present - baby bjorn potty chair...hope kids of my kids will do better.
5	1027987200	I started potty training my son early (at 11 months).  Since I didn't have any other kids, I had no idea which chair to try.  I first bought the safety first chair and it leaked, tipped over, and the deflector pinched my son.  All of the chairs that I tried were too tall and my son couldn't touch the floor with his feet. Most of the chairs were just a plain seat, with no back or sides, and nothing to hold on to. WHat a nightmare!  I decided to go back to [the store] and try another chair.  While in the store I let my son sit (fully clothed) on the Baby Bjorn potty chair...he loved it so much!  He cried when I took him off of it!  It has a good deflector that is not able to pinch, it has a wide and deep bowl which makes cleaning a breeze, and it's design with a high back and sides make it comfy.  It is also low enough that my son can easily get on and off my himself.  I will definately use the Bjorn products for potty training from now on!
5	1027209600	My 26-month-old daughter started sitting on this potty seat when she was 18 months old, and she loves it.  She finds it comfortable and will sit on it for a long time.  The removeable white seat makes cleaning very easy.  This is a wonderful seat for potty training and definitely worth the money!
4	1021766400	We bought this Bjiorn potty seat 3 years ago, and both our daugher and son love it. I'm particularly pleased with the splashguard feature on the front, as little boys (and come to think of it, grown men as well!) tend to have bad aim. The highback chair allows your child to relax and sit back (something you may both have to do for a while when they first start training!) The white seat comes out to empty into the toilet- which is the only downside. We also have a potty seat that fits on the big toilet, and it is nice not to have to clean the little potty out when they use that one. Still, the kids prefer their Bjiorn. In fact, the best potty training tool came to me when my 3 year old sat on the potty seat on the toilet and put his extra-large Pooh bear on the Bjiorn potty. Either way, it's getting its use!
5	1018569600	I am a mother of three and my son being the last....24 months...potty trained himself. I am convinced it had a lot to do with the potty chair. It is the best!!! It is sturdy, leak-proof, love the splash guard on front for him, and perfect size for him. I got the cute little ones for the daughters and overall, this is much better due to the quality. Get this potty and I am sure you will love it too!!!
2	1012608000	My son is 23 months old, and I bought this product and the Baby Bjorn potty seat that goes on the big toilet, thinking I would try them both and see which he liked best. He is scared of the potty chair now because the splash guard in the front "surprises" him when he sits down sometimes, and he gets hurt. He refusus to sit on it now, and only wants to use the potty seat on the big toilet - fine with me because it is easier to clean. The potty chair is narrow, and although my son is on the very skinny side, he sees kind of wedged in there when he sits on it. It doesn't seem that comfortable for his little tushie. I bought the white model, and did not realize that the plastic potty bowl on it is black. This makes it hard to tell when it is really clean. I would give this chair some points for being compact, not taking up much space in the bathroom, and being attractive looking and sturdy. However, it just doesn't seem comfortable for my boy. In my opinion, it does not live up to the quality I expect from baby bjorn products. I do, however, love the Baby Bjorn potty seat that goes on the big toilet, as it is VERY comfortable and seems well-designed for a boy to use. Such a contrast between these two products! Maybe the potty chair would work better for a girl who does not have those "delicate parts" to get hurt by the splash guard.
