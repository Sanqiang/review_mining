4	1405987200	It's ok
5	1405814400	Love this color
5	1405641600	Excellent value, works perfectly!
5	1405382400	My husband is very happy with this Case.
5	1405296000	ok
5	1405296000	I have had this for approx 6 months. Overall like it for the price. I have ripped the case near the vibe switch. Still able to use it. Definitely worth the money.
5	1405209600	Great product, fast delivery. I was 100% satisfied with the entire process of purchasing and receiving my otterbox.
5	1405209600	has saved me from getting a new phone many times.
5	1405209600	A little tricky to open bu I love it! It's secure and seems very protective. Love the color combo as well. The screen protector can be very annoying because it affects the your calibration when you touch the screen since it's another layer between your finger and the screen and it doesn't lay completely flat directly on the screen. However, this is to be expected with any case that comes with its own screen protector. Overall, this is a great phone case and I highly recommend it.
5	1405123200	This is my second defender, as my 80 pound Lab ate my first one. However, my iPhone did survive. I am always the one who breaks my I phone right before the new one comes out. Not with this case, still have my origional 5 and for the first time, my contract will run out. I will stay with my carrier but love that it's been almost 2 years and I have the same phone. I have broken at least 5 if not 6 iPhones, just saying.
5	1405036800	Nice case. I've dropped my phone 5-10 times and never received a mark or broken screen on my iPhone 5.
5	1404950400	This case is very sturdy and protects my iPhone 5 well.  I'd recommend it.
3	1404950400	Too bulky, very protective, just hated that it made my iPhone 5 feel like a brick. I kept it on for about 3 months before switching to a Body Glove case.
5	1404950400	The defender case is a little large for my liking but I purchased this as a gift for my mother in law and she loved it!
5	1404864000	&#128522;
5	1404691200	This box is incredible !
5	1404518400	Great product..... No complaints
5	1404345600	Works great, love it. I have 5s and although you can't use Touch ID no big deal. Survived a drop down the stairs and water splashes. Feels great in the hand.
5	1404345600	I purchased this case instead of the Ballistic equivalent because it works for me very well.  I carry two phones, one in a holster and the other in my pocket.  With some rubber cases, it is a pain to get in and out of my trouser pockets.  I love the Ballistic Iphone 4 and it worked when I was on job and I dropped the phone 20 ft. with NO DAMAGE.  Hard choice, but this one seems to work better for me.
5	1404259200	Solid. Compact. Attractive. And way less bulky than many of the comments had led me to believe.I am kind of embarrassed that I love this iPhone case so much. I really shouldn't. But I do. From the soft gray-and-white palette to the solid, compact construction, it's pretty much all a case can be. I have large, long-fingered hands, but this chunky, rubberized case is perfect for keeping a grip on the slender iPhone 5 even as I text, interact with apps, and peck out emails with my thumb.It's also a genuine OtterBox, and not one of the many knockoffs that have plagued other reviewers of similar products. So for $17, you're getting an awesome case with awesome protection at an awesome price.
5	1404259200	Good product. Prompt delivery
5	1404172800	This is my fifth otterbox defender series case for an electronic device of some kind, and I will continue to come back as I purchase new items that need protection. These products really do protect the iphone, and mine falls a lot. I have a toddler who seems to think this phone is a throw toy of some kind, and when I've been certain that my phone would be shattered...it has survived again and again. Can't beat this price either!
5	1404172800	Sometimes you'll order what you think is a genuine OtterBox at a great price only to receive a knock-off that doesn't protect your iPhone as it should. This item is a Genuine OtterBox, has fit my iPhone 5 exactly as it should, and I've had no problems with the case or it's belt-clip.
5	1404086400	If I have an Iphone 5s and I dont want to use the finger print. Could I order this iphone case and be able to use it? Would it fit perfect?
5	1404086400	My son is actually using this for his iPod touch and he loves it.
4	1403913600	The Otter Box has very good looks as well as providing excellent protection for your phone.Kinda hard to use the 1st time, but, once you learn to get your phone inside, it is fine.I would recommend this to others.
5	1403827200	I have loved Otterbox cases ever since I first bought one a few phones ago. My case really takes a beating and protects my phone perfectly. Love it!
5	1403827200	great case locks everything in nice and tight impossible to open once click in but very good case. And in cool colors.
1	1403740800	i ok not to happy wit ii
5	1403740800	nice. sturdy. looks just like the pic.
4	1403740800	case does a good job. My only complaint is it does interfere with the very outer edges of the screen.
5	1403568000	This item does what it says it does.  Our family loves the Otterbox series, and a new phone is just another reason to get another one.
5	1403308800	Ordered this as a replacement when we upgraded to a 5. Fits perfectly nad has already proven it will take falls and scrapes.
5	1403136000	Until now, this is the best case for me. I love the rubber and the touch. It is very good for people that have big hands.I recommend it!
5	1402617600	This was a gift to my husband. He loved it and it's easy to clean. It's last him for a long time. It protects his phone
5	1402617600	I need a case that would be indistructable bc I constently drop my phone at work. I had a case with a built in battery. The battery charger lasted about a week and the case lasted another 6 months. That was my 3rd battery case and now I'm back to the cases themselves. so far so good. Looks nice and has been dropped 4 times w/o issue
5	1402617600	came in fast and in great condition. i recommend this to anyone trying to get an otterbox. it also fits perfect.
3	1402444800	OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 ( Not for iPhone 5C ) Retail..., is ok but I ordered a black one and got a gray one.  This is ok so now I have a white iPhone and a gray outside.
5	1402444800	Only wish I didn't have to get a new iphone 5c which required a new case, which is awful by the way. You can read my review for that one on the iphone 5c Defender Case reviews
2	1401926400	THIS CASE GOT SHALL WE SAY BAGGY BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OUT............NOT SURE IT GIVES THE SAME PROTECTION THAT IS DID AND SHOULD:(
5	1401753600	Phones are fragile. Otterbox keeps them safe. My husband had one on an iPhone 4. He dropped a drill from his ladder and it landed on his phone. There was just a nick and dent in the case and the phone wasn't damaged at all. Otterbox replaced the case with no charge. Amazing. So when my husband upgraded his phone he got a new Otterbox case. So far, phone safe.
5	1401753600	i used for long time, works great and protect my phone really good, and look good to. thank you. excellent
5	1401408000	Really durable and did not get messed up easily!! I like my Otter, really protects your phone when you drop it
5	1401321600	really good. I loved it!It was really nice!Thank you so much to sell good product!I love it!
4	1401321600	I don't know how I lived without it. You can be so reckless with your phone when you have this on! Like many others mention it is super bulky though.
5	1401235200	This case fits the new Iphone 5s with no problems. The only draw back is the thumb reader not being easy to use without having to peel back the button protector. I would recommend this case for those who want the added protection.
5	1401235200	product is what expected and did everything that I wanted to do and no problems with shipping and just great with product
4	1400889600	I drop my phone all the time. Especially on the weekends. This case lasted me two years (I had destroyed it completely) but the phone is still intact. Will get another OtterBox case for my next phone.
5	1400630400	Great product at an incredible price! I have had success with Otterbox products in the past and am very satisfied with this phone case.
5	1400371200	Works great keeps phone looking new and my nerves down ...I don't worry about dropping my iPhone with this case
4	1400112000	This case is probably one of the best iPhone 5 cases on the market. I have dropped my phone a few times and this case has not failed me. The belt clip that comes along with the case is fantastic and attaches and detaches with ease. Although this is a great case, there is only one downfall I have found over the past couple months. I have recently picked up a pair of Beats headphones and the jack for the headphones barely fits into the phone with the case on. Otherwise, this is one of the best protection cases on the market.
5	1399593600	Rain or shine, it protects like no other.I have dropped my iPhone numerous times onto concrete, carpet, tile and granite.  The OtterBox Defender is the best protection money can buy for your iPhone.
5	1399507200	The OtterBox Defender was ordered to replace one just like it that I had for some years.  It had done its job and I wanted the same one because of that.
4	1399507200	well it fits to a tee no and the a change to the otter box when in sports it supports ok
5	1399334400	As always, otterbox is the go to case for great protection. I now own a Note 2 and got the otterbox for it. Both have taken many drops/hits/chemicals from working in the oil field amd both perform flawlessly.
4	1399334400	My phone looks like now after using this case for about a year. The case is in perfect conditions either even after receiving several shocks and my little sons manipulating it.
5	1399248000	I have dropped this a couple dozen times on all surfaces - tile, cement, pavement, and not a crack or scratch!
5	1399248000	great rugged casei dont know why anyone would need such a heavy dudy case, but it works great !!!
5	1399075200	Great product .  It arrived earlier than expected .  Love that.  I like the color gray and white .  It also came with a carrying case and clip
2	1398902400	Protected my device well, but is WAY to bulky for my taste, as it takes away all the aesthetics of the phone.  Also, the outer rubber stretched out quite a bit and it then became an impediment to using the phone as well as further &#34;uglifying&#34; my pretty little iPhone5.  Just not for me, but I don't throw my phone at the wall so I guess it was WAY overkill.
4	1398816000	Product arrived soon and is very good quality. Product fits the phone great and I look forward to purchasing more.
1	1398729600	Had this less than six months and the rubber case started warping out of shape and falling off hard shell. Spoke to Manufacturer about this and they said I was not the only one experiencing this problem but is not covered under warranty and could not return it.Had to purchase a new one different material and have not had any problems. Very disappointed in customer satisfaction on this product and I still have the old one just in case someone starts a lawsuit over it.
5	1398470400	My boyfriend was about to purcahse this at Verizon for $54. I stopped him right before he could and I'm glad I did. Saved him extra spending money to take me out :-)
3	1398297600	It protects well against accidental drops.  The design is much better than the Otterbox 5s since the home button is covered, thereby preventing dirt and condensation from entering underneath the built in screen protector.  The trade off is that you can no longer use the fingerprint sensor for the Iphone 5s.  The built in screen protector also does not sit flush against the Iphone screen, making the touch screen less sensitive.  The same thing happened with the Otterbox 5s.  The holster for the Otterbox 5 series has less plastic and is not as rugged as the previous 4s model.
3	1398297600	Very tough, amazing protection for industrial workers, factories and outdoor lifestyle, but visual perception is nothing! Not stylish, without elegance and any sort of delicasy! Good product, but not for me.
5	1398297600	It's an Otterbox, that says everything you need to know. Fits my iPhone 5 like a glove, I took my iPhone 5 out of the retail packaging and straight into the Otterbox Defender. That was over a year ago, the case has served its purpose dutifully. I've dropped my phone down a flight of stairs, on pavement, sidewalks and hardwood floors, even in a puddle of water (even though the Otterbox doesn't claim water protection, it offers a small degree of protection in that regard). The phone still looks the way it did when I unboxed it the first time. I take my phone out of the case every month or so to remove built-up sand and dirt to prevent the phone from being scratched up due to particles between it and the case. Buying an Otterbox is a no-brainer.
5	1398038400	I ordered this phone case the day after I got my new iPhone. Not very well planned. When I ordered the product it was estimated at about a week for delivery which had me nervous for my new phone.The case arrived in just a couple days which I was so happy about. The packaging was all original and shipped very well. It fit my phone great!
1	1397865600	Is not compatible with the iphone 5s.  Is not recognized as a compatible accessory and does not charge my iphone.  Avoid!  Do not waste your money.
5	1397779200	Great rugged case.  A must have for any one where your work could be a damaging factor to your iphone.  Gives excellent protection.  Why buy anything else.
5	1397692800	I love my otter box. I work with children so it's got to be just as tough as them. My phone is so protected.
3	1397520000	Does not work with fingerprint ID on the new iphone 5s. Hard to get the case apart initially. Havnt dropped it yet.
5	1397347200	I used the header to state the obvious for those folks who have any experience covers and who may have heard about or owned a  OtterBox product themselves. This is the basic model in that it is not waterproof. It is the total protector for your phone when it comes to dropping bumping or even splashing a liquid on the phone. I work a job in a dirty area where I get my hands dirty so after work I take a rag with a little alcohol on it and I whip it down. Wouldn't do that if the phone was not protected from the alcohol. Again water can get past the area by the ear piece, speakers and camera but you would have to be very unlucky for that to happen.
5	1397260800	We are only buying otter box cases now as the others just never seem to come close to the protection you get with otter box. My husband goes through them kind of quick but that is because he scratches the screen up with his keys in the same pocket as the phone.
3	1397260800	I have had this case since I bought the iPhone 5 shortly after they were released. My sister had the same case and the rubber on the outside tore very easily and the plastic casing broke, but she got a lot of use out of it. This case is good for protecting the phone from damage, I don't think your phone would be damaged if you dropped it in one of these things. It's not marketed as waterproof, and your phone would probably get destroyed if you submerged it or exposed it to heavy rain, but it does protect against the occasional splash or if you leave it in your pocket during a heavy rain storm. It is not practical if you wear jeans because it makes the phone very bulky and the rubber creates so much friction and static tension with your pants that it's hard to get it in and out of your pocket and you can make your fingers sore doing this. I still use it because I wear sweatpants, gym shorts, or khaki shorts most of the time so it's not a problem for me. Also, if you wear it in suit or dress pants, it causes the fabric to bulge and collect dirt around the edges, so you get a nasty dirt ring in the shape of your iphone on your pocket, especially if you wear black pants.
5	1397260800	Very satisfied. A quality product and agreat price. It fits the iPhone like a glove and the charge port is easily accessible for the lightening change cable.
1	1397260800	I bought this for my 5s and it would fit, but it totally covers the button for fingerprint access to the phone which means you will have to enter an access code very time you want to use your phone instead of the more convenient option of using the fingerprint sensor.  There is an otttorbox designed specifically for the 5s that does not cover that button, but this is not it.
5	1397001600	Have both spilled coffee on my phone and dripped it with this case on, both with no harm caused to the phone!
5	1396828800	Very protective and sturdy.  Did not realize there was a clear plastic built in face and that just makes it even better.  I wish there were some &#34;cuter&#34; ones but I will stay with this just because of how protective it is.
5	1396828800	Great case that protects your iPhone from about anything. Does NOT protect against liquids or moisture at all but is perfect for drops and dings that may happen.
5	1396828800	After researching other options online, I bought several of these for our iPhones and every user agrees they are excellent.  The inside of the front screen requires cleaning periodically so the cover must be disassembled, but it is easy and only takes a few minutes. Great product that really protects the phone.
3	1396569600	Looks amazing coming from the box but fitting wise, it was a little small. Nothing too bad as the phone still did fit but not as comfortable as my other otter box cases. Rubber outer material also felt a little like plastic and smooth instead of rubbery that gives a lot of grip.
5	1396483200	I am a dedicated Otterbox user and ordered this for my new Iphone 5s and love it.  The only thing I didn't noticed before I ordered was that this doesn't have the home button uncovered so you can use the finger scan option.  A little annoying, but does the trick for now!
1	1396483200	Did not protect my phone like the one I had purchased from  cell  phone provider. Took it as loss and donated it.
5	1396137600	Thank you works great no problems nice tight fit it was brand new and the box was in new condition
5	1395964800	Very pleased with the case 3 months in.  Dropped it a number of times and no cracks.  Fingerprint unlock won't work because of the cases design, but worth giving up to keep your baby in one piece.
2	1395619200	I love it.. I feel like my iPhone will be brand new forever ;) unless water damage Lol but they have water proof outterbox too
5	1395446400	Perfect, sleek, I love the color, grey and white, all my family have one, getting ready to order another one, a color one this time
4	1395446400	I really liked how thin and light-weight my iPhone5 was when I bought it, and didn't relish using such a relatively bulky case.  But I'm glad I did.  On my first day with the new phone, I dropped it in a parking lot.  The Defender Series case lived up to its name.  I'm sure it saved my phone from serious damage.  I've never removed the case, and I've had the phone now for eight months.  Its size doesn't bother me at all.
5	1395446400	I had s similar Defender on my 4S and got good service out of it.  This fits even better than the 4S case did.
2	1395273600	It definitely does what it claims. It protects the iphone. It is absolutely enormous though.  I cannot fit it in any of my pockets. It takes away from the wonderful aesthetics of the phone, sure, but it also takes away from the slim, lightweight convenience.  Because it is rubberized it is extra hard to fit in a pocket.  Bugs me.
2	1395100800	Rubber degrades very easily so after a couple weeks of work it'll start looking shabby, I am pretty disappointed with otter box, they came pretty far, but have really lowered their standards lately
5	1394755200	The first thing I bought after I purchased my iPhone 5 was the OtterBox Defender case.  And this case has valiantly defended my phone on more than one occasion.If you have normal coordination and luck, you will probably drop your phone at least once.  Sometimes it will land on a pillow, or  container of fluffy cotton.  More often, it will fall on asphalt, and usually screen-side down.  I have dropped my phone from shirt-pocket height in parking lots a couple of times (accidentally), and the phone remains unscratched.  This would not have been the case without the case.The OtterBox has cushioning in just the right places to prevent major damage in the typical phone user scenarios.  Can you still break your phone?  Absolutely.  You'll just have to get more creative.  The downside to the OtterBox Defender is that it adds considerable bulk (but not weight) and essentially ruins the beautiful styling of the iPhone 5.  You have to decide if this tradeoff is worth it.
3	1394755200	I bought this case for both my wife and I, thinking we needed the best protection we could get. As it turns out, this case (and others with similar features) are definitely appropriate in some cases, but this case has too many drawbacks for me to recommend.+sprotects phone really wellwell built-sCase is just too bulky - doubles thickness and is very unwieldyheadphone jack is hard to accessScreen protector that is provided does not sit very flush with screen, and impinges on edges of touchscreencamera glare - photos seem to look different taken with and without caseAt the end of the day, i moved to a slimmer case + stick on screen protector and have had no issues...I'm sure this is ok for some, but I found the form factor too limiting, and my wife (who carries a purse) hated it.
2	1394668800	It is not fit for 5s, can't access the fingerprint scanner. Otterbox had updated with one that does work, however.
5	1394668800	I was a little worried about this case because when I bought it was a lot cheaper than it was in the official website and I had heard there were situations where there were fake ottorbox cases. However, when I received it I verified it was original. Great case at an awesome price.
4	1394496000	I thought the case for the 5 would have the option of using the finger print scanner, and it doesn't.  The case is great quality. I loved my otterbox for my 4S.  I will probably try to find another case that has the finger scanner option, I just love not having to use my pass code every time.
4	1394409600	Works as advertised, have used this product for over a year and my phone has survived many drops and crashes.  Highly recommend especially for the price I paid.  Only complaint is that the case is bulky and the heavy plastic looks like a low end trim option to a Dodge truck.
5	1394236800	The case shown was exactly what got delivered. Good case with a tougher rubber outer core than what the otter boxes used to have.
5	1394236800	This is a very good case to buy.. I love mines and going to order another color ....Buy you one.
5	1394150400	this protective case really works well.  It was more affordable than  Best Buy.  I wish I had purchased the water proof protective case.
4	1394064000	I used it to train for a marathon.  It was almost to bulky.  But it sure protects the phone.  Ive dropped it from 30 feet high and it survived. I've splashed it and it kept the phone dry.  But after running with it for 6 months the rubber started to stretch from around the case and let particles and water into it.  So it lasted 8 months.
5	1393891200	Awesome !!!!!This was described as gently used~ mine was brand new!!! Perfect condition love the color great price. I ordered one for my hubs too :)Will order again for sureThank you
5	1393804800	The otterbox looked brand new and has worked great with my phone. Also it was shipped the next day and arrivived two business days later.
4	1393718400	I returned the iPhone case.  It was just not what I expected.  The iPhone case just looked different on line.
5	1393286400	Great case... I have dropped my phone and not scratch the case gives the phone a little more heft which some people may like ;)
5	1393027200	It was the only one I could find that was sort of manly. My husband loves it. It makes it look new and protects it well.
5	1392854400	Otterbox is the best protection for your device. It's really not that big for the device you're trying to protect. It's a great case.
5	1392854400	I ordered this for my son's new Iphone 5, he wanted something protective and a lighter color than his last black case. This one is white and grey and looks clean and expensive, but it was a great price. He loves it.
5	1392854400	Have had for over a year now and has protected my iphone from drops. Is a little big but is good.
5	1392768000	Perfect cover, otterbox speaks for its self.  It takes a licken when I throw it in the golf cart and it keeps on ticken.
4	1392681600	Overall looks pretty nice and effective. Couldnt use as I didnt think about fitment when ordering. I have the 5c and order a case for the 5.
4	1392681600	I've dropped this a few times with the case on and it protected my phone. The silicone shell can become loose if you carry it in your pocket but their support is great. They sent me a replacement at no cost.
5	1392076800	This item has saved my iPhone many times.  I have dropped it quite a bit, and, I know this case has saved it.
5	1392076800	Great protection for the iPhone. Good way to keep it like new. OtterBox is the case to go with. I would recommend it to everyone.
1	1391644800	I've seen several of my friends using the Otterbox to protect their iPhone so I decided to purchase one. It did it's job! I purchased the gray Defender. I've dropped it so many times that I lost track. My iPhone was still in one piece. Yes, it's bulky, but it protects my phone. I wish it lasted a little longer. Not less than a year, the rubber corners that protect the phone split. It's much affordable than having to purchase at an actual store. Durability, I'd give it a 1 out of 5.
2	1391558400	I have loved my Otterbox for my old Android phone, but when I upgraded to the iPhone 5c, the OtterBox that I ordered for it said that it was for the iPhone 5 and 5s. It however does not fit the 5c!!!Watch the description! It would be nice to have know that it would not fit before I spend the time and money on ordering it! It does not even appear that OtterBox has a case that will fit the 5c!! Time to get on the ball!
5	1391558400	I've had this case for over a year now, not a scratch. It's protected my phone exceptionally and is still useable. Never have needed to get a new one.
5	1391385600	Its a great case however dirt still gets in my screen and there are little spots which are annoying but better than no case at all
3	1391299200	Well it does cover your cellphone from getting dropped and it gets its job done however, the rubber makes it a pain to put in your pocket. If you have the extra cash buy another case as the rubber on this will expand and then wobble. Expand the extra cash and truly take care of your cellphone without compromising portability.
4	1391126400	Not a bad product. Takes a little while to get the case on and off but once you get the hang of it then its pretty easy. The only thing i didnt like was that i was not water proof. Since buying i found a deal on a lifeproof case and have switched to it instead.
3	1390867200	Protects the phone very well, this is the only matching color for white iPhone5.Wish they could have pure white color case.
5	1390780800	has been protecting my phone for over a year now. the case is a little beat up from abuse but my phone is flawless. would recommend
4	1390694400	I've been using it for a couple months now. It's bulky, but very sturdy. I'm a complete clutz, so this is a great product for those prone to dropping things. My only con is that it is difficult to put on and remove.
2	1390608000	The gray rubber does not fit snug around the white casing. It's not normal wear because I have other otterboxes that didn't stretch away from the casing.
4	1390435200	Typical OtterBox product. It's a little less bulky than the normal cases but it's great if you constantly drop your phone.
5	1390176000	Best case I ever had. Outter box best in the business and the price was a little cheaper than in the store. Would choose again but different color as the gray seems to dirty fast
3	1390003200	Its good and all but the built in screen protector had this rainbow affect when i put it on and also its really bulky i do recomended to people who work heavy duty but if you one of those person who keeps it in your pocket then i dont recomended it
2	1390003200	It was returned becauseIt covers the finger print log in button otherwise it was as claimed on the website. no defects
5	1390003200	Before I had a baby, I was a clutz.  Dropped the phone in this case once and it saved the phone.  Now my phone is a baby projectile and teether.  This case is the only thing to use.  Rock solid, fits like a glove, and baby proof.
4	1389916800	Good case. Durable design.  Would recommend to anyone who is clumsy with their phone or just want the extra protection.
5	1389830400	It is always a pleasure to buy a product that does what it says it will do. How often is that the case?This product really does protect your expensive iPhone from damage. Thank you OtterBox.
5	1389744000	I don't normally write reviews...But my phone got ran over by a car...with this case on. The white case inside was broken but the phone still functioned normally with a cracked screen. For getting run over by a car and still works? This case is totally worth it. I'm buying a new one.
5	1389657600	This case is one of the best cases I have ever had, had the commuter before it and I didn't like it due to lack of protection
2	1389571200	I purchased this case and put it on immediately when I bought my iphone 5 a year ago.  I just purchased a new life proof case this weekend and decided I should rate this case and let people know my experience before they make decisions on a case.  This case (in white) was disgusting when I removed it from my phone.  It had dirt and goo in every crevice as well as UNDER the screen protector.  The back of the inside of the case was adhered to my phone and left a sticky substance that I had to scrub off the phone.  There were also other areas on my phone that had weird substances adhered to it.  I was very unhappy to see that the area on the bottom of the case that opens and closes to allow charging of the phone had done damage to the metal around the charging area.  It actually had scraped off the metal edges of the phone in that area.  It was a bulky case compared to the life proof that I just purchased.  Not something I would suggest to a friend who is shopping for protection for their expensive smart phone.  I would suggest looking at a life proof case...at least you won't have crap under your protector.  :(
5	1389571200	A perfect Otterbox case.  Fits well and is what we expect when buying an Otterbox case. Very pleased with this model
5	1389398400	My son has already dropped his new Iphone a couple of times.  This case saved the phone's screen from breaking.
5	1389225600	I had one for the 4 and now the 5. This one has been more solid than the one I had for the 4. Everything snug and everything works. I've dropped my phone plenty of times with it, (main reason I got it is that I am clumsy with my phones) and no damage at all to the phone or the case. It's been great and still shows no signs of wear and tear after 6 months of abuse.
4	1389052800	Have for 2 months now. Great case so far. Dropped twice on concrete pavement, and no damage to phone or case. But inner plastic case is too hard to remove. Others tell me it is too bulky, but I don't care.
5	1388448000	This was a necessity for me and it has worked perfectly.  I have used it for almost 1 year and still in great condition.  Has definitely protected my iPhone 5 and was worth it.
3	1388102400	I do not care that this is bulky, I just have a problem that the iphone slips around when in the case (the case is too big for the phone).
4	1388016000	It's bulky without a doubt, but I certainly can't blame the case for that. It's advertised to be bulky and protective. This is my first otterbox case, and it certainly met my expectations. VERY protective with all the ports and buttons still accessible. I had a screen protector on my phone prior to the case, so with the built-in screen protector of the case added on, I lost some noticeable screen sensitivity. I would suggest having no screen protector on the phone prior to installation of the case to help avoid the loss of sensitivity that I experienced. Since the case covered the entire phone except for the screen, it was hard to swipe for the iOS 7 menu at times. It's a little thing, but can get annoying at times. In the white color, my black pants sort of discolored the gray silicon on the outside. Once again, that was to be expected with the lighter color.All in all, minor gripes but the case definitely delivers and performs completely as advertised. Good Job Otterbox!
1	1388016000	For the price, this case is NOT worth it.  Incredibly bulky, the clip broke within two weeks, and the rubber condom covering melted or stretched or something, but now flops around on the corner by the camera.  the case, although looks brand new, I have taken off and have tried to give away to people but nobody is interested in these huge cases anymore.  Used it for skiing to listen to music and it was as if I had a brick in my jacket pocket.
1	1388016000	The producet developer who desgined this producet needs to redesign this product completely. I feel the material used for the producet isn't holding up to the consumer's standards. Iv'e going through 3 cases in the past 5 months now and I've even contacted otter box about the issue of the home button wearing away after pressing it. I dont recommend this phone cause to anyone.
1	1387929600	I bought two of OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging for my two iPhone 5, one is Purple and one is White/Gray. They do protect the phone very well and the Purple one is still in perfect condition after used for one year, but the rubber outer layer (wraps around the inner-shell) of White/Gray one has become very loose after used only a few months. I found the Replacement Silicone Skin For iphone 5 Otterbox Defender case by SportyGigabite, and could continue to use the case to protect the phone.
5	1387843200	Just perfect! ITS TOTALLY NOT A FAKE! fits the 5s just fine. But the thumbprint thing doesnt work, havent found a case that it does work yet.
5	1387756800	Wanted a case from Otterbox that had a white case, this fit the bill. Looks great and very functional, would and will purchase more.
5	1387756800	This is a good case cover for the iphone, very durable and reliable to have, plus the warranty is easy to apply for if the case were to be damage.
5	1387756800	Absolutely love this case!!! Very happy with the color and the protection provided! I have had several compliments on my case.
5	1387411200	This is my 5th OtterBox, I bought 2 over the course of having my iPhone 3GS, I bought an OtterBox for my old iPod Touch 2nd Gen, and this is my second OtterBox for my iPhone 5. I purchased this, honestly because I wanted a change of color and a new silicone cover. This is by far the best case on the market, bar none! I have tried other cases, because I wanted to try something with less bulk, but none of those protected my device the way that the OtterBox Defender Series case does. I have accidentally dropped my phone several times without one scratch, mark, dent, or mechanical problems. This case is like buying samurai armor for your iPhone! Trust me&#8230; put it in your cart already!
5	1387411200	Bought it for my son new iPhone 5.  He dropped his iPhone twice from 3 ft and the Otterbox protected it, granted that the iPhone fell flat!  Of course, I don't think that this will protect the iPhone if it hits its display on some object.  I don't think that anything case will, unless one that totally covers every square cm of the iPhone!
5	1387411200	I always thought they were way over priced, but when the where on sale for 68% of i had to try it. I got it and it looks good and it is very rugged which is want i wanted. I love this may have to stay with OtterBox for a while
5	1387238400	Bought this as a gift for my husband when he upgraded to an iphone 5. With a toddler an otter box is a must. This case is sleek and holds up well. Very pleased.
3	1387152000	It's ok, ive owned several otterbox cases. This one just never seemed to fit right. The only reason I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars was because of the otterbox customer support.
5	1387152000	Fantastic case for less than half the price compared to Walmart or Fry's. I'm constantly worried about scratching my phone. Otter box Defender offers exactly what I'm looking for, peace of mind. I have one on all my iOS devices, and I don't waste a second worrying about being gentle. Whether it's tossing it into a pocket, briefcase, backpack or onto the counter, I don't give it a second thought.
1	1387152000	My phone while inside my outterbox this is rediclous I wouldn't expect this to happen in a outterbox I would like
5	1387065600	OtterBox is well known to produce excellent products. I give this product a high rating because not only does it provide a solid case that that is well engineered, but it is well priced, and provides an added level of screen protection that is appreciated.My iPhone 5 was dropped out of my pocket while mountain biking, then run over a few times before i noticed... Needless to say, my phone screen was cracked  and spider webbed on the bottom half. It even had a sizable glass chunk missing... This case helps by providing a built in layer of screen protection that now basically serves as the touch screen to my device. It allows me utilize the functions of my phone once again, almost as if there were no cracks at all!
1	1386979200	We purchased two of these for our iPhone5s.  Both fit snugly and worked well with or without the holster/clip.  Both devices have been dropped numerous times in a variety of environments (including concrete) and not sustained any apparent device issues (minor scuff marks on cases).Having said all that:- one of the holster clips failed -> the molded button sheared off at the pivot point leaving the holster/clip unusable.  This occurred when the holster clip hung on a seatbelt while I was exiting my vehicle.  I recognized something was hung and stopped moving before any excessive force was involved, but the clip just cleaved at the mount point and fell apart.- the accompanying outer softskin cover has slowly relaxed to the point where most of the edges now just hang off the inner hard case (like the rubber material or molding process was defective...it's not retaining its shape).I can only surmise the two cases came from different manufacturer's batches.  That 50% failure rate makes me very hesitant to buy another to replace the one that failed...
5	1386806400	Extreme protection no joke. I smashed this phone on the wall three times and not one scratch, no malfunction and the case is intact. It'll make your phone look like one of those prehistoric Nokia phones but it'll definitely protect your phone.
5	1386720000	Came in a timely manner. Love the case!Appears just as shown in picture. Easy to apply and makes my phone look great!
5	1386633600	I bought this a long time ago - last March (2013).  I liked it when I bought it.  I still have it and I love it more all the time.  The white doesn't get dirty and gross, and if it does I can clean it.  Case has held up to cat bites, drops, and the like.
5	1386547200	Last December I made by far the greatest purchase on Amazon I have ever made. I invested in the Otterbox Defender case for my new phone, the I Phone 5. As an active young adult I understood I needed a case that was going to be able to keep up with that lifestyle. Countless drops, falls, and spills my Otterbox has been able to keep my IPhone in pristine running condition. Not only that but unlike many of my friends who purchased rival companies&#8217; cases, my phone has been able to stay crack free. I believe fellow consumers should purchase the Otterbox defender case because of its protection, reliability, and ability to keep dirt and other debris from getting inside and damaging my phone.The protection on my IPhone has been second to none as far as ability to keep my phone safe at all times. As I walked through my house a couple months ago, I neared the staircase and suddenly my phone was in a tumble for the bottom and I thought all hope was lost. Hearts pounding and beginning to sweat I race down the stairs only to find my phone in perfect working condition, scratch free, and most of all crack free. When my mother came running in to see what had happened, she realized how durable the Defender case is and her and my sister eventually invested into their Otterbox case. Over the last year I&#8217;ve seen these cases take all the elements including minor water and still be the phone many Americans need them to be in this day and era.The Otterbox is also a very reliable case. Often in the past I would find my phone cases to last no longer than a couple of months at most due to such heavy wear from being used so often. But with the Otterbox I&#8217;ve been able to use the case day in and day out for a year, and only have minor wear and color change. The ability for the defender case to be able to cover the holes such as the charger port and the headphone jack has saved me numerous times in the past year. On a hike over the summer I found myself going through muddy terrain and upon jumping over a small rock my phone had fallen into a minor mud pit. Instantly, I reached in and grabbed my phone and came up with what appeared to be a mud brick. I popped the case off and discovered that a very minimal amount of mud had slid through the camera hole. I walked to a nearby creek and washed off the case and to my amazement my case looked brand new and I continued on my way.Furthermore, if you are looking for a case that will be able to protect your phone I highly recommend the Otterbox defender. From my personal experience, I can tell you that it will take the grunt every time you drop it and also prevent you from having to pay the costly repair fees for a cracked screen.
5	1386547200	OK, you may think I am joking, but we bought the iPhone 5 and put it directly into this defender series case and 3 weeks later, loading up a trailer, my husband sat the phone down on the bumper of our truck to fix the load, got distracted and drove off. About 2 hours later, we got a phone call from his phone, my 16yr old new driver nephew was driving through town and saw it on the road, it had been ran over a couple times, screen faced down on the asphalt, about 1 mile from where we left with our load. Mind you the hot Arizona sun had been beating down on it and the asphalt it was laying on. So it took them a bit to be able to call because it was overheated, like apple gets, but works fine!! The only thing was when it got ran over the plastic got chewed up a little bit by the asphalt, but THAT WAS IT!!! Thanks to the otter box, our $200+ investment for a phone was not ruined, my husband did end up putting a new defender case on it because the chew marks and the black from the pavement wouldn't come off the white, but for the price we can afford to replace the case!!!  So thankful in many ways!!
5	1386460800	I've been a fan of Otterbox cases since I first got an iPhone when the iPhone 4 came out. I had a Commuter case on my iPhone 5 when I first bought it, but I roughed the case up too much (a fault of mine, not the case) and needed a new one. I decided to get the Defender as it offered a little more protection, and boy has it lived up to my expectations. I've dropped my phone on the kitchen tile, garage floor, pavement in the parking lot at work, etc. The case has taken slight damage, but my phone is about as perfect as the day I bought it.I'll break down the pros and cons I have found with this case:Cons1) The case is large and bulky, and it can be hard to take your phone out of your pocket sometimes since the outermost shell of the case is a rubber material.2) The shimmering rainbow effect from the built in screen cover. (Looks like the rainbow effect when oil or gas gets into a puddle of water.)3) The covers over the headphone and charging ports can be difficult to open at times. I damaged a nail trying to open the headphone cover when I first bought the case.4) I have to regularly clean the screen protector with alcohol wipes because it's not an anti-fingerprint screen cover. It gathers a lot of prints, oils from hands, and dust in the corners.Pros1) The rubber/silicon material offers a nice grip when you hold your phone. I don't feel like my phone will fall out of my hand when I hold it.2) It looks sleek despite its size.3) All of the buttons work with this case.4) Despite how many times I've dropped it, my phone hasn't taken any damage that I can tell.5) The case gives the iPhone 5 a little more heft. When I hold a naked iPhone 5, it feels extremely fragile and light. I really like the weight that this case adds to my phone.6) The sound from my phone when it's naked sounds about the same as when this case is on.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this case. It has a few cons, but I find them to be tolerable considering the pros outweigh the cons for my needs.
5	1386374400	I drop my phone every day, and my iphone has never broken--so, I love this case! The cases for the iPhone4 would get stretched out, but this one doesn't.
5	1386288000	Awesome case! I've always had otterbox cases, but this is by far my favorite. Just last week, my toddler was literally standing on this case and protected the phone.
5	1386115200	Although a little bulky it protects my device .... I'm happy with it, I dropped phone once and was so pleased that there was no damage
4	1386115200	This is a great durable case for my hard on tech products husband. He is always outdoors, climbing mountains, 4 wheeling, you name it. One year later his phone works perfect and still looks awesome. The only ding I have is for such a bulky costly case it would really be nice if it was more water proof.We did have the clip break on the belt attachment at around 11 months, BUT, I contacted Otterbox and they immediately sent us a replacement under their one year warranty.
2	1386028800	Was way too chunky for what I needed. I'm sure it would have been a great protection for my phone, but I just didn't need THAT MUCH protection. Couldn't fit it in ANY pocket I found; pants, purse, or backpack. It just wasn't right for what I needed.
5	1386028800	I've had mine for 2 years and it's still in perfect condition. Just finally went around to getting a stylish new one.
5	1385856000	Lives up to the OtterBox rep. Really fits and protects the iPhone 5. The phone survives much abuse in this case.
3	1385683200	The material is more like rubber rather than hard plastic like the other defender cases. Within one year the holster broke. It did the job in the mean time but I would rather have the the hard plastic outer case.
5	1385596800	It is sturdy and very secure.  It's a little bulky but I know I can trust it to hold up when I drop it.
5	1385596800	It's an Otterbox! Very well made and fits like a glove. I have dropped my phone on the concrete getting out of a truck, and you can not tell it ever happened. The rubber exterior absorbed the blow and shows no visible damage. The phone looks perfect when I take it out of the case, it could be sold as &#34;new&#34; because I never have it out of the box. I do not carry insurance through my service provider, because with an Otterbox I feel it is not needed. The $7 a month I save in insurance fees has already paid for my Otterbox case. The color is very unassuming, so if you like a flashy case you might choose a different color combination, but for me the grey/white is exactly what I wanted. If you want a case that you do not notice this may not be the case for you, but if you want protection then it is great!
5	1385510400	this is a great case. Too bad the windows phone im trying to protect is bout usefull as a screen door on a submarine.  Oh blackberry I miss you so.
5	1385164800	I've had OtterBoxes since the I-Phone 1.  I never ever had a problem with my I-Phones.  These things are sturdy and worth every penny.
4	1385164800	These fit my Daniel Defense M4 perfectly.  They come off and go back on with ease.  They are very comfortable and much better than the plastic Magpul type rail covers.  The only negative that I can find is that the OD green is a little lighter than my other OD green furniture.  That said, I'm sure the Black ones would get 5 stars, as black is much easier to match.
4	1385164800	Great case, but over time the rubber outer shell stretches out of shape.  Put in dryer with some towels and it will get some shape back.  Low heat!  The belt clip is good, but the whole thing is not easy to clip together because of the rubber outer shell and it is bulky.
4	1385164800	I drop my phone all the time, and this case protects it very well. Sometimes people mock me for having such a huge, industrial-looking case - but I don't care. My iPhone 5 stays in great condition. Very durable case.
5	1384992000	This product far exceeded by expectations. I was replacing and an Otterbox Ballastic which I had been only moderately statified with but which was still the best product I had found. The defended is far and beyond a better case than the Ballastic. I have found nothing that I don't like. The IPhone 5 fits it like a glove, it goes into the case with zero problems then pops in and out of the holster seamlessly. I would recommend this to anyone using an IPhone 5 but discourage any other model users. I perfect as it fits the 5 it is sure to have conflict with any other models.
5	1384905600	Very protective! And I do VERY. Dropped mine down from a friend's balcony which is on the second story, and it landed on concrete. Case was a little dirty, which brushed off, but phone took no damage whatsoever. Bulky but if that's not a concern than this is the best investment for your iPhone!
1	1384646400	One of the worst Otterbox cases ever. Doesn't hold to the form of the phone. Not to mention I constantly having to clean the screen from moisture and dirt. Save your time and money.
5	1384473600	Highly recomended.Im civil engineer working in construction, but actually dont want to have super bulky armor cell phone in my pocket.This is it!  A MUST!Its a little more big that any &#34;normal case&#34;. But my cell fall to the ground like 1 or 2 times a week, it dont have a scratch and work perfect.I dont have any problem typing or using the menu buton.No problems with the call sound.
5	1384300800	The OtterBox is fully functional and stylish. It provides great protection for my iPhone. We have one on every iPhone in our household
4	1384300800	Very good case. But it makes the iPhone lose its sleekness! Maybe a simpler version is better for the iPhone in particular
2	1384128000	I used a Defender for my iphone 4 and it was terrific. The Defender for my Iphone 5 has been problematic. The fit between the silicone case and the holster was extremely tight, and the phone had to be forced into the holster. After grooves were eroded into the silicone case by the retainer clip, mounting and dismounting became a little easier. Unfortunately the retainer clip breaks after one to three months of use; I believe I have used four or five new retainer clips in the 14 months I have used this case. Each broke at the same part of the clip  The case, even when new, did not fit the phone well and frequent removal and cleaning was required. Eventually the silicone portion of the case stretched out and now bulges 3 to 4 millimeters away from the phone contours at the corners, giving the appearance of sagging breasts at the corners, and is loose in general on the phone. The flap over the ear phone socket has torn off. I have given up on the belt clip and carry the phone in my pocket (quite bulky) because I am clumsy and the case still provides excellent impact protection.Otterbox has tried to be helpful, sent me the new holsters free. They are aware of the problems with this case, but to my knowledge have not improved it. Now they offer to send me a new clip holder and a new silicone protector free if I send in pictures of the loose silicone rim. I'm debating whether it's worth it or not for two months of function before the clip breaks without me being aware of it and possibly causes me to lose the phone. I am investigating other phone cases with belt clips and/or loops, but will be watching to see if Otterbox improves the design and materials in the Defender in the future. I'm an Otterbox fan, and love the protection the Defender provides my phone, but would be hesitant to buy the current model. My wife's phone is enclosed in an excellent Otterbox Commuter case, but it doesn't provide quite as much impact resistance, and doesn't have a belt clip option.
3	1384041600	For superior protection from nicks, bumps, drops, and particulates, this Otterbox certainly delivers. However, it is compromised by its increased size and bulkiness in your pocket (or belt if you use the belt clip).I used this product for roughly 6 months on my iPhone. I loved how it completely encases the iPhone to protect the screen too. It can take a fall (and trust me it had taken some pretty rough tumbles). The screen protector does not alter the retina display at all and the touchscreen is just as responsive as a naked iPhone.My problems came as I started to feel the bulk in my pocket - just too heavy and made the iPhone not as user-friendly as my peers. Furthermore with iOS 7, it is hard to access the quick-swipe up menu options because the screen protector rim is difficult for your finger to access. For these reasons, I gotta give it only 3-stars: too heavy and it compromises iOS7 shortcuts. But for superior protection is hard to beat.
5	1383955200	Great product! It really meet my expectations! Very good to take care of my iphone! I dont like to write
1	1383868800	These are super cheap quality for the cost. The rubber fittings lasted less than 6 months with very minimal use prior to losing their snug fit with the internal case. Found much nicer cases for a fraction of the cost once this one crapped out.
5	1383868800	I am always a fan of otter boxes. I drop my phone constantly and it is truly a phone saver. This came in the original packaging and shipped to me quickly. It's nice to be able to buy such a great product at a much less expensive cost.
4	1383868800	Tough yet very stylish.  First for me but many already in my family.  This product will be a repeat purchase again and again with each new phone.
5	1383782400	this case has saved my phone and is ver stylish. looks great with white or black iPhones. very classy and strong. i think everyone who buys an iPhone should protect it with one of theses cases.
3	1383609600	The outside casing just keeps getting looser and looser, and I don't think I'm going to be able to use it anymore. I guess it gets stretched in my purse, I'm not sure. The screen protector really makes my screen look bad too. I really like the protection the inner case gives, so it's too bad about the rest of it.
5	1383609600	This is the second iPhone I have protected with a OtterBox. I plan to use them on every phone I ever buy. They provide great protection.
5	1383523200	It's great, keeps my phone from scratching and getting dirty at work. Very durable case and with the clip on its easily available to you without falling our of your pockets
4	1383436800	Case came exactly as described and has already protected the phone a couple of times when it fell on my tile floor. I'm very happy to have it! 5 stars for the product.Oh, and the packaging was fine, just a bunch of cardboard wrapped around the products, nothing special. If it does what it is supposed to do then I dont mind the lower aesthetics of appearance. 4 starts for the packaging.
5	1383436800	I love this case! I am constantly outdoors and working out, and I have my phone with me all the time. This case has protected my phone from numerous drops on hard/unforgiving surfaces. The case fits my iPhone 5 very well. I've never experienced any issues with my phone's speaker sound quality while using this case.I recommend this case for anyone using a iPhone 5.One thing to keep in mind: This case doesn't completely encase the phone (ie. this case is not water-proof). There are a couple spots where your phone is exposed: speakers (top/bottom) and camera (front/back). This case will help protect your phone from raindrops/light water spray, but don't go swimming with your phone and expect this case to protect it!
5	1383436800	It was new and in original packaging and case and holster new as could be is diffently order again.i recommend  to everyone.
5	1383350400	Had this otterbox for a few months now. I noticed the design of the belt clip/carrying case has been updated. In previous versions of the otterbox defender series, the belt clip would break easily. The design flaws have been addressed and appear to provide better structural integrity. As far as the actual phone case, I have never had a problem with otterbox phone cases. They seem to withstand multiple drops.
4	1383264000	I go back and forth all the time between multiple cases, it's like having a new phone.  This case will add bulk and may not be for the average user but it does the job.  It will protect the phone pocket drops or table drops.  I have dropped my phone numerous times and you can see the scuff marks on the edges.  I do not like the built in screen protector because it changes the clarity of the iPhone 5.  I do recommend this case if you do not mind the extra bulkiness.
5	1383091200	I've been begging my wife to get a decent case for awhile now and she finally picked out this case. Having a smaller otterbox for my galaxy s3 I knew this would be perfect and it is exactly what we both wanted.
3	1382918400	It does as it's advertised, but the flaps that cover the charging port, silence port, and aux port are always flipping open!
5	1382400000	Love this case because it accommodates the fingerprint option on the new iPhone 5S.  Easy to install & easy to remove phone for cleaning. Includes screen protector.  It also maintains thin profile of the phone and offers fabulous protection.  What more could you ask for?
5	1382400000	She looks great ! My phone looks good :) I'm glad I made the buy!I'm going to get an other one soon
5	1382227200	Met all expectations. It is attractive and durable.  Would recommend to anyone.  Price was much lower than at mall stores.
5	1382227200	This phone box is great for those who need something to protect their investment because they work outdoors, in construction or just during times of backpacking & other activities where the phone would get a lot of abuse.  I have a Zagg face cover & to add the box cuts down on clarity, especially when the box is put over it.  But to remove the Zagg would mean I just through away my face protector when I am not using the Otter Box.  The caveat is that it is hard to get off, but that's a good thing because you wouldn't want it to come off too easily.
5	1382054400	Case seems smaller than the previous one for the iPhone5. The finger print scanner is fully accessible now and works great!
4	1381881600	i was reluctant to get an iphone because im very clumsy with my phone.  but this case definitely is perfect for me. feel very safe with this case for my iphone.
5	1381795200	Great case! Very form-fitting yet it seems to be quite protective. My only regret is that I didn't go for the gold option
5	1381708800	Just what a wanted! A toddler proof case for my new phone. I never worry about what might be happening to it when my back is turned.
5	1381622400	Is it bulky, yes. Does it nearly double the size of an iPhone 5? Yes. Has it saved my phone on numerous occasions from a broken screen or other form of destruction? Resoundingly yes.This thing gets the job done - protecting your iPhone from (almost) anything you can throw at it.  I highly recommend it.
5	1381536000	5 star case yes its a little big and yes a little heavy but its one good looking case.protection the best but it got this case for it looks and it has class I'm not one of those people that protect things like I never had anything before.so if you want good looks good and has protection this is it.I also own 2 others and one broke there customer service is the best.
5	1381449600	This is an amazing case for Iphone. It is a little bulky but all in all it is fantastic. I have a 1 year old that steals my phone drops it , throws it , spills water on it and it lasts through all of this. Granted its not water proof believe me when I say it is definitely water resistant. Do NOT test this by dropping your phone in the tub but for sure it could take a good full glass of water spilled on it and be perfectly safe. As far as dropping this phone I have dropped it many many times. you could throw this phone ten feet in the air and let it hit the concrete, It will be fine.
5	1381363200	The case was what I expected . I like this product . I work in construction so I put the case to the test. Delivery was one day quicker than I was told . Good place to buy.
5	1381276800	Brand new in box...what could be better than getting what you pay for?  I recommend using this supplier in the future for anyone :)
5	1381276800	Got this for son for his iphone. He is on his long distance running team and he hikes a lot. I wanted something that would take a good fall and protect his phone. He uses it all the time and says that he even dropped it while running once and kicked the phone sending it skidding across the concrete path he was on and the phone was fine.Totally recommend it.
5	1381190400	It was great just what I wanted,perfect color everything I love it,it's just what I wanted I like it very much.
5	1381190400	happy with the otterbox case .. It fits my phone perfect and gives good protection for the phone. Thanks again for a great cover.
5	1381017600	I gave my old OtterBox Defender case away to my Dad so I needed another one for my iPhone5. I decided on this color because it's minimalistic, clean and modern. My phone is white and this case shows off the white even more because of the white trim. Sure, these cases aren't cheap and there are knockoffs everywhere but I wouldn't trust my iPhone with anything else. I've used OtterBoxes for years and with all the accidental drops, slips, knocks and such - I'm know there's peace of mind when I use these. The Defender case *is* bulky and does add a lil weight to it but it's a small price to pay for protecting your phone. I've never had my iPhones shatter or break because of these very very durable cases.
5	1381017600	Love it! It is a great product, beautiful color and can withstand anything that happens to it. You can't go wrong with an Otterbox.
5	1380844800	We bought two and love everthing about them, except the bulk added by the multi-layer protection.  If you use the belt clip, be careful inserting & removing the phone from the clip, as the clip can chew the otterbox.  Don't snap it in & out.  Pull on the clip to spread it open a bit.  One of our phones bounced off a moving vehicle and wasn't harmed at all.
1	1380758400	Fake!! Otterbox Sold By Otterbox and Amazon Prime Go FigureWill be sending this one Back for a Refund for Sure!
5	1380672000	After having lost iPhones to droping and dmaging it and water damage with other cheaper, &#34;less-bulky&#34; cases, I decided to go ahead and get the best case I could find.  Otterbox cases have save my phone dozens of time where they shold have been destroyed with other cases.  Since then, it's all I use for my iPhone.  This one was my favorite color combination.  Buy one, you won't regret it.
5	1380672000	we pay a lot for our phones they are so valuable to us this case does just that dropped mine several times sure glad i had the protection
5	1380672000	This case is very rugged.  I can't count how many times I've dropped my phone and this case has saved it from damage.  I would recommend this case to others.  It may be a bit bulky for some, but I don't mind it.
5	1380672000	After a number of broken and cracked screens, we purchased this case for our son.  We will never have another phone without the protection of an OtterBox.
4	1380585600	had these for about a month now. the field of view is pretty good in these. I can definitely see more to my periphery than my previous pair of speedo goggles. However lately they have began to fog up slightly by the end of my pool workout. considering my old pair fogged up after only 250m this great.
4	1380585600	this case is like any other otter box. It does its job of protection however it sacrifices size to accomplish this. I have found that the case doesn't fit comfortably into some of my jean pockets
4	1380499200	Does the job on protecting the phone. One knock may be a bit bulky but worth it as it's been dropped a few times with no damage.Better to have a working phone. Worth the price paid
4	1380499200	I love the Otter Box Defender, and the Amazon price is half of what Otter Box directly charges.  BUT.....  It will not work on the 5S, only the 5.  Too bad I threw away all the packaging before I found out.  I had to re-order directly from Otter Box as I could not find the new 5S case on Amazon.
3	1380499200	Good case, great protection and easy to install and use. The bad, well the outer rubber part gets stretched out, the cable input cover fell off and it is hard to keep clean. I put the rubber outer shell in a bowl of water, put it in the microwave and cooked it for 5 minutes. Let it cool and that seemed to shrink it a bit. Not worth more than $25, paid less when I bought it and now the prices are going up. Looking for a better case.
5	1380412800	I have had the defender series case before for other phones and it has always been great. I work in a commercial kitchen which is an unkind environment for a cell phone but with the Otter Box my phone is totally protected with or without the belt clip on and the case is not quite as bulky as it gets on some other phones.
1	1380067200	*. Interior plastic case too tight and caused scratch and damages to my iPhone 5 corners.*. If you are buying defender series for belt clip do not buy it. Belt clip is a cheap and inconvenient plastic piece. It causes damages to silicone exterior of case as well. Go with commuter series without belt if you want to buy otter series.*. silicone layer of case loosens up after a short while and looks very bad.
5	1379980800	THis thing is totally what someone like me needs, I have broken 5 iPhone's from dropping them and this thing is so bulky but totally worth it , if you don't want to ruin your phone and possible sell it later knowing the item is in perfect condition. This is a must buy!
4	1379808000	It's a great case, but a bit too big. At times getting into a car becomes a hassle due to how uncomfortable the case feels when sitting.
5	1379635200	Every time a see a kid with an iPhone, they have it in an OtterBox. When I needed to find something to protect my iPhone, I found that you can't beat them for protection. Love it and love the color.
4	1379548800	I have had this case for my iPhone5 for almost a year and I couldn't be more pleased.  I've dropped my phone, spilled things on it and let children play with it...all with complete safety. The only downside is that it does make the phone a lot more bulky.  I look at others with their teeny timney cases and sometimes envy their "small" phones...but I'd rather know that my investment is protected.Notes: It is only just now starting to show some wear-loosening of the rubber around the edges and some peeling/flaking on the home button.  I would definitely reccomend.  I don't think one can go wrong with Otterbox
1	1379462400	looked nice when I received it but the grey outer case stretched and I had to replace the case after 2 months.
5	1379462400	Looks great on my white iPhone 5 & really protects it. I've dropped this phone so many times but it's never cracked.
4	1379030400	This turned my iPhone 5 into a pretty big object, but that's just fine for me.  Very secure and heavy duty.Over time the headphone port cover wore out and fell off.This cover does not prevent dust from getting on the phone.  I occasionally had to remove the cover and clear the dust between the screen protector and the screen.The outer cover expanded over time and no longer seated well against the inner cover.I did feel that my phone was very secure from drops/bumps, etc.
4	1379030400	It's almost a 5 star case. ALMOST. I'm not complain about the size because I knew it'd be bulky. It's worth the protection though. I've had cases break on me before. The only thing that bothers me is that no matter what I do , lint gets in the case somehow. I believe I read another review that says dust does as well. So you have to clean it out every now and then. I also hoped the silent switch was easier to access. Peeling the case each time can be annoying after a while.
5	1378857600	Awesome protection for my iPhone 5. I am in atticsw and crawlspaces all day and i no longer have to worry about my phone getting damaged. It's just the right amount of protection and just the right amount of style. Thanks otterbox!!!
4	1378857600	pretty cool, does the job, bit of a pain to get the phone in and out, as i like to switch to the portable charging case. but otherwise like it
5	1378598400	I bought this for my wife and she likes it. Looks good and provides protection against any unexpected slips and drops.
5	1378512000	It will keep the phone from breaking. Fit perfectly for the iphone5This is the third otter box product we've owned and would buy again
5	1378339200	The best case for any iphone because it protects the phone through basically everything besides water. Recommended product to anybody looking for a case to protect their phone.
5	1378166400	Love the revised Otterbox for the iPhone 5!  Lots lighter but feels just as safe!Buy one now - you won't be sorry.
5	1378166400	It is just like the case you would get from otter box.com and provides lots of protection. I have already dropped my phone in the case and it didn't even leave a scratch. I would definitely buy this again.
5	1377993600	It is a perfect case for Iphone 5. I love it so much. It can protect my Iphone 5 so well, prevent it from broken.
5	1377820800	Great case. I will say that it is harder to remove than the otterboxes for the 4 and 4S. But it protects my phone as intended.
5	1377820800	I have dropped my phone multiple times and this case has protected it. I recommend this to all klutzy people who own an IPod 5! It arrived a few days before it was originally expected to as well.
5	1377820800	The best case for iPhone 5, I work outside n it work great, phone safe so get it now. Three piece
5	1377648000	Solid case, also comes with a screen protector built in that I didn't realize when I purchased so there's an added bonus
5	1377475200	This product was purchased for someone on request.The item was received on time and in the condition identified.I dont anticipate a problem with this item
5	1377475200	I would recommend this product to anyone with any type of phone! You can never go wrong with the Otter Box! It is kept nice and safe against spills and dropping accidents!  The color looks great on a white phone for sure!
2	1377302400	Disappointed.  I had the case less than 6 weeks and the rubber wrap on the outside of the case stretched out in the corners.  I would not purchase this item again.  I am watching how the Ballistic case lasts with my wife's phone.  If it does well I will replace the OtterBox with one.
5	1377129600	It's a prefect case for protecting your iphone. I've even spilled water on it and it kept my phone safe even though mine isn't water proof.
4	1377129600	This is a great case and all but i found that the material started to peel after about a month from the holster so be careful
3	1376956800	my friends kept giving me a hard time about how bulky the case got. I really liked the fact that it protected my phone, and really got used to the holster clip. Unfortunately the holster broke today after about 6 months of working great. I am thinking about sending it back to Otterbox.
3	1376870400	I bought this a few months ago based on reviews and after a few weeks i noticed this product looses it shape and doesnt fit well on my Iphone5. Its still functional but it doesnt look good. I am looking to replce this soon. I keep my phone in my pocket and its not durable enough to keep its shape.
4	1376697600	This is perfect for my wife and I because we have a toddler. We are no longer afraid of him grabbing the phone and tossing it down the stairs.The product is bulky, but protects our phone ok.
4	1376611200	I love the look and it's  durability .  This item totally protects my iPhone and that's the purpose of purchasing it. My only issue with this case is, where the screen protector  is glued around the phone case gets dirty and it can't be clean because its actually exposed glue and lint I believe.
5	1376611200	My husband loves it, it is sturdy enough and looks good enough for him.  It comes with with a belt clip.
5	1376524800	I would recommend these Otterbox phone covers very much i have 2 and they work very well and look good also.
4	1376524800	protected my iphone 5 whenever i dropped it. very duriable. but if liquid is spilled on it, it gets in the case and you have to remove the whole thing.
5	1376438400	Exactly what it says. Durable, baby proof ( my baby plays with my iPhone all the time and my iPhone is still like new) and elegant. I love it
5	1376092800	Protects your phone from accidental falls. Casing is sturdy although it makes your phone quite big. Did not ever use the clip on plastic layer as the two layers are strong enough.The advantage I have over my friends who don't use Otterbox is that I dont skip a beat when my phone falls from my hands.
5	1376092800	I have no worries now about damaging my iPhone. It was so quick and easy to put it on and i love this color.
5	1376006400	I recently purchased a new iPhone 5 after dropping my iPhone 4 in its bargain store protective case, only to find the screen shattered.  When considering a protective case for my new phone, the Otterbox came highly recommended by several of my family members and friends.  I have loved it from the minute of its arrival.  Not only does it keep my phone safe when it occasionally slips out of my purse, but I rarely drop it because the outer covering makes it so easy to hang on to in all circumstances.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an attractive and reliable product!
2	1375747200	I ordered this case and have used it for a few months. The rubber around the outside of the phone was very soft and the belt clip chewed bits of it away until it has nearly come off the hard interior of the case. I have friends who have Otterbox cases that have harder rubber, that the belt clip hasn't torn apart. Then the belt clip broke. I like the case in general, like the way it fits and protects the phone but not the issues I've had with the rubber and then the belt clip. I considered ordering another belt clip but am afraid it will just complete the job of tearing the rubber off.  I saw a review that said these are not real Otterbox cases. The packaging looked right but I've never had an Otterbox until this one. I would expect more than a couple months worth of full functionality from a brand name like Otterbox. I'm not happy with the case.
5	1375747200	This is a very good case and exactly as described.  It is extremely durable.  I have dropped my phone many times and it has no damage at all.  It was very east to install the case
4	1375747200	I like it as I feel my iPhone 5 is protected, Haven't dropped the phone yet (knock on wood), wish that the iPhone 5 didn't need a case, love the feel without the case, BUT it needs protection.
4	1375574400	Unlike the defender series for the Iphone 4, this thing hasn't fallen apart in a year. Only time will tell I suppose.
1	1375315200	Too bulky and the holder broke. Phone difficult to get in and off holder. Probably the reason why it broke. Rubber covering loosens up after a while and detaches from hard protective shell. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Get a Body Glove instead. Thinner, protects better and cheaper in price, if you do your research.
5	1375228800	Awesome case. Buying more today. Tried other brands but none that I have purchased holds a candle to Otter Box.
5	1375228800	I got my Iphone in April. It really protects it well. It is a bit hard to open to put the phone in but I kind of like that. I have dropped my phone a couple times and the case stays together and I have had no issues. I am not really much of a gray fan but I didn't want anything bright or flashy or black. I have grown to like the color.
5	1375228800	I would recommend this to anyone with a blue collar job or who is just clumsy. It protects it very well I lost the belt holster but that was my fault it works really well
5	1375142400	Great case, highly recommend it! we purchased our first OtterBox for our tween who has an iPhone 5. The case is scratched up due to the number of times it's been dropped but the phone looks like new when you take it out of the case. That said, the case is doing it's job and the reason why I'm purchasing one for my own iPhone.
1	1375056000	Like a few reviewers before me.  The outer rubberized casing has become loose around the hard plastic case.  I had purchased 2 and it happened to both of them.  They worked great for the first few months and the problem started and became worse.
5	1375056000	Protect your investment. Excellent case.  I ordered the defender for my iPad as well since it worked very well for my iphone.  I can't wait until the case arrives for my ipad.
5	1374969600	Best case ever. Looks nice, feels nice, handles well. I recommended this to my friend, he couldn't be more satisfied
5	1374883200	OtterBox Defender cases are my go to phone cases. I prefer their rubbery outside to just a hard case. I will continue to use their defender series.
5	1374710400	Works great for protecting your iphone.  No problems putting it on and buttons are still easy to get to.  Charging is not a problem with this case on.
4	1374710400	It's just like the other cases but I bought one right when the iPhone came out and with my previous one the silicone 'covered' the plastic! But on this one the plastic is more raised than the rubber, so maybe this is a defaulted one but long story short for the price I would grab one I really love it and I dropped it about 5 feet on rock hard cement and this thing handled it like a champ!!!:-D
1	1374710400	I have had then case for just a few months, and it broke on me.  I expected much better quality from Otterbox, but was utterly disappointed in what I received.  I will never buy again nor will i ever recommend it to anyone.  I wasted $30 dollars, and it feels terrible to waste money one something that you expect would be of stellar quality!!
5	1374624000	As usual otterbox defender does its job. I have dropped this thing probably about once a month for the past year and even the case still looks new. No problems with the phone at all once protected by this beast!
5	1374537600	Fits excellent as expected.  The nice thing is the feel of the rubber.  Had this for months and the outer shell had not loosened at all like older model otterbox.  Has a good feel to it, grips well but not soft.  Screen protector is best yet I've seen built into a case.
4	1374451200	This case is great for keeping my phone secure, but for whatever reason, when I try to use my credit card swiper from Squared Up, it is not long enough to insert. Could be the case, could be the iphone 5...but it is a pain to have to remove the case to take a credit card.
4	1374451200	Warning: This case makes your iphone hefty and screen protector leaves visible oily looking markings on the screen when screen is off. At first I did not like the Otterbox defender case and I decided to try CaseCrown snap on case, which was nice and sleek but not much protection. Then I returned to Otterbox because my phone felt really safe in this box. As such this case does not look bad, may be even looks better than other cheap plastic cases, but the oil like mark on the screen can be an issue. I minimize the oil like markings by using screen protector on the phone.
5	1374451200	I order this case for my son, I think he liked it because I have not heard any complains. It looks nice and it's just how it looks in the picture.
5	1374364800	like the protection in case I drop the phone.  bought it on the recommendation of family members and I would recommend it to anyone needing extra protection in a case.  I love the color also
5	1374364800	Had mixed feelings about the bulkiness before I got it but love it now, definitely recommend and personally like the glacier white
5	1374192000	I bought this as a gift for my girl friend after she dropped her first iphone 5 and shattered the screen.  She loves it, and it does a great job protecting her phone.
5	1374192000	Provides all the protection you'll need for drops. Already dropped off my lap when getting out of my car and not a scratch. The outer silicone protection that covers the earphone jack was cracking off. I contacted OtterBox, followed their instructions for warranty, and they replaced the part quickly. I noticed they used a different, and better silicone with the replacement. They had explained earlier that they are constantly improving the silicone covers.  Great product. Great company.
4	1374192000	It is great, the only thing I don't like about is that it is bulky and a bit heavy. Other than that it does what it is supposed to do
5	1374105600	I was hesitant to get an OtterBox because reviewers said they made phones so bulky. I have not found that to be a problem. I really can't see that my phone is significantly bigger with the OtterBox than it was with the flimsier case I had previously. I also have no problem fitting the plug of the Amazon brand lightening cable into the space provided by the OtterBox. I like the clip for when I have no pockets. I've already dropped my phone several times and no damage. I work with children with disabilities and we use OtterBox cases for their iPads for use as assistive technology devices. Now I've found that OtterBox makes a great iPhone case, too.
1	1374019200	i have no idea, where they get the product from? its totally different and use less than the original otter box. the outer rubber comes out easily while u take the phone out from ur pocket, i returned the product but they did not credited my account..  :(
5	1374019200	bought for my daughter and she loves it!!! protects phone great! also nice looking and not big and bulky! great
4	1374019200	First time ordering an OtterBox case and it definitely isn't my last time doing so. It's an amazing looking and durable case. The only problem I would have with it is the included screen protector. After a week or so, round rainbow marks began appearing which made the screen look really bad. Easily fixed just by popping the screen protector out though.
5	1373846400	I have owned this case for only a short time, but I am very happy with it. The phone size feels more comfortable than without the case.
5	1373673600	This case is the truth! A little bit hard to put on at first but I figured it out. Very durable! It also does not interfere with the camera/flash; pictures come out looking crisp and clear. I'm ordering another one for my mom today.
5	1373328000	Great product.  I would definitely recommend.  Fits my iPhone 5 perfectly and does a great job of protecting the phone.
5	1373241600	I just love this Case. It really does a great job protecting my phone and looks great too. Very happy with price as well.
3	1373155200	it is not useful as the skin is outstretched so much, it barely stays on.  I guess it is due to the holster case is too tight, so it pushes and stretches the soft skin.
1	1372982400	the grey plastic part that cover around the edge is not fitted and starts to loosen after 3 weeks of use. Not recommended.
2	1372896000	I purchased this from Amazon after first seeing it at the Sprint store where I got my iPhone 5. It cost about half the price on Amazon than it did at the local store. At first I was quite happy with it. Everything seemed to work well except for the cover for the iPhone Ring/Silent switch. It was very difficult to change that switch while the iPhone was in the OtterBox. It was so difficult that I eventually stopped using that switch. Using the iPhone Home button also required lots of force.After using the OtterBox for a while I discovered that it was very easy for clothing (shirt, jacket, and coat) to get stuck between the OtterBox and its belt clip holder. This was a problem when trying to return the OtterBox back to its belt clip on my belt. Also, if I attached the belt clip to my belt while I was setting down it was easy to do it incorrectly. I learned this the hard way when the phone and belt clip fell to the floor one day when I later stood up.After four to five months of use the belt clip broke. (The top clip part broke where it comes up from the back.) The OtterBox service department replaced the part for free after I sent them pictures of the broken part. The replacement process took about a week. The final straw came when, while clipped to my belt, the padded OtterBox separated from the belt clip and fell to the hard floor of a public restroom. The iPhone inside the OtterBox was damaged. (This fall damaged the volume buttons of the iPhone.)Because of these problems, I decided to use a different brand case for my replacement iPhone. The new case, which I purchased from Amazon, is waterproof and dust-proof. It is also easier to use the iPhone Home button, and the Ring/Silent switch on the new case. Since the OtterBox was my first iPhone case I did not know how hard it was to use until I switched to the new case.
5	1372809600	I love the gray color.  I have had this case for 4 months now and it is still protecting my iphone.
4	1372636800	The case is exactly what is described, however my only complaint is that it is extremely bulky which leads me to not use it often!
1	1372464000	After a few weeks the cover stretched out and was loose. I had an otter box for my iPhone 4 and it was great. This one was very poor quality. Very disappointed.
2	1372377600	we had this otter product for 4 months and it deformed itself. now the outer case does not fit snuggly anymore. it is now bigger than the inner case.. we have to buy another case for the i phone 5.
5	1372118400	I think Otterbox did a much better job in the case design for the iPhone 5 as compared with the 4s. Friends seem to really like the gray/white color.Amazon.com had by far, the best price and the shipping was  f a s t!
5	1372032000	Love the color and does the job well by protecting my phone and is easy to use the screen does not make touching the apps or text hard at all, would highly recommend.
5	1371859200	The Otterbox Defender is an expensive case but on Amazon you can get a good deal on it. It only took about 3 days to arrive with the free shipping so that was pretty fast. When I first got it the first thing I did was pop out the screen protector and put an SGP anti glare one on and it was pretty much perfect. The ports are easy to access even if you don't have big fingernails. The buttons are responsive which is a plus. It has good drop protection which is why most people are looking to buy this. The apple is cut out so people know that you have an iPhone and it may bother you but personally it doesn't bother me. The camera cut out is big and it won't cause any problems with the flash. This color would look better on a white phone because it pretty much matches the iPhone 5's color. Overall if you're on the fence about buying it it would be worth it. $30 is a good deal on how much drop protection you get and it still lets your phone look good even though it might be a little bit thick.
4	1371772800	The otterbox does exactly what it says it will do - it will protect your phone from damage.  The case itself is very tricky to get apart and it bulky.  So for a female who uses smaller purses it is not ideal to slip into a pocket.
5	1371772800	Awesome phone cover..instead of investing in phone insurance this is your best choice one time purchase and will protect your phone..I have dropped my iPhone 5 hundreds of times and the otterbox just protects it and the case has hardly a scratch in it totally recommend it...
5	1371772800	This was great! Quick shipping and protects it just fine. Looks great and feels awesome. It just rubbed off on the side a bit when clipped
3	1371772800	I love the way tis looks and feels, adds bulk to the phone but it is nice to have piece of mind about drops. The outer silicone stretced out of shape almost immediately which is something that the others that my family has did not do. I have contacted Otter Box and expect them to replace it.
4	1371772800	This case works great.  It protects my iPhone like it claims it will.  I would recommend this to anyone who is prone to dropping their phone.
5	1371600000	Got it on sale so it was a no brainer. If you have a kid then you need a serious case and this one looks great too. Thankfully I'm not a hipster so the "bulky" case doesn't interfere with my nonexistent skinny jeans. Glacier look is a huge plus as well. Get it.
1	1371600000	i order the grey one plus the pink tree one .. the tree one is great but the grey one my husband HATES it .. the back is a cheap rubber . he threw it in the trash .. DONT ORDER THE light GREY ONE. my wife has a hard rubber back and that is wht i thought i had but no
5	1371600000	It's just what I wanted and this case is great and looks nice on my phone I love this case
2	1371427200	I purchased this, thinking I was saving 50% of the original price listed in the Otterbox. It looked great, but the openings for the charger and the volume are so hard, I had to use a fork to open them. I figured that over time it soften up, but its not been a few months and its the same. Also, the cover has scratched quite a bit. Friends who purchased their from the website do not have these issues. I will be purchasing a replacement straight from the Otterbox company.
5	1371427200	Awesome case. Very durable.  Keeps it clean. Rough. Takes a beating. It's grey. It's white. You can't beat it with a stick. Or maybe you can?
5	1371427200	Otterbox is the best.Positives:- Adds tackiness to your phone so you can hold it without fear of it slipping out of your hand- Adds bulk to a very small device (better for larger hands)- The best drop protection there is. I've dropped my older phone (with Otterbox Defender cover) to concrete several times and never had one single issue. Was able to sell old phone as &#34;immaculate&#34; as there were no scratches, dents, etc on it when I was done with it.Negatives:- Adds bulk to your device (not a negative for me, but I'm sure someone will want to know this)- Price (might scare some but worth it in the end)
1	1371340800	Purchased from Amazon in February. By June, the rubber outer casing had stretched to the point that the case was essentially no longer operable. I'll try and remedy the situation through Otterbox, but so far this has been a bust...
5	1371340800	It's amazing how clumsy I can be, but the Otterbox has saved me from day 1. Wouldn't go any other route!
5	1371254400	Did not know what to expect if wife would like it but the case is quite a bit larger than actual phone and thought she'd not like it but she felt this improved the experience using the phone. Used to BB phone and the slim square edge iphone made it harder to pickup if you're not used to the slim case design. The defender case by the nature of its protective layers made the phone easier to pickup (thicker) and she felt more comfortable using the phone with the increase in the overall size. Some don't like bulk but it worked for her...and ecstatic with it...loves the fact its encased by it. It's install was very quick once you disassembled and opened the hard plastic inner layer and just wrap it with the rubber outer layer....just like putting items into a suitcase and closing. I do feel it adds alot of protection but you have to sacrifice the beauty of the phone. Only item I'd say not perfect its with the built-in screen protector...works fine but adds a slight cushion of air layer that's obvious once you touch the screen but does not impede the touchscreen use (after awhile you don't notice it)...but a worthwhile trade-off in the end to have this level of protection. Highly recommended for those who just don't want to worry about damage from everyday use.
5	1371168000	After reading some of the negative reviews on the OtterBox I was a bit worried, but I took a chance and ordered it anyway.  I'm glad I did. This is my third OtterBox (also my third IPhone) and it is the best yet.  Much easier to work with than previous models and much better made.  I recommend this product without reservation.
5	1371168000	Purchased for my wife's iPhone 5.  Just the right size and weight.  Provides the protection that is needed for the phone.
2	1370995200	Otterbox does a great job of protecting the iPhone, but this new Defender case for iPhone 5 has a real flaw. The outer cover becomes loose over time and is really disapponting!
3	1370995200	Does what it suppost to do just ugly case though wish it wasnt so bulky and gotty lookin and also wish it was ezer to take off
5	1370995200	We've owned apple products for years and we always buy otter boxes. This product is defenatly for parents with small children (or people other heavy duty jobs). We even have them for our boys iPads (ages 5yrs and 2yrs) and it was the best investment we have ever made. They are pricey but worth it!!!!
5	1370908800	I have the OtterBox Defender Series in black, green and now glacier.  They are great and I feel comfortable that my IPhone is protected.
5	1370908800	I bought one of these when I first got my iPhone 5 and though the box is indestructible, the screen is getting worn from use so I bought a spare for traveling.
1	1370908800	This arrived in packaging that was torn open, there was probably (no exaggeration) 20-30 tiny hairline scratches all over the front of the case. Un useable... Tossed it in the junk drawer went to Walmart and got another one. Super disappointed.
5	1370908800	Great protection for screen. A little bulky, but I don't mind since I drop it constantly. Is not dust-proof or water-proof, but provides excellent protection against screen cracking!
4	1370908800	Really nice case, the only thing I didn't like was the holes. I use a full body invisible shield & could still use this case just by taking out the back pad sticker.
5	1370822400	This item has an amazing amount of sturdiness while still keeping the iPhone 5 feeling thin and sleek. I love it.
5	1370476800	I have had several OtterBox Defender cases for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5.  They are a great product!  I feel safer with my phone inside of them.
5	1370476800	With amazon prime 2 day shipping and a savings of 50% off of retail, I know not how anyone can justify purchasing anywhere else. I've had 5 different ottorboxes in the family over the years for various phone models. This one is easily my favorite. The gray color is easily visible on both white and dark counters (not sure how I would feel if I had a gray counter top, but I don't). Makes the phone look professional while also providing otterbox level protection.
5	1370476800	Wat kan i say otterbox quality. Im not rapin my 600 iphone  n nuttun else.  Fit isa ten. Only case tobuy. Beet brik an motor  by 25 buks
5	1370390400	Best product ever! It really protects my iPhone 5I do recommend it, it does make your phone bigger but it issafe!!!! great transaction!
5	1370131200	Pricesly what I need to protect my IPhone cell phone. Not heavy and apropiate color. Good design and the most important protection of a high investment product.
4	1370044800	Protects ur phone very well but its too bulky. If u don't care ur phone's look buy it otherwise look for something else.
5	1369785600	I bought this case because I'll be traveling to several countries next year, and I needed a solid case for my iPhone 5. I had heard good things about OtterBox, and several of my friends recommended this one. The &#34;Defender&#34; series is apparently the toughest line of OtterBox cases, and I'm hard on my phones, so I went with this one.I've had it for about five months, and I haven't had any problems so far. It fits really well!
4	1369785600	As many would say, the case is definitely very resilient to whatever you throw at it, or whatever you throw it at. The belt clip has a problem that some online are also experiencing. Facing the screen to you may degrade the silicon around the notch. The same can't be said for facing the screen outward.
5	1369699200	Every time I purchase a new iPhone, I buy a OtterBox defender case for it.  I actually push out the plastic screen and have a Zag shield installed on the front and back of my phones.  This case provides excellent protection on the corners.  I have dropped my phone a few times, and have no issues at all.  It does add a little to the width, but to me it is worth it.  OtterBox makes a slimmer version, but it cuts down on the protection.  My husband actually carries the slimmer version, it fits better in his pockets.  Being a female, this one gives me no issues on the size, and fits in all of my purses~!  I also carry this in my hospital scrubs, in my front pockets and have no problems with the size.
5	1369699200	I have a habit of dropping my phone often, so when I updated to the iPhone 5 and opted not to take the Apple Care or insure the phone, I knew I had to have a case that would withstand my klutzy moments. This case has not disappointed me so far! The only thing I did not like about the case is the plastic face cover. After a day or two, I just ripped the clear plastic off. I have a ZAGG clear protective cover on this anyway, and the OtterBox cover was just too much. Aside from that, it's great.
2	1369699200	It doesn't fit the phone well. This shouldn't be sold in the market. I would never recommend this product to any one.
5	1369612800	The shipment came in on time and in great shape. Within a few minutes, I was able to install it.Yes, the transparent cover could have been a little thicker and rigid, since once in a while, you can see a little air-bubble, which does go away with a swipe of the finger.But for the price, it's a great deal.
1	1369612800	I had an Otter Box for my iPhone 3Gs that worked quite well. This one, however, fits terribly. The hard plastic case is fine, but it's nearly impossible to remove the phone from it if I want to switch covers or access the charging port with an adapter (charging adapters don't fit through the case - only the standard iPhone 5 cord that comes with the phone does). The screen cover is looser than it was on the 3Gs version, leaving a more &#34;bubbly&#34; appearance on the screen. The rubber casing is where this product really falls short. The rubber outer shell is so loose that it will nearly fall off without being pulled or stretched. I'm very unhappy with this version of the iPhone 5 Otter Box Defender.
5	1369612800	I thought it was going to be a scam and be cheap material when I saw the price,,, but it was the real deal!
5	1369526400	Great product.  Much improved design over the one on my Iphone 4.  The rubbery outside is more firm, is a tight fit and does not collect lint like the old one.  The bottom section that covers the charging port stays closed as well.  Would recommend to everyone.
2	1369526400	This case looks like a real otter box new, and even says so on the case. HOwever, it does not perform like a real otter box should and the rubber on the outter part of the case wears within three months.
4	1369526400	Great cover. The screen cover works very well. It has passed the drop test several times already. Only dislike I have is the earphone and chargers plugs are covered and its a hassle to unclip these. I am thinking of cutting them off.
5	1369440000	I bought this for my dad for a Christmas present.  He loves it very much.  There have been no complaints about anything.
5	1369440000	I have this OtterBox and it has saved my phone many times. I am a teacher and as part of our end of year projects I have my students take a picture dressed in a cap and gown, and write a letter promising the graduate HS. I used my phone to take their photos and uploaded them to Walgreens photo shop- great ap! Let me tell you, between my students knocking my phone out of my hands (and the phone flying through the air and hitting the hard floor face first) and me being clumsy, this case has saved my phone and kept a lot of money in my pocket. I will never rely on any other type of case. The only thing that I would recommend would be to get an additional stick-on screen protector to use before putting this case on. Dirt sometimes gets between the built in screen protector of the case and the actual screen.
1	1369353600	I bought my Otterbox case less than 6 months ago and the rubber frame is already coming off the hard frame.  The rubber has stretched out from simple use.  I've taken my phone out of the case once since I bought it. I need to buy a new case now.
5	1369267200	Great case. Sturdy and very well built. Highly recommend it to those active users like myself. Could be a life savers in most situations!
1	1369180800	First of all, I guess it's as advertised. I mean, it would probably protect your phone from a 10-story drop. But if you want to really be able to use your phone, or have any kind of tactile control over the screen, you can forget it.I bought the Otter Box on the recommendations of several friends. Maybe I'm just not as hard on my phones as they are, but I feel like it's WAY more case than I need. Unless you are REALLY hard on your phone, look for something else. It takes a thin, compact iPhone 5 and turns it into a brick.The cover over the home button is so stiff, you have to press REALLY hard to get it to work. I've looked at other people's Otter Box cases, and they aren't like this, so I don't know if it's just this color (Glacier), or if I was looking at something other than the Defender.The cover for the silence switch is so hard to open, you practically need a screw driver or some kind of tool to get into it.The screen protector has so many bubbles and such a bad glare it almost makes it impossible to read in anything but perfect light. Also, I've noticed that on some games, the touch screen is so delayed it makes it too frustrating to even bother with. And it scratches very easily.I ended up cutting the cover over the charging dock off because it was so stiff it was pushing against the charger and I've ended up going through two chargers because of shorts in the cord. Maybe caused by the Otter Box, maybe not, I'm not sure.I hate to not use the case after spending so much on it, but the frustration it is causing is making me want to switch to a more streamlined case.So I guess to sum up. It will protect your phone, but at what cost?
5	1369180800	Love this, looks good and protects my phone, have dropped phone with no damage thanks to my otterbox  don't leave home without it.
5	1369180800	Only case where it has a clear plastic shield to protect the glass. Love it!!!  The rubber is high quality and durable.
5	1369094400	I started with the Lifeproof case when I got my new iPhone 5, because my old iPhone didn't stand up to kids so well.  But with the LP case, no one could hear me on the phone.  I tried a few things per some blogs to make it better, but nothing worked.  With the Defender, I have all the protection except for the waterproof part.  But really, it protects from minor liquid issues (baby slobber, splatters), which is all I need.  I don't plan to white water raft of scuba with it any time soon.  :)  And this price is WAY better.  I wish I had the $80+ back that I spent on the Lifeproof.  Lesson learned...
5	1369094400	Bought this when i first got my iPhone5 and let me tell you, It has saved my phone Many times!!! It is sturdy, well built, and does the job of protecting a very expensive phone
2	1369094400	Case was less than I expected. Two prongs on the hard part of the case were broken off when I pulled it out of the package, the screen protector is detached from the case in three areas resulting in me having to buy super glue and glue it back on myself... Not that hard, just a bit of a hassle. Overall it was just so-so quality... Guess its true that you get what you pay for sometimes :(
2	1369008000	The case material is very hard that it did break just trying to un box it.not worth the headache get one from Walmart easier and you will be able to return it if the case was old rubber.
4	1369008000	Provides nice protection to phone. Now I dont have to worry about it falling down and crack the screen. But it makes phone a little bigger. So we have to make a tradeoff between phone protection Vs a little bigger phone.
5	1368921600	It does exactly what I need it to do.  I feel my iphone is protected and that's what I need.
5	1368835200	It is great fits right feels right it came in the original package and it had no flaws awesome product
3	1368835200	While I felt my phone was safe and secure, two things bothered me:1. The plug covers are impossible to get open to use the silent switch or plug the charger/headphones in. Mine didn't seem to get better w/use either.2. The protective screen always seemed to have air under it which lead to problems seeing things on the screen. I even tried anti-static wipes. Helped for a little while, then went back to having the air bubble look.Now, I'm hard on phones but I don't think the Defender was necessary (I have since purchased the Commuter case). I have some drops, but I also don't work in an occupation such as construction or other labor job, where I feel the extra protection is necessary.For those that need/want the protection, the above hassle may be worth the purchase to protect your investment.Like I said, I felt secure my phone wasn't going to be damaged by anything other than a car backing over it...the case jjust didn't suit my lifestyle.
4	1368748800	This case offers 100% protection for iPhone 5. I have a toddler and my iPhone 5 inevitably ends in her tiny hands. This case is basically a hard case that seals the phone, and then a wrap around protection that protects against drops. The clear screen part of the case is amazing. It is hard to tell that there is a layer of protection between your finger and the phone. The phone will be bulky, but the added weight will not be noticeable. This is a great case, easy to install, and overall great protection.It comes with a clip on attachment, but I don't use that part of the case.
5	1368748800	all the standard quality meets by the otter-box, cover all the necessary holes by flaps, excellent to prevent dust. good looking.
5	1368748800	Its the perfect color, good size. The belt clip works great. Its a good solid protection from daily life. I recommend it. I have the grey and white. Wife liked it and wanted the pink camo and she loves her case.
5	1368748800	Love the product however it did not come as the color I wanted. I do not know if I selected the wrong color or if the company sent the wrong color. Otherwise excellent product and protects the iphone
4	1368748800	I got to say that when it comes to phone protection I can definitely rely on otterbox to get the job. I've been a fan of otterbox ever since i got a cover for my iphone 3gs and saw what a great protection it provided. I no longer had to throw my foot in the way to prevent my phone from hitting the floor whenever I dropped it. Aside from being a great product I do have one problem with the casing, and idk if this has happened to anyone else, its that the outer rubber has stretched to the point where it doesn't properly fit on the inner part of the case. This never happened to me when I had the case for the 3gs. This is the only problem I've had with otterbox and I have heard people saying they're not big fans because it's bulky, but if these are two things you can overlook then I say you're looking at a 5 star product.
5	1368662400	Yes this case is exactly as described and I ordered the gray with white trim and it's great!  This will protect my IPHONE screen, outlets, and buttons.  I'm sure many users don't like the thickness it adds to the IPHONE, but that doesn't bother me, because I would rather have it protected and keep my phone safe.  I read a lot of reviews and for the price and protection you can't beat an Otter Box.  Love it!
3	1368576000	This is the third OtterBox that I've purchased. I've bought OtterBoxes for the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4 and now the iPhone 5. First, the positives: I love the design of this case - this is absolutely their best design to-date. It also helps that it's available in a rainbow of colors and finishes (I chose the standard Glacier). The case feels just as solid as other OtterBox products. Opening up the shell is also a little easier on this one than the first OtterBox (3G). The negative: After only about two weeks, the outer rubberized shell has begun to wear down in a couple of places, most noticeably around the clip that secures the case to the belt clip harness. Also--and this is purely cosmetic--I'm a little disappointed that the belt clip harness only comes in black and does not match the rainbow colors of the cases.
5	1368576000	Absolutely love OtterBox cases. Keeps my iPhone safe despite me constantly dropping it. Easy to put together and take apart.
5	1368576000	This is an awesome product. Maximum protection for your iphone and at half the cost of the store price. Im very happy with my purchase
5	1368576000	Love my color! I had an otter box before but did not like the color ( I bought it from sprint). I ordered through amazon and it came in quickly and I love the color! (Grey and white).
5	1368489600	I have had no problems with it. The case actually saved my phone a few times. It came in the original box unopened.
4	1368403200	My wife broke her iPhone screen twice. New phone and new case now. She loves this case. Substantial protection, good looks and not too bulky. (A bit expensive though, so just 4 stars.)
5	1368316800	Fit perfect,  looked good. Better price.  Would buy more in the future or would tell a friend. Make a good gift
4	1368316800	Great protection for phone! Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the screen protector smudging the screen taking away high resolution viewing, I was given the option to take the protector off but then would feel like my screen isn't protected.
5	1368230400	Love this otter box! The color is great and very attractive! Nice and sturdy. Absolutely beautiful. It's a great product!
5	1368144000	So far -- it is more than I expected.  Fits snug to the I-Phone and protects the phone extremely well.  How do I know this - because I have already dropped my phone on a concrete floor and it was not damaged.
4	1368144000	I always have an Otterbox for my Apple iPhones. The product itself was in great condition and seemed to be new, despite the rough condition the outer packaging was in.
3	1368144000	The plastic clip on the the belt holder broke after 5 months making it non useable. Before that it worked fine.
5	1368057600	This is a great deal for an otter box.  If you drop your phone or have kids this is a great product to have.
5	1368057600	I've had Otter Boxes since the iPhone4, really strong this one is no different. This only one issue with this case which is the tab for the ringer shut off is really tuff to take off. I tend to use my car keys to pry it off, other then that great case.
5	1368057600	as always otter box protects my iphone 5. I  had a previous otter box in black. my phone was in my pocket with my keys.  When I pulled them out I thought I cracked my iphone 5 screen.  Thanks to otter box it was only a scratch to the otter box cover and not my phone.  Decided to get a different color cover this time! I will not be without one.
5	1367971200	These cases are great - and you cannot beat these prices. I get one about every six months or so because I do scratch mine up - and it feels like I have a new phone every time!
5	1367971200	Ordered this phone case as a Christmas gift for my dad and he loved it! Was exactly what he wanted and arrived earlier than expected! Was very impressed with the smoothness of the transaction and the arrival time of the item purchased. Would definitely recommend this seller to others and would purchase from this seller again! Great experience! : )
1	1367798400	It looked like a returned product. The oil spill on the screen were bad. It was too much work to return and get replacement and no guarantee it would be new. Very disaapointed.
5	1367798400	Does great job of protecting the I-Phone and its fragile face. Also adds some bulk which I find a positive as it is easier to handle.
5	1367798400	Otterbox is sheer brilliance.  I don't know how I got by before without one.- Keeps it clean!  I take my phone out and clean it from time to time.  My phone looks as pristine as the day I bought it.  On my last phone I had a cheap cover.  It lead to hardware malfunction because it didn't keep the dust out of the connector.- Then there's dropping it.  No matter how much I swore up and down that I would NEVER drop my phone, guess what?  I did.  I didn't mean to and I've done the whole &#34;I'm dropping my phone but I don't want it to hit anything hard&#34; dance.  It paid off a few times, but there's always that one time that you just happen to be standing on a concrete floor directly adjacent to something incredibly metal and pointy that your phone is going to hit several times before you helplessly watch it fall to the floor.  Though I'm less tense about dropping it now, I'm still careful.  Still, I drop it.  Otterbox saves it every time.  Nothin!  No damage at all!- Buy the damned thing.  You'll thank yourself.Signed,A really cheap bastard.
5	1367798400	I bought this for my work issued cell phone an it is excellent. Covers every tiny space where dust could enter and allows for an easy grip in your hand. It does make the iPhone 5 slightly bulky, but I felt the phone was very slick and easily lost in my purse before. I highly recommend the Otter Box!
3	1367798400	I give this item 3 stars since there is nothing exceptional packaging wise. It was what I expected it to be a case to protect my phone from scratches and damage from being dropped.
5	1367712000	This case is exactly what i was looking for.  Dropping your phone is no longer a problem with this case.  5 stars.
3	1367712000	I bought this item for my wife since she is notorious for breaking iPhones. First, I wanna say that you need patience.  If not for breaking a couple of finger nails everything is all good. Once you break open the box the rest is easy and it comes with a holster. I wouldn't recommend this to probably seniors and someone with weak hands. Great buy otherwise!  My wife's phone is in great shApe after many falls. The box is in top form since Xmas 2012.
5	1367625600	I purchased one of the OtterBox Defender Series Cases for my iPhone 5 and it paid for itself the first day.  I had the OtterBox installed for about 3 hours when I dropped my phone getting out of a pickup truck onto concrete.  Not even a scratch on the case or phone.  I have no doubt without the case I would have been purchasing a new phone!  Worth the money.
5	1367625600	Took 2 days to get here, it's cheap and legit. It has protected my case when I dropped it and it is very stylish.
5	1367625600	I had resisted buying the Defender on last last three phones but after breaking my second Otterbox Commuter on my iPhone 5, I decided it was time for the added protection. The case does make the sleekness of the phone go away but it is well protected. I couldn't be happier with the fact that my phone is safe in this case and it was $30 cheaper for the exact same one that the local retailers sell.
5	1367539200	I bought this for my son - hoping he wouldn't break this one!!  So far so goodI would recommend this product. Shipping was as stated.He's very happy too!
1	1367366400	Very disappointed with this case ! I used to have my phone in a regular hard plastic case and never had any problems. My friends all told me that this was the best case to get so I ordered it. The first day i had my phone in the case my screen cracked. I didn't even drop it or anything it just cracked diagonally across then entire screen. I do not recommend this case to anyone.
4	1367280000	charger works as advertised the best part is that the flat cable works much better than other coil type cords plug the charger in the center console close the top and away you go
4	1367280000	very bulky but does its job and protects the phone very well screen cover is a bit flimsy but again does its job
2	1367280000	it ripped, and i never once dropped it or did anything to it. also, otter box comes with screen cover which is difficult to use when you are trying to press applications to open, or to text. hated it.
5	1367193600	The best protection for my iPhone. So much less money than all the new kids on the block. Amazons price was more than half off retail.
5	1367107200	I now have 4 of these cases and love them! No matter how much I have dropped my phone the case kept it safe!
4	1367107200	This is my first Otterbox and I love how protected my phone feels, but the screen that comes with it seems to hinder the touch sensitivity of the iPhone.  So that I'll have to put the phone to sleep and back awake again to get the touch screen to work right.  Happens maybe once a day, so I haven't done anything about it, but I was thinking I could cut away the screen and just put a screen protector on the phone.
2	1367020800	This may be made by otterbox I am unsure but the quality as compared to the version I purchased from Verizon is totally horrible. The seller did offer some advice but it did not work and I didnt have time to attempt to return the item so my loss
5	1366934400	You cannot beat this price for an otterbox!  Considering buying a few more because I am saving so much money.
4	1366934400	This is a great product for the iphone5. It adds some bulk and weight to the phone but the protection is undeniable. You can throw this things against the wall and it will be ok. Be warned though - my first otter box case I received from amazon was definitely fake. I noticed that the silicone case was stretched out and no longer was contour to the plastic case. I notified amazon and they sent me a new one without any fuss or my knowledge. I sent an e-mail and the next thing I know they sent me a new case in the mail. HOW TO TELL IF ITS FAKE - the fake retail package is smaller then an authentic otter box package. Its was a yellow but compared to the real thing it was a darker yellow - otter box is bright yellow. The OTTER BOX SEAL on the fake just repeats the otter box name - the REAL THING will repeat the logo in a way that the O matches up and makes a diagonal line. Where the apple logo shows in the back the fake will be missing a plastic covering that covers the apple logo. The fake has excess silicone and feels more like rubber and has a grip feel to it. The real thing is more of a hard silicone with a smoother texture. The edges of the case are slightly raised - on the fake one they are NOTICEABLY raised. If your product stretches out, its a fake. The HOME key on the silicon is an indented square. The fake there is barely an indent and requires more effort to push it down as there is excess material all around the whole thing. Be aware. When its good, its great.
5	1366934400	The iPhone cover and protector is strong and elegant at the same time. The varieties of colors is outstanding. Excellent price!!!
5	1366934400	The size is big makes your iPhone 5 huge. but it's protecting it. offering you a full protect.no more worries about my iPhone 5 falling on the ground or even when it's on my pocket my case.This case is really amazing but makes the iPhone 5 huge as I said, but protect it for you keeping it as safe as you wish.
4	1366761600	The OtterBox Defender is a great iPhone case.  It's not too heavy and bulky and certainly protects your phone upon dropping.  My only issue is the screen cover has a slight rainbow effect thus making the screen not as clear.  I've tried removing the case and cleaning the screen but within a few days the rainbow returns.
5	1366675200	This product is bulky, but it protects my iphone from my work environment. This is my 5th Otterbox Defender and I don't trust anything else.
5	1366675200	This is a great shield lol it came with a plastic case you put on the phone than the rubber outside case. The rubber case was not as hard very rubbery. The down fall was the screen it had bubbles on it really hard to focus on pictures or videos. I just ripped it out. problem solved
5	1366588800	This case have made my iphone very resistent to impact and all this time I have have it nothing has break.Considering that a 2 years old kid toss it around that is a lot.Consider:- It is a hard case not very practical to removal.
5	1366588800	Awesome product and works great, belt clip I just broke after months of use, but was my fault trying to get out the car I got on on seat belt so now buying extra belt clip. I have dropped this phone several times and the Otter Box has worked really good. Highly recommend it...
5	1366588800	I really love this otterbox.  It is thicker than I expected. It has a screen protector and two pieces to the case for extra protection.
2	1366502400	Got Otter Case for iphone5 three months ago.  At the time, Otter was the best rated iphone5 protective case on the market.  The main access button needs to be pressed very firmly to get phone to respond.  I dealt with that.  But the real disappointment was after just 3 months of moderate use, the outer silicone casing started to stretch out, away from the hard inner casing.  It now gaps and no longer fits snuggly.
3	1366329600	very hard to take apart before you put around your phone....but I guess that's why it's an otter box.  Just bulky.
5	1366243200	I love my otterbox for my phone. It protects it leaving me less worried about the phone braking.  The clip is ok.  But with or without it its cool.
5	1366156800	I have purchased several ottorboxes from local retailers and never had a problem. When I received the case, the screen protector was all scratched. I send it back and purchased one from my local retailer and it was perfect as expected. Be careful?
1	1366156800	The outside skin is to hard which leaves it to slick and let's it slip out of your hand.  It is difficult to use the home button not exactly sure why but you have to press really hard to get it to work (and it's not the phone, it works fine outside this case).  The dock connector cover doesn't latch and will likely break off soon anyway because you have to bend it all the way to the back of the phone in order to get the charger plugged in and out because the hard plastic part of the case extends down to far and makes it virtually impossible get a grip on the charger plug.  Will likely sell this thing in the garage sale and replace it with something else
5	1366156800	This is the sturdiest case ever. I have absolutely no fears that my new phone is protected from every day hazards.  I like the way it looks, too.
4	1366156800	The product looks like it made real well and should last a while.  We were very happy it showed up on time.
5	1365984000	The case for my iphone 5 is great. Slim yet durable w/no worries when my phone 'falls' out of my hands :)
1	1365984000	Too bulky...i returned it! But i think it'll protect the phone if it fell from the heaven. Perfect phone protector for construction guys.
5	1365897600	phone company wanted twice the price....great deal for a great product  Like the grey color due to the work wear I have is very formal...and now my phone isn't an extra distracting polka dot gizmo...but a tool....  thank you
1	1365811200	the iphone 5 doesn't fit into this product I'm still looking for the older version of the defender series for my iphone 5
1	1365811200	I was disappointed upon delivery because my iphone 5 wouldn't even fit in the case!  Took it to a Sprint store and they tthought it was a fake, too.  Thank God for Amazon - returned it and refunded it on the double!
4	1365811200	bulky, but protective.  edges where the belt clip connect fray up, otherwise very good product.  bought lifeproof to replace it.
3	1365811200	I would love to rate the Defender series cover however that was not the one I received. I received the &#34;Commuter&#34; series one. Which is very nice too, but the wrong one.
4	1365724800	Case is super.  Belt clip & case.........not so much.  Rubber edge on box gets caught in latch area every time.  The case gives phone a man size feel, controls all work well.  Belt clip or phone case edge need some work to be a quallity piece.
1	1365724800	When I received this item was bigger and didn't fit my iPhone, then I had to buy another one on the store, so I have to spend more money.
5	1365638400	Worth every penny. Protects the phone like it needs to be, makes us very comfortable to carry it around daily
3	1365638400	i liked the price of the product and that it came so quickly. the home button does seem to be too firm, maybe the cap was too big or it was too thin. the problem is that the home button for the case requires me to press harder than i should. (i bought two and one works fine but this one is a hard press).
5	1365552000	OtterBox.  Need I say more?  Love the cushy plastic casing.  Provides less slippage off surfaces, and if you do drop it, the outside material cushions the fall.  A perfect fit.  Would not buy any other brand.
2	1365552000	when I first got this case is was almost perfect. It had a super tight fit, didnt move or anything. only complain I had at first was that the covers over the headphone jack and the vibe/sound switch was extremely hard to pull if i wanted to reach them and then when I did want to use the headphone jack I found the slot was covered up soo much that my headphones wouldn't even plug in. so I had to take out the phone from the case several times cause i frequently use the jack. after having removed the case a few times I noticed when I put it back on that the covering loosened up but also that the rest of the case was stretching out. the bottom was completely not even on the case anymore except for the button and the top left corner was hanging way off! no way to shrink it back to normal size so I got constant debris and lint and dirt inside the case due to this. needless to say, I trashed the case and bought a new one from another company. I don't know what happened. I had an otter box case for my first iPhone 3GS and other than the watermarks on the screen it was perfect. this one was less so.. very disappointed so be wary when ordering this. it's not made for use with normal headphones or earplugs so if u dont use them then this case serves it's purpose to protect. if u remove the case after putting it on once, the integrity is a total joke!
5	1365552000	Otterbox's are ugly but it does exactly what its supposed to do! My baby can toss my phone all around and it's perfectly fine!
5	1365465600	Easy and Convenient! I love the product. It is an excellent choice for phone case.Very user friendly. Also easy to switch out case.
5	1365379200	Best case. It protects your iPhone like no other case. I had broken two screens prior to getting this case.
4	1365379200	Ordered my iphone 5 case. It arrived promptly. It does make you phone bulky but is worth the protection! It also came witha belt clip.
3	1365379200	i bought this case on sale, wouldn't pay full price for one.  its solid and protects the phone well.  the down sides:the outer silicone is sticky to cloth, so the phone is difficult to get in and out of pockets.the hard shell is very difficult to remove once it is put onthe built-in screen protector quickly got cloudy and scuffed up, much more so than a regular stick-on one
1	1365292800	After purchasing one Otterbox case for my iPhone 5, I was more than happy to order one for my wife.. Until it arrived...It is not the same product that I purchased prior,. It is flimsy, and not as durable as the Otterbox case that I previously purchased. It has the Otterbox name on it, but it is clearly not the same product.
4	1365206400	It was definitely secure, but a bit too secure. It was hard to open the cord and side switch. Case works great to protect phone when dropped, but I ended up cutting off the bottom and side flap panel so I had easy access to the charge port and switch
5	1365206400	Very good cover for my iPhone I drop it a lot and this cover is the best on the market.
5	1365206400	Very good deal and comes with the snap case for your waist can't beat this deal love it u should get u one
5	1365206400	I love it. It really protect my iPhone 5 . Is more that I expected. I truly recommended. :) L
5	1365120000	I am pleased with the durability and protection the Otterbox provides.  I would highly recommend this product to others. The 3 part protective case is definately worth the price.
2	1365033600	screen bubbles are awful but does protect the phone. The case is very nice I though for the iphone but could be better.
5	1365033600	I can't imagine any more protection with style.  I feel like I could bounce my Iphone 5 off the ground and it would be safe.
4	1365033600	love this case. I have dropped my iphone multiple times & its still in tip top shape. a little bulky but would the protection!
4	1365033600	The phone actually bounces if dropped and it's easy to use within the case. The only downside is the rubber makes it very difficult to slide into a pocket
3	1365033600	I like the OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 because it keeps my iPhone safe and the design is new and slick but the with the case on, my iPhone is harder to use. The screen doesn't respond as well and it is a lot slower.
4	1364947200	This case does what it is meant to do, protect my iPhone 5.  I have very little issues typing with it (as I have bot the screen protector from the case as well as left the one already on my phone on,) I had to get used to pressing the screen just a very little bit harder, but now I have no issues.  Of course, the case is bulky, but that is something to expect when getting a case like this.  The belt clip holster is nice, as you can use it as a stand as well if you watch Netflix or movies on.  A very solid case that I would recommend to anyone.
5	1364947200	I was happy with the product however it does not fit when I have an otter box on my phone.
5	1364947200	The Price was great the product is good quality. Very happy with it. Much lighter then the other otter boxes.
1	1364860800	I am very disappointed! After having the OtterBox case only 4 months it no longer fits the phone. The rubber material is has stretched out of shape even though I am very careful with the case & my phone. Very poor quality!
5	1364774400	This is the best I Phone case you can buy. I highly recommend everyone with an I Phone 5 get one.
4	1364774400	cons: I don't like how big this case is, wish they made more colors & designs on these. still manage to get a lot of dust inside it.pros: I like the built in screen protector, & port covers. I purchased this mainly to protect my phone from myself after dropping it a few times & it seems the case is doing it's job well.All in all I like it, just wish it wasn't so big.
5	1364774400	I give otter box two thumbs up for doing its job! It came with the right color which the picture shows and easy to put it on and off.
4	1364774400	I love my new OtterBox Case. This case came very quick in the mail. I had it I my hands in a matter of days. I am very satisfied with the color and durability with this case. The only thing is my belt clip broke with in a matter of days after I received it. But OtterBox sent me a new belt clip after I sent pictures of the broken one. I ordered the belt clip from OtterBox not Amazon and it took a while to receive it (at least a week). Just beware of the belt clip!!!!
5	1364601600	The business was a very Fast shipper. The product was exactly what I wanted and it arrived in brand new packaging
1	1364601600	The outer part of the case ripped poor quality . Buyer beware . Only had it for a month . Now I have to purchase another .
5	1364515200	I love this cover. It provides maximal protection for a very reasonable price. I've had a Lifeproof case, but once I upgraded I knew I had to go back to the otterbox. They have great products and a great warranty policy. Never getting another phone case!
3	1364515200	The case has a mark on the window where the Apple symbol will show on the back of the phone.  I offers great protection but be careful with using the clip.  The portion that snaps on the phones starts chipping the rubber on the case.
5	1364515200	Very, very nice product. If my iPhone 5 can make a comment on this, it would say, &#34;thank you otterbox, awesome protection&#34;. Of course nothing less than five stars for this product. After looking at other iPhone 5 protection items, this tops them all. Like they say, it is three layers. They mean it. With an expensive phone to protect I would take the extra step to protect it and Otterbox made this decision easy. I like the belt clip and how you can easily adjust it from horizontal to vertical and it is secured to your belt. Thanks.
2	1364428800	The Otterbox case works fine for protecting the phone, however I've had to take the case off a few times and the rubber bumper is all stretched out now.
5	1364428800	it works like a champ.  My wife broke the screen on her 2 week old iphone 5 so i got this to keep the replacement phone safe.  So far, so good.
1	1364428800	I bought this item and it was shipped from a retailer called Plethora7. I had never seen an Otterbox prior to this, but my sister and 4 other friends had told me to get an Otterbox because it was the best protection for my new iPhone 5. My sister had ordered her Otterbox on Amazon as well, but from a different retailer, and in a different color.When I received my order, it was in the Otterbox packaging that I had seen at the Sprint store, so no red flags there. I proceeded to put it on my phone at that point. The white box was fine, but the clear plastic screen protector seemed loosely fit into the white casing, and no matter how many times I wiped the screen, it kept sticking to my phone and leaving this oily, black, bubble under the surface...weird. Also, the grety outer cover was very flimsy and too big for the white casing. The portion that goes over the main home buttom kept popping out. All the while I thought this was normal, because I had never actually touched and felt the real thing.Low and behold, after a month of using this case, my sister came to visit me from out of town, and she looked at my case and immediately was like &#34;This is a FAKE!&#34;....So when I saw her Otterbox, I realized how different mine was, and that it is a cheap knock-off....I would be very weary of purchasing this Otterbox again from Plethora7. Although my sister got hers on Amazon too, and hers was real (from a different retailer though)....I would report Plethora7 to Amazon for fraud, but I don't see where I can do that other than leaving this awful review....I ended up buying the real thing from the mall for the normal $49.99.....and returned the fraudulent one back to Amazon....
5	1364428800	This product is perfect! It does exactly what it's supposed to do and is very sturdy and protects your phone completely. It's just too bulky for me. All my friends have these for their phones and love it. So this became a gift to one of them that didn't have one. They absolutely love it. Thank you!
5	1364428800	This case offers extra protection for those who find them selves constantly on the go, and needing a bit more protection than a simple scratch guard.
4	1364342400	Since having this case my phone has been dropped multiple times on various surfaces and there's not a scratch on it. I had the  Griffin Survivor Case for my iPhone 4, which also held up amazingly well, but it was much bulkier than the OtterBox Defender and harder to get in and out of my bag. The Defender has a slimmer design which makes it easier to hold and slip into my pocket or bag. I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because the tabs aren't easy to open (power cable, mute, etc). If you have no nails it may be difficult. Otherwise, it's a great case!
3	1364256000	The silver lining looks good but there is a white lining around the inside of the protective clear plastic cover that is not attractive at all.However, construction quality is excellent but once you put your phone in it, good luck trying to get it out....
5	1364256000	Of course this case is great. It's an otterbox. I wish they had more colors to match the ipad cases.
3	1364256000	The case is durable, and has great colors but for some reason there seems to be something wrong with the cover. Theres a gasoline looking effect on the screen. I have taken it apart and cleaned it, and it goes away but then it comes back within a few hours. I haven't seen this issue with any other otterbox's. Maybe thats what I get for $25... I'm not sure. I would like to email the seller direct, I'm sure they would probaby replace it. Does anyone know how I can contact them directly?
3	1364256000	This is a great case, but the port or the headphone jack is a bit annoying.. Overall it was a good case.
5	1364083200	Everything was fast, accurate and perfect. No problems here. this is easy to recommend and I would definitely use again.
5	1363910400	great case for the phone.had to put some baby powder under the protective screen though so it doesnt stick to the actual phone screen.
2	1363910400	I am not fully convinced that this is a genuine OtterBox case.I have multiple friends that own OtterBox cases and the rubber shell on mine feels a lot different compared to theirs. The rubber on this otter box is more flimsy and stretchy that on my friends.This product does however fit the phone and work as intended. I just am not 100% on the authenticity.
5	1363737600	I've had this a while now and love it. It's super hard (not rubbery like the black one) and very strong. My i-phone 5 is safe. I've dropped it a bunch and this thing is a life saver.The little tabs covering the headphone jack and charge slip were hard to open at first, but over time it's gotten easier. I actually like that they're so strong they don't weaken easily.The only negative is that one of my i-phone 4 charge wire adapters doesn't fit through the opening. Some of them do though.
5	1363737600	I bought 3 of different colors because they are just so cheap from China. I hate to support China, but Staples has these for over $30. C'mon!!!  You just have to wait like 10 days when ordering anything from overseas.My cat loves to chase the light. How fun is that?!They make great stocking stuffers and my contractor loves it (I gave one to him). He can walk around and point stuff out to his subs.It arrived in a small, padded, brown envelope in perfect condition. This thing is a heavy metal and feels like a super high quality. Don't hold back, they're too much fun to play with.
5	1363651200	well i have to say that this is a very nice and protection cover for my iphone 5 and more important is a very nice price Thanks
1	1363651200	this disapoints me on two ends one an american company is losing millons through a suppoded reputible company the other is that as a consumer i was ripped off and they said it was a fluke and my otter box would be replaced by anotherand guess what other was a fake also DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT I WARN YOU CHEAP CHINA NKNOCK OFFwilliam make a video for YouTube update tomorrow
4	1363651200	OtterBox always makes a great case for a good price.  It does turn the slim, streamlined iphone into something a bit bigger and bulkier but that is the nature of the product.  Our older Defenders have never broken or let us down.
5	1363651200	Love this case. Protects my phone very well and I like the gray/ white color scheme. Wish they would come out with some more girly colors and/or some college colored cases.
3	1363651200	I had an Iphone 4 and upgraded to 5 and was disappointed with the outter case, it's rubber and shows wear much faster than my old one ever did.
2	1363651200	The design has issues with the holster "wearing out" the rubber where it clips in and out.The grey color tens to turn a greenish color after regular usage.
5	1363564800	is greatThis was recommend to my by others. It was easy to put on. thak you the shiped very fast.
5	1363564800	This is so light weight. I am so glad I bought it. It was exactly what I was looking for.
5	1363564800	I have purchased 3 otter boxes in the past 6 months.  No problems so far.  Have an otter box for my IPad also.
5	1363564800	I love it! Was not expecting it to be white on the inside! It is great though! Thank you! Awesome!
5	1363478400	i love otterbox defender series. i wouldn't buy any other brand for my past phones. i like the built in screen protector in this version. it adds a little bulk but definitely worth the great price i caught it at.
5	1363392000	This is my third Otterbox.  The first one fell off the roof of my car at a busy intersection.  When I noticed it missing twenty minutes later and returned to the place where I had dismissed a strange clunk; I spotted it in the turn lane. I waited for the light so I could dash into the intersection to retrieve the pieces, and was surprised to find the case intact.  I was more surprised when I turned the phone on and it worked. It has worked ever since.  I broke piece of my second Otterbox off, closing the cover for the charging port the wrong way; and when I reported the break to Otterbox they replied with a new cover in two colors. The Defender is not cheap, and it is a tad bulky, but for this klutz it is the only cover!
5	1363392000	My main purpose in purchasing this case was to protect my phone.  It does a good job.  The phone isn't sleek looking, but it is protected.  The cutouts are all perfectly aligned an I have no problem with plugging it into the charger.
4	1363305600	This case provides great protection especially with a 1 year old and 8 year old.  The screen cover sticks to the phone screen (iPhone5) causes oil slicks.  Otter sent me a video on how to use baby powder to prevent this irritation but I have yet to get the right amount of powder to prevent slicks or too much powder for a dirty looks.
5	1363219200	that my glass will shatter, as it did with my last phone, with the OtterBox Defender protecting my new I Phone 5.  It is a bit bulky, yes, but so well-made.
5	1363219200	its bulky but tough I love it...most of the time it has a grippy exterior which is a double edged sword great sometimes and annoying other times.
5	1363219200	love my case. It protects my iphone well. Also like the quality, it looks like it's a very durable ottorbox, well hopefully
5	1363046400	Wanted to protect my new iphone 5 and nothing less than the defender would do.  Easy to put on and take off.
5	1363046400	I love it! I love the color as well. I was told it looks very professional + that's a good things since I work @ a school.
5	1363046400	i am enjoying this everyday.  great feel, really nice protection and bot clip is a major plus.  I recommend this case over others
5	1363046400	Its a really nice case!!! The only thing is that it will add some bulk to your phone but I feel more comfortable with my phone not always worried about dropping it or scratching the screen when i put it in my pocket with my keys!
5	1362960000	The case is very durable and purposeful as was stated in the description before the purchase. Very Satisfied with the case.
5	1362873600	Great protection for a great price.  I really wanted a case with a built in battery.  But the iphone 5 was just too new and no one had a case that really protected the phone.  Really like the water resistant design and the cover over the screen, something that is lacking on most cases.  The market finally developed a pretty good iphone case with a battery but it does not have the protection this case provides.  Other Otter cases are pretty extreme, practically needing a crowbar to remove the case, and doubling the size of the phone.  This case is a nice happy medium
5	1362873600	I ordered the exact case from another seller in November 2012. That case and holster only survived a month. This case arrived on time and fit perfectly contrary to the previous case. I've made a note of this seller and will definitely use them in the future.
3	1362873600	Good overall protective case, but very bulky. Have screen projector on also. Debris gets stuck between that & built in clear plastic protective front. So ended up cutting out clear plastic front, much better now.
5	1362787200	Works well. Original 17 more words to do for this it is a pain this review takes too long. Blah
5	1362700800	Love this case! It protects my phone really good. I work outdoor and I'm constantly dropping my phone. I've drop my several times since I've put this case on and not a single starch on it.
3	1362700800	They did way better on this Iphone 5 defenders than the 4 and 4s.  I have had a defender case on all my iphones dropping them I know they will be fine. The only reason I am giving it a 3 they shipped me the wrong one. I paid for the glaciar and they gave me pink camo.
5	1362614400	Great product!  Protects my phone from me (I'm really clumsy), my 3 year old (hitting, stepping and dropping), my puppy that loves to chew, and liquid spills (not submerged) several times.Picks up lint a little and I can't seem to get everything from under the screen (there's a hair or a spot left every time I try to fit it) but otherwise it's great!  Would buy multiple times over!
1	1362614400	I was looking for an adapter to use on my alarm clock.  I thought this was the solution and ordered.I understand that there are bad products and even bad batches.  (Another product I ordered from a different company didn't work either, but they immediately apologized and sent me a working replacement).  This product never worked.  EVER- even the &#34;working&#34; replacement.  I had to contact the seller multiple times in order to get one replacement.  When it also didn't work, I searched for the company online and found a phone number for the Florida location.  I am guessing it's a home business.  The lady didn't answer as the company, she was rude and believed that I was lying about her product not working.  I told her I wanted a refund or a working product and asked her to test it before sending. She said that she would, but it's been about a month I would guess and I have yet to receive a replacement product, a refund or an acknowledgement of my frustration.  I finally resorted to Amazon's A-to-Z guarantee.Thank you Amazon for the guarantee!  This company is a joke- don't even waste your time and money!  If I find a working replacement, I'll edit my post.
5	1362614400	Sold as advertised, came in the unopened box. Great product., and fit my phone. Ten out of ten. Would buy again.
5	1362528000	I bought this case for my last phone on SALE at Walmart  for $40 and it lasted well beyond the life of my phone. The fact that I just bought it for around $20 NEW on Amazon for my new Iphone5 is amazing, seeing how they are $55 at Best Buy right now. It came NEW IN THE BOX and does a great job protecting my IPHONE5 when running around bartending like a madman.
5	1362528000	Excellent product, great price and fast shipping from this vendor. Great material...much better than an excellent Ottorbox case for an older iTouch. Great protection....sure it hides the slim, great looks of the iPhone....but still smaller than many Android phones...Ottorbox makes trimmer cases...as do others, but as much as I drop cell phones....this is the case for me.
4	1362528000	The case fits fine and does what it is supposed to but...The case Started to peel around the Apple in the back after a few months of having it. So it looks a little weird. And also there is a little space between the screen and the screen protector attached to the otterbox. My sister does not have that space and is not peeling. She got the pink one. But other then that, I have dropped my phone about 3 times from about my hip area to the hard ground and my phone has not broken :) I do recommend this :)
5	1362528000	This is a great cover.  I bought it for my husband who wanted a durable and yet nice looking case
2	1362441600	This was just really clunky, and the protector screens provided in the frame were not good. Would not recommend. I'm sure it would protect my phone, but the thing is a tank.
3	1362441600	Heavy duty case but for the same reason you might not want to put this case on if for any reason you may need to remove it. It's tedious to take the case off and you can forget using a standard line input jack. Other than that great case!
5	1362441600	I really like the product. It was shipped and I received it very fast. It's actually better than I thought it would be.
3	1362441600	Having used an Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 3G and iPhone 4 and being very happy with those cases I expected the same from the iPhone 5 Defender case but was disappointed.Pros- Protects the phone as advertised- Love the color and new material (Alpine Case)Cons- Once the plastic shell is put on, it is quite difficult to open and take off- The top plastic shell when put on creates bubbles caused by static electricity. I contacted Otterbox about this and they said that if you apply baby powder to the plastic film it should solve the problem. Once I tried the baby powder, the bubbles did go away, but why should I have to put baby powder on a case to fix a problem? This never happened with any previous versions of the Defender Series.- The holster is not as secure as the holster for the iPhone 4 Defender Series case.Recommendation...I don't think it is worth the money when you have to put baby powder on the screen to remove static electricty. But since I paid less than half of retail... Sure why not.
5	1362355200	Otterbox fixed some major flaws in this model over the model for the 4s.  The biggest problem was that the bottom rubber portion on the 4s continually got warped.  They fixed that by making the bottom portion mostly plastic.  It is actually thinner than the 4s model as well.  I love it!
5	1362355200	been looking for a reasonable priced one for my iphone 5 and found it here.  They have a good variety of colors.
4	1362355200	The case was perfect the delivery was quick and  the phone fit the case perfectly, I am going to order one for my daughter.
5	1362355200	This service was expedient and excellent. I actually received it a couple of days before I expected to. My 1st iPhone 5 was broken with a different case. Now I feel 300% safer!
5	1362355200	with this OtterBox, I believe my iPhone is safe from even me.  No more worry about inadvertently dropping the phone when distractedly attempting to shove phone into my pocket while running to meetings.
5	1362268800	Works very well, doesn't make you iPhone look ugly, fits so there aren't little pieces not fitting where they should, and it has a built in screen protector that does not hinder touch sensitivity in the least, and the best part is that the screen protector doesn't cause all of those annoying bubbles on your screen. Recommended by me.
4	1362268800	We purchased this product as protection for a new phone.  Although it has not been put to a serious test, it certainly appears capablle of meeting the challenge. It tends to temper the otherwise elegant look of the phone, but I suppose that has to be expected.  Until we know better, we will view this as an acceptable choice of function over form.  For what it is, the glacier white/gray color of this Defender is about as attractive as could be expected.The only reasonable complaint might be that the protective cover for the phone screen produces a sort of "wet, bubble" discoloration; the manufacturer website provides a remedy that offers an improvement, if not a final solution.
4	1362268800	This is a great phone cover.  I never worry about dropping my iphone as I know it is secure.  It is well worth the price to protect a rather  expensive phone.  It was a little difficult to put on, but once I got it on the phone, I was pleased with the way all the buttons worked. I would recommend this product to everyone who values their iphone.
5	1362268800	I have never broken a cell phone or lost one and with this product, you are freer with your caution button and well, they are almost like insurance! You still have to remember where you place your cell phone, but at least if you sit on it or drop it, you need not worry as it would still be working inside this O-box deal! Five stars and I do not throw my phone just any ole time! Unless my big investment comes in and then I will try for the length of the driveway, but it is 600 feet long! Hey, this case would be the last one you buy as it will last as long as you keep up with your cell and its billing!
4	1362182400	Product arrived and is as advertised. I would definitely recommend it to others. I am enjoying it very much. A strong case and a easy to assemble.
1	1362182400	This otterbox was really hard to open and close. The screen protector got a lot of scratches on it right away. It rodent look authentic like my dad and my distress.
4	1362096000	If you don't want to end up having a $700 paper weight get this case. Great protection for your iPhone 5 with full use of functions. You can drop it, drive over it, just don't drop it in water.
2	1362096000	Well. I was excited because I heard good things about otterboxes. The good thing is that it protects very well. A friend was joking around and accidentally threw my phone into the wall, and it came out nearly unscathed. Thats pretty good. HOWEVER, the rubber outer part gets looser and looser EVERY day. Not its just floppy and hangs around the inner case. For me, that ruins it. Great protection but it looks hideous with the outer rubber just flopping around.
5	1362096000	It came in reasonable and I just love those item and they did give a good details for this item.
3	1362096000	Love Otter Box. Got this one for my husband as I have one, but it's made out of different material. This one seems very durable, but it's really hard to press the home button which is annoying.
5	1362009600	even though this case is very bulky and thick but this case provides amazing protection when dropped and provides the best protection for your phone you love so much.
5	1362009600	Exactly what I expected. Fast delivery.  I am so glad I joined the plan with two day free delivery. I live 25 miles from tow a. However I ordered wooing size. Amazon was great
5	1362009600	I got the otterbox quick and it is new as the add said it wasThanks alot . . .
2	1362009600	I got this case thinking that it would be much like the otterbox I had with my iphone 4, which I liked very much.  I can't even begin to explain how wrong I was.  The case is made cheaply, it has not broken but the way it was designed is hideous and non useable.  The cover for the volume has two ugly pieces of plastic that looks like they didn't waste their time to just connect them to make the case look more streamline.  Also the bottom is very flimsy and I feel like it will break very soon.  When I received the case I double checked on the otterbox website to ensure that it was not a fake...though it is not...it really should be to cover how awfully it was made.The worst part about the phone is how difficult it is to get the hard plastic case off...I have been trying for a few days and still fail, and the reason why this is a problem is because the screen protector is bubbling on my screen and I would love to fix it but I can not get it off to do so.  I have used a knife, and broken many finger nails in my attempt.
5	1362009600	Provides great protection to the iPhone. Phone is still easy to use. Not concerned about accidental drops. I would strongly recommend this item to anyone looking for solid protection and great functionality for their iPhone. I have no complaints at all. I am very satisfied with the defender. It really defends the iPhone.
4	1361923200	I drop my phone all the time, and this has kept it 100% safe every time.  Yes, it makes the phone bigger and I can't walk around with it in my pocket, but that's rarely an inconvenience.  My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the bottom section that opens and shuts for the charger never fully closes so there is always a &#34;flap&#34; sticking out. I've had two of them for my 4S and both did this. Still the best though!
1	1361923200	This case is very heavy & complicated to operate. It is very hard to open the chargining point as well as mute setting. It also create the gap between phone screen & cover screen that looks very bad. I am not satisfied with performance of case.
5	1361923200	I got the otter box during a promotion for a total of $17 (including shipping cost) for my i5 phone about a month now and my 5 & 6 years old has dropped the phone a couple of times after that without any damage to the phone and the otter box.  Therefore,  I give this product two thumps up and five stars.  I would highly recommend that you buy this for your i5 phone.
1	1361923200	I have another identical case but in a color I don't like but the case is vastly different. Don't know why but this one after 4 days of use the plastic screen cover has come loose (it's thin), the outer protector skin has a piece that has broken off (don't even use it, happened while trying to take apart to check what was wrong with the screen cover). Recommend getting it in person and checking the quality. THIS isn't the same as the other and I checked to ensure they were the same type, etc....FIGURED IT OUT!!! The good one is made in Mexico the crappy one is from China!!! Thanks Otter Box for poor quality and not being consistant! Consumer beware....
5	1361923200	I bought this OtterBox case for my best friend and she loves it. I had one myself for the iPhone 4 and when I finally decided to take the phone out of the case (which was after a good 2 years of wear and tear), my phone looked like it was just purchased that very same day. I naturally recommended this case to my friend but everywhere else was so expensive, so Amazon it was.
5	1361836800	the perfect iphone  5 protector. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..
5	1361836800	I have had this case on my phone for about four months now. This case has gone through some serious punishment with the phone inside such as dropping it off of a 20 ft bleacher onto concrete with no damage to the phone or the case and several times having it fall out of my pocket while on a run. I'm such a big fan of this case that I'm nervous to change. If you buy multiple cases of this design you can mix and match colors so you never get used to the same ones.
5	1361836800	This case has been great.  I have dropped my phone and this case protected phone.  Case arrived on time.  I would recommend.
5	1361836800	yeah it's thick but It never says its slim. so whoever buys it knows they're getting something thick. once you hold it in your hands for a couple minutes youl forget all about it. I've dropped it a couple of times and it really sounds like the padding works cuz of the thump. so 5 stars it is from me
5	1361836800	It makes the phone a little bulkier, but my phone is still in mint condition and I've dropped it multiple times
5	1361836800	I had an iPhone 4 for two years.  It lived in an OtterBox from day one.  When I traded the phone in, it was in pristine condition in spite of the fact that I'm fairly rough on a phone.  This new OtterBox is of the same design except sized for the iPhone 5.  I anticipate the same kind of protection for my new phone.
5	1361750400	This case works great for my iphone 5. Protects very well my cell phone. It's a hard cover inside and a soft cover outside. The screen protector is integrated with the cover. Better price in amazoon than any store.
4	1361750400	Good case - holds my new Iphone 5 pretty well.  So good in fact that I dropped it at the gym while one of those machines.  No cracks No scratchers no bumps.  If you got the money get it.My two issues are hard to overlook:1. THere is some problem with water - vapor or something - showing up between the otter box sheet and the iPhone 5 face.  when the iphone is on it isn't noticible but turned off it is.  I take it apart from time to time and wipe it down.  Not sure how to stop it or why it is there but it is.The other issue is the rubber stopper part the needs to be pulled out to turn the ringer off and on.  Getting it off at first took a loooong time until I used a key to poke it out.  It's annoying and so from time to time I miss calls because  the ringer is off.But other than that it is a good case.
5	1361750400	Great Cover.Regarding the window moire pattern (looks like it is wet between the underside of the window and face of the iphone.)  Simply cured thanks to Otterbox excellent Technical Support who said the pattern is caused by static electricity.Simply clean Otterbox and iPhone windows with lens cleaner and a lens cloth.  Allow to completely dry.  Sprinkle a very small amount (I repeat-very small.  I used a very small pinch between my fingers.  Held fingers about 6&#34; above screen and allowed to drift down onto the screen) amount of talcum or baby powder on the iPhone face, blow off.  I couldn't see any powder on the screen but after assembly and 1 week later, the pattern has failed to reappear.)
4	1361664000	Works great. Protected phone from drops. Only complaint is front plastic screen scratches easily. It's attached to case so can't replace just screen protector without buying a new case
4	1361664000	Way too bulky, but certainly seems to provide protection.  If I was mountain climbing, I would use this case, otherwise I like other units.
3	1361664000	The issue the user of the phone has is that you can't access the aux cord to use it for music.With the cover on, the aux cord used in the vehicle, you cant make full connection or push the cord in all of the way.Some head phones work depending on the size of the connector.To have to take the case off everytime, especially an Iphone, which is used for music as much as the phone, nowhe's not using the case, which is a waste of money.Trying to resell the case..
4	1361577600	got this product for a friend and he loves it. This quality is great and otterbox did a great job.
1	1361577600	I should have received a case that was gray and white, they decided to send a case that was gray with a pinkish picture of woods on the back. I was going to return it until my daughter said her friend had one and she wanted the case. I am pretty sure this is a fake case. It's missing some protection (the speakers aren't completely covered and the front and back cameras are left exposed.) the picture doesn't look the same as the cases in the store. For half the cost I believe it's sturdy enough to protect in case of a fall.
5	1361577600	I had an Otter Box Defender for my 4 and the outside rubber wore out very easy. This case has a stronger/thicker rubber layer and I love it.  Kids have dropped it a few times and I don't worry about it because this case really protects it!  Awesome case!
4	1361491200	Good price the color that I wanted met my expectations good quality good niceI was satisfy with it thanks
5	1361491200	This product was exactly as described and works very well. Will definitely consider this product in the future for other products.
5	1361491200	This case is very thorough in its coverage and has been able to withstand the drops of my toddler wtith ease.
4	1361491200	My son really likes the protection this product gives his phone.  It was delivered quickly and as described.  He also considered the Griffin Defender.
4	1361491200	Like any other Otter case it gives your phone a lot of shock protection and a very good screen cover that is responsive and does not change what you see.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cover for the charger port.  It puts a pretty good bit of pressure on your charger cable when plugged in.  I am slightly concerned this will cause problems over the long run.  I have considered cutting it off but decided to bend it back a long way and try to 'condition' it to not put so much pressure on the charge connector.Note that the unit does add some splash protection but it is not waterproof. It does not alter your sound but that brings up a potentially significant flaw - plugging in certain audio plugs will not work - for example the Dre/monster Studio headphones I have use a 90 degree plug that goes into an iPhone and it simply will not work with the Otter defender.  If this is not a big deal to you or you are willing to get a headphone cable that has a straight connector then its no big deal.  If not the Defender is a deal breaker for you.
1	1361404800	Had an otterbox for my iPhone4 and LOVED it. Immediately bought one for the iPhone5 and it is the worst piece of junk.It is too rigid and impossible to use with the phone as the rubber/plastic is simply too tight to use the buttons. Terrible dissapointment
5	1361404800	Excellent case very strong with glass protection . Available in different colors , very good price I highly recommend .
2	1361318400	Its too big for everyday use. I imagine a construction worker with this one. Someone with huge hands that has a risk of running the phone over with a truck... Check out the commuter line. Much better for every day use.
5	1361318400	A little bulky, but I knew that when I bought the case. Protects my phone wonderfully. Now I don't have to worry about dropping and breaking my phone.
5	1361318400	I Love the otterbox defender cases and this is no exception-perfect fit and protects the entire phone including the screen.
5	1361318400	I've used the Otterbox Defenders for both my 4 and now 5.  I have yet to find another case that I would replace it with unless Otterbox comes out with something even better.
4	1361318400	These Otter case are great! I do not leave the house w out mine on my phone! I have dropped my phone a few times and thanks to these cases....my Iphone is fine:) Hurray!
5	1361318400	Since getting my otterbox, I have ready dropped my iphone 5 three times. My phone is completely undamaged due to the protective casing.
5	1361232000	defender series is a great case never slips fully secured.occasinally you may want to take it off to clean the speaker area and rear camera lens that are exposed.recommend this case series to everyone.
5	1361232000	I bought this on a recommendation from friends. It certainly works well as I have dropped my iPhone 5 twice now. It does add considerable bulk to the phone as it's pretty thick but once again it's certainly up to the task of protecting your phone. It's very easy to install too.
4	1361232000	The only thing I don't like about the Otterbox is that somehow air or moisture bubbles get in between the screen and protector. I researched how to diminish these and you simply have to squeeze the sides of the Otterbox so the screen protector puckers and releases the bubbles. T is just a temporary fix, but it is a very small problem compared to the benefits
4	1361232000	This case seems indestructible. I love it! The only problem is, that after taking it on and off my phone several times, the grey rubber layer stretches out and doesn't fit to the phone perfectly anymore. Still a great case and I have absolutely no regrets buying it especially because it is $60 in a store.
4	1361232000	So i got a iphone 5, my first iphone ever. So I spent alot of time looking at cases. What made me go with the otterbox defender is the following1. Screen protector- it isnt anything fancy but it does what it is meant to, keep the screen clean and scratch free2. The iphone is protected from the elements, some what3. The case does not keep me for using the phone, I can hear and people can hear me and I can operate the phone while it is in the case4. the case isnt that big, yes it is bigger than the iphone, but my old phone was a droid x which is way bigger so the size doesnt bother me. I like that the case feels beefy, strong like bull.So I got my case here on amazon and when I got it from A-Z retail or whatever they are called, I noticed that the home button was bad and didnt work real well and the screen protector had tiny little bubbles in it that made it look like crap when the screen was on.So, I brought the case to local otterbox retailer and they gave me a new one.So while the otterbox defender is a good case for keeping the iphone safe, I would think twice about getting it for than half off when it retails for 50.00 the one that i ordered off amazon was crap, this one is much much better.So all in all I would recommend this case. I usually take the phone out at night and use the case when I am outside of my home. Easy to get on and off once you get the nack for it
5	1361232000	Love it! They said I have to put 18 words so I'm doing it to fill space. I Love IT!!!!!!
5	1361232000	Love it! They said I have to put 18 words so I'm doing it to fill space. I Love IT!!!!!!
5	1361232000	I drop many things all the time. So far my latest OtterBox has saved my IPhone 5 screen twice. That's money in my pocket great.
5	1361232000	I have no complaints about this case just love it. I have dropped the phone a few times with no damage at all. This case has already proven to do what it is supposed to. If you are little careless then this is the case you need. Worth the investment. Can save you hundreds by not having to replace your phone. I would tell everyone to buy this case with confidence.
1	1361232000	I was only able to use the cable a couple of times then it did not work. A complete piece of cheap junk. Don't buy. Spend the extra money and get a quality cable.
1	1361145600	It is a fake !cloudy screen , controls on phone don't work good , cheap constructionDon't buy it! A rip off!
2	1361145600	I love otterbox products but this one really disappointed me!! The part that goes over the screen kept getting this weird mark on it in between the case and screen and it was really frustration!!  I took the phone out a few times and cleaned it thinking maybe the phone was dirty when I put it in, but that wasn't the case and no moisture was stuck inside either.  Totally just disappointed with the product!
3	1361059200	Like the color and feel of my product but there's a small defect with the Otterbox.  But it still able to go on my phone and I will use it....
4	1361059200	Very well designed well fitting case, and my phone snaps into it very nicely, although I have to take pains to make sure I don't catch a bit of my clothing between the phone and the case.  The belt clip works well too.Only some minor problems: (1) One or two of the protective flaps on the case are virtually impossible to pry open with a fingernail once they are pushed completely closed.  The worst of these for me is the one that covers the phone's ring/silence switch.  I resolved this by cutting that flap off.  (2) The screen protector certainly does its job but air bubbles do develop underneath mine and these cause a minor distraction.  But I am now used to the bubbles being there and generally there is no problem at all seeing all that I need to see on the phone's display.
2	1361059200	My friends said the Otter Box was great.  One friend had a purple one, and I tried hers. I thought it was quite good.  Then I ordered a grey one.  It looked the same, but was a little less expensive than the purple one.  It is so rigid and stiff that it makes my iPhone almost unworkable.  Also, I can't get the watery look off the surface of the phone.  I am really disappointed, and I just learned that the date for returning the Otter Box just expired.  Why does the color make a difference in the flexibility and usefulness of the product?  I just don't get it.
1	1361059200	Brought this 2 days ago, went to best buy and brought the same one and compared them two. Found out that the one on amazon is fake. The price is great but, over all I wouldn't recommend it. Spend a little more money and get the best
2	1360972800	Choose the &#34;otter&#34; one. Not this product. Dust will find its way on your iphone. Bumbed I spent my gift card on this.
5	1360972800	I chose the otterbox because it came highly recommended by all my children.It protects my phone very well.  I would recommend it to everyone.
4	1360972800	Just what I wanted for my cat's grave, although it is a little smaller than I had anticipated.  Really like it.
5	1360972800	It seems to protect my phone well. By the thickness of the materials, it is, of course, a little mor difficult to pus buttons or wake up the screen. I wouldn't trade it, though.
5	1360972800	I got the gray Otterbox Defender for my iphone 5 and I love it.  I got my daughter the pink and white iphone 5 Defender case.  Mine has a little more of a rubbery feel and a little softer.  I had had someone keep reaching for my phone the other day when I had it sitting on a stool saying I am scared it will slide off.  It stays put with that little bit of rubbery feel.  My daughter's is more slick and slides.  You have to really press on hers to hit the home key, mine is perfect. Didn't realize how much I loved it until I watched a friend of mine's phone go flying all around the car every time we turned.  My first OtterBox.  Love it.  The pink one doesn't fit as well.  Thinking about ordering her a different pink one because so happy with my gray one.  Maybe I got version 1 and she got version 2, not sure.Update on 7/22/2013. Still love my gray iphone 5 Otterbox Defender case.  Dropped it several times.  Just fine.  Has been an awesome case.  No issues with it.
5	1360886400	I love this case! It's protecting me from a costly mistake! It's bulky but that is what makes it effective!
3	1360886400	thew case itself is a great design and fits very well.  The case protects the phone from certain damage when dropped.  The belt holder has sharpe edges and needs a little refineing.  overall this is agood case for use when damage could occur at job sites, or work areas or accedentally dropped.
5	1360800000	Otterbox is the way to go for phone protection. It protects against drops for sure, thankfully. Plus the screen protector means my screen won't get worn out. Screen protectors are much easier to replace than iPhones.
1	1360800000	My case is ok but the clip broke after I used it twice. I hope I can get a new clip
4	1360713600	Rubber outer layer seems stiffer--better than the iPhone 4 model. I had several of those & the rubber always became loose & droopy. Solid case. Def the best protection of any case I've seen or tried. One downside is the screen protector degrades image quality & is especially dim in sunlight.
5	1360713600	I love this case.  I have peace of mind that my phone is well protected. It sits securely on my hip with the clip attachment.
3	1360713600	The only problem I had and I still have it, is the rainbowing and what look like wet spots under the glass of the case.  Called Otterbox and they admitted that they were having problems with the static electricity on the face of the Iphone 5.  Offered suggestions on how to get rid of the problem but it didn't seem to help.  The face also scratches easily.
4	1360713600	The best case I have bought for my iPhone. I have accidentally drooped my phone several time. No damage. Money worth spending.
1	1360713600	this is an older model.  current model has a protector to close the camera area.very disappointed.  recommend buying somewhere else.
5	1360713600	I ordered the OtterBox Defender Case for my new iPhone 5.  I travel extensively in my work, use my phone ALL the time which is complicated by the fact that I am also typically very hard on my phone (e.g. dropped at airports, rental car pickups, falling out of my pocket on a plane, etc.), so protection of my phone is critical.  Additionally, I need access to my phone's buttons and ports to quickly quiet it for a meeting, tether it,charge it, etc.The OtterBox case fits like a glove on my iPhone 5.  It went on fairly easily and there is no movement of the phone within the case, which based on the reviews, is being experienced by some other users.  I have already dropped the phone on my concrete garage floor with no damage to the phone or case.  Additionally, I have not experienced any impacts to the touch screen or buttons due to the case.  The only minor drawback is that the covers that protect the charging and headphone port are somewhat difficult to get off.  This I assume is by design but I still get the feeling I am going to break them off when I open them.  This is a minor thing though when compared to the protection and fit provided by the case.  A great case all the way around.
2	1360713600	I first questioned if it was authentic when I received it. The build quality is not of an otter box. The plastic case does not even clip together tightly although the rubber covers it. I've owned otter boxes for a few years now and this one just blew my mind that a company that used to sell high quality products are putting out this trash. Then again mine could just be a faulty case
3	1360713600	The case is good and sturdy , however it's such a tight fit in the case that the exterior of the case is ripping from just putting the phone in the holder.
3	1360713600	I am constantly cleaning the phone and case because dust and dirt enter the case. The case also has a really annoying rainbow bubble on the screen protector when the phone is in the case. I would recommend the case because the case still provides a lot of protection.
4	1360540800	real good case but plastic cover sticks to the screen leaving bubble marks. but other then that its good. looks just like in the picture
5	1360540800	Arrived on time. Great price. It is for sale for $50 in the stores. Definitely happy with the purchase. Both price and product!
4	1360540800	Overall the product works well. It is fairly large and bulky but protects the unit well. I have dropped the unit with no damage..
5	1360540800	I purchased the OtterBox because I have not had the best of lucks with phones. I literally destroyed my BlackBerry a few years ago dropping it all of time, but when I got my first iPhone 4, it was suggested that I try the OtterBox and I loved it then and the new colors available are great.
5	1360540800	This is by far the best protective case for an iPhone.  I work in a factory environment and I don't worry about my phone getting dirty or broken.  The built in screen protector is nice and the screen is still very responsive.  The only negative about the case is it is hard to get in and out of my back pocket due to the rubber cover.  Other than that, it is amazing.
5	1360540800	This is the best, most protective case I have ever owned. I absolutely love it! If you work on a construction site or something like that, this is definitely the case for you.
5	1360454400	The case I order came in decent time and was as shown on the Internet. Would recommend to others. Great !
5	1360454400	This is my fourth different OtterBox and they just keep getting better. The plastic overlay on this OtterBox is stiffer than the silicon gel overlay on the iPhone 4 Otterbox. This is so much better. The iPhone 4 Otterbox started to come apart after 9 months. This one seems like it'll last a lot longer.
1	1360454400	Case is flimsy. The plastic face creates bubbles on the screen. It says otterbox but it does not feel like a true otterbox.
5	1360368000	This was a request from my granson for Christmas. It was a success as he was very happy to receive it!
5	1360281600	IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE THICKNESS YOUR IPHONE WILL LOOK, THIS IS THE BEST CASE YOU CAN GET! YES, IT IS BULKY,BUT YOUR DEVICE IS TOTALLY PROTECTED. YOU WON'T WORRY ANY MORE FOR DROPS AND HITS! I LOVE IT...
4	1360281600	I recommend this to anyone who is clumsy or had kids.  I and my daughter have dropped the phone and it is just fine.  It does add bulk so I took off one star, but it has kept the phone pristine and safe from crumbs and goop that u wiped off the case with ease.  The charge and headphone ports are protected but very easily accessible.  Great case with fun color options and a comfy soft grip for typing while holding.
5	1360281600	Can't complaint about these products.  I don't know if it protect my phone from a drastic accident because I am not willing to test it, but I am a clumsy and so far the phone is perfect. Makes it a little difficult to type the letters near the edge of the screen because my finger hits the border of the case, but aside that fact it does what it does.
5	1360281600	I knew it was from China right away.  It took about 3 weeks to get here but it was well packed and it works just fine. Can't beat the price.
2	1360195200	This is the 3rd case I brought for the iphone5.  This case seems not like the others.  Seems cheap fake
5	1360195200	I love the color of it and it comes just as described. Would totally recommend it to other people! Great Quality as well
4	1360195200	Bought one for my Apple I-phone 5. Works great - I just wish that there were actual instructions instead of badly done pictures. :)
5	1360108800	excellent case, it's perfect for protect your iphone, is durable, resistent to everything, and also it looks great. i absolutely love this product
5	1360108800	Saved a lot of money. Great price compared to mall.  Works great and fast shipment. Cleans easy and keeps shape.
5	1360108800	this is for my teenager, this case is VERY strong and keeps his phone safe and does not restrict any buttons, whic this would work for my phone
5	1360022400	If you have an Iphone 5, then this is the case for you. Buy the Otterbox Defender case and you won't be disappointed. The feel and look and protection it offers is second to none.Would I buy this product again?  YES!
5	1360022400	My husband likes this case.  It seems to do a great job at protecting the phone and fits very well.
3	1360022400	Case looks good and provides good protection, fitting very well. However, this is the second case we have had that developed an oily appearance beneath the screen protector. This is a reported problem with others reviewed on this site. My wife mentioned it at Verizon store and they looked at it and said they had never seen anything like this and were sure it was counterfeit and replaced it. She hasn't had a problem since.
5	1360022400	I am impressed with this great Iphone 5 case.  The price beats the competitors hands-down.  All the external protection covers the actually buttons perfectly and still allow for smooth and precise use.  This cover has a clear cover that allows great response time for games as well as accuracy for people that will actually type instead of dictate.  Also, I didn't think I would use the belt clip, but I have.  I had purchased an elastic arm band for an ipod and the clip holds my iphone in plenty strong.  I have taken it on bicycle trips and walks and it hasn't budged.  Some may say that the case is to bulky, but I want protection and I trust this case.
5	1360022400	I was a little nervous to get this case after reading some of the reviews, but I am very glad I went ahead and purchased it. I have noticed an occasional watermark on the screen, but they are hardly noticeable. I bought the case to protect my $700 phone. So far I have dropped it several times and my phone still doesn't have a scratch. I even threw it once to prove a point and my phone is still unscathed (the case still looks great too.) The case is bulky and has a couple drawbacks, but if you're looking for ultimate protection for your iphone, this is the case to get.
5	1360022400	great way to protect my iphone 5! i had a Ballistic LS0955-M985 Ballistic LS Smooth for the first couple days while i waited for my OtterBox which i am use to! it does add some bulk on the phone compared to the Ballistic LS Smooth which i pretty slim.
5	1360022400	This case is perfect for my iphone 5. I love the built in screen protector. And the glacier colour looks really nice on my white iphone.
4	1360022400	very durable has fallen down the stairs a few times and the iphone is still intact, not even a ding.easy to assemble.  quick delivery
5	1360022400	It may feel bulky at first but I am now used to it and through the multiple phone drops, no issues what so ever.A great bargain!
5	1359936000	I carry insurance on my iPhone 5 but this product is causing me to re-think that.  OtterBox is excellent protection.
5	1359936000	Exactly what I expected. Came in the mail in a decent amount of time. I've bought other otterboxes online, and one of them was a fake, but this one is a real one. I love it!
2	1359936000	The otterbox defender is a great double protection for my new iphone5 but made my phone very hard to use.  It seems like the product was not well thought off or it is a defective one.  Made my iphone front button hard to press and hurt my fingers after a while.  The home button is not lining up perfectly with iphones.
1	1359936000	Such thin silicone it won't stay on my phone. Doesn't seem like a true otterbox. My mom and daughter in law have the same case and they don't have any of the problems I have with this case. Going to send it back.
4	1359936000	Great case only problem I have with it is that after a while when you take it off and put it back on the inside is not as snug as it was when I first got it. Other than that great!
2	1359849600	The screen protector sucks! It sticks to my iPhone and makes it look ugly! It's not what an otterbox is supposed to be!
5	1359849600	This Otterbox Defender case for iPhone 5 is a much tighter fit than their Defender case for the iPhone 4. But I do see where it will wear out. Using the belt clip, it is marking marks on the case. So eventually it will wear it down enough to cause problems. But maybe I am being pessimistic. It is great case in appearance and protection.
1	1359849600	I did some research prior to purchasing and when I received this otterbox defender for the new iPhone, it was an obvious fake.  Thought about keeping it but the clip popped apart within a matter of days.  I returned for a refund.
1	1359849600	this guy went all the way to fool us. even put it in an original box. i compared it with one i later purchased from Walmart. the fake one screen protector sticks on screen in an annoying manner. also the outer rubber part is not as snug. it's NOT the original otterbox. consumers beware.
1	1359849600	This is the most difficult piece of apparatus to put together that I have ever bought and I believe it just doesn't fit the longer iPhone 5. The directions that came with it were worth zero. I called the company's customer service and they tried to help me but did not have this new iPhone to determine if it fit into the plastic case. One must take the case apart which is quite difficult and then put it together with the iPhone in it----the iPhone just did not fit into the plastic case! I wasted half a day on this. Can I send it back to you ? If so, where and how? I am a really good customer of Amazon and have never sent anything back before.
4	1359849600	This case fits Iphone 5 well and has kept it from getting scratched and dinged during drops. Arrived on time
5	1359849600	Have been impressed with Otterbox Defender since having one on my iPhone 4 for two years has it kept it pristine and safe from my two grandsons, now ages 4 and 6 who always wanted to play with it and I could happily indulge them. That still Like New iPhone has been handed down with its orginal Otterbox Defender to my sisiter. I purchased another Otterbox Defender for my recently new iPhone 5 and was even more impressed. Perfect fit and finish but the outer coating is now more sturdy and adherent to the plastic main body and is not softening and loosening as the original design did. And the cost on Amazon is always much better than the wireless carriers' retail outlets.
5	1359763200	I originally bought this case for me. My wife wanted the Ballistic Hard Core case. We have the same model of phones. The first night she used my phone and thought the buttons were easier to use, and she liked that it was thinner than her case. So I had to trade with her, you know happy wife, happy life.
1	1359763200	When I upgraded to iPhone 5 I bought an Otterbox @ Best Buy for $50. I also ordered one from Amazon for around $30. I found the materials to be MUCH better on the more expensive one. I was SO disappointed when I tried the one I got from Amazon. The Rubber is soft & loose- not smooth & tough like my other one. I would to speak with Amazon about this.
4	1359763200	So I have compared the one I got from the Verizon store and the one I bought from amazon and I'm pretty sure the one I purchased on amazon is fake. The first difference is the one from Amazon is its made in China, and the one from the VW store is made in Mexico. The button first real difference is the materials, the one I bought from the store is tough but with a rubberized no slip grip, the Chinese made piece of crap feels like slippery cheap plastic. The second major difference is the touch sensitivity of the home screen, the one from the store I had no trouble using the home screen, the one from here I cannot access the screen whatsover it has zero touch sensitivity. Now for non cosmetic difference that could actually damage your iPhone 5 is how the inner case fits, the case is too big for the phone leaving it room to slide and potentially scratching your phone with the movement, and since this is not a real Otterbox case I wouldn't trust dropping it anywhere but in the garbage without the iPhone inside. Amazon I'm sincerely disappointed you are not watching the quality control of your products and allowing sellers to sell fake products on your site. I repeat this is NOT a genuine Otterbox do not buy this product.----------------------update 3/28/2013-------------------So I can definitely say this is the best case I have purchased this far for the iphone 5. It's been through rigorous conditions such as: being dropped on concrete, thrown against a wall, kids, and the every day life of a klutz for 3 months. The case shows little wear and tear, despite it being put through heavy use. The touch screen is still as responsive as ever, and does not have a noticeable "rainbow effect". It is relatively slim compared to other iPhone cases out there, for the amount of protection it provides. The screen protector also allows the retina display to truly shine, whilst proving protection. I do however suggest that you make sure that before you install your screen is clean! It is not easy to take off, but isn't that the whole point? I am very happy with this purchase, bit heed my warning above, please make sure you are buying an authentic  otterbox from the retailer.
5	1359676800	I made to sure to buy this case before I got my iphone 5. I've dropped my phone numerous times and if I didn't have a case I'd be in trouble. The case seems big at first but you get use to it.
5	1359676800	I absolutely love my OtterBox Defender case for my iPhone 5, it protects my phone while still complimenting the design of the phone, it's a great product to have, and it comes in a variety of colors.
5	1359676800	I paid a great price for a Quality product! A very protective case for my Iphone5 without the high dollar price.  Fast shipping and packaging was very appreciated!
5	1359676800	These might not be the thinnest or the most pleasing to the eye. But for the protection that they give you, the difference just isn't enough to change my mind. I don't have to worry about my phone dropping or being jarred. It just gives total protection. If the looks is all that I have to worry about then it's really no contest.
2	1359676800	Does it protect the phone, yes.  Does it have a ton of flaws, yes.  For starters, there is a issue with what OtterBox calls an &#34;Oil Slick&#34; forming between the screen of the case and the phone screen.  Their suggestion was to take it apart and rub powder on it to release the friction build up... what?  We did what they said and it actually worked for a few days (while also leaving fine powder on the phone and in the case) but then the slick came right back.  Then they say buy an anti glare screen protector and that should help, why is this something I should have to pay for when it is their product that is defective and poorly designed.  The other issues are that because they used a different rubber on the 5 than they did on the 4/4S, the port covers are nearly impossible to open.  My wife generally leaves the charging port open because it is so tight and the cover over the ringer switch is so snug that after both of us trying to open it we usually just have to use a key to pry it open.. not user friendly, especially if you switch from ring to vibrate very often.It seems to be a durable case but I think OtterBox missed the mark bigtime on this one.
5	1359590400	A family member had requested a new dopp kit for Christmas with specific instructions that it NOT be one of those &#34;new kinds that drop down and take up way too much room&#34;.  He travels for business and wanted a classic kit, of good quality, that he could fit into his suitcase.  I am happy to report that this item was exactly what he wanted!  The quality is excellent and the sides stand up nicely while it is in use.  This is one product that appears to actually be what it advertised and I plan to use this vendor for purchases in the future.  I couldn't be happier with the price, quality, and overall general appearance and functionality of this item.
5	1359590400	Bought this cover to protect my new phone. I don't understand why Apple makes a portable device that is glass. Because I am on the go constantly my old phone screen was replaced several times within 2 years. At one point my phone fell right out of screen replacement shop. This case is awesome!!  I have dropped my phone since I bought it, but no worries because it is completely secure in this case. Love it!!
5	1359590400	I adore my OtterBox defender case.  I previously had one for the iPhone 4s which was nice but obviously bulky.  When I upgraded to the 5 I decided to go with something slimmer - a speck case - but I was so nervous about harming my new device.  After three weeks I knew I had to go back to the company I trusted for optimal protection, and I was so happy to find that the defender for the iPhone 5 is much slimmer and appealing than the old 4s versions.  I still get the protection I require without sacrificing aesthetics.  I love the way my phone looks and feels.  I actually prefer how the phone fits in my hand when it's in this case than when it's bare.  It still fits and slides into my pocket just fine, and it just seems so much sturdier.  I've had several drops in the few weeks I've had it and there has been no damage to the phone whatsoever.  I even dropped it while on the elliptical - it fell and bounced on the edge of one of the foot pieces, flying across the gym!  No problem!  I did remove the build in screen protector in favor of the Zagg shield.  Together it's just perfect.But a cautionary tale -- I came on Amazon and purchased a case from a third party seller - &#34;cellphonegeeks&#34; out of Idaho but I think they operate under many different profiles - and was extremely pleased to find that I could pay less than half of what retail stores and OtterBox itself charges for the cases.  What a deal, I thought.  Wrong.  I received an obviously counterfeit product that was undeniably fake and of such poor quality.  I have posted images comparing the fraud to the authentic product I ended up purchasing from a big box retailer.  Luckily I was able to have a refund of the product and I'm now living happily with a real OtterBox.  My suggestion is to buy straight from Amazon itself or wait for the item to go on sale at one of the major retailers.  I purchased mine from Radio Shack for about five dollars less than MSRP.  It's worth it to pay the real price!
5	1359590400	This case is durable and sleek. Goes great with my iPhone 5 in black. The only problem I have found is that the screen protector tends to stick to the actual screen, creating an odd look with some glass sticking and some not. Overall, wonderful quality.
5	1359590400	Im absolutely in love with this product! My son is a clutz and this keeps his Iphone safe and free from cracks!
5	1359590400	Great product . New never opened as stated . Love the grey color, this product cant get any better than this. thank you
5	1359590400	it's a solid case it does what it's suppose to do I'm glad I picked it up. I suggest you do too.
5	1359504000	YES!! There it's!My new Otter Box Defender cover for Iphone 5 fit well.And arrived before time!The deliver said between January 31 to February 7.The product arrived on January 29.
2	1359504000	I bought 2 of these cases - a glacier and a blush. Although the same product, the glacier outer casing was like hard plastic - which tells me it was old stock and very much weathered. In addition, the screen protector did not adhere properly as it left several bubbles and looks terrible. Whereas, the blush's outer casing was was soft as silicone ought to be and the screen protector adhered perfectly. Seemed that I was duped!! Be careful folks!!
5	1359504000	This phone case is amazing- I thought it would bulk up my phone, but it is super cute and stylish with the safety protection my clumsy hands need!!  I thought this product was to be counterfeit- because the price was amazing for an iPhone 5 otter box case. It really is authentic. I would recommend this product to women with white iPhones(it looks cuter that way!!). It goes with every outfit out there. I have dropped it nearly a dozen times- still as good as new. My case is about a month old and is showing no wear (or tear!) I am totally going to order another one!!! The best case ever!!!!
1	1359504000	I do not like the product changes made to the Otterbox Defender case. The case fits too tight. Smashes the screen and it looks like water underneath the protective film. The port covers are so tight that I have to pry them open with a tool. The power port cover is so resistant to bending that I have to clip it back with something to keep it from mashing on the power input and compromising the port.I don't like it. I don't want it and have already sent my complaints to Otterbox.
5	1359504000	Otterbox is just a great protective product for your iphone. As with anything, the life expectancy can be short or long depending upon how they are stored when not being used. I am not afraid when I have this on my phone. The defender is the best protective casing for an iphone... hands down.
3	1359417600	This case is wonderful as expected with an Otterbox...I don't feel I need to go into detail with it.The holster on the other hand broke at the clip within two weeks of use...don't buy if you're need a holster because now I can't fit this giant thing in to anything.
5	1359417600	Great product. I really like it. It is all they say it is and it fit my I Phone 5 perfectly.
5	1359417600	This product was scheduled to deliver to my house January 29th, and it arrived a day early. I also read the reviews before placing this order and saw that many people complained about this not fitting correctly. Well guess what.... it fits like a glove. I love it.
5	1359331200	I bought this case for my phone 3 months ago and I'm so glad! I'd had my previous phone for 2 years and wish I'd had this for it. I have a 2 year old and 4 year old who love to play games on my phone but aren't the most careful about not dropping or scratching it while they fight over it :) I haven't noticed ANY lag on the touch screen with the built-in screen protector, and if it ever starts to bother me, it's attached to the case in such a way that it would be super easy to pop it off and put on a thin screen protector (of course, that would void the warranty, but still). I didn't notice that it made my phone much bigger, but that's probably because I upgraded to the 5 from the 3GS.
3	1359331200	Love the case and the price, but there must be something wrong with the protective plastic front plate.  No matter how many times I remove the case and put it back on moisture gets in there.  This is very frustrating.
4	1359331200	If your like me and need everything just perfect this case will pose one issue for you; 'bubble' like things show when your screen is not illuminated from the plastic cover. Easy fix however, rub the underside of the plastic protector once with baby powder and then wipe until no longer visible to the naked eye. No more bubbles, no more OCD episodes, one happy consumer.
5	1359331200	Case was difficult to get onto the phone when it was brand new but its very sleek and light weight. Protects the phone from all angles. Definitely recommend this case for iphone5 users.
5	1359331200	This is a durable case that has functions very well.  All of the buttons are usable and it is very protective.
5	1359244800	I bought this for my sons iphone, he is quite happy with it. Great protection for when he will inevitably drop the phone.
1	1359244800	It was impossible to open and put the phone inside without broken nails.  The casing was cheap plastic though the outside was okay.  I returned the product because it was not easy to open.
5	1359244800	My iPhone 5 is in pristine condition -- and it's all thanks to the OtterBox. I've dropped it on concrete, hardwood...you name it, and the OtterBox has just worked wonders for the occasional phone drop.
5	1359158400	This phone case came a lot sooner than expected very good phone case for a great price thank u u
5	1359158400	The name otter box speaks for itself but its my first one. I have dropped my phone a few times and not only is my phone fine but the case doesn't have a scratch. Very happy with my purchase.
5	1359158400	It really took some getting used to how heavy it made the iPhone 5... I almost considered returning it since it felt like it doubled the weight. But then my 1 yr old got ahold of it and I knew it was fine... Worth the weight for the durability.
5	1359158400	I wouldn't have a iphone without an OtterBox case.  This case came exactly as described and is WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!
5	1359072000	I am surprised of some of the reviews because the case is not huge but it is big but if you want a case to protect your phone don't you think that it's going to be bulky or a little big. The built in screen protector is awesome and the new rubber for this case is a lot better felling then the past iPhone 4S cases it doesn't lose it's shape or stretches it keeps Its shape really well. Over all I think that it is the a awesome case and recommend it to anyone.
5	1359072000	I just purchase this case the grey white color one from Amazon marketplace, it is FAKE. The seller is smart phone fashion or something like that.  How do I know its fake? because i own  another one that's genuine , completely different. When you see an extreme low price case. dont buy it it most like will be fake
5	1359072000	This otter box is an improvement over the ones I purchased for my iPhone 4. It is so sturdy and fits like a glove. I love the color combo. The shipping was super fast and the price was great. Thank you for a wonderful transaction!!
5	1359072000	i know some dont like it because they think its too bulky but i fully believe in and support the otter box line it offers really super protection
5	1359072000	The OtterBox met all my expectations.  The price was excellent and the case provides the protection I need.  I needed the protection the case provides and wasn't concerned about the larger phone profile.
5	1358985600	Bought this one after the success with one I used with the IPhone 4.  It fits even better then the previous model.  The flexible outer case is very snug better then the last.  Only time will tell.
4	1358985600	I have a new iPhone 5 and this Lightning cable will sync data and charge your phone just like the original cable. Finish is not as refined as the OEM cable but is good for an after market product, it's a solid product at a fair price. I paired it up with the PowerGen 2.1 Amps dual USB car charger so my iPhone is always usable on the road no matter how low the battery charge is.
2	1358985600	It's like putting your iPhone inside a vault. My old RAZR was 8-years old with just a clear plastic clam shell cover and it was never damaged. It adds so much bulk that carrying it in your pocket is uncomfortable, especially when you are seated. The belt clip is so overdone that it is laughable. There are so many other cases out there that offer good scratch/scuff protection for everyday use, that is, unless you have butter fingers or are going to into war&#8230;then it can't be beat!
5	1358985600	This is a great case to protect your iPhone 5. The clear screen makes the phone look a little fuzzy and the mute button cover is sometimes difficult to open to turn the volume on and off. Other than that, I have enjoyed this case and it is worth putting on your phone.
5	1358985600	Great case and i hope to buy another one. Oh yeah i love  how i drop my phone and case protected it
5	1358985600	The price is what caught me Eye.  I am pretty hard on phones and this case is definitely durable. I am impressed.
5	1358985600	This is a great buy for the price.  It is definitely cheaper than going to a the store for them.
3	1358899200	My opinion is that it is a good case. Very sturdy and durable. The clip however broke within 2 weeks of using it. Since it was free, I think they just didn't as much as care as they did in the case in itself.
2	1358899200	My otterbox came in the mail broken. I also does not appear to be the real thing. I guess that's what you get for a 20$ "otterbox." Nonetheless, it does the job of keeping my screen from shattering when I drop my phone.
4	1358899200	I took the leap and upgraded to my first smartphone, the iPhone 5. My main concern when deciding on a case was protection for the phone. The OtterBox Defender is perfect for that, I've had some pretty hefty drops with my phone but so far, so good.Initially I wanted to go with the commuter, and actually purchased the light blue model. It protected the phone well enough, but I didn't like the dimensions of the screen in the commuter, it just felt so long and narrow.Upgrading to the Defender was a good decision, I spent about $20, and my phone feels solid. Just really sturdy and protected. The phone was absolutely fine on my backpacking trip this weekend, despite falling onto rock. That being said, there are some flaws. The lightening port cover does not quite stay closed all the way, and the sort of rainbow illusion has developed on my screen, but it doesn't bother me, nor do I see it when my screen is lit.My number one concern was protection, thats what you get with this case.
1	1358899200	Seemed like a knock off. Was poorly made compared to 4s ottorbox cases and it didnt seem like it was real.
5	1358899200	Excellent purchase for my daughter's new phone. Great price..excellent value for this product....in fact the best we found. I would highly recommended this product...
5	1358899200	I thought this might be a tad bulky but it is not.  This case is perfect for best protection if u drop your phone. Can't beat for the price on Amazon.  Buy it!
2	1358899200	This box wasn't what I was thinking it would be. Very hard to open and keeps a lot of air pockets on the screen.
2	1358899200	The thing is HUGE! Granted it seemed to offer a lot of protection, and it seemed like I could toss my phone off a five story building and it could survive the impact.  If you like your sleek modern Iphone and the ease of use, do not get this case.  It is so large it makes it difficult to use your phone with one hand, which makes browsing and one hand texting very difficult.
5	1358899200	Very good product. Came quickly , fits right over my iPhone  will recommend to others for purchase  good price also
2	1358812800	The Rubber out side feels cheaper than the one on my iphone 4 or my ipad both from otter box.  The seams were sharp and not smoothed off.  The rubber isn't as grippy it feels more like plastic.  I am a big otter box fan so I am not sure if they have changed or what.  I will buy retail next time so I can go feel it I guess.
5	1358812800	This case comes with a belt clip which is great.  I went to the several stores first and left because I didn't want to pay that much for the Otterbox case.  I received this awesome case for a reasonable price and saved money!!!
4	1358812800	This was a great deal the outer box came basically brand new with an low price and the clip comes in handy
5	1358812800	I first ordered a cute little case for my iphone 5, but after it slipped out of my hands a few times onto the garage floor I knew that cute case would not work.  I ordered the OtterBox Defender and have not dropped the phone once.  Once when my iPhone fell the iPhone chipped and the OtterBox covers up the chip perfectly.  I'm not gentle my any means, so this case works perfect for me.
2	1358812800	First off, this will clearly protect the iphone 5. No question there. Its a strong shatterproof case with a durable screen protector.Protection gets 5 stars.Screen Protector: 1 star. Its has an oily smear to it in certain places where the screen protector touches the iphone screen. I've tried cleaning it several times to no avail. There must be something wrong with the material they use that conflicts with the iphone screen. Its almost like there is a layer of water between the screen protector and the phone screen. Can't seem to find a fix for this. Cleaning, drying, etc do not address the issue.Disassembly: 1 star. It nearly impossible to take this thing apart once it has been snapped together. I've seen Youtube videos where they show the trick to disassemble it, but I can't consistently get those tricks to work.  Be ready to deal with a broken fingernail if you try to disassemble this box.
5	1358726400	This is the first time using a case for an iphone or a cell phone in general.  I never liked the loose fitting options colleagues used.  With a lighter and slimmer phone, figured it was a good time to try a case.  It helps when there are so many positive reviews for a product.I had a few issues trying to separate the pieces but found an installation video that made it more clear.  I am impressed by the precise fit around the phone and in the ports.  There are no issues with touch sensitivity and sound quality.  And, feel that when the dreaded drops of the phone occur, the case will provide ample shock and breakage protection.
5	1358726400	I have had an Otterbox Defender series case since my original iPhone 3G. With that being said, this case is the best one yet. The rubber fits very snugly, and gives the kind of protection you expect.If you're like me, and constantly drop your phone, do the smart thing and get an Otterbox!
5	1358726400	As advertised and very sturdy, it protects my phone and looks professional in a business setting.  I will purchase another when the time comes
2	1358726400	Within 1 week of putting this case on my phone, the protective screen is covered with water spots.  It looks horrible.
4	1358726400	I had an OtterBox Defender for my iPhone 4 and the protection was there for the numerous times the phone was dropped.  After looking at many covers, I opted for the Defender for my iPhone 5.  This a very substantial case and stands up to the daily abuse of dropping, being thrown of desks, on car hoods, and rocky surfaces (Yes, being near the ocean, sometimes a rocky edge is better than being wet).  The provided screen protector does not hamper the touch screen operation and reduces some glare (not much).  I recommend this case if you're an outdoor person.  Only wish there was a way to make the case a little lighter in weight.
5	1358640000	Love this case it really protects good its a very good case to protect your phone. If you are looking for extra good protection this is the case for you.
1	1358640000	I have always been happy with the Otterbox Defender case. I ordered this one for my son's iPhone and was shocked. It is clearly not Otterbox quality. It is loose, doesnt fit well and is falling apart. I bought one recently from a different company and there is no comparison.I will never be convinced that it is a genuine Otterbox.
5	1358640000	I liked the last one, but after a couple years the clip broke. This one has a much stronger clip, but takes a little elbow greece to get it on, but I like that it is tight. I as waiting for a red one, but they didn't make it this year, so I settled for the grey one which was on sale, and I do like it very much. I decorated the case with some stickies and that works for now.
1	1358640000	After reading all of the reviews I was considering not buying this case but since they were so mixed I decided to give it a shot.  From the second I received it I have not been happy with it.  First, the cover that protects the silent switch was impossible to open once it had been closed and did NOT get any easier with use. Second, one day all of a sudden my screen became distorted due to the case pressing down on the screen too hard.  I immediately removed my phone from the case and bought a new case from a different brand. Overall I'm not happy at all with this but do know others that haven't had any problems with theirs.
2	1358640000	Cover is to hard that you cannot even open to put on charge or put on vivration  is good but not my type!!
4	1358640000	I have had this product for about 2-3 weeks now, no problems with it. Love the new rubber sleeve, and although it is not as bulky as the Otterbox I had on my iPhone 4, it is still rather bulky for me. But overall, a good product and my phone is protected.
3	1358553600	I like the product but I have an issue with the case which is colors such as my bed sheets rubbing off onto the case.
1	1358553600	I was disappointed upon receiving the iPhone 5 OtterBox case. The packaging was severely scratched and soiled. There was no way I could have given it as a Christmas gift as I had intended and there was no time to reorder or send back. The quality check had obviously not been done.
4	1358553600	The Otterbox defender is a great cover for all iPhones. The fit is great and the design is slick and modern. However, it is a tad bulky which goes against the product upgrade from the older iPhone versions to the new iPhone 5.
5	1358553600	There was nothing wrong. Its exactly as described! Excellent price, excellent product, fast shipping, exactly what I wanted! If you are having doubts, don't!!
3	1358553600	Works well except the clip is very tight and I'm afraid that I will pinch the rubber cover in it and rip the cover.
5	1358553600	I don't like the size of it, but it's damage proof, shock resistant, and indestructible.  It makes me feel like my iphone is secure.
5	1358553600	This is a very good case! I wouldn't trust any company but otterbox when it comes to protecting my phone.
4	1358553600	I have not experienced any of the problems other users have. no vertical movement within the case, no oil-slick appearance on the screen protector...this version is also a LOT BETTER than their iphone 4 case. I had to write them several times about the silicone tearing away and stretching. the 5 case feels very substantial.
5	1358553600	This is my first otterbox defender and i really like it, i also use the Moshi ivisor AG screen protector that is anti-glare under so that i dont get those sometime visible bubble look. The face button does require alittle more pressure but i feel real confident with the protection the case offers
5	1358553600	Great case!! Super durable and not the silicone stuff that's hard to put in your pocket. I Love it!! The compartments for the charger/headphones etc. are really tough to open and close at first though.
5	1358553600	Otterbox Iphone case:  The product is just the best,besides being very attractive it is extremely protective of my phone. This is my secondotterbox.
2	1358467200	I had the otterbox defender for the iphone 4 and loved it! it had a great feel, was easy to use, and was extremely protective when my 2 year old dropped it (ok and me too). So I bought the defender for my new Iphone 5 hoping to be just as happy. I like the changes they had made to it when I opened it, it felt more sturdy and I liked the harder rubber on the outside. It is very heavy and adds a ton of bulk so if you are looking for a sleek case this isn't it, but it is very protective and that's what I want. However, I cannot even open the port for the &#34;silent&#34; button, the charging port is also very stiff and unfriendly. The new rubber they used on this model is just so stiff and unusable I can't use this product. I have ordered a different brand of case and hope that it will be more friendly than this one.
5	1358467200	Couldn't be happier with this purchase! Paid way less than the $50 they are asking in the stores and it works great!
5	1358467200	If you have never owned an otter box, now is the time!  I had to replace my last phone due to a shattered screen.  It also had damage on the sides and corners from multiple drops.  Well, those days of ruined phones are far behind me now that I have my new iPhone 5 securely protected by this heavy duty case.  It was difficult to figure out how to get the thing open initially, but once I did, following removals were easy.  Three layers of protection!  This has a great rubbery kind of feel that allows you to grip it well and the added width the case offers actually allowed me to manipulate the phone better.  Absolutely no regrets!  Plus it was 1/3 of the cost I would have seen in retail store.
5	1358467200	I'm very happy with this product.  It is very sturdy.  My phone has fallen to the floor a couple of times and there is not damage at all.  I like the hard rubber that is used now on the outside of the phone.  The old rubber would move every time you took it out of your pocket or a bag.  Now with the new hard rubber it never moves.  It is always in place whenever you take it out of anywhere.
4	1358467200	I purchased this case after seeing the reviews on Amazon.  Plus the fact that its one of the most protective cases out there for the iphone.  My 5 year old daughter uses my phone alot for games and movies so I have peace of mind knowing that it will be protect my phone in case of drops.  Upon receiving my case I noticed that one part of the hard case did not snap into place.  Also the belt holster that acts as a kick stand does not lock into place.  I notified otterbox about the situation.  After sending them a few pics of the problem,  they have already sent me another one without even asking for the original one back.  Otterbox really stands by their product.  Great warranty.  The case does add some bulk to the iphone5 but as a guy with big hands I like the added size.  Though appealing visually by itself,  the iphone seems very delicate to handle due to the thinness and I feel as if I dont have a secure handle of the phone when making calls.  Other then having to get a replacement case under warranty, I would recommend this case for those who want great protection for their iphone.  Not for those who want to keep the small profile of the iphone as this case will at least double the thickness due to the inner hard case and outer silicon layer.One last thing.  I read some reviews about the built in screen protector not sitting flush with the screen.  I DID NOT have this problem on mine. It sits just as flush as one of those sticky screen protectors you buy separately.  If you have this problem get another one under warranty.  Otterbox will replace it since it is defective.
5	1358380800	If it were not for this case my iPhone would have been in pieces long ago. This case is for a new iPhone 5. I had one for my iPhone 3 GS which I have used for three years and the phone still looks brand new. I work outside a lot around heavy equipment and it is inevitable that my iPhone would get dropped. It has taken up to 5 foot falls on hard pavement and not a scratch or nick on the phone. When you consider the cost of replacing a broken iPhone the OtterBox Defender is good insurance.
5	1358380800	This case does everything its supposed to! I've had an otterbox before (for the 3GS) and if anything the quality of their products has IMPROVED greatly. With my first otterbox, I paid the full $50 the apple store asked for (this is before I discovered amazon), so paying only $25 to me is great! I have a friend that found an otterbox online for like 16, so if you can find that go ahead, but this is a good price.I've gotten plenty of compliments on the color too!
4	1358380800	Solid case that offers very good protectionInstallation is more than simply placing on phoneIf not familiar with OtterBox, read instructions carefully
5	1358380800	Awesome and worth the price! Would buy it again in a heartbeat. Would recommended it to everyone. The feel and look was perfect. Others cost 2x more for the same result.
5	1358294400	This OtterBox for iphone 5 is amazing.  I had one for my iphone3, it was great, and saved my iphone many times over, but the screen cover constantly had water marks under it.  I have had this for a few weeks now, and my screen is always clean and clear.  The cover is much easier to put on, than  the older one was.
5	1358294400	The perfect case for the occasional drops, spills and life mishaps. I highly recommend this case for parents with iphones.
5	1358294400	It's a great case, fits good and looks good and easy to install I've told most of my friends about it. thanks
3	1358294400	I love the Otter box except for one major problem. You have to push the &#34;home&#34; button very hard for it to respond. I already threw away the shipping box and can't find out how to contact the vendor. I'd like to exchange it and then I'd give it 5 stars.
5	1358294400	Much better design then the defender box for the 4s. It feels much more secure and the little tabs you open to get to the plug in spots are much sturdier and seem less likely to rip off after wear.
5	1358294400	Perfect! especially if you have a child or if you are clumsy like me! Ive dropped it numberous times and nothing has happened to my Iphone5! Very happy. Much better then paying for a $100 lifebox,
5	1358294400	I love this case. Its not like the soft some what sticky feeling of the iphone 4 otterboxes. Its firmer and smooth feeling! A great release from otterbox!
3	1358208000	The case is a lot &#34;tighter&#34; than the previous Otterbox I have owned. I had an iPhone 4 case and was protected well. It was easy to open the ports, take the case apart and clean it, etc.The newer case however, is difficult to disassemble, and I need tools to open the ports to access the charging port, headphone port, and mute switch. The Home button is also a nightmare to press. The volume and power buttons work great at least.The rubber outershell is also much stiffer than the iPhone 4 model I own. Not as &#34;grippy&#34; or soft either.Definitely would rethink this if you want to be able to open up your ports without picks and tools.
5	1358208000	He wanted a case that would really protect his phone and this case is it.  He wears it in a case on his waist and is concerned about dropping it.  He doesn't have to be concerned with this case.
5	1358208000	As a person who has dropped and broken her iphone glass....twice....I would recommend this case!  No more damaged iPhones.  Since I got an otterbox, I have dropped it, skipped it across the floor, and even dropped it in water.  (grabbed it out of the water very quickly)My phone has survived all this.  Great protection for almost anything that could happen to an iPhone!
5	1358208000	On time and Swaggsoright I love it I think imma have to buy one more cheap low price the all I needed
5	1358208000	Great price! Great Product! Saved me money and it was in factory sealed box! I would highly recommend buying this case for your iPhone 5!
4	1358208000	This case is well constructed. I don't have to worry about breaking my phone when it slips through my clumsy hands. My boyfriend has the same case in a different color and dropped his phone in the toilet and it's okay! I know it's not waterproof but it certainly adds more protection against liquids. I do wish the otterbox could be made smaller.
5	1358121600	Great case to have if you want to protect your iphone 5. I recommend this one or any color of this otterbox brand.
4	1358121600	It adds a TON of bulk to your phone.  My husband doesn't mind it because his hands are bigger, but I can barely even use his phone with this case on it.
5	1358121600	This is a great buy.  My nephew dropped my phone face down and nothing....It had a small scratch on the product but the phone was unharmed...Awesome!
1	1358121600	I had high expectations given the brand, but was very disappointed with the actual product.This is REALLY bulky.  I am sure it is VERY protective, and you can take the phone into harsh environments with no worries, but if you are using your phone on a regular basis and need something that is not too bulky, skip this case and look for something else.  The holster is sturdy and functional too, but again, it is VERY bulky and heavy.One REALLY big issue is that the main button of the iPhone 5 is VERY hard to operate, and you have to push extremely hard holding the phone with 2 hands.
5	1358121600	the design of the 5 is better than the one for the 4.  It has already protected my wife's phone from a fall.
5	1358121600	Needed protection for my new i-phone.  This is great but I wish it came in more patterns or colors.  Great case though!
5	1358035200	PROS:I *hated* the screen protectors on the older defenders. Not just because of the rainbow effect, but also because of the grainy look it gave the screen, which was especially noticeable when reading something with a white background. While this new case does still have the rainbow effect, the graininess is gone. And since the rainbow effect isn't even visible when the device is turned on, the only visible difference caused by this case's screen protector is a slight shift in the warmth of the color towards the cooler end of the spectrum. (It's not bad, it just makes the color tone look like the 4/4S series as opposed to the warmer tone on a 5 w/o a screen protector.)The silicon is also harder, less tacky, and all around better.CONS:I'm glad there's not a cheap piece of plastic over the cameras now, but if they're going to be uncovered, there should be a rubber grommet or something to create a seal around the exposed portion. These cases have always had a minor issue with dust getting inside. I think (but have no evidence yet -- it's a new case) that uncovering the cameras will exacerbate this. Maybe not, though.Also, the vibrate toggle is pretty awkward to reach. It looks like it would be easy to Dremel that out, though, which is probably what I'll do.
5	1358035200	Picked up this one and one for iphone 4Both came in original packaging.Took a bit to install, but I was unfamiliar with this case.Very rugged, adds a lot of bulk to the phone, but worth protecting it.
2	1358035200	I purchased the Otterbox Defender based on a fear of damaging my precious new iPhone 5.  In this regard, it is what it says it is: heavy-duty protection.However, the watermark phenomenon was a deal-breaker. I read about it before making the purchase, but figured it was pettiness on the part of the reviewer.  Alas, I was wrong. It drove me nuts.  I searched the net for fellow-sufferers and a remedy. Baby powder, glass cleaner, hand grease, Saran Wrap, and complete x-acto cut out of the screen protector were offered, with varying results.Sorry - I can't buy a high-end case, then sort through viable modifications to make it work for me.  Returned to sender. Candyshell Grip en route. I'll just make sure I don't drop the phone off of the CN Tower.
5	1358035200	When I first purchased my iPhone 5 it was so thin I almost dropped it numerous times although the otter box is bulky and takes away from the sleekness of the phone I feel secure with it
4	1357948800	Makes the phone big and bulky but need it to protect it.  Allows moisture to get in behind the screen protector when you have it in your pocket.
5	1357948800	Well made, folds back nicely when opened. Looks good. Recommend this product for use on your Kindle Fire. Several colors to chose from. Reasonable price.
3	1357862400	I purchased this Otterbox here on Amazon since I read terrible reviews about the Lifeproof case for the iPhone 5.  I had a couple of Otterboxes on my iPhone 4, and they seemed to do the trick.  This one has already cracked after a couple months of  use!  It hasn't seemed to compromise the security and safety of the case as it's only the black part around the camera that is cracked, but it's annoying, none the less.  Ah well, for the 20 bucks I paid, it's not that big of a deal. On the up side, the outer layer is far less &#34;squishy&#34; than the old cases and does not stretch out or get deformed like they did.  Overall, worth the 20 bucks for sure.
4	1357862400	A beast of a case with screen protection so do not need to get a separate screen protector.  Buttons are responsive and aligns well to the openings.  Case also plugs up the charging opening and easily opens for access.With the level of protection comes added bulk and weight.
5	1357862400	Otterboxes are the best. What else needs to be said. I am very clumsy and for some reason drop my phone a lot. I broke a couple of other iphones that dropped and had cases, non provided the protection as OtterBox. I actually had my previous iphone in an Otterbox and it kept in excellent condition and I got top dollar for my phone when I traded it in. I have dropped my phone 3 times so far and nothing.
5	1357862400	I am very pleased with this case, it is very protective and is exactly what I was looking for. Product new and quick shipping! Highly recommend.
2	1357776000	I recently bought an Otterbox Defender Series case for my Iphone 5. My brothers also got cases from two other companies. Upon comparison of cases, my case seems to be made of a different rubber material for the outer coating. The rubber outer layer is flimsier than other cases and seems rough cut around the edges and openings in the case. My brother sales Otterbox cases for a living and said that the case I got seems like a knock off/ counterfitted version of the Otterbox cases. It will probably do the job for the most part however the case doensnt seem as durable, well fitted, or nicely made as it should be.To Summarize: Case is flimsy and seems cheaply made compared to other Otterbox Defender Series cases i have held that are made for the Iphone 5 and appears to be a counter fit
5	1357776000	I gave a 5star rating because the product arrived ahead of schedule and with no issues at all. I would use this service again.
2	1357689600	I've owned two otterbox's for the previous generation which were easily manageable, that is why i purchased this otterbox. To much of my surprise almost all of my protective features on this case aren't usable. This case is extremely tight fitting and I thought I would break my phone while trying to put it together. The protector for the silence button had to be pried open and i had to leave it open to even acces the button, I accidentally put it back in and yet again had to pry it open which takes almost 10 minutes. The same with the protector for the charging port and head phone jack. The protector for the home button is extremely difficult to press and I have to find the spot and press aggressively. Overall I am very dissapoint ed with this case and don't feel it's worth the money or hassle. This I can guarantee is not "user error" my daughter worked for AT&T and constantly installed otterbox's...this is just junk
4	1357689600	This is a solid case, will provide great protection; however, I ordered two cases, one glacier and one blue.  Although quite difficult to open to install around the phone, the iphone sat in the case perfectly.  With the glacier case, the iphone had to be forced to fit into the case.  Hoping its not a knockoff....
5	1357689600	Wasn't too bulky or anything like that. Fits perfectly and keeps my iphone lookin great! Very happy with this purchase
5	1357689600	My husband and myself bought an iPhone 5 last week end. We decided to looking really quick for a protective case for our new phones. This case is really what we are looking for....the 3 layers protection make the sleek iPhone a little bit bulky but this phone needs this kind of protection.So far we are really pleased with this case
4	1357689600	nice case! Although I havent dropped my phone yet to find out the promise of this case, I still find it comforting in case I do drop it. Also, your iPhone5 isnt so small anymore...but I guess its for the extra protection!
4	1357689600	The case is nice but I have had three problems with it. 1) The built in screen cover had to come out. It was hard to see the screen because it would not adhere evenly. 2) The home button takes at least 5 times the pressure to use it thru the case. 3) Taking the phone out of the case is damn near impossible.
4	1357603200	Great case for under $20. I removed the screen protector that came with it because it was terribly bubbly and sucked. I would recommend this to someone who wants a quality phone case.
4	1357603200	Love Otterboxes...they are very protective and are well made!!! Multiple color options! Yes they add some bulk to your phone, but it's worth it for the peace of mind! The only (small) complaints I have are that I wish the home button cover provided more of a &#34;click&#34; and that the built-in screen protector would never get the &#34;rainbow effect&#34; from tapping...though there may be no way to avoid this completely due to oil/etc. transferred from one's fingers! Worth every penny!!!
5	1357603200	the cheap and good I got 4 there are good is the some the sell at the store for almost 3 times more
5	1357603200	I purchased my  2 grand nephew his first mobile phone.  This was perfect for their new iPhone 5.  No complaints.
2	1357603200	The qualities of every defender are different. I don't know why they are same product but have different qualities. The outer part of the case was harder than the first that I ordered.
3	1357603200	It is an OK case. The edges are too big and always cause mis-types and things like that. Finally got tired of it and had to return it. If you are prone to dropping your phone a lot and need the extra protection, this is a good option. Use the belt clip that comes with it though. With this big of a case it doesn't fit in pockets very well.
4	1357603200	Yes overall an otterbox is a great case. It has great protection for my iPhone 5. The only bad thing about the are is that after two or three weeks of having it, your screen begins to have bubbles in it. Overall not a bad case.
5	1357603200	We love Otterbox. I like the colors on this one. I have a white phone and it goes nice with it and provides great protection. I have dropped it several times at work with no issues.
5	1357516800	I love this case and the holster is perfect with it. I wear this on my phone when i go to most places. keeps my phone safe
1	1357516800	It is so fragile it doesn't feel like An otterbox. Disappapointed ..I am used to the ones that are more tough.
5	1357516800	The price was good and the case is perfect. i feel like my iphone 5 is very safe. It does add some bulk which many people dont like, such as my husband, but my phone is in pristine condition and his looks like it went through a meat grinder, so...
2	1357516800	We purchased two Otter Defender cases for our iPhone 5s. Both were assembled in identical way. One (black) worked flawlessly and the other (glacier) had air bubbles that we were unable to resolve. Will be returning this to Otter for replacement.
5	1357516800	Yes!!!  My phone  feels safe now!!!  I wish I had gotten a more vibrant color though instead of the grey.This case feels comfortable in my hand and protects my iphone5 well even when I have the belt loop attached.
3	1357430400	These charms are not authentic Pandora charms. Be very careful if you are looking for real Pandora. They are sterling and they are pretty but again it's not a real Pandora charm. Disappointed but Learned a lesson
4	1357430400	This OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 is a great insurance supplement.  It definitely protects your iPhone 5 in a 360 barrier.  Plus is has a great look as well and not bulky as other cases are.  Loved the price too.
4	1357430400	Great case on protecting my phone, but I can't get the air bubbles out. Other than that I still love the case.
5	1357430400	So long as you don't mind the size, otterbox is hands down the best case for your phone. Isn't the first case and won't be the last I buy from them.
1	1357430400	This case is isn't worth the money spent. When mine arrived it had scratches on the plastic screen which of course had a negative effect on the look of my new iphone 5.  I tried washing it in hopes that they were just smudges, but they were definitely scratches.  The plastic screen also "sticks" to the glass of the iphone and leaves spots on the screen.  Of course you can take off the cover and the spots go away, but when you put back on they just return.  Not worth paying to ship it back, so I have just removed the plastic screen.
5	1357430400	It protects the phone great! it is exactly what i was looking for. It is an iPhone must-have. i love it
5	1357344000	This case came brand new in the box and it fits my iphone perfectly, i have no issues with it so far
1	1357344000	The headphone broke in the first week I would like my money back bc the headphone does not even work
5	1357344000	The phone case was cheap I just hop that my phone does not break bc it was  a $525 phone
5	1357344000	My daughter loves it for her Iphone 5.  She spent all her Christmas money on the new Iphone and we definitely want it protected.  Good product, excellent shipping and we will definitely buy from them again.
5	1357344000	Fits my iphone 5 like a glove and is good protection. Buttons all function just fine even in the case and touch screen still works great. Found it much cheaper on Amazon. Gray color is nice to the eye and matches interior color of my vehicle.
2	1357344000	This product offers protection to an iPhone 5 but upon installation the screen was filled with bubbles and as much as I tried to remove them it was to no avail. I did not experience this problem with the iPhone 4S version of this product. Very disappointed with this otterbox product.
3	1357344000	This case is indestructible, which I understand is the point of having an OtterBox. However, the film that protects the screen sticks to the IPhone glass and makes it look like there are water blots. I finally ripped the plastic film off and am taking my chances with my screen scratching. It is nearly impossible to lift up the flap that covers the ringer/silencer switch. I have tried hair pins and pens to get that sucker out but have been unsuccessful. Luckily, all my poking and prodding have somehow flipped the switch the way I want it, even without getting the flap out. Lastly, I tried using an Lightening to 30 pin  Adapter to charge my phone but the OtterBox case is not made to use one--it wouldn't fit. I had to remove the case entirely to use it.On the flip side, I have already dropped my phone, screen side down, and because of the thickness of the case, my screen never made contact with the ground.
5	1357257600	I got this for my son who is the newsroom editor for four newspapers and depends on his iphone as a tool in his job.  One thing he mentioned is that this case helps him hold on to the phone when he needs it to take pictures in the cold.  It will help when things are wet too.  I looked at a number of reviews and comparisons, and this was a good choice at a reasonable price.
1	1357257600	What i rip off i buy this for 36$ now its 20$?I feel taken advantaged of.ripped off!Last time i buy otterbox
5	1357171200	Love this case and the fact I know my phone is protected from a fall. Before putting on the case, I had a protective film cover, I used a micro-fiber clothe to wipe the screen and I haven't had any issues with 'water marks' under the front cover.The only thing I wish is the home button was easier to push on the Otterbox
5	1357171200	Bought this for my sons i-phone 5.  Looks great and has protected it against numerous falls.....whew!  Glad to have such a sturdy and nice looking case for such an expensive phone in the hands of a teenager!
5	1357171200	I bought this because I had seen a review on a blog that said her son had crashed it numerous times, and it still worked just fine.  I have had the same experience.  Quick, easy, and long charge!  We had hours of fun and crashing and have more to look forward to!
5	1357171200	Otter Box, outdid themselves this go around the molded plastic on this is so much better than the older versions and appears that it will last much longer without the rubber piece stretching after a few months of wear like previous versions
5	1357171200	exactly what i wanted and expected! everything about it is fantastic.  very durable and doesn't get hair and dirt stuck to the rubber-ish grey part like some of the other types of cases.
1	1357171200	unfortunately it doesn't fit if you have an otterbox case... unless you want to take the otterbox case off  every time you'd like to charge
5	1357171200	Got this for my wife with her new phone - it is sturdy and provides great protection - just what we need with clumsy fingers and a toddler running around!
5	1357171200	As usual, I love my OtterBox.  I always buy the Defender Series as I drop my phone at least once per day and I'm always getting crumbs on it, etc.  The only issue I had was the &#34;oil slick&#34; created from the screen touching the OtterBox screen.  OtterBox customer service suggested using a dryer sheet to rub on the two surfaces to remove the static electricity, which was causing the &#34;oil slick&#34;.  Problem solved!!!!I also love the gray/white color.  It's not something I will tire of.
2	1357171200	This particular grey Otter Box Defender Series case is a much softer case vs. the other 2 Otter Box Defender Series cases I recently purchased.  The rubber case cover slips off the hard case underneath.
4	1357084800	i just received my otterbox today and was very pleased with it. Product came 3 days earlier than predicted. The packaging looked real and the case was brand new. I opened up the otterbox and it was very very easy to put on the phone. I really like the protection this gives the phone and all the ports are easily accessible and i haven't found glare to be a problem with the screen.negatives: the reason  i gave this 4 starts was because it does add considerable bulk, but thats an acceptable tradeoff for protection. i also wish i had gotten the pink iphone cover as the grey is quite ugly but expected.buy this phone if you really want great protection.
4	1357084800	Good product, although dust tends to gather between I phone screen and screen protector. Otherwise a great product! Thank you!
5	1357084800	Convenient place to buy case as this color was not in stock when I was looking.  Came in promptly at a good price.
3	1357084800	The case is sturdy and protects the iPhone well, but sound on/off switch is not easy to access.  It is too recessed.
4	1357084800	This case protects well against drops from around 4 feet in my case. I am not too happy about the rubber lining. It is loose and kinda looks bad. It sometimes dangles off and you have to put it back one. Otherwise I'd give it a 5 star rating. Also, when you install the hard plastic shell do not plan to remove the iPhone from the hard plastic shell too often. It is on tight and you might possibly break it taking it off. Great for durability. You may have to fiddle around with the rubber lining though.
5	1357084800	After breaking both the iphone 3 and iphone 4s we decided to invest in a good case for my daughters iphone 5, she has dropped her phone multiple times and it is still perfect!
4	1357084800	Excellent. Fits like a glove. Protects the entire phone (front, back and sides) while not interfering with use of the touch screen. It is a little bulky, though. ProClip makes an adjustable car mount for this case which uses the lightning cable to keep it charged. Nice to have both safety and convenience. The holster seems fine, but I do not use it as I keep the phone in a pocket or on the dashboard. It has little silicone latches covering the lightning connector and the headphone jack; I found them a bit of a bother, so I just trimmed them off. A well made product.
5	1357084800	I am so glad that I bought this case for my husband.  He loves it! I will definately buy more of them for our phones in the future.  I would also recommend these to everyone!  They are great.  They keep his phone protected and he is still able to use his phone without any problems.
4	1357084800	Great product, but sometimes the case wants to come off when I out it in and out of it's belt holder.  I would buy it again.
4	1357084800	Overall Good Quality. Only issue is that because the case protects so much, the home button is hard to push. But the quality of the case is really good.
5	1356998400	Delivery was on time and it works well.  Don't know how long it will work because I have't had it very long but I don't expect it to fail
5	1356998400	We love otterbox defenders in our house.  We have tried other brands, but it's been years now since we have bought anything else.  This fit the phone perfectly, and the color is just as described.
5	1356998400	My wife wore out the old case after two years, so there was no doubt that I would go with another Otter for the replacement.
1	1356998400	I had a OtterBox Defender for my iPhone 4 for 2 years. I loved it. This new model (iPhone 5) is very disappointing.Issues I have are as follows. 1)There are watermarks between the screen and the phone. I would say these watermarks cover nearly half the screen. The marks are very distracting when using the phone. 2)The covers over the silent switch, headphone jack and charging jack are very difficult to open. So difficult in fact that I need some sort of a tool to open them. 3)The plastic over the screen also scratches much easier than the Defender Box for the iPhone 4. 4)Finally the home button is difficult to activate. I would not recommend this protective case. The only reason I gave it two stars is I do feel it will protect the phone well. I have contacted OtterBox about my dissatisfaction and will edit this review when I hear back concerning their customer service.Updated 1-5-13. I have a open complaint with OtterBox. They have not been real fast to respond. Their initial response was to puff some body powder onto the screen. They informed me the reason for the problem was that Apple's iPhone 5 have varying thickness. (your iPhone 5 may be thicker than mine). However I was able to put a different OtterBox Defender case on my iPhone 5. It was my son's case, (bought at a AT&T; store) he had no issues with "watermarks or oil slicks". His case worked perfectly on my phone, no watermarks. So you see, it seems rather than the iPhone 5's production being inconsistant, I have found that OtterBox has inconsistant production qualities for this model.  I have change my rating to one star because of OtterBox poor customer service and the fact that they are trying to skate around this issue by blaming Apple.Second Edit.I am adding to my review because after being able to compare multiple OtterBox's, all for iPhone5, I feel as though some counterfeit product is being sold on Amazon, either that or OtterBox has sloppy quality control and refuses to stand behing the product. Order from here? Are you feeling lucky?
2	1356912000	The case is a bit bulky, but understandable given the level of protection.The screen, however, is already scratched after a few times in and out of my pocket.  Not only is it scratched but the bubbles are extremely hard to get out and get a clear picture on the phone.Still deciding on whether to keep it or not.
5	1356912000	I wouldn't trust my iPhone in any other case.  I had an OtterBox for my iPhone 4, and it kept it in prestine condition.  I dropped it countless times, and even stepped on it a few times, and my phone was perfect.  Excellent product!!
5	1356912000	In my opinion, the Defender for the iPhone 5 is much nicer than the one for the 4/4S, which I had before. The silicone has a much nicer feel, and it seems thinner yet still provides great protection. The silicone also is much more secure to the hard case, and it is much easier to put on/ take off. Completely satisfied with this one!
5	1356912000	This item really protects your phone.  It has an inner plastic shell with a clear front that surrounds the phone and then a rubber shell goes over the plastic shell.
5	1356912000	This is the best case on the market.  If you want real protection without losing function, this is the case for you.
5	1356825600	Bought this for my husband's new iPhone 5. He loves the case. The colors are great. It protects the whole phone. It has been very durable for his use, had to make sure to get him a great case as he completely cracked the front and back of his old iPhone! We'd buy another OtterBox any day!
5	1356739200	This box fit my I-phone 4 perfectly. It is excellent protection for the phone and has a convenient belt clip.
4	1356739200	As all other reviewers have noted, the adapter doesn't fit if you're using any type of a case. Without a case, it works for charging. I didn't try it fr syncing or music.I recommend that if you have a case on your iPhone, purchase the cord adapter rather than this one.
4	1356739200	I love this case. Yes, it is bulky, but it protects my iPhone very nicely. I don't have any &#34;sweating&#34; of the screen, as some other reviews noted. My main complaint about this case is the Home button is difficult to push. I have to really squeeze it hard to get a response. My OtterBox case for iPhone 4 didn't have this problem, so it's a bit surprising. Still, I like it.
5	1356652800	Make the phone bulky, but gives a good grip and also solid confidence that the phone is well protected. Now I am not worried when at gym or when my kid is playing on it while we are shopping.
5	1356652800	For any price this case is the best.  i had one with my 4s and now the iPhone 5.  Keeps the phone like new and can take a drop with no problem.
4	1356652800	I have been using this for about a week now and so far it is doing it's job very well. I am rather rough on my phones since I work outside and this product makes me less afraid of dropping my phone.  There are only two cons to this case so far, the home button is a little hard to press and the cover to the silence switch is really hard to open. I had to use a butter knife to open the flap to turn my phone on/off vibrate. So far my phone has stayed from of dirt and dust and the screen protector seems to be working well at preventing scratches.
1	1356652800	I had an otter box for my iphone4 and loved it. The otter box defender for iphone5 is not acceptable.  The outer part of the case, which was very pliable on my older otter box is so stiff that I cannot open the flap covering the ring/silent control button.  Also the covering over the home button is so hard to push that if you don't have fingernails to really punch it, forget it.
5	1356652800	This case fits my phone perectly, no worries if the phone gets dropped during  a trail bike ride, this case is tough!great price, prompt delivery.  thank you!
5	1356652800	This is probably the eighth Otterbox case I've purchased over the last three years.  We keep them on our phones 24/7, so they do wear-out over a 12-month period.  But that is due to the constant use, so it isn't the manufacturer's problem.  The redesigned rubber shell looks like it will hold-up better than the previous 4/4S shells, and I the feel of the shell material is much better.
4	1356652800	My last iPhone looked like I beat it with a baseball bat by the time I was done with it so I figured I had to step up my case game for the 5. A little clunky and awkward to get in and out of a pocket, but a great product otherwise. Two layers of protection and pretty nice looking too.
5	1356652800	I LOVE MY CASE...It looks great on my phone and is very light in weight!  My son also loved it that he ordered one, just in a different color!
5	1356652800	always been a fan of otterbox. They deliver excellent product which protects my investment from spills, drops, shocks etc. With 2 lil kids in house, there is always chance of accidents and otterbox cover prevents that.
2	1356652800	I have owned several i-phones as well as otterboxes and this is by far the worst product i have owned. There is like a bubble between the clear screen and the phone that I have tried several times to get out. The phone still works however it is not clear due to this bubble. I wish someone would have shared this with me or maybe I have a defected one. I have tried putting it on the phone a few times and still have this bubble.
1	1356566400	I assume this is not a genuine Otterbox Defender  and have returned (if it is there would be no positive reviews).  I have had other Defenders iPhone 4's and they all worked as advertised.  This one the &#8220;silicone&#8221; was more like hard rubber, the case was almost impossible to open and close and actually put a scratch on the brand new iPhone 5.  I took a chance as the price was less than half of the retail price, so maybe you get what you pay for.  Have ordered other Otterboxes from Amazon with no issues, but probably won&#8217;t in the future.
5	1356566400	dust gets under the screen a bit too quickly was worth the money because if you buy this case there is no need to buy a warranty.
4	1356566400	OOPS! I bought the iPhone 5 otterbox, not the one for the iPhone 4.... Gotta return this product. It was all intact and brand new when I recieved it though :)
5	1356566400	Works great, I have been using OtterBox for years. Love the dust cover over the charging/head phone ports. I feel my iPhone is well protected
5	1356566400	Really like this case. They have changed the feel of the case and I like it a-lot. It seems more rigid than my other Otter Box cases.
4	1356566400	The the plugs being hard to open I just got some fingernail clippers and trimmed the edges(I dont have fingernails, too short). Waiting on otterbox to email me back about the moisture trapped between the screen and screen protector. Otherwise good case will update on moisture issue
5	1356566400	I've owned an iPhone for 6 years now and once I discovered OtterBox I refused to allow my phone to go uncovered.  OtterBox provides a secure cover for the phone and ensures that my butter fingers won't do damage!
1	1356480000	It has clear indication of use, had black dirt marks on grey case....the box it came in also looked old ...never expect this from amazon...the shipment was late too..I specifically chose Amazon as seller to avoid all this and still got it what I had feared...sad! :(
4	1356480000	My wife's been using this for a couple of months now and seams to like it.  Its done a great job protecting her phone as she's prone to drop it.  Also, our two year old likes to play on her phone while they're out running errands and its done a good job protecting the phone from his abuse.  The case is a little bulky, but does protect the phone well.
4	1356480000	I've had the black defender for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it's an awesome case. It does take a bit of getting used to the lip around the screen, but that's expected.I don't know if this will be fixed later, but the case is approximately 2mm too long, so the phone will shift around. I corrected this with a bit of index card pushed into the gap at the top. Also, my case has the watermark issue, but I don't notice it unless the screen's off.The gap, and slightly irritating watermarks knock off a star. For a $45 case, I expect a perfect fit and minimal (if any) watermarking on the screen.Edit: it's 7/8/13, and I'm still using this thing, and it is awesome now that I figured out how to fix the watermarking issue once and for all!It's a simple fix: before snapping your case together, apply one of those cheap plastic screen protectors to your phone. That's it. Yeah it cost me an extra $3, but it's sooooo worth it.Best part is, the double screen protectors doesn't seem to lower screen sensitivity one bit.Watch, someone from otterbox is going to see this and think "now why didn't we think of this.." and all defender cases will start to come with pre-screen protectors lol
5	1356480000	You get what you pay for. This is the best case I have owned, even though it makes the phone a bit more bulky it protects it very well. Even some of my co-workers want one now.
5	1356480000	This product is exactly as stated and is being sold for double the price at AT&t stores. Great product and price
5	1356480000	Very nice case, Like the colors. Bulky like most cases that give good protection but with kids its a must.
5	1356480000	Case feels good in my hand. Nice grip with complete access to iPhone functions. great price. I have recommended it to friends.
5	1356480000	Love the case.  I've actually dropped the phone twice already and no damage was done.  When I place it on top of my dash board while driving, it wouldn't slide.  It made my iPhone bigger though, and the look was not so femine-like.  But overall, I am very happy with it.
5	1356480000	Best case on the market, I have brought 2 so far and have told everybody else where to get one
5	1356480000	Otterbox never fails.  I ordered this at the awesome price of $17 and didn't worry because I knew I was getting a quality product.  It was a gift for Christmas and my mom loves her new case for her Iphone 5.
5	1356307200	I bought a coupe cheaper cases and then a friend told me about the OtterBox.  I ordered one from Amazon and paid less than half of what Best Buy was selling them for.  Hint...If you had installed a scratch shield over the face of the cell phone, remove it as this OtterBox has its own scratch resistant shield.  I've dropped it a couple times and it protected the phone perfectly.
1	1356307200	The case is ugly, bulky, looks and feels cheap!  You have to peel back a rubber flap at the bottom to charge the phone, what a pain!  Not at all worth the money.  Steer clear!
5	1356220800	Great protection for my iPhone 5. It's also light. Gives me peace of mind for my $399 investment. Fast shipping.
5	1356220800	I bought this for my daughter who works in a hospital environment where the risk of dropping your phone is high.  She loves the Otterbox and it has already saved her phone twice in less than a month.
5	1356220800	we love our otter box, they are pretty and functional and protect our phones!! Love them fabulous product, plan to order one for each phone
5	1356134400	Excellent product if your looking for protection and don't mind the bulk. I tend to be on the butterfingers end of the spectrum so this case was perfect for me. A tip for opening it though, start with the right upper corner. Unhinge this first part and then go for the top hinge. After these two steps pull on the big right lock in the middle of the case. Then, it should make opening it easier.
5	1356048000	What can I say, OtterBox knows how to make them.  If you don't mind doubling the size of your slim and sleek iPhone5 in exchange for protection , then this is definitely for you ( and my wife )  You can drop it a few times and nothing happens to the phone !
1	1356048000	I cannot believe Amazon just behaved like we are in the cave ages and charged me some made up promotion amount to return this case.  Of course I was under the impression that as with other online stores and services, If there was a product I was not happy with, I would just return it and get a refund or exchange it.  I ordered the Otterbox and although I think it's a great case for what it's meant for - protection - I was just much bigger and bulkier than it looked online, so I returned it and ordered another lighter case (of course from amazon again) and now I get an email that tells me that because i got some crazy free shipping promotion, I'm going to be charged to return it.  Non of that information was anywhere when I ordered this product and I am sorry to have done a good amount of my shipping from Amazon this year now that I have returned only one of many items I have purchased and I have been treated like this.  I will buy much more cautiously and will stick with Zappos and Nordstrom's  where all my returns are handled without penalties.
5	1356048000	The new Otter box designs and materials seem to hold up much better than the older rubber outer cases!  Very pleased with this one.
4	1356048000	The product came on time and is well constructed.  Just like all of the Apple products we have had that were made in China, it worked!
5	1356048000	Its realy a good outerbox . Good price also. I received on time. White and grey color is looking very nice for my white iphone
5	1356048000	This is a great case and well worth the money, especially if you are prone to dropping your phone. I have dropped my phone several times on the concrete floor of the plant I work in and have not had an issue. The case does make the phone a little bigger, but it is something I prefer as it makes the phone easier to hold on to. The only negative is something mentioned by other reviewers, after about a week there is a kaleidoscope effect in the center of the screen. It doesn't effect performance or legibility. Just annoying . Overall a great product though.
1	1356048000	This is the worst as it relates to quality. It is definitely not worth  $14. I don't think it's worth a $1. Please don't waste your money. The cable doesn't go all the way into the car usb port or the adapter. All parts are made of cheap plastic. I'm really considering sending it back. I will check it out in my car tomorrow for the final decision.This is by far the worst thing I have ever ordered from Amazon. I will just spend the money at Apple.
5	1356048000	This is wonderful!! I was concerned about being able to touch the screen, but I am having no difficulty. I like the color and quality. I think I will buy another color...awesome!!
5	1356048000	Makes iphone5 almost indestructible. Great price and quick delivery. I was not sure about the color but now I love it.
2	1356048000	Only lasted two weeks.  Now it will not charge iphone.  Looks like the apple cord but does not last. Do not bother.
4	1356048000	Love this case, I got the white/grey case. I would &#34;love it&#34; if it was a little less bulky, but I don't know that it would protect the phone as well. This case is great for me, especially because I toss my phone in my work bag and it gets jumbled around with a lot of other stuff.
1	1356048000	Product was impossible to open (not the packing but the box itself).  Directions were not helpful and did not work. I cracked the screen in the process of trying to open it in order to put the iphone 5 in.  Did not have this problem with other otterbox.  Do not recommend buying, but cannot rule out counterfeit item because it turns out that the one shipped to me was from a third party seller (fulfilled by amazon).MSK
1	1355875200	do not be fooled, this is a fake case made in china! i compared a real one with this one, very different. Also the slots for the head jack/charger/vibrate button would not open. I had to cut off the "sleave".
1	1355875200	Had an Otterbox for my iPhone 4 and loved it.  Apparently Otterbox has hired some poor engineers as this product is a definite downgrade!The outside case is a not very flexible plastic and not soft rubber as before, making button depressing harder and it is nearly impossible to remove it from the hard plastic inner case.The inner case now has like 8 latches which must all be depressed to get it open.  It is worse than a child proof prescription bottle!  Had to fight with it for 5 minutes to get it open!!!  Then I had to force the iPhone into the plastic case so it doesn't appear to be sized right.The plastic protective screen was scratched when I cleaned it with a napkin - you'd think I used sandpaper!  It also sticks to the iPhone screen so it looks like there is liquid inside the case and it causes the screen to register false touches when using.  I was barely able to get my lock code entered!So sad to see a good product go bad...will be returning this item asap...
1	1355875200	So just got Otter Box In The Mail and seeing the package i could tell something was up cuz it looks like it went to hell and back.so i open the product and its clearly been used,The screen protector is all scratched up theres marks on the rubber and scratches on the back lens where u can see the apple logo.Also has halo affects or water mark..so Watch out for Always on Sales rip offs.If it says new should be new plan and simple grrr
5	1355875200	The case does everything it said it would. The phone feels very secure and protected. Hardy case that completely protects phone.
5	1355875200	I have no complaint about this product. It works great, very durable, and it worth the price tag. It also comes with a warranty.
5	1355788800	Good protection for the new phone. With a new IPhone 5 costing upwards of $600, it seems reasonable to spend a few bucks to protect it.
5	1355788800	I bought two for my wife when we watch our son play football. They are easy to light. Filling them the first time was a liitle difficult. They stay warm all game.
5	1355788800	Fits real good and love color.price was crazy so i order a few for xmass gift and stockin stuffer love it...
5	1355788800	Just recieved my otterbox today and was pleasently suprised that it fits like a glove. i have had oter otterboxes for the iphone 5 and always ended up returning them because of the issue that the hardshell case was too big for the iphone 5 and caused the phone to slide up and down in the case. not the issue with this one. it fits like a glove with no wiggle room whatsoever. i dont know if otterbox came out with a second updated shell due to all the complaints of this issue or if its a nock-off. the box is genuine and displays the halogram logo on the top so im guessing its the real deal. whatever the case i like it. the silicone is very tight on the perimeter of the shell and doesnt look cheaply made. it will last a long time it seems. time will tell. the only issue i have is that the home button is a bit stiff and needs to be pressed harder to navigate but thats all i have to complain about. all the ports are covered (lightening/headjack) the speakers are exposed but thats ok. sound quality is great with no interference. overall a great case.
5	1355702400	This is a really great product just upgraded from a blackberry to the Iphone 5.  heard people saying how they had cracked their screens on their phones.  well with the way this product is built I think it would take quit a bit to damage the phone inside this case.
5	1355702400	This is my second otter box, i had one for my iphone4 and now one for my iphone5. The box adds a litte bit of weight and thickness but that is only a small thing. I can always trust that no matter  high it drop it from or what ever it lands on that the phone will be it perfect shape. i highly recommend it. the only other case that i can think of that is the same or better would be the life proof case but they come with a bigger price tag.
1	1355702400	I bought one of these, returned it, only got half of my money back, and purchased another.  When I received the first one, the plastic cover was coming off at the corner.  I was using the case with the holster.  (I bought the Otterbox at least a month before I received my iPhone 5.)  After a few weeks, I noticed that the middle rubber area that the phone snaps into the plastic holster was wearing the rubber down on both sides.  I called Amazon to have a return label sent.When I took the second case out of the box, the entire plastic screencover fell right off as if it wasn't even attached.  Of course, I wanted to take the plastic case that was currently on my phone off but I couldn't get it off my iphone!  I ended up taking it to work and a friend got it off with a metal tool and two sets of hands.  That was stressful because I was afraid we'd scratch my new iphone!So, after getting it off, I put on the new case and this plastic one snaps on and off without a problem.  The rubber is a darker gray and very loose.  The first case was tight and held to the phone well.  I tested the holster and it tears the rubber just like the first one did.  I use an old leather holster from my iphone 3gs.  Since the iphone 5 is longer, my phone sticks out fo the case.  So, if you buy this, don't plan on using the holster.  It will just ruin the case.For the return, I had to pay a shipping and a return fee.  They also charged an additional restocking fee that was about $12.  Everything I returned was damaged so there's nothing to restock.  I need to call and see if they'll credit that to me.  The return was damaged in every way.  I paid about $54 for the phone and received a $38 refund for a messed up case.I've had two Otterbox cases with past iphones and never had any problems.  This is just sad and such a hassle.  I know others have had issues and that would explain why the price dropped from around $50 to around $23.From reading other reviews, it sounds like it depends on where it was made....China or Mexico.  They were very, very different.I highly suggested buying it from a store.  That way you can put your phone in it and see how it feels.  In my opinion, the one made in China was better because the rubber was tight.
2	1355702400	I ordered three color, the Grey (Glacier), purple and black as gift to my co workers.  The purple one is straight forward to put together with the phone and the outer silicone is soft and flexible.  It was a breeze.However the Glacier one arrived with some scratches already, which looked like someone else already struggled with it before.The silicone is harder and not very stretching, and it's a PAIN to take it off, including the the plugs for the ports.  Once put together, I couldn't get rid of the air between the screen and the protector.I checked the black one and it felt like the purple.  so i might keep it.  But I am returning the Glacier.  So disappointed.
5	1355616000	I love this Otterbox Case for my iphone 5, I got it a few weeks ago being told it was one of the best you can get. And i agree with them 100%. Its a 3 piece phone case w/ a built-in screen protector, silcone/rubber like feeling for the outer layer which is nice cause it wont slide or fall off things as easily whereas other things would. its durable, the built-in screen protector doesnt affect the actual iphone screen at all, atleast not that ive ever noticed. also it comes with a 360 degree rotatable case clip holder which i use everyday.i would recommend this to anyone that doesnt want to have to worry about dropping their phone and it cracking to chipping.i give it a 5 star.
5	1355616000	All i was expecting. Nice and strong, just what u need to secure an investment like an iPhone or iPad.
4	1355616000	Got this until I could get a Lifeproof case. This works well but the Lifeproof case is slimmer lighter and water resistant to six and a half feet. Great around the water.
5	1355616000	I was surprised, I thought it would be really big and bulky. But it was very manageable, especially since I'm careless with my phone.
5	1355529600	Okay, cosmetically it is bulky, but does the job for protecting against drops, bangs, and bumps.The clip is great for extra security and it props up the phone.
5	1355443200	I'm glad that I purchased this case when it was on sale! I accidentally dropped my phone on my tile floor and my phone didn't get damaged. Very satisfied with the product.
5	1355443200	All my friend love this so I got it and it was amazing I love it so much also because I allways drop my 5 !!!! BEST CASE EVER
4	1355356800	I was kinda disappointed that wearing this otterbox on my iphone makes it really hard to press the home button.. I hate that it does that, But other than that everything's good!
4	1355356800	I just got this and after charging (a few hours) it was relatively easy to pair to my iphone 5.  I tried using spotify and the sound was great.  I called another cell phone and the receiving side said the signal was very good.  I will update this review or add a new one as time goes by and I discover new things, but so far seems good.
5	1355356800	This case and belt clip are great.  Very versatile.  The belt clip allows the phone to spin so you can have it horizontal or vertical.  It's a steep learning curve to get the iphone 5 into the case but worth the effort - there are videos on youtube.  I recommend it as I have already dropped it several times.
3	1355356800	ITS a GREAT product, (my friend got his IPHONE ranover 5times & OTTERBOX KEPT IN LOOKING BRAND NEW!)BUT I DONT like HOW IT shows WHITE when your looking the SCREEN, so REALLY i wish i got the BLACK ONE (BECAUSE ORGINALLY I LIKED the ALL SILVER COLOR!)!JESSE GW
5	1355270400	Got it on time, looks just like in the picture. I thought it was gonna be different being that is soooo cheap but its sooo good. I dropped the phone already 3 times, and nothing happened. Recommend it
5	1355270400	awesome deal on the best product even better price!!!too bad it was for the i-phone 5 not the 4 that i thoght i oredered...fotflmbo
5	1355270400	This case is superior to the 4 case in every way.  The case inner frame is more rigid and form fitting than the 4 case and the outer rubber skin is not flimsy at all.  My wife constantly complained about how the rubber skin stretched and wouldn't fit the case securely and it looked horrible.  Otterbox seems to have fixed that with this update and she's had it for 2 months.  The case also looks good and the wife doesn't mine keeping it on the phone on weekends.  GREAT case!!
5	1355270400	This case is rugged and seems like it will be great protection for my iphone 5.  It came very quickly and packaging was fine.  It was easy to put on and stays on tightly.  I love the fact that the screen is fully protected with this product.  The price through amazon was so much less than in the retail stores.
5	1355184000	I had been considering in purchasing an otterbox phone case for the long time. Ive bought the communter series and the one below it, but the Defender series takes the bakery. Its nice and compact. perfect for the protection of your pricy investment. So Kudos to the company, this product rocks!.
4	1355184000	I wanted full on protection for my iPhone 5, for the most part it does that. However the opening for the speakers and the cameras front facing and back allow dirt in between the phone and case so I have to open it and clean it often. But over all it's still great.
5	1355097600	this was a great choice for a case for my iphone 4 s.  Protects it wonderfully with a great color too!
5	1355097600	The otterbox series can't be beat. This is the single best case available for the iphone in my opinion. Perfect fit and very durable. Highly recommended!
4	1355097600	The rubber case is kind of flimsy and not as the same quality as you get at the cellular stores. But for the cost I got it as $15 plus shipping compared to retail at the cellular store of $50 it is so far so good. It has not broken or tore and so far satisfied with the purchase.
5	1355097600	This case is worth the price if you are paying below $25. It is a very good case but I would not pay more than $25 like they charge in the stores when you can buy them on Amazon for much cheaper! Def addicted to Amazon bcus of the prices! Great case for men who work construction or labor/warehouse jobs. My fiance is a manager at a grocery store warehouse & this case has really withstood a lot! Love that it has a built in screen protector, but still suggest putting a screen protector on under it bcus of dust getting in & possibly scratching in between.
4	1355011200	strong good built case for busy people... nothing special to show just works the way you need it to protect your phone
5	1354924800	Very easy to put on and stays on well. Really does children proof your phone well. Recommend for the clumsy as well :)
5	1354924800	Great case.  It's very durable as I have dropped it several times with no damage to the phone or case. The only con is that it is bulky but it is worth it.
5	1354924800	I got this for my husband because his working environment is crazy. I have to say it was great to see how much he loved it!
1	1354924800	If I could give negative stars, I would.  Worst Amazon experience ever.I thought I ordered a Glacier Otterbox Denfender series case for my iPhone 5 from Amazon through a storefront called "casedirectusa".  However, the order was fullfilled through Amazon.  I immediatly noticed that the screen protector was severly scratched, on the inside, and not glued very well either.  I purcahased the identical case from a brick and motor, corporate Sprint store.  After comparing the two cases, I came to the conculsion that the case I orignally purcahased from Amazon must be a knockoff.  This is based off of several varriations.1) the scratch2) the interior foam backing is crooked3) the hard plastic doesn't match up together perfectly4) the exterior rubber is much stiffer and harder to remove5) the clip is much more difficult to engage as the kickstand6) the box is very well worn, as if it was reusedAs a customer, my poor experience with the knockoff from Amazon almost kept my from buying another Otterbox product.  However, I'm glad I bought the real one.If you want an Otterbox Defender case, you want about the best protection so don't be cheap.  Go to a real store and buy a real one.
5	1354838400	Perfect!!! The case is everything I wanted it to be, I highly recommend it to anyone that has a cell phone.
5	1354838400	Great product, sturdy and well built, does what it's supposed to do. Seems it will last for a long time.
4	1354838400	I was using no case and I liked the slim feel of the iPhone5.  I know that this case protects my phone, but it feels a bit bulky and the home button is harder to push.
5	1354838400	Best case very cheap! Same a best buy ones! Amazing! Never better, worth the money! If you want protection get this case! YouTube is a good video! To to YouTube type in the search bar otter box Glacier iPhone 5!
5	1354752000	I bought the gray and white Otter box it's fits perfectly in the case. I was reading a couple reviews that said there phone didn't fit in the case perfectly. Well I didn't have that problem. Also this case isn't as bulky as pervious Otter box's.
5	1354752000	received the case and was so happy. It is sleek and easy to use. Gets the job done at protecting my phone
5	1354752000	A very good case very bulky but is what i need i had one in an iphone4 and i wanted another one for my new iphone 5 so this case offers very good protectoon
4	1354752000	The price is reasonable. The case is nice and really protective for my phone, but the problem is it make the phone heavy and bulky after installing, especially when I wear skinny jeans, there is a big bulge in my pocket. I will use the case for special occasions, but not for daily use.
5	1354579200	Love this!  My phone has gone to the concrete so many times, and Otter has saved it from complete ruin each time!  There a few very minor unconvinced with the bulkiness, but the benefits and protection FAR outweigh those!  This product is well worth the investment!!!
4	1354579200	Very nice! Fit well and not as bulky as I expected:)One thing: dust can get into the case easily and stays between the screen and the screen protector.
4	1354579200	I had an Otterbox Defender case on my iPhone 4S and thought it provided great protection from drops and scraps. Like any case, it wasn't perfect, but it served its primary function (protection from drops) very well. When I first received this new Otterbox case for my iPhone 5, I wasn't very impressed. It felt very cheap. But after I put it on my iPhone, I actually liked the look and feel of the case. It felt solid and I liked that it seemed less obtrusive than my 4S case. I didn't observe any movement of the phone within the case, as others have mentioned. However, I do have one minor criticism, and it is the same criticism that I had with the 4S case - the charger port cover. After opening and closing the charger port each day, the 4S charger port would not close after about 6 months of use. The iPhone 5 case has been redesigned and the port cover, which contained a "tongue and grove" system to keep it closed in the 4S case, now appears to simply be a "flap". There is nothing to prevent the port covered from opening after repeated use. After owning the case for about a week, I can already see that the flap is resisting closure and it's beginning to hang open. While these cases are not intended to last forever (I'm happy to replace my case every 6-8 months, if necessary. A $20 dollar case is better than a trashed phone), I do think that the design might be improved upon a little. I'm not looking for water proofing (I don't believe any case can provide this - just look at the Lifeproof case reviews) - water protection from the rain is fine. The main reason I put the case on my iPhone is to protect it from drops and scraps and so, even if the port cover remains slightly open, this is not a deal breaker for me. The case will still protect my phone. In reviewing many, many cases, I think that this case is still the best case for all around protection - and you can't beat the price!
5	1354492800	Otterbox can take a beating without ruining your phone.  As some one who dropped his phone out of his pocket on his wedding day only to have Apple tell me that it would be more expensive to fix it than buy a new iphone I learned my lesson.
5	1354492800	I was concerned when I read some reviews indicating this Otterbox was a knockoff.  I ordered anyway and am pleased to report the product I have received is genuine and in a retail package as advertised.
3	1354492800	If you are worried about protection of your phone than you will love this case.  If you are looking for something that allow you to put the phone in your jeans pocket, then keep looking!  This thing is GIANT!  I thought this case was great until I realized how much bulk it actually added.  It DOUBLES the thickness of the phone and feels like a brick in your pocket.  I ended up switching to a Speck case.
1	1354492800	what a disappointment...I paid full retail for this and have had it less than 2 weeks...I stopped using the holster because it is ripping and stretching the silicone outer "slipcover".Now I am getting the swirly rainbow moisture under the screen protector.Just spent a few days emailing otterbox warranty/support about my husbands iphone 4s defender case...his plastic holder was ripping and stretching his silicone slipcover and the little flaps were tearing off...but that took 5 1/2  months.... I am hoping I can get my money back...
5	1354492800	Otter box for Iphone5.  It works and looks great.  I was looking at the lifeproof but they were taking tooo long.
5	1354492800	for $20 i highly recomend it, you dont even notice the built in screen protector, and it protects like no other. and you dont really notice the bulk
5	1354406400	I am not worried at all about my phone being protected. Even though these cases are not waterproof, I have no doubt that liquids would have a hard time ruining my phone. Only downside is the phone case is a little bulky. I love the OtterBox cases, they do not break as easily as the other cases and are truly superb quality.
5	1354406400	Product is awesome. My teenage son uses it and the phone is still in perfect condition.This is a great case.
5	1354406400	I love it!!! Great case for extremely good price! Will definitely keep buying from yall.Do yall have any Green Bay Packer iPhone 5 cases I could buy?
5	1354406400	With this case, in a few years you could sell the for for new and people couldnt tell that it was used!Also other review says that sometimes it leaves a watermark. it is true, just wipe it off! take off the case and clean the screen protector! Easy
5	1354320000	I am a real estate agent, so all my stuff has to be on-the-go ready & user friendly. Otterbox is the only product manufacturer that produces a reliable product for me. In fact, this is the second Otterbox Defender Series iPhone case I have purchased, as I had one for my iPhone 4, and loved it. My new iPhone 5 survives all the bumps, scuffs, drops, and any other oops! I put it through. The color choices of this Otterbox Defender Series really leave a lot to be desired, but I purchased my iPhone 5 Defender in "glacier" to match the iPad 2 Defender case I bought in "crevasse".  They're now a matched, well-protected set!
2	1354320000	This has excellent phone protection, however as other reviewers stated, I get little watermarks under the screen protector. Doesn't seem to matter how often I take the case off to try to fix this problem, it's back in a few minutes. The other MAJOR problem I have with this is how stiff everything is. On the Otterbox 4 case, the home button is nice and supple, and the feature covers for the power connector and tab on the side are all easily removed for accessibility. Not so with this case. I have to take a pen or something equally hard just to get the tabs open to plug my phone in or place it in vibrate mode and have to press pretty hard on the home button just to get it to click down. Definitely not for me. I'll be sending this back once I'm able to find a case that's protective but also makes the phone more usable.
1	1354233600	Was really excited to finally buy a full blown otterbox with the full phone protection such as the screen protector and belt clip and everything...the case looks great but there is a gap between the protective screen protector and the actual iPhone screen which makes the phones touch screen capabilities work very poorly and incorrect due to the screen being risen. It's so much a problem that I couldn't bare with this major issue for more than a hour and removed the case. As much as you think you may want this otterbox case trust me you don't...until they fix the screen protector to fit properly it is a complete waste of money.really wish I wouldn't have wasted my money.
5	1354233600	Superior desing and durability compared to iPhone 4s cases. Its harder than previous cases and wont stretch over time and use.
5	1354233600	This case is real sturdy and good. My wife has the same series from another website and that is no where close to this. Absolutely strong. I needed something like this since I have a troublesome two at home :)For initial use the operation may feel tough but I guess it might be ok after some days.Worth the cost.
5	1354233600	iPhone 5 perfectly fits this case and sits well on the included belt clip. Though the phone looks bulky, but if you are like me ( who drops phone a lot) , this is the best way to ensure you do not end up with a broken glass on you iPhone like many others. And the price is much cheaper than what you need to pay at BestBuy or Verizon store.
4	1354147200	I've no doubt this badboy will protect my precious (iPhone 5, not ring of invisibility).  Very sturdy, and the touch screen is quite responsive.  So far no dust infiltration or scratches on screen or body of iPhone.  All of the buttons save the home button are appropriately responsive.  Some times you have to mash it in a bit to the phone to acknowledge the input.  The case is a titch bulky, but that's why it's called the defender series.
5	1354147200	Like all the other otter box's i've purchased, it works like a champ. Best protection for any apple product. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a case, it's literally the best one out there!
3	1354147200	i like the case, but i don't like that my fingerprint are very visible and you can hear my typing when the case is on. the flaps are also kind of a hassle to open and they are very deep. i don't like that the cameras are unprotected and that the case is not waterproof.
5	1354060800	These Otterbox Defender cases for the Iphone 5 typically cost upwards of $50 if you purchase them at the local carrier and retail stores.  It is a no-brainer that one would purchase the exact same case for $30 less and with no taxes or shipping charges.  Regarding the dynamics of this particular case, Otterbox has improved the feel and structure of the Defender cases over their previous Iphone 4 incarnation.  First and foremost, the outer skin is now constructed of a lint-proof rubber/plastic that feels great in the hand. Second, the skin fits much more snug and stealth-like over the skeleton of the phone.  I have read in other reviews where there is a halo effect on the clear screen protector.  Well, if one looks at their phone's screen when it is isn't on (which makes no sense to me), then, yes, one might be able to make out some rainbow-type effect when the phone is off and held at an angle to a bright light (who does this as common practice?).  This isn't an issue, though, because this doesn't exist when the phone is on, and who on earth looks at their phone's screen when it isn't on?? In sum, great case/great price.
3	1354060800	The case itself is very nice. I absolutely love the way the case looks however I find it to be too bulky to be comfortable.Sometimes I will have trouble taking it out of my pocket.It offers great protection, but personally it's too bulky and ruins the iPhone's design for me.If you need protection and don't care about the bulkiness then this is your case.
1	1354060800	First of all I have to say this is a nice case except for its bulky part. I would have given this a 5 star but the NEXT day I noticed small dots on the screen. It's not one or two it's ALL OVER THE SCREEN!! It's like a kid took a pencil and stabbed the screen 100 times. When the phone is off you can see it clearly if its under light. When the phones on its not a problem but still. I only put the case inside my jeans? Those dots really annoy me. ALSO you have to press the screen bit hard for the phone to respond. If you press slightly the phone doesn't catch it. I'm not very happy with that either. Also like the others I also see rainbowish color on the screen when turned off and in light. Not very dissatisfied but dissatisfied
5	1353974400	The case is stylish and proved to be a great gift for my aunt. She absolutely loved it. I also like the different color choices.
5	1353974400	Great product. The exact same thing you would buy at the store and less than half the price. No complaints there! OtterBox's are definitely a saving grace, especially if you are clumsy like me!
4	1353974400	I just got done putting this case on my phone and MAN IS IT STURDY. So sturdy, its almost bulky and slightly takes away from the great asthetics of my new iPhone5. However, I can tell this case is going to do what it is supposed to do. It was easy to install on to the phone. It doesn't look amazing, but it definatly isnt ugly. (glacier) It has easily doubled in size. I would never have paid the 50 dollars for this case as I just think thats too much for something so bulky. I paid 23, and I would do it again. I feel like I can now breathe easier now that my phone is properly protected. I just wish it was more attractive.Biggest Pro - I LOVE the built in screen protector. Best one Ive ever used, was the main reason I bought this case. It works perfectly without having to worry about bubbles or creases.Biggest Con - Bulkiness, not great looking.
5	1353974400	Great case to protect my iPhone 5.  Can't even tell there is a front screen protector on it... Doesn't affect the look of the screen at all.
5	1353888000	This case is absolutely awesome for the iPhone 5! I have the white iPhone and it is a perfect fit! It looks great and protects it. Absolutely recommend this product to everyone! They made the rubber alot tougher on the outside and it sits perfectly flush with the the plastic casing.
5	1353888000	The phone case arrived in its original Otterbox packaging. This is a great deal. You should take advantage of it!
5	1353801600	quick ship, everything was expecting, real good price, my wife is so very glad to have found such a great deal
4	1353715200	This is my first Otterbox and purchased for my first IPhone.  I normally use feminine phone cases but phones end up beat up.  The case is durable but heavy and clunky.  I like it though.  I can drop my phone in the car's cup holder, my purse or my turnout pants pocket at work and not have to worry about it.  One issue is that if you have a car or wall charger for your IPhone5 that has the 30 pin adaptor on the end..it won't work with this case.  The opening at the bottom of the case is too small for it to fit.  The other issue is that it is a pain to get the phone apart when you have not done it before.  I had to watch a YouTube video to figure it out.
5	1353715200	Works just as well, if not better than the Otter case we had on our iPhone 4's. If you were accustomed to bulk of your iPhone4 in the Otter case then this case will be like a dream. It fits well in cargo pockets and has already bounced on the ground without issue. The ports are deep within the case but I have had no problem accessing them. I haven't seen the water spot that was discussed in other reviews. Perhaps they fixed it?Great case! Glad I bought it.
5	1353715200	I've ordered &#34;Otterboxes&#34; on Amazon before and compared to this, they are crap. This one is not rubbery and fits very nicely. This will protect my iPhone for a long time!
5	1353715200	Purchased case for iPhone 5. The case certainly provides adequate protection on all fronts. It does add substantial weight and bulk. No worries about dropping or scratching though. Easy to put on (and take off, if necessary) and fits very well. Screen responsiveness does not seem to be degraded much, if at all, and reception and sound clarity remained the same.
5	1353628800	I had a customer tell me he ran over his iPhone with his car.  Twice.  It went unharmed both times because it was in an OtterBox.  Each of my iPhones has survived 3 kids, a husband, and a dog.  None of my 3 iPhones ever had a scratch on them.  Literally.  I bought this BEFORE I ordered the iPhone 5.  I swear by these things.  The only improvement would be if they made them waterproof, too.
3	1353628800	I wanted a case-holster combo for my iphone 5 that had better protection than the one I bought from Verizon store for my 4S. Not to many choices yet, this case is well known for its protection, which I will confirm is second to none, and it happened to be on sale for like $30. From the moment it arrived I knew I would not like it (I hate bulky big phones), however I have to say that the included screen protector that is part of the case is really good. I have to say the holster looks really cheap and it isn't easy to get the phone off your hip, then its even harder to click it back in the holster. It does have a kickstand which was a nice addition. If you absolutely need all this protection, this is the case for you. Everyone else look elsewhere. In all truth the iphone 5 is way to good looking to be hiding in one of these.I would reccomend to those who neglect their phone or have physically demanding jobs that may put you phone at risk.I would not reccoment to anyone else.
5	1353628800	I got the white/grey one and I love it!  Seems to be tought yet not cumbersome.  It still looks sleek.
5	1353369600	I like the defender for my iPhone 5. It fits well and seems to be pretty rugged. It is a little bulky but I knew that going in and opted for the extra protection. Buttons all work easily thru the case and I've had no problems with touch screen thru the case.
4	1353369600	I must say, I like the feel of the new case for iPhone 4 and 5. Of course, this is a 5 case.Pros: feel of rubber - not sticky like the old onePhone seems secure.Openings for camera easier to cleanOpenings for switch and earphone seem goodCons: opening for lightning connector does not stay closed.
3	1353283200	This case does exactly what it states: protects your iPhone 5 from damage.  All the openings and port covers line up on the phone perfectly.  I had no problems operating the buttons on the phone with the case in place. The belt clip is very sturdy and holds the phone and case in place without problems. I listen to music on my iPhone when I'm outside running, so it's important that the holster hold the phone securely despite the vibrations created during exercise.There are two major issues with this case: 1) it doubles the width of the iPhone making it very bulky and heavy. I wouldn't mind that as much were it not for the second problem.  2) There is a lot of static and the sound cuts out on voice calls when using earpods/earbuds with this case on the phone. Music sound quality was not an issue. The problem is with voice calls only. I went to the Apple store twice thinking that either the iPhone or my earpods were defective...I was wrong. I made a call after removing the outer rubber layer and there was much less static. Next, I removed the plastic inner shell and made another call. I had no trouble hearing voice calls after that.Another minor problem is that the built-in screen protector decreases touch sensitivity. Some may find that a major problem given touch features are what makes the iPhone so great.Bottom line: This is a great case for protecting your iPhone 5 if you can tolerate the extra bulk and degraded quality on voice calls. The problems exceeded my tolerance level and I returned the case. Another reason for returning it was that the case I received was different than the picture of the one I ordered. Amazon was great and processed my return very quickly.
3	1353283200	Not garbage. Not awesome. 3 stars is fair.I bought an Apple product and was hoping that this would be the same. Of course i am disappointed.I have no idea where old &#34;five stars&#34; gets off with his assumptions.The one thing in the advertising that is FALSE is about audio output. It does not. The Apple product does. This product will allow you to sync and charge. So if you want it to extend the life of your old Apple cables then this is for you.Of course most of us wanted to be able to buy several and use our Apple compatible devices including our docks and in the car. If this is your aim then look elsewhere. Don't waste your time with this half way there product.
5	1353110400	I love this case. I was a little worried about buying this product because of some of the reviews but I love it.  I love the build in protective screen and it does not feel like it is even there. It is not bulky like some of the reviews stated
4	1352851200	This case does exactly what it says--protects your iphone 5 like crazy. The plastic shell snaps on and provides structural rigidity to the case. The plastic shell has a built in screen protector. The silicone layer fits over the plastic and adds extra impact protection since it is a shock-absorbing material. I ultimately returned this case because I found it too bulky for my tastes, but since this is my personal preference it does not negatively impact the review. The 4-star rating is due to the screen protector issues and port covers as described in the following paragraphs.I found that the port covers (covers headphone jack, charger port, and external silence switch) were fairly difficult to open. I had to use my fingernails and really pry them open. This is good, since it really keeps out the dust and elements, but it is also annoying. I use the silencing switch often, and I really wish that it hadn't been covered since it is annoying to uncover it every time I turn the phone on/off silent mode. Since this is not really a &#34;hole&#34; into the phone, I don't see a reason to cover this switch like they did. Plus, even when the port cover is open, the plastic shell makes it really difficult to use this switch. With bigger hands, I had to use my pinky fingernail to turn this switch on and off (my other fingers couldn't fit in the space around the switch).The screen protector is a useful feature, but like other reviewers I found that it would contact the screen in some points and create a halo appearance in certain points. This was slightly annoying in that it was noticeable, but did not make it unusable by any means. It was also difficult to prevent dust from getting under the screen protector since the protector was not attached to the phone itself. This is only a problem if you take this case off and want to put it back on. Every time I put it on, it was a painstaking process to ensure no dust was in between the protector and the phone's screen.Those gripes out of the way, the case is overall comfortable, well-designed, and offers great protection for your phone. It more than doubles the phone's thickness and adds about a centimeter in height and width. This made the phone too bulky for me and I returned the case. But for those who need extreme protection, this is a necessary compromise. If you absolutely need maximum protection for your phone, this is a great case. If you just want something to protect from scratches and minor bumps/falls, there are other cases out there that are cheaper and smaller but still add great protection.  Thanks for reading!
5	1352851200	I was skeptical about purchasing this case at first, as some of the reviews said the case was slightly too large, making the iPhone 5 move around.  However, I also realized that all the reviews for each type of case have been lumped into one.  So to clarify: I ordered the otter box defender series.  This case fit PERFECTLY and I have had absolutely no issues with it for the last several weeks.  I love how protected my iPhone is, and I wouldn't use any other case!
5	1352592000	Great case, i really liked the color scheme. got shipped earlier than expected. chillin! and im not just saying that!
5	1352505600	I got this case way before I got my iPhone 5 ( around 2 weeks in advance).Working in a university based setting I noticed that i phones are of 3 types : No scratches, no glass broken cased iPhone (around 40 %), no scratches, no glass broken non cased iPhone (around 20%) and broken/ scratched uncased iPhone (40%)A lot of students and many coworkers have iphones, but a large number of them also have broken screens/ broken back glass (no longer much of a problem with the iPhone 5) and since repair is expensive, none of them bother getting it repaired or changed, and trust me a broken iphone looks just plain ugly.So when I wanted to get a case, I wanted a no compromise, super safe, sturdy case which I could use in every setting : when using public transport, to take a quick peek out of the pocket in adverse weather (rain/snow), accidentally dropping it off my bed/night stand, and this case fits its all !It comes with a rubber (ized plastic?) outer shell, flexible yet sturdy which can be pried off the inner hard shell case. The inner hard shell case itself comes with an inbuilt screen guard and a foam back. There is a cover over the apple logo on the back, but no plastic cover for the camera or the earpiece.The innards of the hard shell are pretty protective enough, its a comfy fit - not too tight, not to loose that the iPhone will get jostled about in it. The back contains a foam thing so that the back is not in direct contact with the hard shell. The sides and front (except the screen) are pretty much unguarded from the plastic, and one should hope for the best.The screen guard is one touchy topic here. The screen guard is such that its stuck to the inner wall of the hard shell. 2 problems - one is that there is a small (very very minute) gap between the screen and the screen guard, which makes typing sort of slightly inaccurate. For example - when you press 's' on the qwerty it tends to type it as 'a' and things like that. Another problem is that the screen guard in general reduces the sensitivity if the iPhone screen, some touches wont get registered on the screen and things like that.I have heard of the Spigen Glas.t being used in conjunction with the Otterbox Defender, but I'm not sure how much it would fit in given that the glas.t is pretty thick by itself. One will also have to pry off the inbuilt screen guard from the otterbox to use this, though I'm not sure if this will compromise the water safety of the screen guard.The case is thick, fat and ugly, it can fit into a baggy jeans pocket, a normal jeans pocket with some effort but don't try fitting it into a tight pocket, coz it will be a pain to get it out. But the size doesn't matter to me, all I wanted was protection - and this case does it well. If you are generally clumsy, or just have a lot of bad luck, then this case is for you. If you want to see the prettiness of the iphone 5 everyday, then this case is not for you. Its a trade off between style and functionality.But it does as is advertised. Also it comes with a holster which can be clicked into position such that it acts as an iPhone stand on your table/desk. This can be pretty useful if you charge it on your work desk like me. I don't use the holster as a holster though because it just looks silly.
5	1352505600	i got this case to protect my new iphone 5 ive used otterbox cases on my iphone 3 my atrix 4g and my xoom tablet and this case is by far the best case they've made i highly recommend these cases for anyone who wants to protect their electronic investments
5	1352332800	Try cleaning both screens with rubbing alcohol, and then letting dry followed by wiping with a microfiber cloth.  Make sure you do not touch both screens with your fingers.  I have tried this procedure and for more than two weeks no water marks. This is a great case.  Does add bulk, but if you have children and a busy lifestyle you cant go wrong with this purchase.  Excellent case so far.  Also, the Iphone 5 sits in place without any movement, unlike some other reviews.  The protective screen is very good.  I bought the glacier version, very nice!
5	1352246400	Very protective yet attractive looking phone case. This is actually much sleeker compared to previous OtterBox models. I would recommend this to anyone. Also, I love the Glacier color.
1	1352160000	I'm ashame that otterbox did this, but I can guess why there is a gap clearance when you put the iphone 5 inside the otterbox. Otterbox must of build their initial designs for this iphone 5 around rumors or pre-spec and did not realize how smaller the phone is compare to thier specs and probably just went ahead and ship the orders they have made. I have brought at least 10 otterbox from them and now I am very dissappointed. The problem can be easily remedy by folding a small piece of paper and pressing it into the gap. Shame on you otterbox.
5	1352073600	It's a bit costly but short of blowing it up with explosives I don't think this phone can get damaged in a case of this quality the only exposure this case leaves open is the speaker slots and if I didn't have to listen to music or the calls on the headset it would be completely covered, I am confident that not even water is an issue while I wouldn't test that theory because of the cost of the i5 I have no doubt that if not completely submerged there would be no damage what so ever and I did reluctantly test that theory having to go out in heavy rain. Even the screen protector is sealed to the case and withstands more than average impacts and scratches, I would never think of trusting my iPhone to any other case without a doubt!!!
4	1351987200	this case will protect your phone. trust me. it's easy to put on and take off but it's sooooo big. can't even tell I have an iPhone 5
5	1351987200	This is my first otter box case that I've owned an haven't really given it the ultimate test yet i.e really smashing my phone. I have although dropped it several times and found the rubbery case to almost sort of bounce when dropped onto hard surfaces.  Another good thing is that it seems to be pretty grippy.  The screen protector does not hinder the use of the touchscreen features.
5	1351728000	I am so happy with this purchase, otterboxes make it a lot less scary to have an expensive phone. cause if you drop it? It's gone. Unless you have an OTTERBOX. Buy this. I was lucky and bought it when it was no sale so it was really cheap. buy it.
3	1351468800	Sure it's an otterbox, but still, I found it pretty clunky (as compared to a 4s otterbox).  I found the feel and responsiveness of the screen with the cover and the *noise* my screen taps made just a little bit too much of an inconvenience.  Also had annoying lint getting between the screen protector and screen.I went with an incipio case instead, not nearly as much protection but much slimmer and more functional.
4	1351209600	The outer case is a little rubbery so the phone doesn't slip around when you set it somewhere like on the couch arm. It seems very solid. The touch screen works amazingly well through the protective shield. It does make the phone very large losing the effect of the slimmer iPhone.
5	1351036800	For my iPhone 4 I purchased the otterbox before leaving the ATT store. I really liked it. When I purchased my iPhone 5 I did some looking around. Obviously I went back to Otterbox to see what was available now. I decided on the Defender vs the next version up after reading all the reviews. I am so glad I did! The version I had before had the rubber shell that made it difficult to get in and out of pockets. This version works great. I have seen NONE of the problems that others have reported about the covers for the plugs or typing on the screen. These covers really feel like they will last as long as the phone. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend that if you have to slip your phone into your pockets and yet want the protection, this is your case!
4	1350777600	I bought this case for the iphone 5 because I want the best protecting possible for my phone for a few reasons. Firstly because buying a good case is a lot cheaper than potentially haveing to replace the phone, I can be rough on my phones and it makes me feel more confident holding my phone while doing demanding activities because I am not as worried about dropping my phone or getting it scratched. This particular otterbox offers the highest level of protection the company offers. I like the fact that it does not add a ton of "bulkyness," to the device while still being pretty protective.There are disapointing aspects though. Firstly the case was not made as well as it could have been. There was some access rubber that had not been properly removed during production. The case seems to become weaker and does not fit together as it did the first time if you take it on and off your phone a few times. Also, the part of the phone that would touch the phone in the front above and around the screen is just solid plastic. It would be nice to have a rubber coating there to increase shock absorbsion and make sure the sureface of the phone is not scratched. Otterbox definitly has a superior product and they know that due to the high demand. For what it is, it is extremly overpriced but considering supply and demand it seems to be working out for the company. It just sucks knowing that I paid a lot more for a product than it is actually worth to get the "otterbox." I had a case on my droid x2 made by Incipio that was a full silicone case and then it had a second stage that was hard plastic that fit around the rubber. It was almost identicle to an otterbox, I found it on amazon for $12 I think and it lasted 2 years and is still in great shape and I have dropped my phone quite a bit; no scratches or anything on the phone. Overall though, good product and worth it considering the cost of replacing the actual phone.
5	1350691200	I was skeptical about this case to being with. I had an OtterBox for my iPhone 4 and it wasn't very impressive. However this case fixed all the problems I had with my iPhone 4 case. The case doesn't get stuck in my back pocket, is relatively thin (specially for the amount of protection it provides), and no interference with my camera. Over all this case is pretty awesome, better then I expected, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good protective iPhone case but doesn't want to carry around a brick.
2	1350432000	The lightning to 30 pin adapter doesn't fit in the port with the cover on. Somebody wasnt thinking ahead.  needs to be redesigned.
5	1350172800	Great product; they have really learned from past mistakes. The rubber outer part is more durable and feels sturdier. This is probably the best case out there for the iphone.
4	1350172800	I bought the otterbox case as the new iphone 5 came out, and I was considering other options for case protection. However, I had used otterbox before and knew quality was amazing. I got the Gray/White one..... it matches perfect with my white iphone. My only complaint is that the back side does not have a protective film for the camera. Other than that, I love using it.
1	1349913600	So.....I've always used an otterbox defender for my iphone, but this time around there's a damn halo effect/watermark in the center region that is very displeasing to the eyes...For $50, I'd expect the people at otterbox to make a damn good case, especially when their margins are so damn high. I will be returning the case, and will look at exploring other options, or maybe get an updated version of this case. I will say this, the weight of the phone + case together is much lighter than the previous model.OTTERBOX....STEP IT UP...SERIOUSLY...PS. The mute/unmute switch is hard to reach with people with bigger hands....
5	1349913600	I'm hard on my phones. I drop them a lot. I've had an Otterbox Defender on all my iPhones since my first, a 3GS. I've dropped my phone countless times on concrete, tile, whatever. I've never had a broken screen or even a visible scratch. I give full credit to the otterbox for saving me what could have been hundreds of dollars in replacement costs.I have to laugh at the other reviews that say how bulky or ugly this otterbox is. Compared to earlier models, the is the thinnest, and best looking defender case ever. Otterbox created a new case for the iPhone 5 and didn't just update the previous version.
5	1349568000	I must say after owning several OtterBox cases. I like this one more than any of the others.First, while it still adds bulk to your shiny new iPhone 5. It's not as bad as it has been in the past.The rubber surround on this case is by far the best part. Unlike my iPhone 4 case that had a loose, flimsy feel to it. This outer case has a nice tight fit to it without any free movement. The port covers are also thicker and actually stay in place when closed! You'll have to work at it a little to open them when needed.If I have a complaint it's that the silent switch is hard to get to. The opening is a little tight for a normal size finger tip. With that said, I use the do not disturb feature that's include in IOS 6 instead.If anyone is interested. I was able to put a bestskinever on the front and back of my phone and it still fits in the case. I'm surprised to be honest. There are days I take it out and it's nice to know that my screen and back are still protected from scratches.
5	1349308800	This case is much better than the Otterbox case for the iPhone 4 and 4S. The rubber case that surrounds the hard plastic is very sturdy and I can tell it will not get loose over time around the home button like the other cases. The hard plastic now extends down further and the rubber over the home button tucks down under the plastic.This case is worth the money.
5	1349222400	I received my iPhone 5 today, and it fit perfectly into my Otterbox Defender case.  Almost every inch of the phone is protected, except the camera areas and the speakers.  I feel like I could throw this against the wall, and my phone would come out perfect.  However I'm not going to try.  The phone fits solidly into the case, and there's no rattle or movement at all.The only problem was a "bubble" or defect on the screen cover that my eye keeps finding... otherwise it's perfect and I still give it a 5/5.
4	1349136000	I have to retract my original comment after I finally found the Defender Web site and the U-Tube video on how to assemble the case! The instructions that come with the case are horrible and no written instructions! After I watched the video I realized that I had half of the plastics case upside down! This from an electronic engineer so if it happens to you don't feel bad! Make sure you clean inside the screen before assembly because it attracts a lot of dust and debris from shipping! Overall, this is a GREAT case and the rubber plugs will really help prevent high humidity from getting into the phone  and shutting down its operation!
5	1349049600	The folks at Otterbox have their act together.  Instead of just releasing a new case with different dimensions, Otterbox made some changes to the case that address previous versions shortcomings.1. Harder outside silicone.  On the old case the silicone was relatively soft.  The port covers would "mush" into place and the grippy tackiness of the case would cause pockets to turn inside out and dust and dirt to accumulate.  On the iPhone 5 the outer silicone case is harder, more dense, and smooth (albeit some tactile feeling).  The port covers snap smartly into place and stay there (on my iPhone 4 OB case, the charging port would come open through out the day).  The silicone outside case of the iPhone 5 is more of a molded feeling and a huge improvement over the iPhone 4/4S case.2. Belt Clip - The new belt clip is less bulky than the 4/4S.  Both this case and the old case hold the phone in place.  The iPhone 5 belt clip holds the phone in place at three points  (Instead of one large lip on one side of the belt clip), this makes for a lighter clip and allows you to put the phone in almost any orientation.  The rotating mechanism is smoother and the loud clicking noise of the old case is no longer.Overall the phone fits perfectly into the case.  Yes the phone is a bit bulkier.  It's also very well protected.  The case isn't waterproof, but the majority of areas are covered and protected.  Accessing these areas is less cumbersome compared to the older Otterbox cases.  The screen is very sensitive through the plastic protection cover.  If there is a loss in sensitivity, I don't notice it.  The screen protector is hardly distinguishable on the phone.  There are no air bubbles or gaps between the protector and the glass.I purchased around 12 different cases for my iphone 4.  The Otterbox for the iPhone 4 was good, but I was frustrated with the bulkiness and softness of the outside silicone shell.  I am confident that this will be the only case I purchase for the iPhone 5. Well Done Otterbox!!
4	1348444800	It is the first time that I use Otter Defender as a case.  The reason I choose this case, is first there is not much a option for Iphone 5 cases...  Since I bought it the 2nd day it was release.  And second reason is, I heard that, the back of the black iPhone suffer from scuffing, or easily scratch...when you put it in your pocket,with a key or coins.  I give Otterbox a try.  First, I feel thou it is a solid case, which even I drop my iPhone it will withstand any damage.  But the downside your iphone will look like an old iPhone.  You will loose the the nice design of a iPhone 5.  I am sure this is just a temporary case for me until I find a better one with better case with better aesthetic design.  But I am sure I will keep this one, in case I need a rugged case, on a rugged situation.And the reason I only gave it a four start, is I hate the screen protector.  Which causes watermark especially when you are using a 3rd party screen protector... likes of Zagg or other industrial design screen protector.  I remove Otter Box screen protector, which is only held by a glue, not a biggie... since I have a industrial strength screen protector.
1	1348444800	dont buy it. Finger print everywhere..very hard to put on...you need to soak the thing in water and wait 1 day for it to dry..not scratch proof completely useless
4	1348358400	I realize if you are shopping for an Otterbox, you are beyond pretty and want functional. But come on, it's so ugly! Even the 4 cover was nicer looking. It has made some improvements from the iPhone 4 cover. I had 2 Defender covers for my iPhone 4 because I let my 3 yr old play with my phone. It's been chucked across IKEA, thrown out of shopping carts, and dropped on the floor daily. Never a dent or chip to my phone. Because of that, I've been a die hard Defender lover. This new version is VERY thick plastic unlike the 4 version which both ended up breaking in multiple places. This seems much sturdier. But it's still insanely heavy and bulky. Which is a shame to have such a nice phone and not even get to see or feel how light and pretty the phone is. For some people, you may have a job or a lifestyle where pretty isn't an option and you need sturdy, if that is the case, go with the Defender. I've decided to be shallow and just get the apple care and a nicer looking cover. I got the Black Defender cover and it's like putting on big black chunky glasses, so ugly. There is nothing redeeming about the way it looks. At least the previous ones had a little style to it.Also worth mentioning, it's insanely hard to get the case on and off. If you plan on docking it, you will be very frustrated. It's not as easy to get on and off as the previous model.
5	1348012800	Ok so this review is a bit premature due to the fact the phone ain't out yet. But I am basing this on the quality of what I got in the mail.It's constructed well, te "glacier" color is cool and I expect nothing but the quality history I am used to. I have put an otterbox on every phone since the 3GS. If the phone comes and the case doesn't fit well or something goes wrong I will adjust my review.
2	1347926400	I received the Otterbox Defender in Glacier today. First impression, good... product feels sturdier and much improved over the previous iPhone4/4s version. The silicone skin is smoother and more rugged without being overly chunky feeling. And you can feel confident taking the case apart that the silicone won't tear. The plastic shell appears and feels sturdy also. Even with the extra length of the case it still slides in and out the pocket smooth.After further inspection my disappointments are with the clear protective film windows or lack of them. The camera lens and flash opening have no covering over them at all. Leaving those openings totally exposed to the elements and pocket lint. And the speaker and mic holes have nothing covering them either. I can imagine how much dust, lint and dirt will find it's way into the case to scratch up the phone. I guess it's a good thing that the silicone feels sturdier because you'll have to take the case apart repeatedly to keep the phone clean. I'll keep it and use it until the Lifeproof case is released for iPhone 5.
5	1347840000	This is an early review as I just received my Glacier Defender 5. It's slimmer than the Defender for the iPhone 4. Obviously taller. The hard plastic shell has six points of click clousure rather then the three before. The rubber silicone skin seems tougher and firmer. The packaging is modern plastic rather than cardboard recyclable. Just on first handling it's much nicer than the previous gen, not diminishing the 4 series. I've dropped my iPhone and not a scratch or damage. It just protects it like nobodies business.I'll add more when I get my iPhone 5 and can fully test. This is so far, very impressive.Edit: I uploaded some pictures and also did a YouTube video unboxing, search "iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender"Amazon removed my link.Edit: I added more photos. 9/18/12Edit: 9/22/12My iPhone 5 arrived yesterday. I assembled the Defender around it. It fits like a glove. The screen is crystal clear and touch is as responsive as on the glass itself. The underlying image is beautiful and clear, no distortion to my eyes. Based on the crazy lightness of the iPhone 5 the Defended 5 is fairly light to hold. I heard the 5 was lighter but when I compared it to my 4, WOW.Grip is good, I feel some "sharpness" on some grips that I never noticed on the 4. Nothing bad, just different. Two things I do notice are the bottom flaps. I have a headphone set with a medium large jack. It barely fits, it actually forces the Defender apart just a bit when I click it in. I'm also concerned that Apple's Lightning to Old Dock Connector adapter will either not fit or be VERY tight. I don't have one so I'll let the first reviewer who buys one comment. Just concerned.I also notice when wearing it on my belt it is easier to get to my pocket than the 4 was. It is trimmer by a good bit. This is really good for me as it was alway a fight to get my keys out with the Defender over my pocket.Overall I'm very happy and will report if things change. I'm sticking with five stars.
5	1347062400	I've bought bamboo blend and full bamboo towels. The Pinzon blend were absolutely great. Unfortunately Amazon decided to not stock them anymore. The full bamboo towels were dissapointing, only in the thickness, they were ok otherwise. So now I figure I had to try sheets. I did some homework and found mostly happy reviewers. I tried the Malouf brand as I recently bought their Z Pillows and they are oversized (queen) and figured the reference to generous sized pillow cases was not an accident. Yep, the pillow cases are 36" long and do fit, barely. I would have like 40" for these monsters but it's better than everything else I've got.I washed them before using them for the first time. As with most bamboo products they need extra drying time, don't go for more heat. The big sheets came out fine the pillowcases could use ironing on the trim, but I'm lazy. On they went. The fitted has rubber all the way around and easily fit my 12" memory foam mattress. The flat sheet is very generous in size and tucks in nicely. Malouf doesn't tell the thread count and they aren't super thick. I can see the mattress design showing through. Still, they are super soft and smooth. I've never felt anything like them. Almost like a very thin suede, is my best analogy.When you throw out the sheet to cover the bed there is a very unusual "flow" to the sheet as it rides on the air. It is almost fluid in its movement as it drops. Again, like nothing I've seen before. They are a joy to sleep on. Bamboo is supposed to have a wick away quality to help you keep cool. I can say that I slept very comfortably and didn't sweat from them at all. I usually only buy 100% cotton for that very reason. This is my first change from the usual. I've sept on them for a few night now and really like them a lot. As for durability and multiple washings, that will come as I amend this review.For my initial reaction, they are fantastic and somewhat cheaper, at $70 for Queen, than others I looked at. I'm giving a big thumbs up and if I get an answer as to thread count, I asked, I'll post it here. The box also doesn't mention it. They are made in China.Update:10/13/12I've laundered them a few times now and they retain their softness and some noticed wrinkles are relaxing. I don't iron, hehehe. Still enjoying them as much as my first reaction. I did get a response from Malouf as to thread count. I was told it wasn't a relevant number as bamboo is much thinner threads than cotton so the numbers don't relate. Not sure if that's true so I'll say they are thinner and more transparent than higher count cotton. Still, loving them.Another reviewer noted these are cotton blend? I don't see that noted but I've since tossed the cube box and never saw a blend notification. Another question for Malouf.Update: 4/1/14Still enjoying them, though some sweat stains are a bit difficult to get out. Overall very happy.
5	1344643200	This is the second time I purchased these batteries. They are about half the cost and last just as long (about a week) as batteries you buy elsewhere.
5	1342396800	this is a A-1 product. grg makes a top quality part and the price can't be beat. its a American made part and the quality reflects that! go ahead and save a nickel on a chinese made product and wonder why it failed when you needed it the most... don't try to save money when the thing your using it for is going to keep you alive when you can buy American for the same price
5	1335225600	This item is exactly what it's advertised as.  It's great.  Just what I needed. I love it.  Just as it is.
3	1334275200	I was really excited when I received this item in the mail. Within two days, the zipper broke. I've had to switch to an old purse. The purse is super cute but messed up.
5	1323734400	Did not expect much but its cheap and works great! Only gripe the volume cutout was not opened and had to cutout myself...but it was easy. Also some openings needed shaving from the injection mold to get a clean edge look.The case is a hard urethane plastic like a rollerblade wheel. It has the same tackiness too even with a shiny surface but slides easily in the pocket. If placed on a car console its plastic tackiness grips so it does not slide or collect lint. Its shiny so it does show some fingerprints but cleans easily.Overall up close critical eye...a cheap looking case but everyone commented the case looks great from a distance, nice and shiny can't see the edges, does not add any bulkiness to phone and can get to all the openings needed plus a very tight fit w/no looseness around the edges. Only time will tell if it lasts awhile but for the price can buy another to replace if needed.
5	1314057600	Makes me feel at ease!!!! Knowing I can have a glass of wine at dinner and not having to worry about my baby getting any of the alcohol!
2	1306800000	the swimming suit is beautiful, I usually wear size M but base on  others reviews I decided to go for the large size, it fit fine but the cup zise still to small. This swimming suit is for a woman that wears cup 30 or 32, I am cup 34 and it didnt fit me well at all. However, the swimming suit is realy cute, shame that I cant wear it.
4	1283731200	it's a great product. You must have discipline with the pills and it will works perfect
4	1195257600	Camera comes with 2 levels of software installed but has to be updated just to use....we already had taken pictures as there was nothing in the instructions that told you do download first. the website wasn't easy to use and I could never get thru to tech support on the phone....BUT, once I got the software downloaded/upgraded, it's great....nice pictures, you can edit/delete while viewing the slide show....
