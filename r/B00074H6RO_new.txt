4	1404950400	The functioning of these gloves are as stated in the description, however the inside part of the gloves are softer and definitely not leather. The outside seems to be leather covered which would benefit the customer who's looking for a boxing/training glove. The product does its job for the most part and protects your hands but they are fingerless after all which won't protect your fingers.
5	1404950400	Perfect workout gloves. If you wear medium...get these in &#34;large&#34;. Very stylish, too.
5	1404777600	Got these when I bought a Bowflex Blaze. I measured my hand per the size chart, and came up with 8.5&#34;, so I ordered the X-Large. They fit well.
5	1404777600	Husband Loves his workout gloves!!!
4	1404691200	Looking good so far!  Sturdy build!
5	1404691200	I do a lot of barbell exercises and exercises requiring a ton of grip. I used to go to a gym where we could use chalk and grip would never be a problem. However, after returning to an annoying bourgeois gym, I needed a durable glove to prevent slipping while sweating. The Harbinger 143 seems to accomplish all of that thus far. Highly recommended for its value
3	1404604800	Sure they do what I want and are well padded, but the wrists have a limited amount of adjustability for us ectomorphs with long thin hands / fingers.
2	1404604800	Ran small.  Owned a similar pair from this same company but these are too tight.  Better off buying at a store and paying the extra amount knowing you'll actually use them.
3	1404518400	Don't think these will work for wheelchairs. I needed them for gripping and they are too slick. They would probably work well for bicycling
4	1404518400	goog fit! the get dirty fast but there still holding! used them every day!
5	1404432000	use them as wheelchair gloves. had for 2 years and they still haven't worn out
5	1404345600	Excelente
4	1404259200	They fit perfectly! a good price for its value.
5	1404172800	I have big hands and these work and fit great.  I have ruined my hands and hope these will help heal them from lifting without them.
5	1404086400	I was looking for open fingered gloves to replace my old ones I have had for years.  These fit the bill nicely.  Very well made of quality materials.  Very flexible while strong enough to protect my hands when working.  I like them a lot.  Highly recommended.
4	1403913600	Decent gloves for the price. They are a little too padded, but once worked in they seem better. Will leave some staining on hands when sweating, but this is easily wiped off with a little soap and water. I've had them for a few months and they've held up well.
5	1403827200	Not much really to say about these but they are good fit just fine would continue to purchase brand when these wear out
5	1403827200	Bought the Tan pair which lasted around 7 months and loved every minute w/ them. I replaced them w/ the black style, but noticed immediately the difference in the structure of the leather. They worked well, but began to tear after 2 months of use. I left those in my car for backup and purchased another tan pair. Have had a few friends purchase these as well after my recommendation, and they're very happy also. I lift at least twice a week about 1hr 1/2 each time(supersets 1min rest) Highly recommend the TAN version. My originals, still usable, are in my home closet next to a ab roller I never use.
3	1403654400	good quality, but they have that weird smell.
5	1403654400	gloves are very functional and withstand periodic washing. The price is excellent. I was able to purchase 2 pairs for the price of one pair of similar glove at a sports apparel store.
5	1403568000	They look as manly as they feel comfortable.  Grip could be better, but they deserve 5 stars.
1	1403568000	The gloves are uncomfortable and after every time I use them, they leave black dye on my palms. It's so annoying to use.
4	1403481600	The come in slightly larger than expected. I measured my palm, per the picture provided, and have even purchased other gloves (size large) and it still is a bit large. It doesn't seem like it will make much of a difference but I just got this in and haven't tested it out. I'm remaining hopeful.Also, good amount of padding on the palm and lightweight, breathable material on the top of the hand. Hopefully, it will shrink if I wash it to give it a good, snug fit.
4	1403481600	Pretty solid..Just weaker wrist support. Does what it was intended for. If you are looking for something to do moderate liftong without the side effects of toughened hands..This will suffice.
4	1403481600	Like these because they are not black, so many times when you buy the black the color runs on your hands and you have stained hands, which is okay if you work outdoors or wear work gloves.  We'll see how well they hold up, maybe next year I can tell you how they hold up.
5	1403308800	It upsets me how so many people say that these gloves are not good OR say they are ineffective. I have used these gloves religiously for 2 weeks now and I must admit, THEY WORK. They are good for any form of lifting regardless how heavy you are lifting AND they are very comfortable. These are by far one of the best investments I have ever made. These gloves will def protect your hands from rough skin as well as blisters. I def recommend this product to anyone who is lifting and needs protection as well as solid grip.
5	1403222400	These don't let you lift extra weight or do anything crazy.  They are fingerless gloves that allow you to not get huge calluses on your hands when you lift weights.  Also, I prefer the grip they provide versus going barehanded.  They do their job, they do it well, and I've been buying Harbinger for years.
5	1403049600	Great product, quality and fast shipment. Produc as described. Next gloves will be with the bondage to wrist.  But whose were as described.
3	1403049600	not a snug fit unlike the other pairs I bought at a retail store. looks like I'll have to get small size the next time
5	1403049600	got these to use them for workin out... like the fit & feel, help me maintain good grip with sweaty palms.
2	1403049600	I thought I needed lifting gloves because my palms would start to get calluses after doing primarily dead-lifts and curls.  I'm 6'5&#34; and I feel these things need to cover my fingers more because I can't get a good grip on the bar. My max weight for dead-lifts has definitely gone down. I plan to try full hand military-style combat gloves (thin style) next.
5	1402963200	Fit and material all excellent.  Bought them for my husband's weight lifting work outs.  He is very happy.Harbinger is a dependable brand.
5	1402617600	I've had several pairs of black lifting gloves that look like everyone else's. I like these for the Harbinger quality but a different look. Good padding in the palms and fit well. Highly recommended
5	1402444800	I bought these gloves to be used by me daily at the Gym for cardio/weight routine, it arrives attached to a display carton with an elastic cord (don't pull it, use scissors and cut the elastic cord to make the gloves apart from the display carton), on top you will see stripes of something like a thin&soft leather (I'm not sure) and it's padded by a medium leather layer at the palm, the adjustment is made by a velcro strip under a rubber tab that shows the harbinger cross logo. Under the first use it feels a little bit tight, but after you wash it the starts to feel more comfy. To wash it just put the gloves in your hands like you do for normal use and use some water/toilet soap, rinse it to eliminate any residue of soap and hang it in a very well ventilated area not exposed directly to the sun, don't use your washing machine or dryer. Not being a heavy weightlifter I found these gloves are great for common cardio/weight routines, protects the palm very well against callous and are very well manufactured, the display carton says are made on China. I will update this review in the future with more information about durability.
2	1402444800	Looks cool but fit not quite right.  I would have preferred something with more give. Now it is my back up.
5	1402185600	I have had several harbinger gloves.  I believe these are the best ones they have made.  Well padded in palm area
4	1402099200	People were saying they fit small so I ordered 2 size larger.  I recommend only one size larger than your normal size.
5	1402099200	these gloves are a good deal. Reinforced padding on palms helps. The fingers are not that long. Longer finger padding would make more comfortable.
5	1402099200	When my trigger finger just would not grip like it should, these gloves help gripping a bar without closing my fingers.  Also it helps not getting callouses in my hands.  Handy for fitness workouts or using in the yard.
5	1401753600	Washed twice and still in great shape!Great gloves, love that they don't have a wrist support. Gotta support your own wrist ;)
4	1401494400	have stood up to a lot of weight training and still going strong with just a couple seams starting to suffer. also washed a couple of times. easy.
5	1401235200	No more calluses on my hands from lifting weights.  Looks bad-ass, like I'm about to rob the place.  Recommended. :)
5	1401148800	I have a tough time finding good weight lifting gloves mostly because I lift pretty much every day on top of helping clients try to do the same. As a result, gloves often don&#8217;t last very long. These gloves have been with me for a while though and they are showing remarkably few signs of damage. The grip is pretty good too.
5	1401062400	I ordered these and I really like them. I am a male with hands on the smaller side, so I ordered the medium size black gloves and they are great! I use them strictly for weight lifting and they are very durable, comfortable, and grip very well. They make a huge difference for lifting weights and I can push myself further and get better pumps. Overall they are really good gloves for the price point. I would order these again.
5	1400976000	It a good glove good item I loving it . The leather is ok but I think finger is shot but it ok
4	1400803200	These are the best workout gloves I have had so far but they are very loose around the wrists and even strapping them as tight as I can they have about an inch of extra room around my wrists and I have fairly big wrists.
5	1400803200	I am able to wear these simultaneously with the watch to my heart-rate monitor. They fit my hands well. Good material. They seem to be holding up well. They have been preventing callouses from forming on my hands.
2	1400803200	i like more or lest howit fits but start to get smeally if you dont clean often. and start to release black color and stain my shirt and hands
4	1400457600	I like this gloves a lot. Great price & so far great durability. Wish the Velcro flap was a little longer.
4	1400457600	I workout hard.  I don't expect any set of breathable gloves to last too long against daily intense weightlifting.  These have held up fantastic.  After almost a year of very heavy use I'm just now having to replace them.
5	1400371200	Purchased it as a gift for my bf and he loves it. they are very confortable. I have another model from this same brand and i love those too. good product. in my experience this brand's products are durable. we'll see if these ones last as long as mine have so far (over a year of use, about three to six times a week)
5	1400284800	Fulfills needs perfectly! Nothing is better than this product at the moment. Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!
5	1400198400	I tried this on and was a perfect fit, good material. The padding in the palm seems to be not that thick, but it's enough to not hurt your hands.I recommend a 100% this gloves, the only but, it's the size. But it's up to you have a right measure on this one, that's why it not a con.
5	1400198400	Good guality gloves a bout weigt lifting.Harbinger is the best.&#304; buy a gain hrbinger lifting gloves.I recom. This item
4	1400112000	Got these gloves to get rid of the corns in my palm due to weight training.And so far they have served me well, corns are almost gone!But sometimes these feels like little too thick than they should be and doesn't really allow to have a good grip on barbell or dumbbell.But that also depends on the the thickness of the equipment, so no major complaints!
5	1400112000	I do heavy weight lifting, I have now had them for 6 month and they still look the same, very durable
5	1400025600	I got these gloves for my husband to use at the gym he loves loves these gloves. He says they work great when he is doing his strength training and weight lifting they really save his hands.
5	1399939200	It is good quality , Good size. same size as any medium glove I ever used.so far, I recommend them.
5	1399939200	These fit perfectly. When I pick up weights I have a great grip. For a bonus it's well padded and  comfortable. There is no sliding and stretching when I sweat, which I have encountered with cheaper gloves.
4	1399766400	Its good quality, Good size. same size as any medium glove I ever used. My only issue is i don't like the strap. But the glove is good, the material hasn't worn out yet so thats nice.
3	1399680000	I do more reps at a lower weight and so I mainly want gloves to prevent calluses. These gloves have a medium level of padding and I guess I prefer less padding so I have a better feel of the bar or equipment. Other reviews are right that these do fit well and don't cut into your wrists.
4	1399680000	Darn, should have got these earlier. Previously when I did benchpresses I couldn't user heavier weights because the bar will press onto my palm and it hurts. So I typically could not complete a good set. With these, there is adequate cushion on the palm area to form a firm grip, enabling me not just to complete a set but even handle a bit heavier weights. A must-have for gym freaks that lick iron for breakfast!The only issue is, when I inspect the design of the gloves, I found that the velco wrist strap is a separate piece from the main body, secured only by a sewing thread(see attached pix). Usually after a gym session users may just yank the strap loose to remove the glove. I forsee that in the long run, after wear and tear, the whole strap piece will come off. But I think it is possible to sew it back using stronger material such as nylon.Other than above, I think it is a great product.
4	1399507200	I bought a medium and they fit well. Maybe a little big, but the smalls will probably be too small. Strong and sturdy too. Not cheap feeling or looking.
4	1399420800	First of all, be wary of the black dye staining your other clothes if you wash them in the washing machine. I ruined about 5 of my favorite shirts. Also, about two years ago Harbinger switched to a whole new glove and still called it the 143. I have found that the gloves don't cover as much surface area as the old gloves but the new material lasts longer between washes without getting an odor. The velcro surface area is smaller on the new gloves (and the gloves barely cover the bottom of my palm) and they feel slightly thinner overall. Also, whereas the old style of 143's would crack and shrink after about the third wash, the newer model retains its shape better. I think that the newer material is better than the older material but Harbinger should have maintained the overall design of the old glove.
4	1399161600	As others have mentioned sizes run a bit small. I'm a medium but ordered a large and it was perfect. Good price, good gloves... job done.
5	1399161600	These are nice gloves. They are super durable and I have been using mines for a month now and it doesn't look a bit worn. I have a feeling these glove will last me a while.
5	1399161600	Exactly as they're pictured, they adjust a little bit tight but it's not a problem for me, average quality at a fair price, so far, I recommend them.
5	1399075200	I don't use gloves often but when I need some, these work great. Great glove for the price but I only use them when I tear my hands open pretty good, so I cannot give any testimonials of how well they work with daily use.
5	1398988800	I love these gloves and the only reason I bought this pair is because I lost one of my old ones, which are still in a great shape.
5	1398988800	These fit well for my very small hands. I don't feel as though they pinched or cut into my hands at all. They only a bit snug at first, but with anything they stretched a bit over time. But they didn't strecth to the point where they are too large or anything along those lines. They have held up well in the year that I have had them. Perfect for my every other day weight lifting use.
5	1398729600	I had Gold's Gym gloves and they strted to tear way too soon. The Harbinger gloves are ones I had before so I went back to them. When they wore out it took quite a while and wore out at the center and not at the thumb &#34;root&#34; as the Gold's Gyms ones did.
5	1398729600	Good fit and very tough - I have been using Harbinger brand for many years now and absolutely love it.
5	1398643200	Great, comfortable, break in quick. I got myself a pair for resistance bands/pull ups, and my wife started using them for her workout. she liked them so much that she bought a smaller pair of the same glove. What you want out of a pair of fingerless gloves.
5	1398384000	Try to destroy these, it is impossible. I have had the same pair for 2 years of day 4 days a week working out and they are still going.I would buy this exact pair again.I am 6'2 190 with large hands. XL fits great.
5	1398211200	Satisfied with the product price and quality are good and they fit me nicely. Also its quite comfortable good product!
3	1398211200	I purchased these gloves from Amazon to use at the gym.They are okay but leave much to be be desired in the way of how they feel. I like a sturdier glove with padding around the knuckle area and these are just light weight. I found that they are great for bicycle riding but I don't like them too much for working out at the gym. Just too light weight for me. They do seem to be good quality...just light!
2	1398124800	You get what you pay for. They protect your hands well, but the construction quality is low. They did not fit as well as other more expensive brands I had used in the past and they are not as comfortable. For the price they do work and the foam padding insulates my hand well against heavy loads but if you are looking for a perfect fit with outstanding construction these specific gloves aren't a good choice.
4	1398124800	The gloves came quick but the weren't very comfortable and I can't use them without getting pissed off but other than that they're pretty good.
4	1398038400	I'll add my two cents on the size issue first. Unfortunately (for me), my hands tend to run most often right between large and X-large when it comes to gloves. I went with X-large in this case, and they're a little loose. That being the case, I'd predict that these run very true to size. I've used them for a little while now, and would recommend them. They're easy to put on, and come off in hurry too (some gloves it seems have so many straps and tabs, that it can seem like forever to get them off). I'd buy them again.
5	1398038400	I read the reviews, but wasn't exactly sure what size I should get. I went to the company's website, ordered based on the size-chart information, and the gloves fit perfectly. Great quality.
5	1397779200	I use these gloves with a pullup bar and plastic gymnastics rings. They keep my hands from developing massive calluses, and provide a sufficient amount of padding. Recommended!
3	1397606400	I like the natural leather color and the design.  But as other people have mentioned, the material is on the thin side.  If you're looking for good padding, then I'd look elsewhere.
4	1397520000	The gloves feel good in your hands. I personally like them very much because they do what they are supposed to do. I can only say two negative aspects about the gloves. The mesh(black) material will tare a bit and you are gonna see small loose ends specially around the tops of your fingers. I personally done like the way the wrist band attaches to the glove but magically it works when your lifting and they have never come undone on me.
4	1397520000	useful and comfortableA little fluffy after using some timesBut the overall experience is good and I like it
5	1397433600	I was at the gym on a Wednesday evening, doing what I do - demolishing and devouring all the weights - when I realized that I was developing callouses on my palms.  In between sets, I get on my Amazon app, do a quick search for the highest rated product and this thing shows up, my old friend Harbinger.  This product was outstanding 10 years ago and is still the same now.  With Amazon Prime I was told I'd get the gloves on Friday with free shipping.  Guess how happy I was to get it the very next day?!  Under-promise and over-deliver.  I love it.
5	1397347200	I am about 5.11 and i think i have usual sized hands - i was worreid about sizes and reviews and checked over many gloves, i am so glad i settled on these ones, very very well built, great quality and i like the cross at the top very cool. The size L was perfect for me.
4	1397174400	This gloves are quite thick. They're really well made, they are durable, and the toughest I've seen. The only downside is their thickness. They're a little too thick for my taste so it reduces my grip on bars.
5	1397174400	These gloves are just perfect.Pros:1. Hands do not sweat in them due to the elastic material in between the leather.2. Provide perfect grip for heavy weightsCons:1. I got the size specified by the chart, but those ended being bigger for me. I passed it on to my brother and got a size lesser.Caution: IMO these should be used only with weights that are too heavy. due to the thickness, they give a different feel other than your bare hands when you hold the bars/weights. Too much dependence on these gloves may not help you build the grip you need with bare hands.
5	1396828800	Purchased becaue if using a wheel chair, makes the gripping process and handling of the chair ideal. Very satisfied with this item.
4	1396569600	Except that the palm will come dark or black as time goes on.I will buy a black pair next time.
4	1396310400	They grip much better than those York Fitness gloves I bought some years ago. Those gave me calluses from inadequate padding. These do not. I like the colour too.
5	1396310400	I hope these are good gloves. I plan to use them fer riding as I don't like to use closed fingered gloves on the bike. Will update later.
5	1396137600	I have been doing gym workouts almost daily for years..(many)Recently I began using the Concept 2 rowing machine which I can highky recommend, since it is full body, but the least possible strain on the knees.  But a lot of friction on the hands..After some rough blisters, I decided to try gloves.Almost any will do.. but these are just great.. comfortable, with the right cushioning at just the right place.Cannot remember what they cost, but I am pretty sure it was no more than $10..Probably dollar for dollar, the best purchase I have made this year...
4	1396137600	Velcro closure straps are too narrow compared to older models, but they do the job. Can't say how long they will last. Previous pair lasted about three years of 2 to 4 x/wk moderate use.
4	1395964800	So far so good. Good thick gloves for weightlifting. Gonna see if they last over time and don't rip or tear easily...
5	1395619200	Theres nothing bad i could say about these gloves, the padding is significant but not to much. The size chart worked well and there a good tight fit, not to tight.
5	1395619200	Works great! I have been using it for last 10 months - no issues. I followed the instructions to measure my size. I am satisfied with the fit which is comfortably loose to slip on and off.
5	1395619200	Because of the size of the gloves. And the color.The gloves are very comfortable and practical for my needs.
4	1395446400	This product works well for me. As expected and worth the buy. Gives me a good grip and the required softness to hold dumbbells for long.
3	1395446400	After 3 weeks de gloves show bursts, i workout every day (1,5 Nour ), so maybe they are built for this. Would be strange because they advertising witch &#34;professionel&#34; gloves.
4	1395100800	Not bad, not bad... my only complaint is I wish they were more ventilated. My old Harbingers had an open back and lasted for years and years under heavy, heavy use - eventually the palms wore away but when it came time to buy a new pair it was a no-brainer: Harbinger.
5	1395014400	good price, good fit, they do the job.  allows me to get a good grip, the leather is high quality, haven't had any issues w/smell to this point.
5	1394841600	Well, they're amazing, there isn't much else I can say. Only bad thing is that the Natural color really rubs off easy. I was doing deadlifts (not much, 275) and I noticed that they started looking weird from the palm. So if it doesn't bother you, go with natural. Personally, I still love the color, and it just adds more character to my pair.
3	1394841600	I love Harbinger gloves and seeing that my last pair was showing their age I bought a new pair, size 2XL. I enjoy the tan workout gloves they make much more than the ubiquitous black gloves you see everywhere. But these felt tight, much tighter than my others. Yes, I'm sure they will stretch out some but everyone seems to be using less material these days as a way of saving money. Also, these are shorter than my previous pair and the edge that goes across the bottom of my wrist bothers me at times. The black woven stretch material that is on the fingers extends beyond the end of the leather on the bottom palm side where the fingers protrude from the glove; this means that after only a few sessions at the gym the black stretch material is frayed and ragged at the end of the fingers on the palm side from grasping various metal bars on workout machines. I don't think it will be a long term problem (I hope it will just fray and fall off) but my last pair were made better and the stretch material did not extend beyond the end of the fingers. Still, I like them and wear them often, alternating them with my other pair at the gym.
4	1394668800	it's not bad at all.... i sweat a lot so i have to wash it a lot...lol...but until now it's really good to me at the gym
3	1394582400	This product is that, just ok. It fit accordingly, comfortly, but one of the straps rips off at the firts attemp, not very durable.-
5	1394582400	My last pair of Harbinger gloves lasted about 10 years and finally I decided to replace them with these.  I've been totally happy with them so far.
5	1394496000	Use gloves 2hr a day, 5 days a week. Dedicated powerlifter with cardio circuit training. I have been using the gloves for about 3months. Upon first use, I found slight discomfort in between the fingers. After initial break-in, about a week, gloves were amazing! Heavy weight was a breeze with no hand fatigue. On bench press doing 240 plus, (10reps, 4sets) found gloves to cushion palms extremely well! Also, very comfortable when flexing gloves! slight cushion under fingures makes a huge difference. when resting weight on that area along with exposed fingertips improved overall grip (dead lift for example). Straps do not wrap around the wrist providing extra flexibility when curling, working forearms and working with dumbbells which is a pro in my book. Others may disagree based on personal preference. Highly recommend these gloves, great fit, great ventilation. Looks and price are fantastic, however actual use is what counts for me. You will not go wrong with this pair.
1	1394409600	badly placed stitching causes pain and discomfort in fingers too agonizing to  use. The discomfort is distracting and when you are benching free weight distractions are dangerous.
5	1394323200	Perfect! It protects my hands from being hurt. The size is just OK and it looks nice too. What I want to say is that it worth the money.
4	1393891200	They are good ones but I was looking for something better for same price, I couldn't find it and I proceed to buy it. Anyways, they are good, and protect my hand of lift weighting.
4	1393891200	if you need your fingers at work these are nice gloves the have. I work at the post office and have to finger thought mail but my hands dry out bad. I found that with these gloves keep most of my hands is decent shape
4	1393891200	These gloves are well constructed and rugged.  Made to take the abuse of a hard workout.  Could use a bit more padding, but I like them just fine.
2	1393804800	The padding is nice, and they fit well.  Unfortunately the seam between the thumb and the hand goes right across the ball of my thumb, and when I' m pushing heavy weights (bench press, shoulder press etc.) especially dumbells, the seam gets pressed into the ball of the thumb and makes my thumb go numb.They are fine for any other kinds of lifts though.
5	1393718400	I do kettlebells at home using the Skogg system (started with his DVDs and now I use Virtual Skogg). I had a cheap pair of gloves from TJ Maxx when I started, and they started to tear apart within a month of use. I came to Amazon and found these...I bought them back in August 2013.It is now March 2014, and I have used these gloves 4-5x per week....and they undergo MANY different kinds of movements with the kettlebells. I must say....they have not fallen apart at all. They are not even shredding or peeling or anything. They have been able to withstand months of abuse, and if they ever start to wear, I'll definitely come back and buy an identical pair.I'm an average female, 5'7&#34;...I went with the mediums and they fit me perfectly.I would highly recommend these if you use kettlebells!
3	1393459200	Needs more gel in the heel of the palm.  And the Velcro tab is too thin and narrow.  I'll use this as a back up.
5	1393459200	I put those things through hell day-in and day-out. For the price and quality, you can't beat it. I went without the wrist wraps to give more freedom while doing muscle-ups.
4	1393372800	I like these gloves for many reasons, but they have drawbacks. I like natural color and the very thick leather on the front and back, which extends the full length of the fingers. But, the fit for me is less than perfect. The fingers are too long, and get wrapped around my first knuckle...making them a bit uncomfortable when closing my hands around anything. Secondly, their size Large was tighter than the other Harbingers I also use. I'd say they run a bit small. But everyone has different hands and if these fit you, they make a great and solid glove.
5	1393286400	Great product.  No more &#34;stinky gloves&#34;!  Great hand protection and comfort.  I use them five days per week, and my first pair lasted over a year!
5	1393286400	Fit great. Feel great. Look great. Nicely padded n not too much. It is what it is man yea yea
5	1393200000	I use these with free weights and when deadlifting, and I find that I can do a lot more simply because of the lack of strain on my hands.  They are very comfortable, presuming you ordered the correct size, and they come at a very reasonable price.  Those looking to buy a pair for weightlifting should seriously consider these.
2	1393200000	Unlike the previous model of the Pro gloves, these are rather short and--even with a perfect fit--slide annoyingly during pullups or comparable exercises.For pushing exercises (bench press, etc) they are comfortable and have ample padding.I also found the stitching coming out after a few months.These are a downgrade from the prior model.
5	1393200000	Bought several types of gloves and &#34;alternative palm pads&#34; to use for kettlebell workout to try to reduce callouses. These heavy duty gloves did the trick, Well padded but not too much so you can feel the weight in your palm but superior protection from friction and callouses. Highly recommend. Breathable and washable. Seams are sewn well too.
5	1393113600	Liked these!  Washable, comfortable, padded, wrist support, good price--just what I was looking for. I got it as a gift.
3	1393113600	The glove is a decent looking gloveBut the sticking around the finger holes has already come loseNot to happy about that
2	1392854400	I used these for a moderate kettle bell workout twice a week for about 3 months before the stitching on both index fingers of the gloves came unraveled.  Purchased the gloves for around $17 and expected a little more out of them in the way of quality for that price.
5	1392854400	I bought these gloves two years ago when I started training for my first Tough Mudder event in 2012. I wore them while running and lifting to wear them in before the actual event because they restricted my grip (I'm a fairly small guy.) After the event, I threw them into the washing machine and viola, they were almost like new again. I continued to used them for another event the following year along with training in between and are still in use to this date; although I think its time for replacements.My only problem so far is the seam at the base of the thumb on the left glove was ripped sometime before the first Tough Mudder, although I've continued to use them without any issues.
5	1392681600	I bought these to replace my gold gym gloves, i really like the gel concept, it really protect your hands.
4	1392681600	These gloves were just what I was looking for. They take a couple workouts to break in, but after that they're like a second skin. Hopefully they hold up for as long as my old Harbinger's.
1	1392595200	This is a very thin glove. I mean almost not there. Like wearing a plastic glove.  What ever it is made of does not feel like leather or natural like it is advertising.
3	1392595200	Don't buy these for Tough Mudder or anything where you'll be getting wet. The padding and leather on the palm soaks up water, and grabbing a monkey bar means squeezing out dripping water all over your hands.
4	1392422400	The product was as I expected and arrived promptly.  The worst thing about your revving policy is that I must say more than I want to.
4	1392076800	The sizing chart worked perfectly to fit my hands, however compared to other Harbinger gloves, the wrists are both too short and too wide.  If you're used to workout gloves that give some wrist support, these will not work for you.  Besides that, the quality is as great as one would expect from this company.
4	1392076800	They are already starting to wearout but, I use them for some intensive workout so it is expected. 1X Recommended!
5	1392076800	Comfortable! And I got medium and fit perfect. Originally had a Large due to the other commentors who said to order a size up. Glad I didnt listen to them as mine fit perfect. Just follow the size chart from the manufacturers website, it is correct. I have small hands and medium was perfect.
5	1392076800	Had these for almost a year now and they really help a lot! one pair actually got stolen so i got another of the same kind because they were the most comfortable i've had for far. Definitely worth the price. Good deal.
5	1391990400	These gloves are padded just enough to be comfortable without being bulky nuisances.  The open fingers and breathable material make for great odor control as well.  And it doesn't hurt that they look really cool too.
5	1391990400	Good product. Feels good in my hands abd provides just the tight protection to allow hours of comfortable riding. Material seems of good quality. Excellent price.
5	1391990400	These are great workout gloves. I have been using them for well over a year now. To some the thickness might hurt grip but it doesn't bother me much. Very tough and sturdy gloves. Glad I purchased them.
5	1391990400	I got these because I am getting back into lifting heavy weight. 300lb shoulder shrugs and had enough without ripping the skin off your hands and these gloves have made all the difference in the world.  My hand don't even hurt after a hard workout now.
4	1391904000	decent gloves overall, quite rich padding, durable, took out one star because glove opening is too wide for my hands while the rest fit is ok, i bought Large, as normally use L size, but maybe my hands just not standard. good product overall, especially for the price.
5	1391731200	Great gloves for weight lifting and even better price. I am glad I bought a size up, fits my hand and fingers perfectly, but the wrist is slightly loose which is not a real problem. It has perfect protection the palm and fingers. I have not received any blisters since putting these on whether I am lifting weights, swinging kettlebells, or doing pull-ups. I have to say these are one of the most Comfortable and Durable gloves I have used to date.
4	1391644800	It was time to replace my husband lifting gloves so i bought these. They fit him well and he likes them. No complaints so far. If you have a dog BEWARE. My dog chewed on them which is why we bought a second pair. I guess they love the leather.
5	1391558400	We go to the gym regularly.  I love using all of the equipment, except for anything aerobic.  Oh well.  Why are these machines so boring but weight lifting is not?  These gloves assure me that I have a grip when weight lifting.
4	1391385600	The Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove have met my expectations from a fit and use perspective. I rated the product a 4 star because of the price of the product. In my opinion and based on the materials used in its construction, the cost of the gloves was way too high. Please consider and review all types of weight lifting gloves before purchasing these.
5	1391385600	size approached - excellent sitting on hand even if you do not zip up. look expensive! Only the first two workouts a little uncomfortable, but then formed on a hand
4	1391299200	Decent gloves for the price. I  ordered size XXL and they seem to be a little short and/or small. They defintely run smaller than other brands without question.
5	1391299200	I cannot state how much these help to have at the gym.I've had these for about a year and they have held up to my lifting schedule of 4 times a week. Give them a few sessions to break in. After the break in period, you will wonder how you ever got by without them.
3	1391212800	Worked good for about 1 year until the velcro lost its stick. Now the straps come open from time to time. If you work out allot with gloves, try a different pair because these won't last long
3	1391126400	but not good for wheelchair use: the palm area is not sticky enough. Also they seem to run small. I wear a men's small, but opted for medium with these, and I am glad I did.
4	1391040000	The palms get dirty after a few work outs. If the stitching holds up they will do fine. Like the two tone colors.
5	1391040000	this is exactly what it is described to be. fits a little snug at first but it will loosen up with wear.
5	1390953600	Just what I wanted/needed.  I wear big watches and this fits just right to keep them on while I work out.  Takes a little bit of getting use to, because I don't feel the bar as much with these gloves on.After a week of working out, I throw them in the washer and they come out looking like new.  Will not workout without them on.
5	1390953600	It fits perfectly with my hand, just use measure your hand and compare it to the size table. It's pretty durable.
5	1390867200	love these gloves and treated the leather with mink oil for longer lasting leather. they cushion well and feel great.
5	1390780800	This is the second time I am buying these, and they both loved it, it fits small so buy a size up and it does not come down over the wrists. Great buy. I love it
5	1390694400	Really good grip, rugged look too :) Washes and dries well, does not stink. I'm female and it fits me too.
1	1390608000	I bought two of them and it was an mistake. The size L is a little bit small and the strap doesn't protect the end of your hands. Is similar than other harbinger pro model I had but in that version the protection and the elastics are in bad quality. I don't recomend it
4	1390521600	I originally used these for weightlifting and they worked well for that.  I now use these as my driving gloves (transit operator). They have nice padding on the palms, adjustable velcro strap at the wrists and are washable. Out of the package they feel a bit stiff and they take a few days to mold to my hands and soften up. A pair usually last me about six months wearing them five days a week while working. I've had the stitching come apart at the wrist straps on two of the pairs I've bought.  Also hand wash these, as I've noticed that throwing them in the washer will dramatically reduce their durability. That said I keep buying them, and recommend them to coworkers.
3	1390435200	I bought these because of the good reviews on Amazon and the price was comparable to stuff on Academy. They work well enough, but even though they haven't been heavily used I noticed that some of the stitching is getting frayed.
4	1390435200	I&#8217;m a large usually, but these were way too small.  I opted to send these back and get a pair in XX Large.  Now I love them, especially for doing pull ups with a 55 lb weight in between my legs.
5	1390262400	I bought these for my boyfriend and after a few uses and washes they are still holding strong! Another reviewer suggested to go a size up because they run a little small, and I think that's pretty accurate!
5	1390176000	Got these for my son for Christmas. He has just started lifting at school, but these he is able to lift harder, longer and with better form than all his friends. Is it in his head or something else...who cares! Fit is spot on and material quality is great!
2	1390176000	I bought this gloves back in 2011 the quality was awesome, excellent quality, so I decide to order again to replace the old broken one, I'm so disappointed with the quality, it looks like they replace premium material for a cheaper one, now I decide instead of using the new ones I'll have to continue with the old ones, even the old one are broken they are better than the new ones.
5	1390176000	bought these for my husband uses them for weight lifting was very happy with these, very durable and easy to care for
4	1390089600	I like these gloves and bought them coz my hands sometimes can't handle the torture of iron lifting .. they are of very good quality but i think i should have bought medium size instead of small .. I was too lazy to return them so i am managing with small size lol .. but overall a good purchase
5	1390089600	This is the second pair of Harbinger gloves I've used for my gym workouts. I wore out the other pair over a couple of years, my main issue being the leather chipping (I probably could've done better maintenance) and small tears in them. I personally put 10,000+ reps on my last set and I've already put a few hundreds reps on these. They feel great and they updated the style. The best thing is they reduced the size of the velcro connector (last one was ~1 inch and the new one is about 1/3 on an inch.I look forward to wearing these gloves out.
4	1390003200	Bought these to protect my hand and they work great. Not the best gloves you can buy, but it does what it's supposed to and is comfortable. I'm 5'6 135 pounds and got a medium which fit snuggly on my hand.
5	1390003200	These gloves are sturdy and they fit okay. The grip is solid and the construction is medium quality. The price is reasonable.
5	1389830400	Great gloves, they are very durable and comfortable. I wish they were a little tighter on the wrist but other than that they are a good purchase.
5	1389657600	I have had these gloves for about 6-7 months now and it hasn't broken down at all. It fits perfectly and
4	1389484800	Once i have warn them in they strech and worked out pretty well. I wanted to wait until then to write my review.
4	1389398400	They look nice and seem to work.  Flexible material, sturdy padding.  Haven't washed them yet, so I will see how that works later.
5	1389312000	it doesn't let my hands to get ruined for shooting the ball after workouts, also its easier to lift heavier weights! awesome!
5	1389312000	Bought these gloves for rowing on my school team.  They saved my hands from many painful days on the water while I let my hands heal.  Definitely worth the price, nice quality.
4	1389225600	This is what I expect from Harbinger. I tried to switch to another brand and got mad because those lasted only about 2 and a half weeks. These bad boys are strong a comfortable. I use them for every thing. Biking Weightlifting scrumming up rocks. Good gloves.
4	1389139200	Needed these gloves to replace my old gloves which were falling apart.  Harbinger is a solid brand in this area so I decided to buy the same brand.  The only issue with these gloves is that compared to my old ones, the wrist straps are much too far apart and short.  The glove stops where the wrist is and the Velcro for the strap is very far apart.  You need to pull the Velcro almost all the way to the end to get the gloves to fit on a normal wrist.  I believe because of the design of these gloves the large opening at the wrist was needed.  Instead of having an opening in the glove to help your hand go in, these use a continuous design.  Since there is no opening for your wrist, the hold is much too large.  Overall, however, they are very good lifting gloves and would buy them again even if the improvement isn't made.
5	1389052800	This pair of gloves has become my motivation to hit the gym three times a week. I worried they may not fit, but it turned out to be so good. they protect my hands, and I don't feel any ache in my hand as I use to before I had them.
5	1389052800	Ive been using these gloves steady for over 4 months now and they're still going strong. No rips, tears, or any signs of physical wear in the typical areas around the seams. I fully expect these gloves to last me through the year at this pace!
5	1389052800	Excelent accesory, matches all the expectations and match with what was offered, has more quality than that i expected with the pictures.
4	1388966400	I use these gloves for group weight training classes (Group Power or Body Pump).  They're ideally suited for that kind of a program (bar weights ranging from 25-70 lbs.).  Below that weight, they're not really necessary.  These aren't a substitute for the gloves used for heavier weightlifting.  But for their intended purpose, they both improve my grip, and prevent the weight of the bar from digging into my hands during pressing exercises (chest press or clean and press).  I bought these to replace another pair that I wore (3x week) for about three years (which at this price didn't owe me anything) and I expect these will last as long.
5	1388707200	My teenage son has become obsessed with working out with weights.  He has received the tools he needed including these gloves.
5	1388620800	Works great, looks cool.  Keeps my hands from getting blisters.  I don't rate much, but when I do, I prefer this stuff and you should too, nuff said.  I love it.
5	1388620800	I don't normally buy gloves, so I had no idea what size to order.  My hand measured 9 inches around the knuckles, and an XXL was a perfect fit, as their sizing chart suggested.Goodbye calluses!
4	1388448000	Good quality, although a little bit larger.I use it a lot at gym and pull up, it's not slippy at all.
4	1388361600	The shipping was fast and it was a brand new product. It looked made out of good quality materials and fit nicely. The pricing was pretty reasonable considering it would have cost way more at a workout shop. I would recommend anyone to buy it!
3	1388102400	Ok product, not made very well. Mine lasted about 5 months before the stichting started coming out on the velcro wrist area of the glove i eventually just pulled the velcro part off the glove so it does not velcro close since it was falling off anyway.
5	1387843200	Good tight fit, flexible. Would recommend to anyone needing a good glove for workouts. Buy it, Buy it, Buy it
5	1387756800	For the price you can't go wrong.  This doesn't require a lengthy review, comfortable fit, and makes weight lifting a breeze (for your hands).
4	1387497600	good looking, comfortable glove, works fine.little too small for me. i don't have large hand but i do wear large in mechanix gloves.i ordered size large but little too tight.i would order 1 size up.otherwise a good glove.
4	1387411200	It works but it's nothing crazy, nothing special but it's comfortable and it's a small bit of padding that helped protect from too much callouses.
5	1387411200	I have been using this gloves for quite a long now (almost for a year, and average 3 times a week in gym) , and no issues so far.  Fits perfectly .
5	1387324800	Great for lifting light weights/dumbbells.Nice leather inserts, for a reasonable price.Fortunately, they fit great and looks pretty good.
3	1387324800	These gloves are too thick for me.  Their thicker than the Harbinger Power Stretchback if you are looking at those too.
4	1387324800	I really like these gloves. I buy them over and over. They do a good job of protecting my hands and last about 6 months. I go to the gym 5 days a week so they get used alot. I wash them two times a week and through it all they hold up. Now don't get me wrong they get a little crumby at the end but they are super broken in and comfortable too. Look if you use gloves as much as I do .... two pair a year is pretty good.
5	1387324800	First off, these gloves are great, and I use them all the time when lifting weights. However, this product performed above and beyond for me.One day I went out to ride my dirt bike, and put these gloves on as an afterthought. That day I ended up crashing my dirt bike on gravel, and got road rash on almost every part of my body (crashed going 40 mph). I am really glad I had these gloves on, because I landed with all my weight on my hands going 40 mph on gravel. My hands undoubtedly would have been hamburger without these. My hands were pretty much the only part of me that were unscathed. These gloves are TOUGH.A few weeks after the crash I started lifting weights again, and I examined the gloves. A few bits of fabric were sticking out, which I picked off. I still use the same pair today. Tough gloves.Comfortable, extremely tough, and useful for a wide variety of situations (even crashing a dirt bike). No cons that I could think of. Fits me very well.
5	1387152000	These are cheaply priced but well made. I work out 4 days a week at the gym and these gloves hold up well. I even threw them in the wash to clean them and they came out as if they were brand new!
4	1386892800	I bought these to help me on the over-the-door pull-up bar.  This works quite well for that purpose.  Can't comment on it's efficiency for other uses.
4	1386806400	Satisfied with the price and product. Not bad for the low price. Gets the job  done. Have only used it a few times. I'll let you know if they last.
1	1386806400	Paid way to much for such an inferior product.. this came looking old and worn.I am verrrrrrry disappointed with this purchase. Expected much more for the price. It looks small for a large fit but this is part of a xmas gift so i cant determine whether or not its too small now. do not waste your money
5	1386720000	I weight train 3 days a week and have been using the same pair of gloves for about 3 years.  I've been dreading replacing them because they are SO comfy and broken in.  Unfortunately, the style is no longer made so I had to switch to another glove.  I've purchased  a half dozen pairs or so, and was never satisfied.  This pair FINALLY made the cut.  I've been using them for a couple of weeks and they have finally softened up to the point of being as comfortable as my original gloves.  Easy to get on and off, flexible enough to get a good grip, with good palm and finger protection.  I plan to order another pair immediately so I'm ready when this pair is ready to be retired.  I'm a woman with (I guess) a medium sized hand, and ordered the Men's Small size.  They fit a little bit looser than my original gloves, but are not big.
5	1386720000	I bought these gloves to use with my wheel chair so I can go in mini fund raising roll, walk, run events. I need strong protection and comfortable padding. These gloves provide both and don't wear out or become in stitched with daily use. Nice colors match my chair. They.are true to size. I also have on old pair, same brand, at least15 yrs. old and they are still in fine shape. Good buy.?fair price .
5	1386633600	I've owned quite a few pairs of workout, bicycle, and even some very high-end anti-vibration gloves over the years. These are in a class of their own. Although not a particularly high priority for me personally, they are very good-looking &#8220;stylish&#8221;. I don&#8217;t ride motorcycles anymore these would make very good riding gloves. The thumb is designed and constructed pre-curved which makes them very comfortable for gripping. The palm padding is thick and the texture of the suede provides a very good non-slip grip.  The workmanship is not perfect but very good, for the price they are an exceptional value. Daniel
5	1386460800	I usually use XL or XXL depending on the weightlifting gloves brand. I have size XL with these gloves. The padding on these gloves gives enough cushion and it still allows you to grip and rotate around a standard size 45 lb bar with comfort. The finger length is perfect so that it does not drive into the skin when holding a bar. The color stands out more than black which make them harder to lose or forget at the gym.
5	1386460800	I use to use a Nike Glove before and it use to hurt my hand a lot. Ever since i switched to the harbinger, Luckily it doesn't hurt anymore and the grip makes it easier to keep the weights or the bars at a steady level instead of feeling like it might collapse on me.
5	1386374400	These gloves provide excellent palm and lower finger padding for lifting. The material is comfortable, isn't bulky, and doesn't bunch up on your finger joints. Wrist support is minimal, so if you suffer from wrist fatigue while lifting consider the model with the extended wrist support. When these wear out I plan on purchasing another pair.
5	1386288000	OK, so maybe these gloves are meant for gym rats but they also serve a dual purpose as WHEELCHAIR gloves. I got a new ultra-lightweight chair and the only problem with it was 'pinching' on the large tire and some nasty calluses forming. With these gloves - poof! - no more abrasion.While I'm sure these gloves work well in the gym, they're great for general wheelchair use!
3	1386201600	These are decent gloves, if you don't expect them to last for too long. They aren't the most, but I don't find many gloves to be very comfortable to begin with. As long as they provide grip support, that's all that matters.I have gone through three pairs of these. Each of them lasted roughly six months of lifting five to eight hours per week, and a spin in the laundry roughly once a month. That's good enough in my book. If you take care of them, I can see them taking a full year or more of beating. Eventually, though, the seams start to come apart and the leather on the palm starts to smoothen out and lose the friction-providing surface. Additionally, the leather on the tan version starts to look closer to a dark, dirty brown, from all the oils and dirt they absorb. Pretty gross, so stick with the black version. They remain useable even after all these things (and I still have two of the three pairs. One pair was left for other climbers up on Half Dome in Yosemite National Park), but definitely feel a bit less effective.The fit of these gloves varies out of the box. One pair had a left-hand glove that would cause major irritation due to a seam rubbing between my middle and ring finger. The next pair was fine. The third pair had another rubbing issue, but between my right thumb and index finger. Picky hands? Maybe. Lack of quality control? Probably.
3	1385942400	The gloves seem pretty good but they run a little small so far so goid !! Give me a couple of mobths to use them
5	1385683200	They're comfortable and work well. The padding is very good and prevents calluses. The grip is excellent. I've used them almost every day in the gym on all sorts of equipment. They have finally reached the end of their life after almost 4 years. I will buy another pair.
3	1385596800	I had a pair of the tan and black and needed a spare pair to have at work. The closure on the black pair was a lot thinner. Fit was good, and the gloves are good otherwise, but I really prefer the larger closure. The black pair are definitely a little different than the black and tan.
5	1385596800	Nice and comfortable for use. Quality is pretty good too! Can consider if you need it for a good workout!
3	1385510400	While using them 3 or 4 times a week, they are breaking down faster than I expected. But like the last pair, if they last for 6 months, i'll be happy.
4	1385510400	I Like these gloves a lot. The last gloves I had still gave me blisters on my hands after heavy lifting, but these are very, very sturdy to where all my blisters and calluses are gone now.The only negative, is after a couple months, there is a slight rip developing in one of the gloves, but its not a big enough tear to stop using them or complain about too much. Good product.
5	1385510400	These are high quality gloves. I use them for the gym when lifting weights. THey give me a very strong grip.
2	1385510400	I wore these gloves about three times before they started to rip.  Not the old harbingers.  Sorry.  I continue to use them with the rip.  The old harbingers lasted, but got stiff after 30 for 40 days of use.  They did not rip as much.
4	1385510400	I liked the product by quality but make sure you buy right size. I bought large by taking reference of my friend's harbinger gloves and ordered but when i received, i realized that i should have ordered medium but still you can cope with bigger so i am ok with that.  I recommend product but please make sure you order the right size.
2	1385251200	Excellent gloves, to the extent, but do not know if I should buy a bigger size because when too much force closing hands hurt so much I've cracked hands leaving skin and occasionally a little blood.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Excelentes guantes, a la medida, pero no s&eacute; si deb&iacute; comprar una talla m&aacute;s grande ya que al hacer mucha fuerza cerrando las manos me ha lastimado mucho las manos dejando agrietada la piel y en ocaciones sangre un poco.Update:After using a couple of days these gloves, I started to leave marks on hands which have begun to ache and crack, which has required careful to get back to normal, I had never happened before this with other gloves, I can no longer use them more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Actualizaci&oacute;n:Despu&eacute;s de utilizar un par de d&iacute;as estos guantes, me ha empezado a dejar marcas en las manos las cuales han empezado a doler y agrietarse, lo cual ha requerido cuidado para poder volver a su normalidad, nunca me hab&iacute;a pasado antes esto con otros guantes, ya no podr&eacute; usarlos m&aacute;s.
3	1384732800	I find that these gloves actually make it difficult for me to grip on my &#34;pull&#34; exercises. I've really stopped wearing gloves over the past few years.
5	1384041600	For more than a year, these were my FAVORITE weight lifting gloves. Unfortunately I lost one at the gym.They fit tight so if you have any question, go a size up!!  I wore a Large and it was a tight fit for an average hand.BUT!!  The quality was perfect.  This glove protected and felt good at the same time!  Not bulky and stinky like those rawhide gloves they sell everywhere in the stores and online.  These are QUALITY LIFTING GLOVES for a great price!
3	1383955200	These gloves have changed since the last time I purchased them. The leather seems different and the Velcro strap is thinner. I have wide hands and I preferred the last iteration to the current one.
5	1383955200	Great fit, good padding. Wearing these for extreme mountain biking and they have enough leather for protection against brushing against sharp trail hazards.
4	1383782400	Really good gloves but the palm on the left one tore within the second week of me using them. Maybe I'll get a different kind next time...or stop lifting such heavy weight ;)
5	1383782400	These are great gloves.  They are very comfortable and provide a good grip. They seem very well-made. I am happy with the purchase.
2	1383696000	The stitching next to the thumb came loose on the first time I used the product. The gloves are comfortable to wear, however are assembled poorly. Would recommend a more durable brand or style.
5	1383696000	I love these gloves! They're comfortable, are easy to take on and off, and provide a good grip for lifting dumbells and barbells. I have owned the gloves for the better part of a year now and the overall wear-and-tear I would expect considering the way I use these gloves just hasn't happened. They're stylish and functional, and I highly recommend them.
4	1383609600	These gloves are very good lets just say great over any glove that says HD on them. I passed them around in my Riding Group and everyone wants me to order for them when they need a new pair. Do not know where Harley gets their gloves but they might want to take a lesson from this company.
4	1383609600	This product is fine for my kettlebell trainings, fits well. However, the size and tailoring is not 100% perfect, and after a hard training session it leaves some black spots on my forehand which - luckily enough - can be vanished easily though.
5	1383609600	Very comfortable, didn't have any break-in period and plus they look awesome lifting weights.  Also i like the small Velcro straps compared to other gloves that have large ones.  They also allow your hands to breathe.  Would definitely recommend.
4	1383523200	These gloves do what there suppose to do. Protect your hands from friction from lifting heavy weights repeatedly . These are my 5th pair over 10 years. I am a moderate weight lifter, 3-4 times a week. They usually last  2-3 years. They are comfortable , and the leather holds up after sweaty workouts without the leather shrinking ! Have tried different brands which last a year or less and tend to fall apart due to poor stitching and poor quality leather!
4	1383264000	Like this a lot and used them as soon as they were delivered. It felt just right. Was very please with the quality and that the package arrived on time.
5	1383264000	These have been used 3-5 times a week for over a month now.  They are showing no signs of wear, and we are totally satisfied with the quality.  I would suggest that you try a size larger if you are close to the top edge of the size.  If not, you may find that they cut into your fingers a bit. I will be going a size larger for the next pair.
3	1383264000	This product is made with cheap material but at the end of the day I cannot complain ... It wasn't expensive at all.
5	1383091200	Purchased for my son as he does the insanity workout, and he was very happy.  Said it was just what he was looking for.
4	1383004800	These gloves have helped my hands alot. Weights, pullups...Would buy again No worries. Not sure how long they last though.
4	1382918400	When you use it, it can help you to easy the pain when you hold things like dumbbell, and protect it slipped form your hands when there is a lot of sweat on your hands.
4	1382918400	After several uses, I finally broke it in.  My fingers and palms chaffed at first due to the stiffness, but after several uses, it fits like a glove (pun intended).  It seems durable.
5	1382745600	I've been wearing these gloves weightlifting at the gym for an hour five times a week for a few months now.  I used to get calluses on my hands from lifting without gloves, and that's a thing of the past now.  I get a good grip and I've never had any discomfort, even though I wear my wedding ring under the glove.  Some of the edge stitching may have come loose, but not in any way that actually affects the gloves.  I've even put them in the wash, and they came out just fine.
5	1382572800	Nice gloves. Medium padded.looking good.  Perfect for my requirement. By the way , I am beginner in building. Both Brown and black are good.
5	1382572800	good protection against metal splinters from barbell bars and also prevents blisters.main reason to buy is if your hands are naturally sweaty. this prevents the barbell bar and dumbells to slip around my hand when trying to grip them.recommend to others who wants to protect their hands from weight lifting.
2	1382227200	Too big for hands. I ordered a small and its still a little big. I still used it for my workouts as its still functional. But I was hoping it would fit better.
5	1382227200	Great snug gloves with plenty of padding. Would be good if they had a tab you can grab when taking them off to make that a tiny bit easier.
5	1382227200	Fine and durable skin. The only thing that you may lack is additional fixation in your wrists area (refers mostly to the bench press).
3	1382054400	I can already see wear and tear on these after less than a month...  I'm a little nervous that I will be having to use the warranty.  I do like the feel though and the way they fit my hands.  I just see a lot of wear on the thumb area.
4	1381968000	So far so good. Only been using em about a month now. Three or four days a week when I lift. No complaints, but nothing spectacular either. They're lifting gloves, they do what they're supposed to.
3	1381622400	As described and good material quality for its price. BUT, even both right and left are labeled the same size, the left one is wider. Still worked, but felt weird wearing them. Hope they have better quality control.
2	1381622400	This pair cannot protect your wrists. You should not use these to try your limit weight, it will be harmful..
5	1381536000	Very good for the price. I tried it out as soon as I got it and it works great.  I lift again with getting narly looking hands!
5	1381449600	They do their job protecting your hands from the constant wear of bars and weights.  You will still need to moisturize.
5	1381190400	I have been using the gloves for 2 months, so far these have been great, The price was good also.
3	1381104000	Way bigger than stated.  Honestly unusable.  I bought these to stop callouses and blisters from forming while I work out but these just caused more to form.  I am a woman with fairly large hands but these must be for a giant.  I had to go out and buy a smaller pair.  I wouldn't recommend buying these online unless you already know the fit or are willing to spend more money for new ones.
5	1381017600	Frankly, I just don't see any problems. So, if you're thinking of buying them for lifting, go ahead. It's worth its price.
5	1380844800	These gloves are great - very good quality of construction, good level of padding (not too much), right length on fingers. They even have stitching along the padded palm to mimic the main natural lines on the palm - which allows for good fit (especially in light of the padding). The fit is a bit on the tight side - not necessarily bad, just an individual preference. If in doubt, go for the bigger size.They will be a great addition to anyone doing weights - protect your hands from callouses, as well as increase the weights being done due to the comfort for the hands.
5	1380758400	Real leather, great construction, great buy and fast shipping. Would recommend these to anyone for exercise, lifting heavy boxes, or playing handball or paddle ball.
5	1380758400	Quite comfortable and a good padding for light use. I only do my every other day routine and it works splendidly. I do not suggest for people who want to go to the gym everyday and spend hours lifting.
4	1380672000	They were tight at first had to wet them to fit my hands now there awesome. I would buy another pair. Great product
4	1380672000	I really like the grip that these gloves give me.  I feel like I am much more in control of the bar and any free weights I have so I can focus on lifting and less on the bar affecting my hands.
5	1380672000	Get an excellent grip from these!  They are very functional, in addition to being easy on the hands (callouses) and stylish.
4	1379980800	I was reading views about the size glove I should get and someone said medium was good for average sized hands. They where a little big for my hands however, the gloves cushion very well and have no signs of wear even though I workout every other day. Gloves look nice and are pretty comfortable. I would suggest small or medium for most size hands. But to be on the safe side, I would go to the store to buy a pair just so you know you can be sure of the fit of the glove is right! Have a good day and I hope I helped!
3	1379894400	Stitching came loose after 2nd workout on the Velcro tightening strap. Very disappointed in the quality. Nice fit but that's it.
3	1379635200	The gloves I bought fit pretty much perfectly. They are a bit on the smaller side, but they offer just enough padding to protect your hands and improve your grip while not adding enough to get in the way. Unfortunately, while the right glove is seemingly perfect, the left glove's velcro strap is slowly becoming unstitched. I've had them for a few months and have been using them despite the issues, but eventually the stitching will fail completely. For the price I'm not too disappointed, but perhaps spending a bit more would have gotten me better quality control. Additionally, the velcro closure is not too substantial, so at times while doing heavy pulling exercise the gloves will slip towards the ends of my fingers. Gloves with a heavier wrist strap would likely not have this problem, but at the cost of wrist mobility.
3	1379635200	I would recommend a nice pair of cloth/ velcro gloves over these any day of the week. And that's because you can wash cloth, but leather is not meant to be washed. (And we all know that when you workout you'll sweat and eventually want to wash some of it.)
4	1379376000	Slightly tight but tough im 5,8  165 lbs ordered medium and the gloves def do their part I bench 250 curl 120 and feel no pain on my skin the only complaint is there kinda tight other than that its great, keeps my skin smooth
5	1379203200	Excellent Gloves true to size nice soft leather Harbinger been lifting weights for 25 years harbinger is theeee best gloves around.
5	1379203200	This is the second pair of these gloves that I've purchased. They are both comfortable and durable. Will definitely purchase again when I wear this pair out.
5	1379116800	I've been using these for a few weeks, and so far I love them. I'll update my review when I get some more wear on them.
5	1379116800	These gloves help prevent blisters from forming on my fingers when I enter the gym. If you lift a lot of weights like myself (180 lbs, :) ) these would help.
5	1379030400	These were purchased as a gift for my adult son who has told me they are holding up great. He wants another pair.
4	1379030400	These are well made, nicely padded and comfortable. I think I will go back to ones that wrap around my wrist in the future. just a personal preference.
5	1379030400	great long lasting gloves.  hope they continue to make them. I do buy XXL even though my hands are not that big.
5	1378857600	I'm usually a Medium, but following someone's recommendation, I got L and it fits perfectly. I am very satisfied. The gloves are comfortable, and seem durable
2	1378771200	I've had a number of Harbinger gloves over the years and never had a pair to bleed on me until these.  I use these for an hour of bootcamp at 5:00 am, and so I sweat quite a bit.  The back of the gloves will bleed the dye onto my hands which I have to scrub very hard to remove.  If you sweat, don't buy these.
4	1378684800	Bought the x large and it fit great. I have bought many of these style gloves in the past. These seem to be the best made so far. I use them in the gym all the time.
4	1378684800	Not bad. Not quite the padding I expected, but worth the money. Runs on the small side. Good color and texture
5	1378598400	They are a great fit and a very good value. Would recommend to everybody and will probably buy an extra pair or two.
4	1378598400	Love the look and feel.  Using these for crutches/wheelchair during recovery and also plan to use for gym after.  I would highly recommend these to anyone for the aforementioned uses:)
1	1378512000	I have owned many weight gloves over the years. Many have lasted years and years of use. This pair is already loosing its threads and coming loose after only a month. I use many gloves and so I only used this one 1-2 a week max and it's already coming apart. I would not buy this again. Horrible product. Stay away. Company should check quality control on this product.
4	1378339200	Does what it is supposed to do. Well. Worth the cash. The only issue is that the gloves should have had loops to make it easier to take off. That would be another star.
5	1378252800	I took the advice here and bought two sizes larger than what I would normally buy. The gloves arrived, but were too large. So I ordered one size smaller and returned the others. Better, but still too large. Turns out I ended up having to order my normal size anyway, and ended up spending a lot more than anticipated. Perhaps fit is down to preference. Your mileage may vary.
4	1378252800	2nd pair I have owned. Got these to have an additional pair in the trunk of the other car. 1st pair have lasted 2 years with very frequent use.
4	1377734400	I have weight training class as school and the instructor said we should buy weight gloves. I got home, looked on Amazon and had a few options. I chose these ones and I chose well. They fit my average sized hand (medium) and protect my skin from getting callused and also help in the actual lifting as the bar no longer puts strain on my hand. 4/5 because 5 should really only be used for products that go above and beyond. This one is excellent, but nothing divine. However, they are a great choice! Get them!
5	1377734400	these gloves are great as i am retired and i was getting blisters on my hands and now i do not and they give me much help in gripping the weights .
5	1377648000	For the money it's not bad at all. Just make sure you size UP because they run small. The leather seems to be of good quality.Also these don't have a wristwrap. Highly recommend these for overall fitness workout.
4	1377561600	My husband work out 4 times a week,  he said it is perfect hand protection and good quality, it is the second Harbinger gloves of him and the first one  is 140, as he become a heavy lifter and I will get him another Harbinger.
4	1377475200	i order a L and looks like a M, buy it, the material is awesome but in two sizes more than yours
5	1377302400	Fit snugly and have no issue cutting into skin or circulation in hands. I've had no issues with cleaning them and they work perfectly fine for my workout routine.
5	1377129600	I do crossfit in which pull ups are a part of a regular routine. and after my first callace ripped on my 45th pullup I decided that tape wasnt just going to cut it anymore.i have been using these gloves for a few weeks now and i have to say Im really impressed with the quality. no signs of distress or ripping yet.
4	1377043200	I liked the gloves. The only problem is that they are little small but they are really authentic and comfortable
5	1377043200	On my second pair after getting my first in 2006....that's how good they are. comfortable, durable and look a little different than typical gloves. Seriously, if I couldn't get them on Amazon I would have waited until my next USA trip (I'm in the UK) and bought them from a store over there. Buy and enjoy.
5	1376956800	Weight Lifting is good for the muscles and body but bad for the palm. I have been using these for a month and these are a good gear to have in the gym.This gloves do the job correctly when the fingers are flexed and prevent calluses from forming.The fabric breathes so that your hands do not sweat and heat is limited. I want to mention that these one do not protect the wrist, if you want that you need to get other ones.The material is soft and can be easily cleaned in the wash- YESSS. No Dryer though.I just wish it had a clip which could held them together after use as a pair because they can be misplaced or lost in the gym locker.
5	1376870400	These gloves are great.  I use it mostly for dumbbell lifting and so far have held up great to the rough diamond pattern handles.  They also have a pleasant fresh leather smell.  I was actually going to get the black version but everything in my weight room is black and I've learned in the past that if I place a pair of black workout gloves on top of my weight rack, especially on the black ends of the dumbbells, I'll look forever to find it.  Or imagine putting your black gloves on a black rubber floor lining your home gym!  With the tan version, it stands like like Americandirt on white fresh French Alps snow.By the way, I was going to order a large size based on the Harbinger sizing chart but another reviewer mentioned to order a size up because they run small.  I am glad I did and the XL fits perfectly.  I am wondering if the XXL with give a better fit after the glove has set in (i.e. sweaty palms on leather equals shrinkage)?  Amazon has it for such a good price that I might get a second set for the gym away from home but in the XXL size.  Will report back after I do.
5	1376611200	Bought these because I had increased my pull up routine numbers.  No more painful callouses digging in to my hands. Well made.
5	1376524800	One month in, they're holding up well and they are definitely doing their job. I am definitely satisfied with this purchase.
4	1376524800	So I haven't tried tons of gloves but these ones do the job.They definitely aren't cheaply made and actually feel pretty sturdy and well made in general.Has good grip and they slide off easily after a workout. Haven't washed them yet but they don't smell easily and tend to remain decently dry.
4	1376438400	These gloves do the job. They look good, without any excessive logos or flashy &#34;style&#34; touches. Material is heavy enough, but still flexible.Price is reasonable.They appear to be well-made and durable. We'll see how they hold up over time.
5	1376352000	Great pair of gloves for lifting.Gloves run small, ordered a size down usually wear a size large in other brands.
5	1376265600	I do about 1 hour of free weights then 1 hour of Cardio. My last pair of Harbinger Gloves were stolen from me at the Gym while I showered. They were $40 Harbinger Model 1250.I was Not too pleased with bright yellow colors and a big "GoFit" logo on the glove. Seemed more like advertisement than practical use.
1	1376265600	stitches ripping off like there's no tomorrow. don't recommend this product at all.additionally, it hurts my palm for some reason when i lift.
4	1376092800	I picked up this pair of gloves because all the weights and handlebars in my gym have little metal spikes on their grips that rip the skin on my hands. These gloves were a great value. They're built well enough to stand the harsh abrasion that frequently occurs during my workouts.However, I have one complaint: I wish the velcro strap on the gloves was longer by about 3/4 of an inch. My wrists aren't too thick, so I end up pulling the strap pretty long to make the gloves fit. As a result, about 3/4 inch of the velcro strap isn't secured, and is left hanging. I have some concern that this might cause the strap to loosen over time. I wish Harbinger would've thought of this when manufacturing these. But for now, it's working fine.
1	1376092800	the fit was good, but very poor quality ; the stiching started coming off after only a week of use; relatively inexpensive but not worth it.
5	1375747200	Great gloves, soft and durables! they fit me perfect !  they must make in other glove colors and some boxing leather gloves!
4	1375747200	the material is great and the glove are good looking.. but you should choose a bigger size to fit your hand
4	1375660800	I guess they are everything I was hoping for so far... We'll see how they hold up in the tough mudder.
5	1375660800	I bought these gloves as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves them! He loves the quality material and fit. He has used other gloves in the past but these are by far his favorite.
4	1375574400	They are thinner than I had expected, for good or for worse, without much padding. On the recommendation given on the homepage, I choose a size larger than specified (as the sized are said to be given for a pretty tight fit and your advised to consider a size larger); they turned out to be slightly too large, though not fatally so. Overall, they look nice and work well for most exercises, but fall short when I max out on e.g. deadlifts.
4	1375574400	After reading through many of the reviews, i decided to purchase the Natural colored gloves in  Medium. The black gloves seemed to have complaints of dye rub-offs & bad sizing. I usually buy men's fitness gloves in size medium, so the Natural gloves in medium fit me great! I'd be curious to see what a small size would feel like, since I have to close it all the way at the end of the velcro. If these fit my boyfriend's hands, then I would have given these to him & tried the small. I have no complaints when I deadlift, bench press, or when I use dumbbells. I'm super happy with my purchase!
4	1375056000	I was a little disappointed with the sizing.  But these gloves are so good that I am over that issue.  They are just ever so slightly large on me, but the next size down would have surely been too tight.  These things work great though.  My hands don't sweat at all.  My other cheap crappy gloves tore up very easy when using the curl bar at the gym.  But these show zero sign of wear after using the abrasive curl bar at the gym for the past few months.  Overall, great gloves for the price and I would definitely buy them again.
4	1374796800	some of the stitching in the gloves is harsh as hell when you are lifting.. like right on the fingers, I knew this would eventually wear out of the glove though and it has already worn down to where it isn't incredibly annoying anymore and I can lift without the seams pressing into my fingers.
3	1374710400	My husband has previously owned a pair of Harbinger gloves (in the yellow leather) he thought these were the exac same thing, boy was he mistaken! They fit fine but made super cheap, very thin, i dont see them lasting long.
5	1374710400	this F***ing gloves ROck..! :) they don't get smelly after a few uses like the rest of them plus they have double lining in the inside they are remarkable insanely great..!
5	1374451200	I purchased these to help protect my hands while weightlifting. They do the job well and are very comfortable. yay.
5	1374451200	Fit well, leather feels great, and they perform well. No problems with these.But be sure with your sizing, I measured my hand, which measured to be large, but in reality I had to step up to XL.
3	1374364800	The glove fits like, well, a glove! it looks very good and feels very good but it didn't take too long to get a tear on the palm area.
5	1374192000	Now this glove has been my friend for 2 years. I have to say at first I do not lke it too much since it is hard and tight. But the more I used it, the more I love it. It is thick and very protective, extremely durable.
4	1374105600	These gloves are good and do the job. My only complaint is that the strap that is designed to tighten the glove around your wrist will not let you get a tight fit.
5	1374019200	Harbinger is my favorite brand of workout gloves. They are good quality and protect my hands from callus assist with grip. The gloves are made of a strong yet cushioned material.
4	1374019200	fits right in my hand,good support , right price,the looks are just ok not as trendy or cool that i would have preferred
4	1373932800	very comfortable when its using for work out and very adjustable to weight training.But if you guys can, make wrist protector with it.
5	1373846400	Been working out for 3 years now, one pair of these lasted me 2 years. It's a little ripped and stuff so I bought a new pair. But guess what, I can still wear the old ones sometimes (when my new ones are at school) and it's fine.
1	1373414400	Bought these for my husband who does a little weight training. He was using Valeo gloves, bought in a local store, for about 10 months. They are getting worn out and he needed to replace them. On the very first day, he complained that these gloves are not good for gripping weights. His hands are not big, yet the gloves are very tight. He threw them out after two days, and went back to his old gloves.I am never going to buy this brand again.
4	1373414400	Like all items with a general sizing chart, it's always going to be a little off. My hands don't quite fit the average mold as they're long and slender. If I size down to fit the girth, the fingers suffer; if I size up for length, then they're too roomy. These in a small fit me alright. They've held up pretty well and look ok as far as workout gloves are concerned. Keep in mind that the tan leather will get dirty. I've yet to wash them, but the care instructions state they're machine wash safe.
5	1373414400	The gloves fit perfect. Harbinger has sizing chart at their web page. I thought my hands were small/med but the size recommended was XL. Padding is amazing, the knurls don't cut into my hands anymore, ouch. The weight lifted seems lighter since there is less direct pressure on the hands. The grip is no slip like you always have with sweaty hands. Would definitely buy them again and again.
3	1373414400	carefull if you have big hands, they are a little smaller than xx-large, and not ready for a heavy duty life.
3	1373328000	I measured my hands according to the manufacturer's instructions and the gloves seem a bit &#34;short&#34; at the wrist.  I feel that they should be at least 1/2&#34; longer for a good fit.  The &#34;width&#34; across the knuckles and diameter of the finger holes are fine.  Padding is good, Velcro holds well.  They are a bit difficult to remove - require pulling each finger slightly in succession to &#34;coax&#34; them off.  When these wear out I will most likely not buy the same model again.
5	1373155200	these are great glover, wonderful fit size large, very comfortable to wear, soft leather which provide a non-slip grip I would reconmmend them to my friends or family!!
5	1373068800	Feels very tough and durable. High quality materials. Feel well-built. Comfy and snug at same damn time lol. I hope they last
5	1372982400	I lift heavier weights, so I needed gloves because my hands were becoming very calloused. After using them for months, my hands have almost completely healed, and the gloves themselves are in very good condition. The only thing you have to worry about is to make sure to wash after use. They may stain your hands if you forget to wash them for a while.
4	1372896000	These are great for doing weights--I'm a woman, so I got the small, and I have joint pain, so these cushion my hands and allow me to lift. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they get dirty pretty quickly because of the color, but hey, they're workout gloves!
2	1372809600	I bought 3 pairs and neither one has same size or fitting, and terrible wrist band. Wont recommend anyone to buy it, unless you get lucky in size.
3	1372723200	Good material and provides good protection in hand, however annoying in the palm of the hand as it has a seam and catching the weights upset.
5	1372636800	They fit very well. The design is good. The thickness is just right. They provide comfortable protection while lifting weights.  The only challenge is removing them. There's no quick way to pull them off.
5	1372636800	I'm on my 2nd pair, the first lasting about a year and a half.  They don't get as stinky as others so they don't require as much washing.  The black ones required some breaking in but the natural gloves seem to be softer from the get go.
1	1372636800	The &#34;new&#34; 143 Wash & Dry Gloves are a definite disappointment compared to Harbinger's previous/older version of the same glove.This current model of glove is made of thinner material, has less padding, almost no tentions around the wrist due to a much skimpier velcro wrist closure... leading to the glove riding up the palm, and fits less snug/looser than past versions of the 143.All in all a very inferior glove... especially if you've owned the last incarnation of this glove.If I could find older versions of the 143 I pay double their price to avoid purchasing this &#34;upgraded&#34; model.VERY disappointing!!
5	1372377600	Very nice pair of gloves, fit perfect the medium size in my small hands and I wear even  driving my car. So confortable
3	1372377600	these gloves are awesome they fit well. the only down fault about them is when your hands sweat there hard to get back off after an workout
5	1372291200	I used to have a pair of these when I lifted, so I bought some for my son.  He seems to like them as much as I did.
5	1372204800	Indeed well worth the price... Will keep an eye out for products by this brand... Couldn't be happier with this pick up..
3	1372204800	I usually get medium for gloves..However this gloves are a little bit smaller than general even the same thing in different color (natural).for the natural color, perfectly fit to my hand..but.. this black.. too tight to wear and take off..I would get large one for this next time!
5	1372204800	I have tried several different workout gloves and always had a problem with the skin on my hands be pinched when lifting weights. I have been using these gloves for 3 weeks now and have not experienced that problem. I will buy another pair when these wear out and would recommend these gloves.
5	1372204800	fantastic product!! Seriously, my last pair lasted me 2 years, so i bought 2 more pairs for the next 4 years ;)
5	1372118400	I keep buying these gloves over and over but they do last a very respectable amount of time so no complaints there.  They are comfortable, they protect my hands while lifting and they don't stand out in a negative way at the gym.  Nobody is gonna say "why did you buy these gloves" but nobody is going to comment on them positively either as most lifters know about Harbinger gloves! They do their job and they do it well.  I do have a couple bits of advice for those looking to buy these gloves:  #1) The sizes run small so if you are going to err get a bigger size. #2) The tan gloves show dirt very easily so stick with the black color so your dirt can blend into the gloves :)
2	1372032000	I have had several pairs of Harbinger gloves in the past and have had good luck with their durability.  I primarily lift free weights including dumbells and Olympic style bars.  I was a bit wary of purchasing gloves online, but wanted to give it a try.  From browsing the gloves available I decided that I didn't want/need gloves with wrist wraps, but wanted sufficient cushioning for lifting dumbells up to 70lbs and barbells up to 200lbs.  My main complaint is that my previous Harbinger gloves lasted approximately 3 years being used 3x per week and had more (or at least better) cushioning in the palm of the gloves where I experience the most discomfort when lifting heavier weights.  I cannot forsee that I will tolerate these for more than 1 year before I look for something better suited to my needs.  In summary, these would better suit my needs if they had better cushioning in the palm of the gloves.
3	1371945600	Its hard because you win in one and lose in the other, you could wash it, its good quality, fits well but its hard to grip.
5	1371859200	I've used it for two semesters worth of gym workouts at my university's gym. It hasn't fallen apart yet which says a lot. Prevents those annoying calluses!
5	1371686400	I use these to lift weights and do pull-ups about 3 times a week. They took a few weeks to ware in, but I now find pull-ups much more comfortable. I would recommend.
4	1371686400	These gloves are tight fitting and have good padding on the bottom. Your hands will never get too hot because they air out pretty well. The only problem is that they can not prevent all chaffing on your hands if you lift or do pull-ups.
5	1371513600	good grip, good fit and light. breathe well and do not stink like most gloves. also fast shipping. i would definately buy another pair
4	1371513600	I use these gloves about three days per week for moderate lifting. I've had them for about a year and they are comfortable and holding up fine. I like that they are washable. There's not a lot of padding, but they meet my needs.
5	1371513600	These gloves are perfect for me. I recommend them to anyone looking for a good glove for weight lifting.They have an amazing grip and really help when doing low-rep/high-weight exercises especially.After reading all the reviews about how they run small in size, I went ahead and ordered a size above what I typically would.The reviews were right, if I had ordered my normal size they would have been too small... so keep that in mind!Give these a try; you won't be disappointed. Lift on my friends!
5	1371340800	Just the right size and slight elastic allows for good firm fit . . . comfortable and reasonably priced. I use them for weightlifting and wheelchair.
2	1371081600	I ordered another pair of Harbinger gloves in my size (L), and had to return them, too small. Got these instead, size XL, still too small, in fact they are the exact same size. It will cost more than I paid for them to return so I guess i will cut them.
1	1371081600	Lasted about 15 workouts, then the palm of my hands turned black after every workout.Definitely poor quality, do not reccoment.
2	1371081600	These gloves are made good have decent amount of padding. But they are not made for lifting. The wrist has no support. Would use the brand again just not these gloves
3	1370822400	I bought a medium but it runs a little large, I had a pair of nike gloves medium and it fit perfectly, but these are a big large. Regardless it works just as intended.
5	1370822400	The product is very good, with high quality and surpassed my expectations. Congratulations for the beautiful work. Back to shop with you.
5	1370822400	-Got an XL fit perfect.-Confort: 8/10-Feel: 9/10-Look/Style: 9/10-Value: 10/10-Performance: 10/10 - Great feel, when lifting weights.
4	1370476800	I was just in between the M and the L (8" circumference), so, based on other reviews about going up a size I opted for the large. Though the glove fits, it is a little bit loose, but not enough to say I bought the wrong size. I do see how other users could have the pinching between the fingers, but since my glove is slightly roomy, I don't have this problem. I have had it for a few weeks and use it 3 times a week for freeweights, kettlebells, and straps. I am glad I bought these gloves. I give 4 stars because it should be possible to get a snug fit glove without the pinching.
4	1370476800	Product as described. Slightly big for the large, but just cut the fingers a litter. Grip is great and satisfied .
2	1370304000	the gloves are small and make my fingers go numb...i'll need to get another set, probably from a store where I can try them on...
4	1370304000	These are kind of heavy for lifting weights. (I know, ironic) But they do the job. They probably need to be broken in but apparently people look at you funny when wearing gloves to the gym. So I stopped wearing them because of that and the fact its just an extra item to have to carry around.
5	1369872000	They fit my hands. That's really the only criterion I have. Yup. Eight more words. Now five. Three. Two. One.
5	1369785600	They fit well, the shipping arrived on-time, they're good quality, durable, and overall I was very satisfied. These are great for strength training when your hands hurt, and you want to keep going.
5	1369526400	Bought these gloves after my last pair of Harbinger gloves lasted 2 years.  That was using them on average of 4-5 days a week.  So far so good, great feel in the palms
4	1369526400	i have small hands and small is ok.  I probably could have went with extra small if available.  I can lift weights as well as perform pullups.  I haven't worn gloves for years, but had a sore palm from some different machines and these worked well.  Haven't washed them yet
3	1369440000	I've been using them 3 days a week for 45 minutes during my workouts for 3.5 months now. I don't do that much weightlifting and the weights are nothing extreme, however after about a month or so I noticed a crack in the leather about 1 cm in size. Luckily it hasn't become larger since then, but now the threads started to come out of the fingers. These aren't capital defects, however I wonder what will happen to the gloves in 6 months. Will they last a year? Who knows.On the positive side, the gloves look great and fit my (narrow and long-fingered) hand quite well. I can do pull-ups or toss balls just as well as grab weights while wearing these.
2	1369353600	These things are useless. The fingers are too short for the size of the glove, and the padding is so thick I can barely hold the bar during heavy deadlifts. I had a pair of GoFit Diamonds before which weren't very comfortable, but did protect my hands and improve my grip. The 143s protected my hands by weakening my grip (endangering my toes). I finished my workout with a pair of full fingered mountain biking gloves (Fox Men's Dirtpaw) I had in my car. I have to say, of the three pairs of gloves, the MTB gloves are way better (for deadlifting) than either of the made-for-lifting gloves.
4	1369267200	Hard to beat the quality of these gloves for the price. The leather does not look or feel cheap and the padding in the palm is fantastic. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the fingers are a bit short and it sometimes causes an uncomfortable pinch, which can be a bit distracting as you try to knock out those last couple reps, but it only happens once in a while.I've not washed these yet if it ruins anything I'll be sure to update my review, as of right now I'm pretty happy with the purchase.One other thing, the gloves I got look like the ones in the first pic. The velcro straps are small and low profile, unlike the other images which show them taking up a third of the glove.
3	1369267200	These were great until they bled and dyed my son's hands black.Don't buy them if you plan on sweating while you work out.
4	1369267200	Best thing i liked is, the black one does not have visible big branding labels which can be a eye sore.
2	1369267200	although my hand measured as the chart says, they were too small. i have ordered another pair of xxl to try
2	1369180800	they run a little big.  I'm not sure why, but gloves are more expensive and don't last long anymore.  My previous Harbinger's were way better than these and fit a lot better.
4	1369180800	These gloves are great and fit well, I use them for sailing so I don't get ropeburn, et cetera. The gloves are made of quality materials and seem like they will last a long time
5	1369094400	These gloves are bang for the buck for sure. I have used them few times and they stood up to the beating quite well.
4	1369008000	Gloves are great. Very padded, very comfy; much better than my old Nike pair. However, they really do run small. I usually use Medium to Large gloves. When I measured my hands with their size chart, it sounded like Large would be perfect for me, so I ordered them. When they came, the Larges were small enough to cut off circulation in my hands. I returned them (very easily, thanks Amazon!) And got the Extra Large. They fit perfectly. Bottom line, if you have normal sized-hands, get the XL. If you have big hands, get XXL or a different glove. If you're a woman with smaller hands, get a Large. No idea who could wear a small... little kids, maybe.UPDATE: Been using my Extra Large gloves for three weeks now, normal gym lifting, 5 times a week. They're still very comfortable and well-made, but they seem a little stiff. Certain parts dig into my hands, and while I don't notice while lifing, it leaves nasty grooves in my skin. They're better than they were when I first used them, so I'm breaking them in, but they have a ways to go. I never did wash them when I got them. Maybe after a washing, they'll loosen up more. I'll post another update later.
5	1368921600	fit is awesome on it and as long as you follow the size guide you should be fine. grip is great and it actually has helped me increase my grip strength as it forces me to have a thicker grip on the bar.
5	1368748800	The gloves fit perfectly. Could not have asked for better gloves. Very reliable and keeps the dumbbells from tearing up my hands when lifting. I defiantly would recommend this product
2	1368576000	Had these two months and already had a seam rip apart.  Once that happens, it's all down hill.  I will be going with another brand going forward.  The last two sets of Harbinger gloves I've had didn't last more than a couple months.
5	1368576000	I'm use these for moderate lifting at the gym and have no regrets on these.  They're comfortable and a great fit (I got large), as far as fit goes, I think I have average hands for a 205lb 5'10&#34; athletic guy.  I get no pinching or abrasion with these, work exactly as expected.They don't seem to hold moisture excessively or get too nasty so far.  The velcro could be easier to use, but may be because I have skinny wrists.Would highly recommend.
2	1368489600	I wanted these for deadlifting. As soon as I've started using them my fingers got bruised and battered from the way the glove is stitched together. The stitching is on the inside of the glove and runs up the fingers as well. When using heavy weight the seams dig into the sides of your fingers and causes light to moderate discomfort and pain. I gave up using them and went back to callouses and paper towels. It is possible that I got a defective product, so check other reviews and see if anyone else had a similar problem.
5	1368403200	So the XL was a slight, and I mean slight, bit larger than I prefered it to be. Other than this minute issue the product works wonderfully. It provides cushion in the palm area, it reduces calluses, and provides some wrists support (not much). I cannot comment on durability at this point but I expect the product to lasts given how well it has worked for me thus far.
3	1368057600	The gloves feel good and from what I can tell are pretty well made.  They are a little stiff however and that noticeably affects your grip strength.
5	1368057600	I bought two pairs of these and am still on my first pair, almost 3 years later! Washable leather that just keeps going. Great padding in the right places and my palms feel fine even after an intense weight -training session. Look no further. Yes, I agree with an earlier reviewer, they do run a bit small - so order one size up.
4	1368057600	I am a 61 year old male who does moderate weight training 3 days per week as part of my program to generally stay fit, and in particular to keep my arthritis from bothering my joints.  I've tried a few different brands of weight lifting gloves over the last 4 years and these Harbinger gloves are the best I have found for workouts like mine.  They provide adequate padding, are comfortable to wear, have proved to be quite durable (some I have tried stretch out and need replacement after just a few months) and are reasonably priced.
5	1367884800	These gloves seemed well made and sturdy. After a couple wears, the stitching started to unravel. That sucked, but I thought I'd at least get the most out of the glove before throwing it away. It's been three months. The glove did NOT fall apart. I suspect it's double stitched. I work out 3-4x a week, and the leather is thick enough to prevent calluses from forming.I bought beige/medium size. Should have gone small, because I actually have BETTER grip without the gloves. For safety reasons, I bench without gloves. For everything else: gloves. The color faded into a pasty brown, but who cares. It works. My SOLE REASON for buying gloves was to keep calluses under control. I could care less about aesthetics or wrist support. For this SPECIFIC reason, I give these gloves a 5/5.
5	1367884800	I am traditionally very hard on work gloves, and very few have survived very long with me when I am going to my usual extremes.  The ordering process with these gloves was a little difficult.  I ordered large expecting to have room, but could barely get them on my quickly purpling hands when they arrived.  SO I exchanged them (that's what I get for not going somewhere where I could first try them on.  The Extra Large fit perfectly, and now, just one month shy of two years later, they are still in GREAT shape. I spent at least 18 months of that two years lifting between 1 and 5 times a week... so they've seen some pretty decent use.I really like that they are washable.  I'm more than a bit of a crumb, so I admit that I haven't washed them that many times, but it's nice that when the smell gets unbearable (like you still notice it when your arms fully extended) you can throw them in the wash and air dry them [check their website for clearer instructions].  In the time stated I washed them about 4 times.All in all I'm really pleased with these.  They were worth every penny, and I will certainly invest in another pair when these are through.
3	1367625600	They are a good pair of gloves, however when i got them the seams where loose at some parts of the glove and within a day some of the mesh on the top ripped but im still using them and the awesome. My hands aren't getting ripped apart as they did before. Also, i think they sent me an older version because the gloves i received in the mail dont look like ones in the picture.
5	1367539200	I used these for about 10 years and started wondering why my gym bag started stinking. It was because the gloves had 10 years of my hand sweat in them. I trashed them, and thank God they still make these. They fit. They're comfortable.
5	1367452800	I bought 4 gloves (rebook, Nike...) and i returned them all. This one is for professionals! All the others they lack small details. I love the design & material, the finish... It is very easy to take off & to put on which was the biggest issue i had in the past with other gloves.I read a lot about the size issue, which it's not an issue because this is how it is designed to fit you as it has cloth from the sides finger to reshape the size if you have bigger fingers.
4	1367280000	This glove is exactly what I want. There are enough padding around the palm. That can protect your hand while doing weight lifting. And this is the only reason I want to buy such gloves. I only give 4 starts because the opening around wrist is not tight enough.
4	1367280000	The purpose for my purchase of these gloves was to help me control an alleviated hand callus problem along with finding a durable glove that would last a while.I used the gloves right out of the box... be warned that there is a protectant coating or spray on the gloves (for the leather I would imagine) that may stain your clothes and things you touch a dark blue.My first workout lasted about 2 hours, not much heavy lifting on this day with the gloves (it was a leg day) so I only got to break them in a bit with about 20 reps of heavy deadlifts.  They did well, they felt a little bit too heavily padded and I felt like I lost feeling/grip on the bar, but I chalked it up to not being broken in.So, I washed them in a machine and let them air dry.  They held up very well in the washer (I always wash or handwash my gloves).I then put them to the test in another 2 hour workout with medium weights and plenty of reps (bench press, dumbbell press, curls, overhead press, etc) and they felt much more relaxed and very protective.No worries to my calluses as they didn't seem to cause any more pressure and my grip help up very well.  Very pleased so far.
5	1367193600	Great glove... does what it's suppose to do. Good padding but not too much where it interferes with your grip. Nice fit, durable, good protection. Everything you need a glove to be. Not bad looking either!
5	1367020800	These gloves were bought to replace another brand that was worn out. These are much better than the previous pair. They are fairly heavy duty and so far have held up really well to all the workout equipment (even those &#34;cheese grater&#34; dumbbells). IF/when these wear out, I will likely buy this brand again. They do run small; I was a large in the other brand and an XL in this one.
5	1366848000	I usually don't wear lifting gloves because I never found a glove that fit my hands properly.  Until I came across these gloves in XXL size.  The key ingredient I was missing all these years was found at:  [...]I measured my hand and realized I was buying the wrong size all these years.  Now my hands are not receiving all the abuse from lifting with free weights.  And my wife isn't on my case anymore about my hands being so darn rough.  Good quality product and nice look.  Definitely recommended.
5	1366848000	I use it everyday at the gym. Very solid glove, fits good, and is very comfortable. Only cost 3 more dollars then the one below this.
5	1366588800	Used quite a few times at the local gym.  They fit well and I consider myself to have slightly larger palms than normal.  Haven't ripped or torn.
4	1366588800	Fit is tight (as explained in the product description) I normally wear an X-Large winter glove... I purchased a XXL Harbinger glove... They fit, but are tight... The gloves will stretch (I have bought this brand in the past) I recommend the gloves.. They last a long time vs other brands I have purchased...
5	1366588800	I'm a casual weight lifter.  I don't plan on getting super ripped, I do it for my health and fitness.  These gloves serve my purpose perfectly.  I've had that for a couple months and they are still in tact.  No ware, no tear, and the feel great.
4	1366329600	comfortable, good quality and very durable! only thing missing is a wrist support, the strap is a bit short, doesnt fully reach the wrist but still, they're excellent
5	1366329600	So I am new to using gloves for weight training, but thanks to the review of Arthur Bradley, I decided to go with the Harbinger 143 (Black; Large)Before, I use to only use my bare hands and finally got tired of sores, blisters, and the potential contact of bacteria from Work-out equipment.Even though the GoFit seemed more padded, has Diamond-tac for extra grip, and a little nub for easy glove removal, the design was less desirable. I was Not too pleased with bright yellow colors and a big "GoFit" logo on the glove. Seemed more like advertisement than practical use.I preferred a more discreet design which the Harbinger has. On the back side of the glove where the Velcro strap is for the wrist, has a little grey/silver "+" sign that signifies it is a Harbinger brand. On a closer look on the inside of the glove says the name Harbinger and that it is "Hand-Wash/Air-Dry ONLY", Glove Size, model number, Phone contact to Harbinger, and a website link to Harbinger Fitness.The inner side of the glove is this "suede" black leather (I LOVE THIS STUFF). Feels great, gives just as much grip as Human skin would and doesn't interfere with dumbbells, push-ups, chin-ups, or anything that requires the use of the palm. The backside of the glove has this three-part smooth/soft black leather that is connected by what I think is a single piece of stretchy fabric. The places where your knuckles would be does NOT have leather covering which is good, since if it did, it would restrict finger movement.After some use, sweat and moisture is absorbed by the stretchy fabric and evaporates.The glove comes off quite easily for me, I just undo the velcro wrist-wrap and tug off the glove from the middle finger. Due to the stretchy fabric, even if the glove is wet from moisture/sweat, they come off easily and practically glides off. May differ from person to person as some people said it was a little difficult to take off.The velcro that wraps around the wrist portion of the glove mainly serves to keep your gloves on. It prevents the glvoes from sliding off your hands from strenuous work-out.I would highly recommend this to others due to the simplicity of the design, practical use, lightness, the materials (suede/soft leather), and perfect balance of materials to prevent bulkiness and unnecessary itching which is common in other gloves.Side-note: The stretchy fabric is very similar to the stuff used in making slip-on pajamas for the waist area. But is softer, thinner, lighter, and more breathable. For some people this may feel cheap, but its actually HIGH-quality material.
4	1365984000	Size up they run small, but go ahead and beat these, they can take it! Excellent raw look with other natural products like belt.
4	1365811200	I had a pair of Nike weightlifting gloves that lasted almost 10 years, and they were perfect. Fit and functionality were great. Well they went to glove heaven and I searched for another pair of Nike. All of Nike's workout gloves now absolutely terrible, so I turned to Harbinger. Great fit, and function as needed. My only gripe (and it may be just me), I like my gloves to fit a little more snug around the wrist. now it could be that I just have girly, frail wrists, but the velcro strap doesn't offer much in terms of tightening around the wrist. Again, this could only be me. Aside from that minor gripe, the glove works well and fits well...
4	1365724800	I am not a big person (5'9&#34;) and do not think my hands are that large.But these gloves fit very tight and I ordered the XL. They are hard to pull off after a bit of sweat.I think that is okay, but be sure you are comfortable with the size.
4	1365724800	THESE GLOVES ARE REALLY NICE, BUT i THINK THAT THEY WHERE CUT SMALLER THAN AN XXL. mORE LIKE A REGULAR XL GLOVE.
5	1365552000	We searched every sports store looking for these gloves, couldn't find them.  The fit on these gloves are like no other, I hope Amazon continues to carry these gloves.  I feel safe with these gloves!
5	1365465600	I've tried many different gloves from real leather to synthetic materials and have not found one as comfortable as this pair. My last leather pair gave me some pretty bad callouses. These are as comfortable as weight lifting gloves could get and fits perfectly.
5	1365465600	These gloves have amazing grip. Helps a great deal when benching, when without gloves you have to deal with a sweaty palms and your hands sliding on the bar. Great buy.
5	1365379200	I ordered a large, they fit perfectly and feel extremely sturdy. I can tell that these will last for a good while. They are very comfortable as well.
5	1365120000	I've been lifting for the past 10 years or so and have gone through countless lifting gloves during this period of time. As some of you may know, gloves can either be too thin to really make a difference or too thick which affects grip strength. The Harbinger Pro gloves really do find that sweet spot in-between the two extremes and have a great feel to them. So if your just starting out or have been lifting for many years there is no need to look any further than these gloves.
4	1365120000	I'm pleased with the gloves but the Velcro strap is thin. You don't have have the feeling they are secure on your wrist. Overall okay. Got gloves in stated time. Thanks
5	1364860800	Glove is durable and looks good. I have been using it 2 months so far. It still in good shape. I recommend it.
3	1364688000	I love harbinger gloves since my first pair. Over the years I've used different Models and have had zero problems with sizing until this pair. They feel and work great but are way too small for my comfort. If you think you need a large go with an extra large. These are great for what they are and are not fancy gloves but they get the job done. I tried to use them anyways and they feel like they're cutting into the webbing of my hands and create discomfort. I'll most likely buy another pair but definitely going extra large with these. Other than the sizing being off they're great gloves.
5	1364601600	Love these gloves...have had no problems with use. Fit great and it doesn't make my hands black after use. No tears yet!
5	1364601600	I use heavy weight and need a heavily padded gloves for inside gripping of bar/dumbbells. These work best I still pad more though
4	1364428800	The gloves have padding in the right areas, I'd give them 5 stars but I'm still breaking them in.  They are a little stiff so I want to see if they loosen up any.
5	1364169600	I'm not an experienced weightlifter, but found some handles were giving me callousses or just digging into my hands.  I realized gloves might help, but didn't realize the other benefits---- hands don't get as tired, so more reps can be done.  The padding on these is great, and the color isn't as &#34;weird&#34; looking as in the pix.  I'm very pleased.
3	1363996800	Gloves are well bit but be sure to order at least 1- size larger.  They run smaller in design than expected.
4	1363737600	Bought these for our son whom is in a wheel chair. When he goes out it save his hands. He really likes them. 1. they are very hard to get on when you have contractured hands, and they are so hot they make his hands sweat and smell.
4	1363737600	Just solid work out gloves that will last almost a year, wash up nice, don't fall apart.  Can't find better ones yet.
4	1363564800	These gloves are nice enough though I wish the velcro band at the top were a little wider.  I think they run a little small.  All in all, great purchase for the money.
5	1363478400	Will work very well for my purpose.  Better than expected quality. Glad I sized up....normally wear XL ordered XXL per info from other reviews.  Fit great and seem to be made of good material with good craftsmanship.
4	1363478400	The quality is pretty good.The size a little tight but yes they look awesome.Really happy for the purchase.
5	1363392000	Harbinger gloves are the best lifting/workout gloves out there well, in my opinion they are.  They're definitely worth the price.
4	1363132800	Had the original version of these and they finally gave up the ghost. Got these and they feel as solid in the padding area as the previous ones. The velcro strap seems less solid than the previous version, but they are holding up better than I expected nearly six months later.
5	1363046400	These goose are high quality and fit extremely well. The leather pads protect my hands where I grip the weights and my hand pain and calluses are fading away.
5	1362960000	Easy to use, fits well, velcroe holds tight, prevents friction (due to gel layer). comfortable and overall great pair of weight training gloves! can also be used for wheelchair propelling-works great!
5	1362873600	Fit is snug and tight and I like that better than previous gloves I bought from the same manufacturer. I bought deveral pairs.
1	1362700800	When i saw this product I was sure it was i will need but when they arrived they were similars but not exactly those i have seen.
4	1362700800	These have held up very well, used 2-3 times per week for many months now.  They look good, feel good, and fit well.
5	1362528000	I purchased these gloves for general use, as I figured they would be good quality. They are! Exactly as pictured and described. I have small hands, and the 'small' size fits perfectly. They give an impression of being very durable gloves with good grip. I look forward to using them!
4	1362441600	A bit tighter than the sizing indicated but overall a great product, I have purchased several different brands but Harbinger is the way to go.
5	1362355200	I'm a woman with relatively small, but wide (palm) hands. My fingers are not thick and I remove my rings prior to a workout - after the first time I used these gloves WITH my rings. (More on that later.) That being said, I purchased these gloves after trying them on at a local store to check the fit. I purchased a men's size 'small'. I wasn't sure that was a good choice as the gloves were very snug, but over time they've held their shape and a comfortable, functional fit has been the result.The Good:The gloves fit snuggly and the palms are wide enough for my hands. The velcro closure at the wrist is adequate enough to cinch up even on my small wrists. The padding on the palm (covered by leather) is comfortable and has eliminated developing calluses, which is why I purchased the gloves in the first place. Finger movement is not limited by the length of the fingers of the gloves. Seem to be holding up well with 4 day a week use.The 'Not-So' Bad:The finger holes are tight, and if you are like me and your hands swell during lifting, it can be very uncomfortable. This has eased with time however, and after 10 months, I don't even notice it anymore.The fingers of the glove have no real give to them and right at the web between each finger, the glove tends to 'cut in' and bite. It has been fairly painful at times and was extremely painful with my wedding ring on. This stops after a break-in period of a month or so.Getting the gloves off after a workout is a bit tricky (I peel them downward - inside out) because of the fit. I did try the next size up, but that was just bigger overall, the fit on the fingers was still tight.My Conclusion after nearly a year of use:If you want lifting gloves that are durable, with a snug fit, give 'em a try. I've been doing weights 4x's a week for 10 months - machines and free weights. I have developed a very slight callous inside my hand, under my ring finger on both the left and right side, but never any blisters using these gloves. The leather palm of the glove is worn, but not thin. I suspect they will be with me for another year without the need for a replacement pair. These are good gloves!
5	1362268800	Well made and comfortable. Been using almost a year now and have washed them several times. They're holding up quite well. Also use them in a 12 mile Tough Mudder with no issues.
4	1362182400	Does everything but make the weight lighter.  Sturdy construction and comfortable design.  Used daily with no problem. Price was right.
5	1362009600	Excellent model! The verdda this model are amazing ..! are very comfortable to use and protect you hands thoroughly.!! Los recomiendo....I recommend them ....
5	1362009600	It is GREAT! -it's Amazon's security that really sucks!!!!!!. I have had 2 Debit cards hacked this year. I only use those cards on Amazon - NO WHERE ELSE!  So be very careful letting Amazon keep your information on their &#34;Secure Site&#34; HA! I called them and they as much as told me it didn't happen.  I KNOW AMAZON WAS HACKED BECAUSE I KNOW I ONLY USE THE CARD ON HERE. BEWARE!
3	1361923200	The Harbinger Pro FlexClosure gloves replaced my old worn-out Harbinger gloves that had lasted 3 or 4 years of thrice weekly workouts at the gym.  I've been using the new gloves for about one month now.The new gloves seem to be made of thinner material than old ones that I had bought at a sporting goods store.  I doubt they will last as long as the old ones.They provide pretty good (but not great) protection to my hands against calluses for my light weight lifting.  I will continue to use them, but next time I will choose heavier gloves and will probably buy them a sporting goods store, so I can try them on beforehand.A minor complaint:  The gloves leave a blackish-blue, ink-ish color on the palms of my hands after a workout.  This washes off readily with soap and water.
5	1361750400	I got these a few months ago, and have used them at least 4 times a week since, they still look/feel good as new.Pros: tough gloves, cheap, look goodCons: they stink now, and I'm not sure if they're safe to wash or not.
3	1361750400	These are some good quality gloves. The problem is that the fingers do not extend far enough for me. When I am lifting weights the middle section of my finger gets pinched by the end of the glove and the bar of the weight. If your finger is divided into 3 sections then I would want the gloves to go past the 1st and 2nd ones, only exposing the fingertips.
5	1361750400	Best you can buy. Very durable and nice grip. No more blisters!. . . . . . . . .
5	1361664000	Great grapping and excellent quiality. Perfect for my work out on the gym.  Make sure the size is correctly choosen.
2	1361318400	The side of the glove is already torn and one of the stitching in the webbing of the glove is already coming off. As a graduate student, I can only currently fit in two week workouts. I've started heavily lifting again barely less than a month ago and it's already starting to tear. My cycling gloves are stronger than that! You have to be kidding me... Money wasted, pretty much.Another tip is to probably buy one size up. It was a good fit, pretty much perfect for me but this glove does stretch and can really choke the webbing of your fingers or constrict some movement of your hand. I'm stuck with these gloves I guess... They're not bad, but they are far from good as I initially believed of them.
5	1361318400	well, bought this a while ago and still using tghem at the gym, have already recommended it to a couple of guys and they too are very happy, good cushion and very durable.
4	1361232000	I use these gloves 2-3 times a week (general gym work) and find them a good fit, hard-wearing and well made. I'm not tough on my gloves but they do wear well. Able to be washed in the washing machine, too. I currently get about 18-24 months each pair.
5	1361059200	Exactly as described. Everything he said had the description and the colors were exactly alike. I loved it. Thank you. The shipping is so quickly
3	1361059200	The glove I got fits okay (only a tiny bit loose), but the fitting isn't the problem. The gloves dig into the webs between your fingers and when your hand start sweating, it really starts to sting and hurt.Stopped using them but still giving 3 stars because they're well made.
5	1361059200	I've tried a lot of gloves. None of them have the great sleek fit of these, while still giving the utility of bare hands. These gloves help a lot.
5	1360972800	I have had these for a while now and they are durable.  Holding up well to frequent use.  Highly recommended.
5	1360800000	Very good fit. Just sometimes I feel like I have better control without using the gloves than when I do have them on, especially when lifting with dumbbells.
4	1360540800	Helps keep my hands from being scraped up. I am 6ft1, with thin and long fingers, and the large fits pretty well.Sometimes I still get a little scraping past where these gloves reach, but it is pretty minor.
4	1360454400	have been using them for a couple months now and have been pretty satisfied, wish for a little more pad at the thumb area but they have been doing great
4	1360454400	My second pair. Very comfortable. I like heavy duty leather gloves instead of the nylon. I hope they never stop making these gloves.
4	1360368000	Great gloves... they fit so well .... a pleasant surprise... they are comfortable without being soft... they arrived promptly and in perfect condition thanks Amazon......
5	1360281600	great product, do not regret purchasing it, can work out for muuuuuch longer and better now!....thats all i gotta say
3	1359676800	BOUGHT THE BIG ONES! AND THEY ARE TIGHT! I would size up if you have man hands like I do.
5	1359504000	Good quality for the price. Came perfectly. Would recommend. Now on my hands will not calluses from the bar, the bar or dumbbells.
5	1359504000	I bought the gloves to protect my knuckles while doing knuckle push-ups. They were as described and totally worth the money.
2	1359244800	I wanted an xx large as i had tried an x large that was too tight. The xxlarge is almost as tight.
3	1359158400	I bought this for use with my Mountain Bike & for fitness exercises, after the other ones I had fell apart. They seem well made, and do offer protection. I bought the large size since I didn't want them to be too tight, but unfortunately, they still are and cause some pain after extended use. I'm hoping they will break in eventually. Comfort level could be better.
5	1359072000	Love these gloves! Have used this model for several years. They fit great.The stiching ensures long life and the design is very stylish. After wearing my first pair I have subsequently bought several pairs at a time. I use one for driving in winter. I keep another pair in my gym bag for use there and one with my softball gear. It works well as a batting glove and great protection for my head first slide into the bag. Lastly I use it on my wavemaster and speedbag to throw punches. Again light weight and good protection. On size. I've heard others comment about going with manufactures size - for me that would be XL. They do fit snug and after a hard work out they've got some moisture in them (sweat) so they are hard to peel off. I went with the next size up (XXL) and it's worked out great! The bad: Increasing harder to find this model. I don't know why when there is an exceptional design it gets changed.
5	1358985600	I use these gloves 6 days a week for weight lifting. They do the job very well. The fit on them (which is very important to me) is absolutely great. I never worry about them falling off.The look nice, provide a very good grip, and do their job well. I'd highly recommend these to anyone looking into gloves for lifting heavy objects (or even just for looking cool)
5	1358985600	exactly what I expected, great quality, they hold up well. I've been using them almost every day for about 9 months and no issues.
1	1358899200	Bought these for my husband.  He felt like they were too padded to do pull-ups and other non-bar exercises.  Darn!  Need to see if it is worth the $ to return ship it back.
4	1358812800	In an effort to find a replacement for my Valeo Ocelot gloves that are no longer produced, this pair had similar qualities.  However, as one reviewer previously stated the gloves fit really tight at the webbing of of the hands and I needed to cut one of the gloves between one of the figures to alleviate the pinching.  Also, at the wrist when pulling the gloves on the material has separated, but I've also been able to fix this.
5	1358553600	I am 6'8&#34; and have big hands. The xl pair fits well and I can do a lot of lifting. Palms have never gotten sore and the gloves have enough elastic to make them very comfortable.
3	1358467200	Decent pair of workout gloves for those of you who do not prefer padding in your workout gear. If you like lots of padding, I would not recommend this product.
5	1358467200	Product arrived on time. Sizing chart was a great help glovesfit just right and will grow/contour with use. Wrist straps are positionedjust right. Great gloves for a great price!
4	1358380800	I like the open air vents in the back of the gloves, however, I feel like the length of the fingers has decreased over time. Otherwise, I love these gloves.
5	1358380800	I do P90X and use these gloves for my pull-up and weight routines (about 2-3 hrs per week).  I have had them for several months now and they have held up great! They are very comfortable and allow good grip also.
5	1358380800	Bought these for my husband since he was getting calluses on his palms from weight lifting.  He said they are a comfortable fit and he can get a better grip now too.  No more calluses either.
5	1358380800	Got these for my father in law, who uses them to lift weights.  He likes them.  They fit good, and provide good grip, while also allowing good range of motion.  He has washed them one time, and said they came out just fine.
2	1358294400	I bought these as a backup to have for the gym at my apartment for when I can't make it to the gym at work. The gloves I've used are Harbinger 155s in a size Medium (they're great and stretched to size after using them for 2 weeks.).After reading reviews, I decided to get an X-Large in the H-143s. I have long, thin fingers and I didn't want to get some that were too small. Let me just say these are still way too small, regardless. The finger holes are way too tight (as is the palm), but the wrist is loose. I don't know why this is the case, but I do know that whenever I do "push" exercises, like on chest day, my palms start to cramp up from trying to hold the weights. I'd rather have calluses on my hands than drop a 60 lbs dumbbell on my face from my hand giving out.I'm going to attempt to further break them in, but after using them sporadically for over a month I don't see that happening. I purchased mine from Amazon, not from a 3rd party seller, in case anyone was wondering. Feels like a nice glove other than the sizing issue.
5	1358294400	These are my first pair of weighlifting gloves and I am so glad that I bought them. I was worried they would not fit do to the other reviews stating the chart was wrong. Well I went with what the chart said and I am glad I did. They are comfortable and fit great. They are hard to get off though.
4	1358208000	These are great minimalist weight lifting gloves for those who don't need a heavy wrist wrap.  The velcro strap stops at the base of the wrist and gives practically no support to the wrist.  There is a moderate amount of padding on the palms and fingers in just the right places.  The fingers on these gloves are designed to come up to the middle knuckle on your hand.  This is enough protection for the parts of your hand which are the most highly stressed by weight lifting - notably on the inside of your hand at the base of the fingers.  The gloves seem very durable and are very grippy.  All good things.So basically I give this glove 5 stars for design and construction.However, I also deduct a star for the absolutely wonky sizing.  I'm a 5'8" male with moderately sized hands.  I bought a large and they are too small. I just don't understand how a male of below average height and average proportions can require an extra large sized glove.  I thought maybe the glove just needed breaking in, but I can confirm that it does not.  After two workouts the glove is still too small and doesn't appear to want to stretch out.  I've been working out for 17 years and this is the first time I've required an extra large size workout glove.  I guess next time I'll know better.My hand is 7-1/2" from the tip of my middle finger to the base of my hand.  I would say that the maximum size for a comfortable "large" fit would be 7".  Anything over 7" would require an extra large.  Be sure to measure your hand before you order so you don't make the same mistake I did.
5	1358208000	Harbinger has proven to be the best weight lifting gloves I've ever used.  They outlast any other glove I've ever tried.  While many gloves last me only a few months, I can usually get at least a year out of Harbingers, and I lift five times a week.  The fact that they are washable is a great plus as well.
2	1358121600	Did not breathe at all and seemed not size was right.  Going o continue to look for a better glove
5	1357862400	I have been using it for several months in weight lifting and it is amazingly durable. I didn't get any blisters or vesicles as other weight lifters had. I RECOMMEND IT.
4	1357862400	I like the gloves; however, they are very difficult to take off.  They stay dry and put. Good grip for heavy lifting, pull ups and chin ups.
5	1357689600	These gloves are very nice workout gloves. The price was very reasonable and this made a very nice gift for my boyfriend.
5	1357516800	Good gloves, bought large...and they were too small (i like tight gloves)  so i ordered xl's and gave the other ones to a friend, worked out good, good quality, but like any weight glove they will inevitably deteriorate.
5	1357257600	Wonderful price and product  Easy to use and the price is right....  You can't go wrong with this product. !!!! Awesome
5	1357171200	I lost my previous gloves so i got these. Great price and quality. I'm not an Olympic weight lifter or anything, so it definitely fits my needs!
5	1357084800	These gloves work as advertised. I've used it for about a month now and the caluses on my hands have now gone completely away. They have decent grip which is good enough for anything that I need to lift. My hands do not get too sweaty or clammy or anything. Just works and is a very reasonable price.
4	1357084800	Chose them because I wanted a cheap pair of workout gloves. They fit very nicely and are worth the price and probably even more.
5	1357084800	Came as described and very timely. I bought for my brother and he liked them very much. Great gift for gym enthusiasts.
4	1356912000	Excellet fit, glove measurement chart on Harbingers website was accurate enough as this was my first glove purchase.Comfortable and is great for working out.
5	1356912000	I read the reviews and was worried about buying two sizes larger but they were right.  I should be wearing medium gloves but purchased the the XL gloves and any smaller would have been uncomfortably tight.
5	1356739200	I bought these gloves for a work out fan.  He lifts weights and his old gloves are worn through.  He said these are much better than the ones he had and is really looking forward to trying them out.
4	1356652800	simple basic glove that is well made and should provide good long term usage. I measured my hand prior to order and these gloves are pretty much spot on for size.
4	1356480000	Replaced a similar pair that I lost. Fine, no problem. Fits well and provides enough padding whilestill retaining good feel
5	1356480000	A lot of weightlifting gloves require you break them in first. Either wash them or use them for a while before they feel good in your hands. Not these gloves. Right out of the box they worked great. Comfortable. Long lasting. Perfect for the gym or home. Highly recommend these gloves for working out.
5	1356393600	My husband is a long haul driver and has LARGE hands,  to find a pair of XXL gloves made my day. And his too! These are well made and should last a long time.
5	1356307200	I think these are a great pair of gloves for the money. Some people say the sizes run small. They should be a snug fit. They will go on fairly easily, but, be a little difficult to pull off (especially when they are brand new). They will stretch out a little bit after a couple weeks of regular use. If they are loose, you will have the leather in the palm bunch up between your hand and the bar. That is extremely uncomfortable and adversly affects your grip. Hear me now and believe me later.
4	1355961600	These gloves are great. The only issue that I had was I ordered a size too big based upon the measurements I did in accordance with the Harbinger website (not on the products detail page on amazon but harbinger's site).No issue with the gloves just the sizing chart. I measured multiple times and with great specificity but the size I was fit for is a bit too big around the wrist.Once again, the gloves are nice. They grip well and allow me to lift heavier without fear of dropping my weights on the ground (Bowflex weights which tend to slip).
5	1355616000	I've been using these for about six months now and they are holding up very well.  No rips or tears, threads are not coming out, and the glove continues to be very comfortable.  Good product!
4	1355529600	Awesome gloves, only issue...on my left hand right between my middle finger and ring finger the gloves bore down really hard. I finally broke them in but geez it took almost 2 months. I work out 3 times a week, and its just a tad annoying/hurtful. But another reviewer suggested making a little slice on em. I didn't want to cut my new gloves. So i sucked it up and now there great. Overall a good pair of gloves. You may try maybe getting a size bigger.
5	1355356800	Product that came on time. Product that was received was as exactly what was advertised. I would use this site again.
3	1355270400	good material, it is a bit unconfortable while working out because the interior sewing lines can print lines on your hand.  That makes me unconfortable. some people cares, some don't. you have to judge it yourself.
5	1355184000	I have tried a wiiiide variety of workout gloves and I can confidently say that these workout gloves are the best. Very solid and they lasted me a little over 8 months (lifting five times a week). The size usually corresponds to your tshirt size (I am a large). They fit perfectly and I cant complain.
5	1355097600	confortable and durable!good quality!It helps me a lot on weighting and protecting my hands from wore out.I love it!
5	1354924800	I love these. Better than the Harbingers I replaced. Nice tight fit with good padding. Cheaper price for higher quality glove than I could find in local sporting goods stores.
5	1354752000	Let me tell you, finding gloves for a big old hog oar of ands isn't easy, but, by God, I've done it! He loves them, hasn't had a pair that fit so well in he can't remember when! XXL was his fit, he is 6'2 at 260 pounds and has hands, (from wrist to middle finger tip,) of bout 8 inches. These allow full movement of his fingers for great gripping control. He, and I, highly recommend.
4	1354752000	I weight lift multiple days a week.  I needed some good tough gloves, and these gloves fit the bill.  I will be ordering more in the future.
5	1354752000	I work out daily and these gloves have lasted a really long time. I could not be happier and &#34;if&#34; they ever wear out I would buy them again
3	1354579200	Followed the sizing chart and the gloves are so tight I can't grip a bar.My wife ordered a ladies' pair and hers fit perfectly.Obviously consistency is an issue.Otherwise they seem well made.
4	1354579200	This are great simple gloves that won't rub off and leave black on your hands after and hour of lifting in the gym.
3	1354492800	I am 6'0 and between 180 and 200lbs.  I have slender hands, but these are not built for my hands.  every dimension is for someone of thicker stature.  if you have thick hands, they're great, if not DO NOT BUY.
3	1354406400	It's always Good to replace your gloves but this one runs very small and it hurts my hand. I Didn't realize that it was too small on started working out in them.
5	1354320000	Just what I was looking for, very lightweight & breathable! Easy to get on and off and great price, very happy with these gloves!
4	1354060800	I've used these gloves for about three months.  These glove are ok, they do serve their purpose.Pros:These gloves do well in the washer and dryer.  Mine have not frayed yet and I wash them after each workout.Cons:I found that I have to wash these gloves after each workout.  They do build a smell because of the sweat. As long as you wash them you can prevent the smell.
5	1353801600	When I started working out with weights,  I noticed my hands were sweaty and did not get good grip.  So out of fear of having weights fall on me or elsewhere. I purchased these gloves.  They are comfortable.  After i cut the webbing a bit from another reviewer mentioned.  Now i work out and have better grip on the weights.
5	1353715200	Before I got this product, every time I got back from the gym, I would have red spots on my hands that result from lifting metal weights. However, after using these gloves, these red spots do not come up anymore and I enjoy weight-lifting much more. The thickness of the glove is perfect; the grip is still firm, less harm to skin. Now I can actually lift weights according to muscle tiredness and not how much my hand hurts.
4	1353628800	I definitetly recommend the gloves if you are looking for work out gloves.  They are very comfortable and do not bunch up while lifting weights. Also, contrary to some reviews, these gloves run true to size. I read that they run small so i got x-large, even though my glove size has always been a "normal" large. X-large was definitely too big so i re-ordered it in large and (excuse the pun), they fit like a glove. The quality and fit cannot be beat for the price or even at a higher price.
3	1353456000	Threads began unraveling after a months use. After the second to third month, they began to tear. Improve the quality and this item could easily get 5 stars.
5	1353456000	Has a close fit so i would recommend going a size over your normal glove size, but these feel pretty sturdy and has a nice padding for grip
4	1353369600	Pretty comfortable, and protects my hands so i don't get blisters on them from weights or my bike. Good gloves.
2	1353369600	After doing some research and reading a number of reviews I purchased this product. 1)I totally agree with the previous posts that said that the gloves ran small. I too ordered an XL since all my other gloves were XL and they were at least a size too small. And to the person who says this complaint is idiotic because leather stretches...leather also tightens when it gets wet. No need to name call, it is what it is. 2)These gloves have ZERO padding whatsoever! I got on the bench press and couldn't do what I normally do due to the discomfort. Felt like all the weight was resting on my wrists. 3)The stitching is perfectly imperfect!All in all, if I had baby hands and lifted 10lb weights these might be ok gloves. Unfortunately for me that's not the case. The search continues...
4	1353283200	These are quality tough gloves.  They don't have much padding, but are very sturdy.  They are really tight right now and I don't have big hands, but I know they will loosen up as I break them in.  This is (at least) my 3rd pair of Harbinger gloves over the years and I'm a big fan.
5	1353283200	THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, BECAUSE IT'S SOFT AND CONFORTABLE. THE COMBINATION OF COLOR IS FINE. IT'S THE BEST OF  HARBINGER
5	1352937600	Love the grip and feel. Let them break in for a month and you are good. Took me almost 2 years of constantly working out to wear these out. Just ordered the same ones from amazon for the next two years.
5	1352851200	I bought these to replace a similar pair and the quality is comparable.  mine fit a bit small but the gloves are flexible enough to stretch and never feel constricted.  they've already been washed several times and appear no worse.  these are simple gloves with a nice wide Velcro closure thats easy to grasp.
5	1352419200	I use it primarily for pulleys, and they seem to work very well so far. And it is very cheap.
5	1352332800	Wow! I order this n I got this today!  love this is so great. Fast sipping thanks you store. For doing fast shipping! Keep the great work. I use this about 5 weeks n it look great!
5	1352246400	Well made. Partially open back allows cooling and faster drying to help with odors between workouts.  Right amount of padding for my lifting.  Some support but still allows one to feel the grip without a lumpy palm pad.  No color bleeding and a good fit compared to the typical hand width measurements.  Too early to estimate wear but seems solid after ~ 50 workouts. Enjoy.
4	1351641600	I am not sure if the size I bought is too small. Overall it fits great, but the part where I bend my fingers hurts when I hang from a pull-up bar or any other similar grip. Anyone else having this issue? Anyone have a fix for this? For $13 I feel like I got more than what paid for and they seem like they will last a long time. I work out 4-7 days a week (5avg), if that is relevant.
4	1351123200	Nice workout gloves. Use them about 3 times a week. Very durable. Great price. It is a really nice buy.
5	1350864000	I have been using these gloves for years and I have no complaints. My hands are quite soft and I have no desire to callus them all up. Say what you want about that but it's true. It also lets me concentrate on my lifts more as it makes it easier to retain a grip when lifting several hundred pounds. I usually buy these gloves as they are readily available at most stores around the area like Walmart and Dick's. However they are horribly overpriced at those locations. The stores don't usually sell the tan gloves either so I am trying those out and so far they are nice. The gloves I am replacing are the same model but black color and I have used them for about 2 years. Those gloves were shredded but they still kept on chugging along.
3	1350432000	I ordered the Flex Closure, in medium. what i got was a regular glove in medium. i dont feel like going through a bunch of bull to get this order right, but if you order this, dont expect to get what you ordered. it will be slightly different.
5	1350432000	EXCELLENT !! IS WHAT I EXPECTED, GOOD LOOKING, GOOD LEATHER QUALITY. I'M HAPPY WITH MY NEW GLOVES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GYM GLOVES.
5	1350172800	These gloves are great gloves not only do I use them for lifting, but they are great at the shooting range. They are COMFORTABLE FIT as well as the price.
4	1349913600	ADV: Grab feeling is good, glove is neither too thick nor too thin. looks cool(I bought the yellow version)DISADV: the side of 2nd knot of thumb is not protected by leather but by nylon. Sometimes when I'm holding heavy dumbell, the 2nd knot of my thumbs will be touching or worn by the sideface of the plate of dumbells(maybe my holding way is not so correct) and nylon cannot provide enough protection. I would prefer the the side of 2nd knot of thumb can also be covered by leather.
5	1349654400	These are very comfortable and I like the design, very cool. I prefer to wear a men's small as the men's gloves have more padding then the women's.
5	1349568000	I have this gloves one year ago,but looks like new,the leather is very resistant.I training 3 times in a week,and this have good padding,grip,and its very confortable.No pain in my hands when i lifting heavy weights.I think its need more ventilation.The Large size its ok for my big hands.This is a good pair of gloves for $13 bucks you dont find nothing better.HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
3	1349395200	They look and feel great when you put them on, but the finger tubes are a bit too long and when I lifted any heavy weights, they would dig into the skin on my middle finger. So I had to return them, unfortunately, because otherwise I really liked them.
5	1349395200	If you are looking for workout gloves that hold tight and keep the pain off your hands and in your muscles, these are for you. Provide great grip and take the awkwardness out of gripping weights.A+ product.
4	1349222400	My boyfriend has recently started getting into weightlifting, so I got these for his birthday. He loves them. I gave them four stars only because you have to order a size up (I have tiny hands and the Large size fit me like a medium would) and because they need to be broken in as they are a bit stiff.Overall, would recommend.
5	1348876800	I am a personal trainer and avid fitness buff. I have used many different gloves, but one of the things I like about these is that they don't dig into the crease of your thumb like so many others do. My only suggestion to anyone looking to purchase this brand is to consider the sizing. I have a small hand, but find the XXLs to be the most comfortable fit, I can get them on and off when my hand is sweaty. This seller did a great job of timely delivery too.
4	1348704000	I found these gloves to be extremely great at preventing callises from forming and allows me to go for more reps longer
2	1348531200	I purchased the Harbinger 143 gloves at a local retailer recently, to replace a well-worn pair (which lasted some years).  The new gloves have less than half the padding of the previous model and the leather is thinner.  The fit and stitching seem good.  I would not recommend these as they do not offer sufficient protection for your hands, mainly in terms of proper padding.
5	1348444800	Thick enough to prevent hard palms. My girlfriend does not like my palms to be hard so this was a good buy for the job. If fit well too
5	1348272000	I have been using it for more than a year every single day and it is holding up nicely. It is also thick to give lots of protection.
5	1347840000	I've been using these gloves non-stop for a couple of years, an average of 3 days a week, 52 weeks a year. They are comfortable, offer great protection and their endurance is unparalleled. I have gone through a lot of work out gloves, but none have lasted as long as these. I couldn't recommend them more highly.
4	1347667200	This seems like a good product for the price. I haven't tried a lot of other weightlifting gloves and i haven't been using these for more than a few weeks so I can't comment on their durability. I use XL gloves for all purposes from lab work to bike riding and usually have no problems with the fit. However this is one of those instances where the XL fit is snug. I've only used these a few times and I hope that they will stretch a little with use. Maybe I should have taken the other reviewer's suggestions and bought a size larger but XXL seemed like overkill. I would also have preferred a little more padding in the palm area as I can feel the stitching pressing into my palms.
5	1347580800	I've owned these gloves for almost 2 years now, and they're still going strong. I admit that I don't use them extremely frequently, but I would say that they're used at least once or twice a week. There is some wear and tear near the thumbs, but nothing you wouldn't expect from owning the gloves for this duration. Also, these gloves are very very comfortable and don't make your hands feel wet and disgusting. When they get dirty, you can easily throw them in the wash, but if they're really disgusting, you shouldn't put them in with your nice clothes, as some of the gym odour can rub off.
3	1347408000	I thought my hand is a regular size (medium). Therefore, I decided to order a "Large" size. However, it was toooo small and tooooo tight.I recommend "Extra Large" for medium size hands. In other words, choose 2 grades upper than your real hand size.
4	1347321600	I get the impression that the folks who make Harbinger gloves have finally responded to the people who've been complaining about the sizing on the 143's running small. I usually wear large in lifting gloves, but was considering getting XL in these the next time I bought some, as previous "larges" were indeed too tight. However, I tried some large 143's recently (mid-2012) and noticed that they were now what I would consider a genuine large...not mediums they call "large."UPDATE: After comparing my very latest pair (late September 2012) to previous pairs, I have to conclude that not all 143's are created equal.  The manufacturing/material/sizing of these gloves is inconsistent.  The latest pair, for example, didn't include a label indicating the size (and had a black "Harbinger" label rather than the usual white), though they were most certainly LARGE, and not "large" which are too small and tight.  However, it appears that some people are still receiving "larges" that would be better described as Medium or Small.  Some are made from a more stiff material than others.  If you are ordering these online, you can't be certain what you will receive, but they should be pretty good IF they fit.I've used these in the past, and will continue to buy them unless/until I find something better. THE MAIN REASON I USE THESE is that they're relatively comfortable with pull-ups, which I perform 3X per week on a bar that I mounted in the "doorway" of my garage attic access. It's actually an unpadded stainless steel lat pulldown bar with a rough "gripping" texture on it--much too rough for bare fingers. And yeah, the 143s' DO become wrinkly and uncomfortable at the fingers kinda quickly--at least the smaller "large" ones did; I'll have to see how it goes with these newer (2012), larger ones. (BTW, for those doing dips on a dip stand {such as theUltimate Body Press Dip Stand} I recommendHarbinger 1215 Big Grip II Weight Lifting Gloves. The 1215's have been described as having "too much padding" in the palm area, which makes them unusable for pulling exercises such as curls and pull-ups...and I agree. But all of that palm-padding makes them perfect for doing dips on a dip stand, as well as bench presses!)
5	1347235200	I have had a few gloves that tear at the thumb or any finger and last only a couple workouts. Gotta honestly say these are my best gloves yet. Padding is great, no pain on heavy lifts, and I have so far been going hard in the gym for almost three weeks and they are still going strong. I will see down the line how they hold up but can't complain right now....
2	1347235200	I measured my hand per the photo. 9" around, right in the middle of the XL size spec.My XL gloves barely fit me.  They've stretched out a little, but they'll never be comfortable.Do yourself a favor and SIZE UP your order!!!
5	1347062400	Bought these for my son to use during weightlifting in preparation for sports for his Junior year in high school.  Before using the gloves he always complained about calluses and sore hands after weightlifting sessions. Using these did the trick for him.  I've used Harbinger gloves that I've had for years now for myself.  Good product for the right price for sure.
5	1346889600	Fits good. Perfect fit and it does not hurt like some of the other reviews said it did. I didnt!
4	1346630400	Offers good padding against weights.  I used other gloves before where I get calluses. Not with these gloves.  The only complaint is that it slides too far down, so it gets too tight to the crevices between my fingers, and has to be tugged finger by finger to be taken off.
5	1346544000	I'm perfectly happy with these Harbinger 143 gloves. It's true they fit very snug but after a few weeks of workouts they were the perfect fit. You might want to order a size bigger than usual. I've been lifting weights for 33 years and these days I lift lighter weights so I don't know if these are good for power-lifting and so forth.
4	1345593600	Like these gloves a lot. These are the first lifting gloves I've gotten, so I don't have anything to compare to. I was just sick of the calluses I was getting at the base of my fingers, which led me to buy these. The padding is great, and my hands don't show the wear of lifting anymore. They breathe relatively well, so my hands aren't disgusting when I pull them out at the end of a workout. One thing though: as many other reviewers pointed out, they DEFINITELY run small. My brother has been using the Harbinger 155 gloves. He wears a Medium, and they seemed to fit me pretty good when I tried them on. However, because of the reviews, I bought a Large in these (the Harbinger 143). They aren't too small, but they're pretty snug. I'm worried that if they shrink at all, I'll have to buy another, larger pair. So, definitely buy a size up from whatever you think you need. Overall, great gloves.
5	1345507200	Harbinger gloves are great and i really like the new pro flex closure gloves. They fit well and are easy to wash by throwing into the washer and letting it air dry. It doesn't seem to damage the leather and or expand the material. A definite buy if you are looking for a workout glove.
1	1345248000	I ordered medium sized gloves (as the size chart suggested me being a medium) and the gloves that were shipped were much smaller in size. I faced a lot of difficulty trying to grip onto weights and it just resulted in painful palms after the workout. I went to a sports store recently and saw the exact same "medium" sized gloves and they fit perfectly. I went back home to check whether my gloves were mistakenly marked as medium even though they were small but I don't think that was the case. Maybe the seller storing conditions might have affected the quality of the product. Long story short - I was not satisfied at all.
3	1344988800	followed the instructions on how to size and fell right into the mid range of x-large. Still very tight after about 10 wears they are starting to loosen-up slightly.The thumb area on rt. glove is starting to unravel. I suppose not a big issue. I would order xxl if doing over.
5	1344902400	I wear them while working out. They are a great pair of gloves and they fit perfectly. I like the fact that they are wash & dry gloves. When they get dirty, I can just put them in the washer and dryer.
5	1344556800	These are by far the best gloves I have been able to find at a reasonable price. I have had them for about 9 months. I usually throw them in the washer once or twice a month and just let them air dry. All the other gloves I have tried would've had at least one or two holes by now. The only minor problem is they run a bit small so would order one or two sizes larger.
4	1344556800	I'm using those myself and just bought a couple as a gift. I use these gloves 3-4 times a week and they seem to be quite durable and comfortable. Recommend those
5	1344297600	I've been waiting to write this review until I knew whether or not this product was going to last or not. I've been using these gloves for about a year now and they have yet to rip yet at all. They are now all broken in and feel very comfortable. They also still are protecting my hands just as well as the first day (but now they are formed better to my hands). I have even recommended that a few of my friends get these gloves as well. They are quite inexpensive and in my experience they have lasted quite well. Hopefully they will last as well for you.
2	1344211200	I'm only 5' 7", 133 lb, a small guy.  I ordered these men's gloves, size M.  Size M arrived. Although they appear and feel nice, they are way too small for me.  For decades, all size M gloves fit me fine, but not these.  I gave them to my wife (they fit her).
4	1343779200	Overall the glove is pretty good. The styling is functional basic black, no frills, nothing fancy, don't need a matching jump suit to wear them. If you are like me and crack a sweat when you're in the gym, the wash and dry option is nice to have.In one of the images on the item description there is a note about cutting out the webbing between the middle fingers, this is a pretty uncomfortable area and does need to be removed. Turn the glove inside out, and a quick cut with scissors does the job.
3	1343088000	I have been lifting free weights for the past year and decided it was finally time to try using some gloves to minimize the damage the weights were doing to my hands. After reading through the reviews, I bought the Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Gloves. While the gloves themselves do the job, they seem to be bulkier than they need to be which sometimes makes me feel less comfortable lifting heavier weights. Overall not a bad product for the money, but if you are looking for something slim then I would look elsewhere.
4	1343088000	Love these gloves. They seem to be working out just fine. The only thing that sucks is that I listened to everyone else and ordered a size bigger than I normally do but it was still too small..next time i'll order 2 sizes bigger and I suggest everyone do the same.
5	1343088000	I'm extremely happy with these Harbinger Pro FlexClosure gloves that I ordered through Amazon. The material is comfortable for my hands, and the leather grip is excellent for holding weights, dumbbells, or other gym equipment. The velcro closure tab is sturdy but nothing special. I will comment like others here that the glove sizes run just a "tad bit small/tight". So if you are unsure what size you should order, you should consider rounding up to the next larger size than what you usually wear. Very happy with these, I am tempted to order a spare set of these gloves.
5	1342656000	I've been using these gloves for several years now.  They fit very nice and snug and lasts forever.TIP - Flip them inside out after each workout to let the inside of the gloves dry out.  If not, after some time, it starts to smell.  That goes for all gloves...not only this one.
4	1342137600	These are really high quality and well made.  I've got a couple of other harbinger gloves at big 5 or the gym and they are much cheaper feeling.
4	1342051200	I think I got my first pair of Harbinger 143 gloves from Amazon nearly three years ago now.  That pair lasted quite a long time before I decided to replace them due to wear (seams coming apart) and odor (after a while, it seems like no pair of leather gloves is immune to stinking, even after repeated washing).  I quite liked my first pair and was surprised to find some less than good reviews here, including comments from people about how their gloves fell apart rather quickly.  Well, I ordered another pair of these only about a year ago and they are already in much worse shape than the previous pair that lasted twice as long, despite getting the same amount of use from me.  I also noticed that some other reviewers mentioned how these gloves were tighter than they should be, and that didn't describe my first pair but definitely described my second.Just a few days ago, I ordered another replacement pair.  I obviously cannot say whether they will hold up better than the second pair I had, but I can report that even though the gloves are ostensibly the same size the new pair is, in fact, not nearly as tight on my had as my second pair.I'm a bit frustrated by the lack of consistency in what is supposed to be the same product, but I do like these gloves overall.  (I guess that's obvious or I would not have ordered another pair again!)
5	1341964800	Over the years, I have seen the general quality of weightlifting gloves diminish -- but am very pleased with this purchase.  These gloves are fine quality -- comfortable, and durable. I expect they will last for quite a while.
5	1341619200	I ordered workout gloves because I did not like how my hands were getting calloused and blistered when I started working out. After much searching I chose these because I felt they were the best value and had good ratings.I have worn them for two weeks now and haven't had a problem. My hands are no longer calloused and the gloves feel good when I am wearing them.I measured my hands and found them to be 7.6" around so I ordered the medium size (after much pondering on whether I should get a size up like many people said). I made a good choice as they fit nice and snug. Don't be dismayed if you feel that they are uncomfortable and tight at first, you just need to wear them for a while to make them fit better. I would also suggest stretching out the holes that surround the finger a bit while you are wearing them (do it gently!) to make them feel better in that area.
5	1340496000	After a bit of looking around, I chose these lifting gloves. They're a snug fit, and help out with having a comfortable grip. Just enough padding for protection so it doesn't feel bulky. I haven't tried washing them yet, but we'll see how that works out. I'm happy with my purchase.
5	1340323200	I love these gloves because they help my hands stay smoothe and still allow me to pound the weights. Thanks gloves.
4	1338768000	I had these for over two years, and sure they were durable while they last the first year.But after that, the material started to bunch up and it didn't protect enough of my hand.I eventually bought newer ones last year of a different brandThese are nice but too small (they don't protect enough of the fingers and hand)and they are heavy.'The leather starts to smell and the wear down (stitching) pretty quickly.Granted, these were pretty good price , I think it was good for what I bought it for but I'd recommend investing in some nice pairs since you'll use these babies often.Hope this helps,Daniel
4	1338508800	So far so good.  They come in small sizes which is good for my smaller hands.  I have a question.  What is the 2 little tabs that are attached near the inner wrist???
4	1337731200	This gloves are OK for training. They run a bit small but they work just fine for mel Hopefuly they last.
4	1337558400	A pretty good pair gloves with comfortable padding. It's tight enough to be able to train comfortably. The colors on the inside of the glove has faded already after about 10 sessions. I really don't care much about the color though as long as it does not rip.
3	1336694400	I bought these gloves for weightlifting at my local gym because I needed a tighter fitting glove. This glove I had to order a size larger and even still, they were very uncomfortable at the webbing between my fingers. I feel that the glove cuts too deep at these points and that there is too much material in between the fingers.I needed a good pair of gloves that could be used for rowing and weightlifting. While I find that these gloves work for my short periods of weight lifting, they are less than ideal for long periods of time on the rowing machine. The pain is simply too much and my hand grip adjusts in a way that is more uncomfortable on my wrists. It is too bad because for the price and the velcro strap on the wrist, it has the potential to be better.
2	1336608000	These just felt bulky in all the wrong places of the hand. After using them for lifting my hands (nerves/ligaments) were actually hurting, especially towards the end of the workout (while they did not hurt while doing the same sets w/o the gloves on prior days). I have average hands and ordered size L - yet they were very tight still - difficult to put on and even more pain to take off later (had to pull off each finger separately). It's funny, I had some gloves that came with a Makita circular saw and since I had nothing else I used those for lifting - and my hands felt much more comfortable in those gloves than in these. I would not recommend these gloves.
5	1335139200	My hands were extremely calloused and rough before buying these gloves. So much so that they even had hardened areas that would hurt people when I shook hands.If you're going to be lifting extremely heavy weights these are the gloves to buy.They have a great fit. They are snug but do not cut off circulation.I would highly recommend these gloves to anyone that does weight training.
3	1334880000	These gloves were a pretty good buy. They definitely run small so GET A SIZE UP.  I up-sized and still get some minor pinching between my fingers and the palm leather-area seems to have a few unwanted folds when I grip.Initially they are rough and need a lot of breaking in to. Don't be afraid to pull out the scissors and make small cuts to relieve some of the pinching areas.
2	1334793600	Didn't like these gloves, I have small hands and bought medium since the reviews said they run a little small.  Still too big!  I guess they are ok for lifting dumb bells, but for pulling exercises doesn't help..back, pull ups.
5	1334534400	I use these gloves 5 times a week. Going on the 12th week now, still going strong. These gloves are on point!
3	1333929600	The Haringer Pro FlexClosure 143 gloves are OK at best. The sizing guide is not very accurate. My hand measure 8" which according to their guide is a M or L. I ordered the L and getting the gloves on and off isn't very easy. I have to pull on each side separate to pull them off. Also, the gloves cut into the finger's webbings so it isn't very comfortable. Getting the gloves at your local Walmart would be cheap and of good quality. I also hand washed the gloves. The dye however kept coming and coming when trying to wring them out. Letting it sit in water make the whole water black. I change the water multiple times and it had the same results...disappointed about this. I wonder what would happen if I put it in the wash with my other clothes. However, Harbinger does seem to have very good customer service.
4	1332979200	I like it they have a solid thickish feel to it. I'm guessing after you break them in they will feel just right. The size I picked was large. It fits my hands pretty good. I had a size large for my previous gloves so I got a little worried about all this talk 'get a size bigger than what you normally get'. All in all it's a pretty decent glove for the price advertised. I don't understand some of the negative comments about this product.
1	1332806400	These are extremely uncomfortable workout gloves. I used a few times then purchased another brand. Would strongly recommend against purchasing these.
5	1332374400	These are heavy duty, thick gloves.  Some users may be used to / prefer their gloves on the thinner side.Thankfully, I read some reviews and actually measured my hands in the manner recommended by the Manufacturer prior to ordering.Based upon an old pair of gloves I had my first instinct was to order a size Medium.Based upon Harbinger's size guide, I was right on the break between sizes Large and X-Large.Based upon reviewer comments, I went with the X-Large size.  And, I'm glad I did.  They fit very snugly and I can't imagine the Large size would even fit me.
5	1331942400	UPDATE 11/16/12:The gloves are still perfect. I haven't even washed them since I bought them (haha) - and guess what? They don't smell! I have a black pair and they don't look dirty at all! Very happy with these gloves. I got the black pair for myself and a yellow pair for a friend but the yellow ones do get dirty.-----------I followed everyone's advice and bought a pair one size larger. The gloves fit me perfectly! Before buying I measured my hand's circumference using a small ruler - it was hard but I measured about 20cm which is ~ 7.9inches = medium. So I ordered large. Perfect fit! Almost all the negative reviews of this product are about the size and nothing else.It takes me 15seconds to take off each glove. It's not hard at all.I love how my hands NEVER sweat! Other gloves make your hands sweat but not these ones!! So the design definitely works.Since the hands don't sweat, the gloves don't give out a smell which is great also!The gloves look great. They feel great - very tight feeling. They are extremely comfortable and I love wearing them! The length on the fingers is just right, as well as the length on the wrists.When I first put on the gloves I thought - good amount of padding. When I went to lift weights for the first time with them on I thought they had more padding than necessary. After 3 days of lifting the padding has softened up and now they feel perfect!Pushups: these gloves helped me a lot! Before when I didn't have gloves my wrists would hurt when doing pushups (standard), but with these gloves my wrists no longer hurt AND the number of pushups I could do noticeably increased!One thing to note: when lifting light weights the padding sort of interferes with your "accurate control". For example, I did skull crushers with a curl bar and only 45lbs (light weight) and I was able to do much more reps WITHOUT the gloves. On the other hand with heavy weights they work perfect (e.g. bench press or barbell curls) and my number of reps increased noticeably now that I have gloves! So: excellent for heavy lifting, but for very light lifting you shouldn't wear them.Verdict: highly recommend these gloves. When you get them, try them on for a couple days and you'll come to love them! So far I have no complaints whatsoever!This review last updated on: 3/18/12
1	1330992000	I bought these gloves because the gloves I had been using were tearing a part. I'm not impressed. I had Schwinn biking gloves, bought them 4 years ago for $15 at Walmart but hardly used them so when I hit the gym I decided to use them instead of bare hands. They had a very rough surface (leatherish i think) and I had no issues with them for 2 years! These gloves already in a month seem to be losing their grip and I have to constantly wash them to remove every little grease/sweat/dirt which seems to make them lose their grip. I hardly washed, maybe threw them in the washer once or twice, the Schwinn gloves. They're just not worth. I'm so worried about the grip on the bench I have to use tissue paper just to make sure they won't slip. For gloves made for the very purpose of grip, they're just not impressive. They're definitely more comfortable but when you're benching hundreds of lbs you don't want something that feels great to your skin you wana know that it's not going to slip and these gloves just don't do that.
5	1330992000	As some reviewers have mentioned, the size of these gloves may be smaller than you think they will be. But the quality is very good. My hands are smaller than average, hence I had no problem using this. I highly recommend this pair for its grip.
5	1330819200	I've got to highlight these as quality gloves. The leather here is soft,flexible, and properly placed. The material doesn't shrink in the wash.
5	1330646400	The Harbinger Pro is a great pair of gloves. It provides all the abrasive protection and grip you could ever want. However, the areas between fingers dug into my hand during the first few weeks of use, but after it was worn in it literally "fit like a glove". I lift 5 times a week with heavy weights doing power lifts and olympic lifts with them, and after almost a year they finally wore out. The first things to go were the threads that held the leather in place at the fingers (where the knurling on the bar rubs against) which then led to the fabric mesh around the fingers to come apart. The padding is not excessive but after about a month of lifting all the padding was flattened anyways.Remember to wash your gloves once in a while or they will reek from the sweat. Hand wash them with a little bit of hand soap/detergent and air dry.
5	1330300800	harbinger gloves or very good work out gloves . long lasting and if you wash them and let dry they or ready to go.
5	1329868800	I've reached the point in my training routine where the hand discomfort of gripping the weights was preventing me from progressing.  I read the reviews offered and ordered these in the large size since the consensus seemed to be that they ran small in size.  They are easy enough to wear and grip, not too stiff, and very breathable.
1	1329436800	I ordered the same size as my last pair and these must have been mis-tagged because they were so small I could not wear them.
4	1329264000	I got them for my boyfriend who started lifting, hes says they're great. They help with hand pains so he can lift heavier weights and for longer durations. For beginners, I would strongly recommend!
3	1329177600	i got these gloves for airsoft i get hit in the hand alot in CQB bit i dont whant my finger tips gone so i use theese :D a bit itchy.
5	1327363200	I read reviews and purchased this - Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove (Black, Large)Undoubtedly this is 75% leather and fits perfect... Another FYI... My hand measured 7.5, but I bought the Large (Coz it was kinda cheaper) and it fits perfectly... Thanks a lot...
3	1327276800	I'm not an especially weird-handed person.But these gloves just don't quite fit right. I went with medium, and am sure large would be too big (come on I weigh &lt; 150 lbs. I'm clearly not a Large size anything.)My problems are threefold:1) The fingers are cut too deeply. What I mean is, when I have the glove on the bottom of the "V" in between two fingers cuts painfully into the skin webbing between my fingers. Again I have completely normal hands - not aquaman here. My fingers fit in the holes perfectly, so clearly the proportions are just wrong. Never had this problem with a glove before.2) The velcro strap rides up too high on your wrist. It's generous saying it's even on my wrist, it's really half on my palm.3) The above two might make you think maybe I am indeed a large. But the thumb-hole already has a lot of wiggle room - no way I'd need more. Additionally, as I said, the finger holes are perfect and the pads align well with the bottom of my fingers to prevent callouses.This is clearly just a case of a poorly designed product. If you can get them under $15 and only lift 2-3 days per week it might be worth it. Otherwise it's worth an extra few bucks to look elsewhere.Side note: the yellow version of these gloves are what Artie on Glee uses. Weird.
2	1327017600	I followed the sizing chart provided on the web page and ordered small, but now I can barely put them on and barely take them out (the taking out is so annoying). They will be a good present for my friend that has small hands!
5	1326412800	This is my second pair.  I'm still using the old one (about 4 years old) and this one looks more rugged.
1	1325980800	I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND IT NEVER COME !!! WHY I DONT KNOW BUT IT NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
5	1325635200	i received the item within a few days, it was very fast. The quality is also amazing i'm loving it
5	1325376000	I followed Glove size chart and bought size L. Gloves were a bit too small but after I wore it for a few times they got stretched. One more thing, no tracking number of the package.
5	1324857600	These gloves are a great investment if you spend a lot of time in the gym. Before using these, lifting would put a lot of stress on my hands almost making it unbearable to continue. While wearing the Harbinger gloves, they provide my hands with ample protection when lifting weights, doing pull-ups, etc. The only bad thing is the natural color gets a little dirty but other than that you can't go wrong!
2	1324598400	Like many others have already said, the sizing runs way too small. I'm 5'9", 165lbs, and I actually measured my hand (according to the image above) and I came out to large. I ordered large and what came was an extremely tight fit glove. I could hardly make a fist because it was so tight. I'm returning it for sure.
2	1324425600	I've had multiple pairs of Harbinger gloves but a different model in the past.  (and have always been satisfied)  The XL's of this model were so small I thought they had to be a woman's size.  FYI, this model seems to run very small in the XL size.
5	1324339200	Great workout gloves.........I use them when weight lifting and using my rowing machine......Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glove (Black, Large) .....I bought two pair and would buy again!~
5	1324080000	These gloves are the bees' knees. They fit snugly without being overtight and have just the right amount of cushioning. I normally have my gloves last years, so will have to see how long these last. I've got no reason to think they won't though. I'm thoroughly pleased I bought them.
5	1323993600	I work out 3 times a week for about 5 hours total and use these gloves consistently. They work really well. The stitching is great, they are tight enough to allow for a good grip but are easy to remove without tearing them apart. I would definitely buy them again. BTW, I am 6'2" and I bought the large size and they fit perfect.
4	1323648000	Gloves are comfortable and made of real leather. The palms are all double thick leather to minimize calouses on your hand. I bought two pair and glad I did. This way, one can be in the wash, while I use the other pair. Great valueOne negative, it is a litlle short, i would have preferred a bit longer.
5	1323129600	I weightlift 2-3 hours a day at the gym. Hard intense workouts and these gloves keep holding up. I have gone through many other pairs in just weeks. These have kept their padding and seams have held up. A great buy for a great price!
4	1322438400	These weightlifting gloves are exactly what I had hoped they would be.  They fit well and provide the appropriate amount of padding.
4	1322438400	I only bought these for a costume so I don't know how they hold up while working out yet. Really nice gloves though.
4	1322352000	Nice quality for the price, but even if you follow the instructions for measuring, consider getting the next size up.
3	1322179200	These are not nearly as comfortable as the Valeo pair they replaced.  I'm not talking about padding, it's just generally a less comfortable glove to wear.  The shape of the glove forces your hand into a semi closed position.  It takes more effort than usual to straighten your fingers or make a fist.  The construction is pretty rough which again doesn't help the comfort thing.  On the bright side, so far they're lasting well.
3	1321315200	You'd be forgiven to think making a fitness glove isn't rocket science, but actually manufacturers can go wrong quite a bit. I have bought this particular glove as it promises to be washable. While I have yet to try that aspect of the glove's performance, I am sure it will do well at that.I am not too impressed with the rather rough finishing, getting the glove on isn't a pleasure the seams are not covered and the back of the velcro actually rubs against the skin. Once on and at it though, the glove performs fine, does not however support your wrist (the Reebok model does an excellent job at that, albeit at a much higher price). I also do not like the latches with which the gloves were attached to the cardboard packaging, I recommend you cut those off.Considering the price, you are getting a good (but not very comfortable) glove at a reasonable price. I found a method to wash even 'non-washable' gloves though, I put them in a black cotton sock (to prevent color bleeding) and treat them with a pre-wash product and then wash it on the hand washing cycle at a low temperature. Don't put them in the sun to dry and avoid a tumbler at all cost, the product will have a surprisingly long life that way without the smell that seems to accompany workout gloves after a while.
5	1321228800	Bought these gloves because certain exercises putting a lot of stress on my hands and creating calluses. These gloves fit comfortably on my hands and the grip is great. Been using these for about 6 months and they are still in good condition.
5	1320883200	I realized a need a glove to increase the amount of weights i could lift. This made doing squats, dead-lift, lateral pull down, and dumbbells pretty easy. I can actually get my muscles to work rather than hurting my palm.Decent padding, decent price. Yes, I read other reviews, order one size larger. I also tried the size in sports authority before ordering it online (its was 3 dollars cheaper on amazon).The material near the thumb looks little cheap, lets see how long they last. Overall happy with the purchase.April 2012 Update=================These are really nice pair of glove, I have been regularly using them in the gym and they are still in very good condition. Changing my rating from 4 to 5!
4	1320883200	These are very solid and snug fitting gloves. I really like them, and they seem well build. One thing to keep in mind is that the leather around the fingers is very strong and will take a while to be worked in. For the first few times of use, they will pinch your fingers, but eventually this will go away. I recommend these if you want to protect your hands from calluses.
4	1320192000	These fit small compared to my other harbinger gloves. My other set was a medium, so I figured a medium would fit. It didn't. Should've ordered a large. The skin between my fingers always gets pinched. I still tolerate it though.These gloves have padding in all the right places for every exercise, pushups, bars, free weights...after a few months of using these gloves, they still don't smell which is AWESOME. I couldn't handle the smell of my old gloves and I couldn't get rid of the smell. They weren't the wash & dry like these either which is why I retired them, even though they were still physically in good condition.These don't show much wear/fatigue indictive of failure. Very well crafted and built to last like my old harbinger gloves.Would recommend and buy again.UPDATE 2/5/2012:Still using these. I workout on average of 3x a week. They still haven't developed a smell. I probably only washed them once or twice since I bought them. No rips or tears yet. They've developed a slight fraying on the cut-off finger tips, but very minor. They are holding up extremely well.
5	1319932800	Originally bought these for my son for Christmas 2010. Bought him a second pair to keep at home and he keeps the others at college. Great buy and the gloves wash very well, too.
5	1319587200	I have not actually used the gloves yet, since I haven't reached a high enough weight where I'm limited by the pain in my hands, but I did try them on and they feel great. They also came promptly and without a hitch.
4	1319587200	Good quality, tough gloves. I ordered Medium since my winter gloves and the latex gloves I use at work are also Medium size. However, the gloves run small. They are very snug, and although after several uses they seem to be loosening up a bit, I still find myself struggling to "peel" them off of my hands from how tight they fit. Highly suggest going one size bigger if purchasing.
5	1319500800	The glove were perfect, strong yet flexible a nice snug fit also. Arthur/CAPS DO you sell a larger size glove just the pair i bought/I need a pair one or two sizes larger thanks Arthur/CA
5	1319500800	These gloves are great! They are sized small so order them large like every one else says. They are a little stiff at the web of your fingers when they are new but a couple workouts and they fit and feel fine. I had no problem with loss of grip doing lat pull downs or pull ups with these gloves at all. The leather in the palm has just the right amount of thickness and is very tough but pliable. The mesh back is breathable and doesn't overheat your hands. I would have paid twice the price for these if I had to.
5	1319155200	Thank you very much!  I was extremely happy with the fast service of this item.  I sincerely and wholeheartedly appreciate it.
5	1317945600	They are comfortable, durable, and don't cost any more than the cheap gloves I normally get. Having the option to change size was an amazing benefit and made a huge difference.
4	1317772800	These gloves fit great except for one place. In between my ring and middle finger on my right hand the seam is deeper than the others and it digs into the space between my fingers. I dont know if this is a design flaw or a hand flaw. Still great gloves.
5	1317600000	This weight lifting glove is very comfortable and easy to get on and off, however I am female and usually wear a size large in a ladies glove and had to order an XXL in a men's size, so they do run small. Outside of their running small, I rate them very highly. They are hard to wear out.
3	1316822400	The gloves work great but are tough to get back off. Whatever size you think you are, buy 2 sizes bigger if possible. I bought one size larger but they are still tough to get off and feel a little tight. I stretched this out so it is starting to feel a little better.
3	1316044800	Overall, these gloves are made of 70% leather and feel pretty solid on hands, when lifting they help by reducing friction of the bars and weights on hands. But there are two severe problems with these gloves that knocked off two stars from this review:1- So before buying anything on the internet I read lots of reviews as experience reflects the truth. When going through some of the bad reviews of this item I noticed some people were having trouble with the sizing marked on this page as being smaller, so I thought, ok there are many good reviews and the sizing is the problem so I bought a larger size, when it arrived I immediately put them on and they felt perfect (almost too perfect). When I tried them out at the gym I started feeling them very small specially between the fingers and when holding onto a bar and lifting it the gloves puts too much pressure on the webbing of the fingers causing an "itching" pain making them very uncomfortable almost to a point where I wasn't able to close hands. So now I'm considering buying 2 sizes larger to get around that problem.2) The velcro pad to secure wrist stick to other parts of the glove when not in use, dragging out the synthetic fiber out of the fabric making it look used and cheap.The advice I give you if you are considering buying this is that if you wear Medium buy Extra Large for example, two sizes larger.
5	1316044800	Excellent weight lifting gloves. I purchased a pair about ten or so years ago and used them regularly (three times a week) for almost five years before I had to replace them. I especially like the 3/4 finger length since it prevents blisters. Rugged, fairly priced and excellent quality. They're also machine washable.
5	1315785600	I was looking for gloves to wear during my teacher led exercise classes -- tough on hands to do pushups on concrete ... and bands often slip in sweaty hands.  These are GREAT gloves and an even better value -- and love that they can be washed.  Here is one word of caution --- be sure to order the next size up from what you normally do.  They run VERY SMALL.  All in all great product and recommend highly.
3	1315612800	I got this from my local 24Hr Fitness. They look ok and made to be sold for $15. However, be careful with the sizing. I found that size L was too small for my hands, but since my gym only had them in Large size, I tried all of 7 them they had in stock and found that 3 pairs labeled Large fits my hand comfortably and 4 pairs labeled Large didn't fit at all. So, I am glad I didn't got it from the internet.My left glove is cutting the web between the ring finger and middle finger. I am hoping some more use to it should make it comfortable.Overall, they will do the job and not bad at all at this price. Just be prepared to deal with incorrect sizing.
5	1314576000	Before getting this glove, it actually kinda hurts working out, but with these on, I feel like i can workout much longer.  It gives a very good grip, however, for me, the thumb part was a tiny bit to narrow. I really hope it will lossen up a little after use.  Great GLOVES~
3	1313539200	I am a pretty skinny guy and size Large was still too small.  The gloves are nicely padded, but not comfortable at all.  I returned it and got the GoFit ones instead.
5	1313020800	Having had ALTUS Leather gloves for a looong time, which did a pretty good job, these are quite a few grades higher in terms of overall quality, comfort, functionality and convenience. Sure my old ALTUS Gloves were washable however they really were not created with that in mind at all I imagine, given they were entirely leather and got very sweaty-dirty quite quickly. These Harbingers breathe quite nicely indeed, fit very comfortably pre-break in, and have a keen sense of design both in cut and design. They really enhance your concentrative strengths instead of less than optimal functionality insofar as trying to always adjust to avoid grip/palm pains for example.These are great for many different uses aside weights... I noticed a reviewer mention they're great wheelchair gloves, and I can clearly see how easily they can be. Also great for driving, alot of outdoor work and also I find them to be great for tactical use and training as well. Very nice subtle cushioning in all the right spots.Personally I find the pairs  in black look rather appealing, very intelligent design and perfect stitching. And of course, being machine washable is ideal with no indication of degradation. For me one bit of advice would be buying a size larger for more dextrous uses- they will shrink- although break back in just fine for lifting, however for things that require more finite handling, I find shrinking down and breaking in a larger size certainly makes the difference. A couple pairs will definitely come in handy for a very good time.
5	1312761600	I am super satisfied!Very comfortable.Excellent grip.They look awesome.They Last a long time and are very durable.Easy to wash!Buy them!
1	1312416000	On my second workout the palm on one of the gloves tore.  I also found these gloves to be quite uncomfortable compared to other gloves.
5	1312243200	Gloves were accurately sized in description - they fit properly when I got them!They are well constructed and seem durable.My only problem is getting them off they fit so well!
4	1312156800	I have used a lot of harbinger products in the past, these would be my favorite gloves if the largest size was just a hair bigger (this is why 4 instead of 5 stars).Pros:-Easy to machine wash, have not had any problems, no seams broken, etc.-Perfect padding. Allows for good grip without sacrificing the comfort of the gloves.-Good Velcro. This was a problem in the past, where after a wash or 2 they wouldn't stay tight.Cons:-Sizing runs very small. Previous gloves were always L/XL. XXL is still small for me, but wearable.-Finger dividers are a bit sharp. This probably wouldn't be as noticeable with correct sizing.Like I said great gloves for the money, I am happy with the purchase despite the sizing.Update:After owning these for 1 year here are the pros/consPros:-Still holding together after machine washing many times-No rips or tears, surprised by this!-Velcro still worksCons:-Seams at the webbing of your fingers are still sharp/uncomfortable. They are not unwearable by any means but I have to pull the fingers up in between sets-Wrist has progressively stretched out but can still velcro-Padding wore down after about 2-3 months of consistent use but still are comfortable
4	1311811200	These are great workout gloves for the price. Great ventilation and protection during a hard workout. The only problem I have with the gloves is that it runs a bit small.
5	1311811200	Def what i expected and it's not that expensive. I can lift more pounds at the gym now without hurting my hands. Only thing i didn't like was when doing sit ups and having your friend throw a medicine ball for you to catch. It hurts your hands when you catch it. But not a big deal i just take it off.
5	1311120000	I actually use these gloves in place of biking gloves. Not only are they far superior in protection, but they cost far less. I normall wear an XL and the XXL is just a bit snug, but they are well made and look to be very durable.
1	1311033600	It is ridiculous how small these run.  I bought a mens large for my husband who has thin fingers and small hands,  they don't even come close to fitting.  They even felt tight when I put them on.  Total waste unless you like returning.
5	1311033600	I have been working out 5 times a week for a little over a year.At first, the callouses were nothing, and actually welcomed, due to the fact that I have a white collar job and had hands comparible to a baby before I started lifting.However, after a while when your hands are stiff as boards, and callouses peel off and bother you, you start looking at alternatives.  That's when I came onto these gloves via trusty Amazon.They are not bulky at all.  They seem to be made of very high quality materials.  After a couple weeks of heavy use, there is no sign of any wear and tear.  I expected to go through them much faster, but they appear to be built to last.The grip is definitely welcomed, but they have accomplished the goal I bought them for.  My callouses are already visible smaller, and I haven't had them dry up and peel off in about a week.So, if you are looking for a VERY reasonably priced pair of workout gloves, I would recommend wholey.  Great product.10/27/2012Alright, so I decided to mention the durability of these gloves.  I am today ordering my second pair.  The gloves as they stand now are completely trashed.  They were starting to tear and degrade after one year.  Now they are just about useless.  BUT, the good news is, they lasted me what, 15 months?  I use them 4-6 times a week.  I think that speaks to how tough the gloves actually are.
4	1310774400	I go thru wheelchair gloves quickly. I use them to propel but I also use them as my brakes. So I give these a 4 rating just because they are a little bit harder to get off my hands than my other gloves have been. It could be that they are snug or a bit smaller than the other brands I have used so keep that in mind when sizing.What I love is they are durable. I've used them, washed them, (no dryer) and worn them over and over. The places I ususally wear them out and get holes in are holding up really well. The padding in the places I need them seem to be thick enough for my comfort. Even going down hill I don't get that hot feeling from friction.I like my fingers to be out but that is just preference. Also, I can still walk some, so I'm not 100% in my chair. I can transfer in and out by myself and can propel myself for the most part. My own personal recommendation is to have at least 2 pairs so that you can wash one and have one ready to go!
5	1310342400	I find these gloves to fit my need perfectly.  They are durable, comfortable, and get the job done.  I switched to these from store brand gloves that had wrist support, after having positive experiences with other Harbinger products.  These seem to hold up much longer, and are a pleasure to use.  I am 5'11", with a slim build, and hands that may be a bit on the smaller side . . . but I decided to go with the medium size gloves since that is the size I buy for all my clothes.  I can't speak for people of different sizes/builds, but for me they fit and work great.  If you're looking for a solid pair of gloves and don't need wrist support, give these a try.  I recently purchased a backup pair to have on hand just in case my originals ever wear out.  These are my new glove of choice unless/until I find something that's somehow better.
5	1310256000	Thats all I ask for,a timely delivery,the product i asked for and the right size and color.like I said, what more could I ask for? Thankyou very much Amazon.
4	1310169600	I purchased an identical second pair within three months after being distraught at losing my first pair at the gym. The knurlings on gym equipment hurt my hand bad and this pair of gloves guard my palm well. I am at the gym 3-4 times a week and do basic weights and stability training, nothing too fancy so the gloves are not truly battle tested. They are inconspicuous black gloves that look sophisticated. I have two issues with them no fault of the glove itself - my exercise watch moves down to meet the leather upper for the velcro fastener and pushes the watch buttons into my skin and that hurts after an hour. Secondly, I had to remove my ring as the gloves were pushing it all the way to the webbing and hurting them - not an excuse to walk the gym without a ring on my finger, genuine pain there! I purchased the female set with a dash of pink for my wife and she loves it too. The gloves provide no further stability to your hand beyond protecting the skin and the measurement methodology for picking the right glove worked perfectly for my short stubby hands. I haven't washed them yet, so I am not sure how they react to water. One final thought, they initlaly leave black residue in your palm, guessing that is something the manufacturer uses to coat the gloves, it stopped after about 6 hours of use.
5	1309824000	I bought these for my girlfriend.  She lifts pretty hard, and none of the woman-specific gloves were adequate.  These protect her hands from the bar well, and the fingers are long enough to avoid bunching up and pinching.  They fit a little funny on her hands, because she has skinny woman hands, but she says they are comfortable.  I asked her what she would rate them, and she said 5 stars.
5	1309737600	These are my first pair of workout gloves, so I don't have anything else  to compare them with, except for biking gloves. I've been using these gloves for a month and they're still working well and are comfortable, flexible, breathable and durable (and a bit thicker than biking gloves). However, some of the threading is fraying (normal wear-and-tear). I don't have any problems with fitting; I used the sizing chart on the product page to select my size. The glove webbing around the digits occasionally gets tight while working out.
5	1309651200	Very well made, wear well.  These help immensely with a work out.  Word of caution - this is our second pair because in addition to my son who loves these gloves, our dogs do also.  Don't leave them lying around!
4	1309651200	This is a good basic training glove. Works well and is adequately padded. One strange problem is the web between the middle and ring finger is fairly shallow compared to the rest of the glove - so while it doesn't "pinch" it does press against the web of my hand if I pull the glove on tight.Although if I simply put the glove on without pulling it down, it's fine and doesn't cause a problem while working out.
5	1309564800	I've been using these gloves 3-4 days a week for nearly 6 months now. They are still in great condition and cleaning is a breeze. The material is of high quality and the grip is perfect, not too much grip yet weights will not slip. Highly recommended!
4	1309478400	I've been lifting weights for thrity years and have worn work out gloves for the past twenty and I will say that it is difficult to find a durable and comfortable pair of gloves.  I tried numerous pairs on in various stores and finally choose this one as it seems durable, is attractive, washable and fairly comfortable.  I got the XXL and the glove fits perfect except for one thing and most workout gloves seem to have this minor irritant.  The cut on the gloves between the two middle fingers is too low and it puts pressure on the skin between these two fingers.  I've been slowly trying to stretch it out without tearing the gloves and hope it loosens a bit after they break in.  Other wise they look great and work well.  They don't bunch up when gripping the bar and they seem to breathe well.  I do recommend them but make sure you either try them on locally or get a size or two larger than you think.  I would have gotten the XXXL if they had them.  4 stars for the finger issue otherwise 5.
5	1309392000	These gloves are very good. In the beginning the material was little hard. But after one or two weeks it was perfect. If you just work in an office and your hands are too soft for the bars at the gym these gloves are great for you. At least, I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4	1309305600	With all things this review is pretty much a pro and con list of things that I've experienced personally with my gloves.After 2 weeks of 2 a day training in them I've a pretty good feel for their abilities and short comings.PRO: The glove itself has good hand/finger coverage in general.  The padding in the palms is thin enough for pulling exercises but there is enough there to help support heavier weight when you are doing a pushing exercise (i.e. bench press).CON: I've been a large in every other glove I have wore, I ordered the XL just in case they ran small and found that even the XL sized gloves are smaller than the typical glove (they did stretch out after a day or so).Overall: I'd recommend these gloves.  Heavy lifters might want to seek out a Harbinger brand with more padding.  I have yet to wash them due to the fraying around the wrist area and would like to get my $ value before testing their washing/drying durability.
5	1309219200	These are some pretty good gloves.  They breathe well and there is just the right amount of padding on the palms for when you are working out with heavier weight.  They are not to bad to get off but I still wish they had something on the fingers to help pull them off.  All in all a great glove, very comfortable and a good price!!!
4	1308960000	These gloves ended up a little small for a Medium but hopefully they stretch out a little, but great for the price!  Thx!
4	1308614400	Take the advise of the other reviewers seriously! Order one size larger! I did that and the XXL fits me snug. The padding is what I'd call medium - which is just what I wanted. You can easily close your hand around a weight bar but there is some decent cushioning. The only reasons I didn't give five stars are that the wrist strap can kind of distract and irritate just a little.Also, I have only had these for about a month and used them probably ten times. So I can't say how they'll hold up.... except that these replaced another pair of Harbingers that finally fell apart after about 5 years. That's pretty good for weight-lifting gloves that get used (and sweat in) a lot. I don't bother doing anything to take care of them either.These are soft leather and quite comfortable aside from the wrist thing I mentioned. They also feel sturdy which makes me think they will last five years like my last pair did.
1	1308268800	I thought I had researched the different gloves pretty well but here's what I couldn't know - I ordered the men's 143 Pro Wash & Dry Gloves in the XL size since that is the size of glove I wear in every other phase of my life.  These gloves shipped as promised and it does say XL on the tag but I could just barely get my mitts into them!  This AM I decided to give it a go anyway, thinking, "oh, the gloves are probably supposed to be this tight so as to allow for expansion after I work up a sweat."  NOT!!! Holy crap, I did 15 reps on my lat machine and I lost the feeling in all 10 fingers!  I stopped right then and there and spent the next five minutes trying to get the things off my hands!  I'm going to return them if I can and try their XXL gloves.  The company is based in California so I have to wait until 10AM EST to call their customer support line.  I'm going to ask them who the "men" are that they use as benchmarks for sizing their equipment.  I mean if this glove is an XL I wonder who could possibly fit into the Small?
5	1308096000	These gloves are simply amazing. I was finally able to focus on doing my exercises with good form and not having to worry about losing my grip. They are snug and just the right size. The only downside I would have to say is that there's a bit of pain when extending my right index finger from my middle finger, but it's not at all noticeable while lifting. Other then that, they are well made, effective, and a great value for the price amazon has it. Make sure you read the comments about the size, I ordered mine large out of instinct and I got lucky that they fit me just right. Fast shipping as usual.
5	1307145600	By size chart, I have to use L size but after reading quite a few useful reviews, I decided to order XL size. I found out they fit my hand perfectly and are comfortable. If you look for affordable glove to use in the gym, I recommend these ones.
5	1306627200	Very happy with my choice of glove. So far... Because, only time and usage will tell about their longevity!One thing though: I ordered size Large, and got a size large, so tight that the gloves are very difficult to take off, even worse after the workout!And I don't have big hands at all.I bought another pair, from another brand, at the same time, same size large, and they fit me perfectly.
5	1305676800	These gloves are made well, durable, comfortable and a great value.  I lift weight 2 to 3 times a week, to take a little stress off of my hands and assist my grip I bought these gloves.They are very comfortable and fit perfectly.  I bought a medium pair and they are definitely a snug fit, but not too tight.  I haven't had any issues with excessive moisture buildup or anything that would cause these to work improperly.Great price, great fit, and perfect for heavy lifting.  I would highly reccommend to anyone looking for a new pair of weight lifting gloves.
5	1305417600	This was my first pair of work-out gloves I ever bought.  I didn't mind having calluses on my palm all that much.  But eventually I started lifting weight with 90+ lbs per dumbbell.  The problem is that the dumbbell bar has a ridge like surface that began to literally cut at my skin on my fingers.  Hence, I spent more energy fighting off the pain then lifting weight and the productivity decreased, obviously.I got these gloves sized large since that is what my other gloves are.  However, I immediately noticed that while my palms were very well protected and padded, the skin over the middle and most distal finger joint space was uncovered and the bars continued to rip my skin.  I highly recommend going a size larger that normal, considering they'll shrink with washing anyways.Overall, these are definitely worth the cost!
4	1305244800	If you are getting this, get it one size larger. make sure its large enough to cover the middle of your fingers. Mine was very small so im not too happy with it. but i guess it was my fault. overall, it works pretty good. I do not get callus anymore.
3	1305158400	the glove is alright I guess , protects the palms from bruises, does what it is suppose to do,  but not much padding when doing heavy bench press.good thing I read the previous reviews in regards to size and ordered a size bigger than on the chart provided. my last harbinger was L size this one was XL and it is a tight fit , it is hard to take it off. so order 1 or 2 sizes bigger.
4	1305072000	These gloves are very durable and provide excellent grip during exercise. The only thing I would want more from them is a little extra wrist support but this does not mean that I don't love them.I just bought a second pair for a friend and I have had mine for nearly a year and they are in perfect shape even after 2 wash cycles.Highly recommended.
5	1303862400	This product was absolutely perfect! My first pair, got them a few months back. So far they're pretty durable. Ever since I started using them, I no longer get callous from lifting weights, which was my main reason for getting some. I recommended these gloves to my friends who weren't wearing gloves and getting callouses. The price was a bargain to the value of this product. Don't know would I still be doing weights if I never had them.
4	1303689600	first of all, you definitely want to go up a size, or even more.second, it just to tight between fingers and sometimes feels like it is cutting your skin between the fingers.quality is good compares the price. worth a try, but the right size.
4	1302048000	I was just in between the M and the L (8" circumference), so, based on other reviews about going up a size I opted for the large.  Though the glove fits, it is a little bit loose, but not enough to say I bought the wrong size.  I do see how other users could have the pinching between the fingers, but since my glove is slightly roomy, I don't have this problem.  I have had it for a few weeks and use it 3 times a week for freeweights, kettlebells, and straps.  I am glad I bought these gloves.  I give 4 stars because it should be possible to get a snug fit glove without the pinching.
4	1301961600	The gloves are great.  High quality, durable and comfortable.  Even though I received XL when I ordered L,they do the job just fine.  The $14 price tag is a bargain for the quality.
5	1301875200	These standard workout gloves fit the bill.Low price, lightweight, breathable, and protect your hands from getting pinched etc. I use these for freeweights mostly. They run more or less true to size, slightly on the snug size, but they loosen up with your hand as you workout.They have held up for 2-3 months so far pretty well (no noticeable wear). Don't retain any bad gym smells, though if they do you could simply soak them in soap water, rinse them and let them dry.The lack of padding is nice for me as I can use these for active workouts (running, plyo, freeweights, machines, etc). Of course if you are doing heavy weight lifting thats more static, I'd get something with padding and wrist support.
5	1300579200	These are great gloves!  I have no complaints about them, but I do think I should take a moment and address a common complaint that almost kept me from buying them.  Several people have commented that the gloves run small.  These complaints are frankly idiotic.  These people have obviously never owned anything made of leather.  NEWS FLASH -- it stretches!  Yes, the gloves are small and do pinch at first, but after about a week's worth of wear at the gym they fit perfectly.  There's no reason to order one size too big, because if you do you run the risk of them being too loose, which would cause them to rub and cause blisters, which is the whole point of buying them in the first place!Buy these gloves in the right size, and if you have more patience than a preschooler you'll love them!
4	1300579200	these gloves are great. well made and a great upgrade from the regular harbinger gloves. try them on in a store first though, they run about one size smaller than you'd expect and from the non-pro version.
5	1300406400	The main point of my review will be my personal experience with this product. People get confused with reviews because some reviwers tend to talk about their impressions or other subjective aspects.To start, I need to say I used the manufacturer's table to choose the right size. I measured my hand and the indicated size was the M.Important Advice - Don't give up in the first weekWhen I first tried these gloves on they were a little tight and still comfortable but as I got to the gym I felt that pinch between fingers some people mentioned. I need to tell you, it really hurts but after a week of usage the pinch totally disappears. Also, during the first week it expands a little bit (break-in time).I've been using them for two months and they almost don't shrink after washing.Now, the best thing about the gloves is the protection. I must say I'm a beginner but I've tried 3 gloves so far and this one really keeps me without blisters or calluses.To sum up:I followed the manufacturer's indication and the size was perfect for me.It hurts a little in the first week but it goes away.It looks good and protects you very well.It has also a very good value and looks good.
2	1300147200	I bought one of these gloves a while ago, and what I can say about this new one is that the size is smaller, it didn't fit my hands as the old one (both size S), and the sewing is a little bit different too, a little uncomfortable. Preferred the old model
5	1299801600	These are some pretty decent lifting gloves.  They're cheap and constructed well enough, although they seem to run a little small size wise.  I normally wear a medium in gloves, but with these, I had to go large.  They've handled some very heavy weights while providing adequate protection for my hands.  The Ocelot gloves with the wrist-straps are of a little higher quality though, and also run small in their sizes--more so than the Harbinger.  A good buy, especially at their price.
2	1299801600	Based on the metrics to determine the size I need to buy, I found myself to be a medium and purchased one only to find out that its a little tight.I would have returned this product any way because the material used was so rough, I felt that I would get more callous on my hands by using this product than not using it.
5	1299369600	This gloves are great i have worked with them before, i go to the gym four times a weak, the pair that i had been using lasted me 1 year in a half, so the very durable.
5	1299110400	These gloves are really durable. I've been lifting for a while now and my hands were stopping me because they were aching, but these gloves really give me that good support in the right places.
5	1298592000	Good gloves, my only fear was that I wasn't getting the right size.  That isn't a problem and I'm useing them 4-5 times a week.  I'd buy them again.
4	1298246400	I figured I would be a medium hand, but it seems a large would have fit me better. The glvoes are tight around the finger creases, but that is only to my unknowing of the glove sizes; one of the downsides of buying online. Other then that, trhey are good gloves, and feel great!
4	1297641600	Because of the low price I went ahead and ordered two pairs of gloves after reading all the good reviews.  The gloves are durable, well-made, and confortable except for the webbing area between the middle and ring finger where it digs into the skin.  After cutting out some material in that area the gloves feel and fit great. Due to the low price and super saver shipping I was willing to do some alterations of my own, had these cost much more I probably would have returned them for something that fit more comfortably right out of the box.
1	1297641600	I work out 3 times a week were I do a mix of resistance training and cardio.  I received these gloves early January and I was eager to try them out.  They were okay at first and took some getting use to.  The leather was pretty stiff but after a few weeks the gloves loosened up and thinned out in the thicker padded areas.On Feb 14 2001, the stitching came undone on the right glove.  So about 1.5 months of use and the gloves are now falling apart.  Maybe you'll have better luck but I would be cautious of buying these again.
3	1297036800	I heeded the warning about the size from the other reviews. I wear a men's medium in every glove I wear (skiing, dirt biking, cycling). I bought a large in these AND THEY WERE STILL TOO SMALL. I wore twice and gave them away to avoid the hassle of returning them. Then did seem very well made and designed, however . . .
1	1296432000	Another reviewer (By Cameron Scholtz Phoenix, AZ USA) who posted pictures got it right.  He had to cut the webbing of the gloves.  I'm not cutting anything of a brand new purchase.  I returned them right away and bought the Harbinger Flexfit Training Gloves which are perfect.Do NOT Buy
5	1296259200	I have been tying several gloves, and this are just perfect. Very comfortable, easy to use, light. The union of the different fabrics are perfect. Your hand can breath easily through the glove. Your hand is never going to be hurt or is going to stay soft because your skin is very well protected.
4	1296172800	So the gloves are nice. Comfy, good padding, well-constructed.I'm a decently heavy lifter (max: 120lb dumbbells in each hand). Nothing even remotely close to some people, but I can push some weight and the gloves have def saved my hands.Only neg thing would be the area where the fingers come together seem a little deep... its hard to explain, but the webbing area inbetween your fingers can get sore because the gloves are... deep-fingered?Anyway... id def buy them again. Harbinger is the S!
5	1295913600	I've used many gloves over the years and these have definately proven themselves to be the best so far.  They are a little tight but after months of use at 300 lbs plus of weight at a time they are still holding up just fine.
4	1295913600	I bought these gloves because they're washable and people rave about their durability. I agree with both of those points, but am a little disappointed in the gloves because they don't have flaps that extend to the second knuckles on my fingers. The lack of protection means the gloves don't provide enough protection and grip on some exercises.
5	1295222400	HAD TO RETURN THE ITEM FOR A LARGER SIZE, IT WENT QUICK AND PAINLESSMY SON LOVES THE GLOVESGREAT TRANSACTION :)
5	1295136000	These gloves are one of the best I have ever used. I haven't used them very much so far, but I know they'll hold up for a very long time. They are very durable and add just the right amount of padding so you can still get a good grip on the bar.
4	1294790400	Great gloves for the money!  But with this said make sure to order one size bigger than you want.  I ordered these gloves the first time in M, but too small, then in L, but one glove fit perfit and the other too small.  I ordered gloves one more time in L again and a perfit fit end of story.
2	1294617600	When compared toValeo Ocelot Lifting Glovesthese gloves are crap. I bought both pairs and I think the Valeo is far superior. The 3/4 finger length is wonderful, they are softer leather, and have more cushioning than these Harbingers. Unfortunatly the Valeos have the same sizing issue as these, so read the reviews to find your correct size, don't count on the sizing charts. (For Valeo, Large is a perfect fit for my 8" circumference hands, taken around the palm, under the knuckles).
5	1294444800	I cannot say that I have tried a lot of different weightlifting gloves. All I can say is that these are great. They fit snuggly and comfortably, seem like they will be very durable. Wearing them doesn't just protect your hands, it adds some measure of a feel of stability as well. Definitely worth it compared to the cheap pair I bought before.
5	1294099200	I'm ecstatic about these gloves, so much that I just ordered another pair to have around when this pair wears out (not in the foreseeable future). First, the sizing...for comparison, I wear a medium in Nike batting glove, Nike golf glove, Specialized & Pearl Izumi bicycling gloves, as well as Burton/DaKine/Grenade snowboarding gloves. Simply put, I have always been a Medium. My hand measures 8" in perimeter when measured according to Harbinger's sizing guide (see size chart picture). The sizing guide worked well for me so I wouldn't deviate from its recommendation. Second, the material - the back of the hand has thin strips of leather to provide structure and an elastic fabric that stretches to allow for a comfortable fit. The palm of the hand is very lightly padded, less than the gel padding found in high end mountain/road bicycling gloves. Third, finger coverage - the coverage of this glove extends just beyond my knuckles when I'm grasping the barbell/dumbbell so it does protect against calluses on the underside of that knuckle area if that's something important to you. Fourth, the velcro strap is secured inward rather than outward which feels strange to me. It's not a big deal but something that I'd like to note. Lastly, I do not feel any discomfort with regards to raised edges/seams on the inside of the gloves. Though that seems like a trivial attribute to note, I quickly realized the importance of a seamless interior when my previous pair of gloves caused so much discomfort that I would have long lasting (but still temporary) impressions on my hands after my workouts.In summary, this is a well designed, nice fitting, and comfortable pair of workout gloves. They're almost as comfortable as the nicer neoprene gloves but these look like they may be more durable. The current discounted price (10% discount for Harbinger products) makes this a no-brainer purchase. At this price level, I see no need to splurge on a fancy pair of gloves or risk the discomfort of cheaper gloves. Appearance wise, they look like plain Jane workout gloves which I prefer. There is, as mentioned by others, a chemical smell when these are new but the scent isn't strong enough to raise any safety concerns. As usual, the ratings on Amazon are spot on and I'm glad I came across these helpful reviews.
4	1293926400	Pleased with the overall workmanship of these workout gloves.  The palms and fingers are well padded and the stitching is solid.  They are a bit snug even though I bought them a size larger than my previous gloves based on other reviews that they tend to run smaller in size.  I would purchase these gloves again.
5	1293494400	Great gloves.  Love wearing them during my workouts and not getting my hands tore up.  Quality seems up to par and they feel sturdy.  Highly recommend.
5	1293148800	I bought my second pair of gloves after the 1st were stolen at my local gym, and am really pleased with them, the only tiny niggle is the fingers are a bit tight and I have to kinda pull the cut off part of the finger endings to get them off but im sure with time that will become easier as the gloves mold to my hands.
5	1292976000	I bought these gloves as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves them!  He says they're really comfortable and provide a lot of support.  The only very small downside is they're a little bit difficult to take off, so they do tend to run a little small.  But other than that they were a great buy!
5	1292889600	We received the Pro Flex Wash Dry Gloves on time.  They were a gift for our nephew.  He loved them.  We are very happy with our purchase.
5	1291420800	I love working out without any gloves and I don't mind having callus on my hand.  However, I purchase this glove for health/sanitary reason.  I heard that the weights are actually one of the dirtiest items.  As a matter of fact, you can get some skin diseases from it.  When the package arrived, I inspected the glove.  The glove was well made and it seems sturdy enough to last for long time.  I believe this is a worth while purchase and hopefully it can last a long time.Until I have a personal gym at home,  this glove seems like it will do the job.
4	1289865600	My experience using this pair is limited due to injury (nothing to do with thse gloves), but I did not have any issue with the gloves.
5	1289520000	My old pair of Harbingers were over ten yrs old and starting to wear through.  These are great out of the package - comfortable, just the right amount of padding, and look good too!  I them to last another ten yrs.
4	1288742400	The gloves are very comfortable.  Make sure you buy a bigger size than normal and if that isn't enough you can always cut between fingers if it bothers (This was my case, but after cutting a small hole they are very comfortable and have a nice grab).  Delivery was fast too.
5	1288483200	I received what I expected in expected time. I have been using them since two weeks haven't had any problem yet. overall It's a good product. I would surely recommend it.
5	1288396800	I ordered the large according to their sizing chart and the fit is just perfect. snug  but not tight. they flex well with my hands and provide adequate padding. only thing i can say bad about them is the padding in the fingers makes it a little difficult to hold on to do reverse curls with palms facing out. but then i just take the gloves off or hold extra tight.an excellent pair of lifting gloves. highly recommended. :)
5	1288310400	Ever since I first tried on Harbinger gloves, I said that I would never ever try another brand gloves. My older Harbinger gloves (Harbinger 133) lasted for a very long time and was so comfortable. This time, I picked the Harbinger 143 Pro. When I first put it on, I thought I had to return them because it felt so tight even though my older gloves were medium as well. Just beware that it will feel pretty tight when you first put it on. Then I worked out with them and that broke them in nicely where it felt comfortable. It feels nice and comfortable, looks great and appears to be high quality where it would last a very long time.PS. My older gloves had shorter finger lengths like the Harbinger 138-flexfit so I had more "feel" and less bulk. The Harbinger 143-pro has 1/2 finger length so that it protects more of your fingers better. I didn't realize until after I bought them. Do you want better feel or more protection for fingers? Something to think about.I give these gloves a 4.5 out of 5 stars.
5	1287532800	The item is good but DHL just dropped the box next to my door and left it there for me, for my neighbors or for somebody else.For whom? who knows that clever delivery guys or bloody excellent DHL's customer-service.I was at home but the delivery guy did not knock at my door, and I just heard the noise of fallen box on the floor.DHL - good on you!excellent job!perfect reputation!
2	1286755200	I think weightlifting gloves are one of those items that you really need to try on before purchasing. Nevertheless the price was right on Amazon so I took the plunge only to find out that the size wasn't ideal. I'm somewhere between a L and an XL, but the way these gloves were made I don't think either would have fit me quite right. The gloves look ok, but there was some strange sewing/fabric near the fingers that just irritated me enough to not want to wear them when lifting. Ever since my wife made me start lifting with gloves to avoid those manly callouses I can't lift without them, but I much prefer the Nike strength gloves which are made of a much thinner fabric and have a zipper to close as opposed to irritating velcro.
5	1286150400	These gloves meet the purpose I need them for, they seem like they will last awhile unlike the Golds Gym brand I got from Walmart, they will seem very loose at first but once you break them in they relax to your hands very well.
5	1285977600	Comfortable and does what it's supposed to do; protect my hands. These gloves have a good feel and seem to be of pretty good quality. I'd recommend to anyone.
1	1285459200	Bought these gloves. No wrist wraps and there is no wrist support whatsoever. Tried using these to bench press - better off with gloves that have wrist wraps. Would not buy another pair and would not recommend them to anyone.
3	1285027200	First of all, everyone who wants to know how it looks, please only look at the first two pictures. The pictures follow by the third picture are uploaded by other people and the gloves actually don't look like that. At least, no Narbinger brand name on the 2nd finger on the left.Why I'm going this 3 stars because of two things. The comfort is -1, and the durability -1. 5-1-1 = 3 stars
4	1284336000	Agree with other reviewers.  Tough and durable, good padding.  They could use a little more padding -- I do dips on a machine with unpadded grips, and sometimes feel the pressure on my palms, but these gloves do much better than alternatives that I have.
3	1283817600	Helped relieve hand pain and stress for first 3-4 months. Then padding wore down and finger holes widened as increased my lifting. Basically have needed new ones since the 3 month mark of lifting 3-4 times a week. Looking to purchase new gloves now because I have gotten worse and worse calises and these do not have enough wrist support. Would only recommend for beginners.
4	1283212800	The gloves are really nice and seem to have a lot better quality than the older styles.My only problem is that the old style fit with XL but these are a bit more tighter. After a while my fingers start to get the numb sensation.I've been wearing them for 2 weeks now and they area around the fingers has loosened up.If you don't mind the tightness at first I'd get these gloves. They feel good and provide pretty good flexibility.Or you can get the next size up :)
4	1283126400	The Harbinger Pro FlexClosure gloves are a terrific addition to anyone's workout gear. I have problems with my hands and these gloves make a strong effort possible during my workouts. The fit is nearly perfect. They suggested I measure my hands before ordering. Good thing I did. I would never have ordered the Large gloves when in fact they were exactly what I needed. Well made and very comfortable!
4	1283040000	I use these whenever working out with my free weights. They definitely save your hands from blisters and a lot of other wear and tear. I'd recommend them.
4	1281830400	I have been using these gloves for a month and have been hoping they would stretch out some.  They have stretched out some over time but not enough.  I read the reviews before I purchased them and saw all of the comments about how small the gloves are so I ordered a XXL size even though I am typically and XL.  Upsizing the gloves 1 size was not enough for me because these gloves and too are still too small.  They are very well built and should be very durable, the sizing just stinks.  If you are considering buying these gloves you should upsize them 1 - 2 sizes.
2	1281657600	This was my first attempt at lifting gloves, so I don't have a lot to compare it to.  But these gloves are a disappointment.  They're both too loose and too tight.  My hands are about medium length for a guy, but they're kind of petite and small with regard to width of palm and digits.  I bought these gloves in extra-large.  They're too small in that they kinda pinch the webbed skin in between each finger.  They're kind of painful.  And they're too big overall, lots of extra fabric, all over.  They're just too big for me.  I don't believe there is any size of this Harbinger glove that would fit my hand.On the positive side, the Harbinger gloves have a (somewhat) grippy material on the palm that will help you get a better grip on the weights.  This is good, because it feels kind of scary holding weights when I can't feel them like I used to.  I hate losing the sense of touch that comes from wearing no gloves.  But the calluses are getting to be a problem.The biggest problem with these gloves, though, is their basic design.  When you bend your hand to hold a bar, you have all this extra fabric that bunches up at the intersection between your palm and fingers.  The solution, of course, is to find a glove that comes pre-bent, so that you can't easily flatten your hand, but when you bend your hand and fingers around the bar, there isn't any extra fabric to bunch up.Today a bought a new pair of gloves at my gym.  They are "Valeo Ocelot Lifting Glove" size medium.  These are really comfortable and actually fit my hand.  The inside of the glove feels great.  One problem is that the palm side of the glove has no grippy material, so it's hard to get a great grip on the bar.  That makes me really nervous, because losing your grip on the bar could be disastrous.  And these Valeo gloves have the same problem as the Harbinger gloves - when you bend your hand around the bar, all this extra fabric bunches up at the intersection between your palm and fingers.  This really messes up my ability to get a good grip on the bar.So, the Valeo gloves are a much better fit than the Harbinger gloves.  But neither is great.  I need to find a "pre-bent" glove with a great grippy material, and less fabric overall to bunch up.  If you know of one, please comment.  Thanks.
5	1281312000	I got these for weightlifting, they are great. I measured before I ordered, and ordered the size recommended by the measurement. They were ok to put on and take off once per session. But then I had an accident and ended up in a wheelchair and they were way to tight to put on and off several times a day. I ordered up a size and prefer them. When you wash them they get smaller so really you should order up a size unless you are lifting huge amounts and want no movement and are ok if you need a minute to get them off.Once you find your proper size the gloves are fabulous, they really have held up under daily use. Good quality stitching, good quality materials, they are great gloves. And the price is amazing. You will be happy.
5	1280793600	Yes there may be gym gloves that you can get for a couple dollars less, but the quality suffers by a lot.This pair of gloves are not only stylish but they serve their purpose to the best.
5	1280016000	These are made for weight lifting, but I use them for motorcycle riding.  Good construction and good padding.
5	1279670400	I have large hands and I didn't know if they would fit, and they fit very good. I've already washed them and they came out fine. I will be buying more in teh future.
1	1278892800	These hurt the skin web between my middle and ring fingers. I guess I will have to cut it or something, but it's way better without them :(I bought them to avoid pain, but the pain is even harderOne year after, they are almost destroyed. I washed them like 3-4 times and now there is a big hole in it.
5	1278806400	I usually take a large size but after reading the reviews went for extra large.  Fit is snug and very comfortable.I like the natural color and there is no odor (someone had mentioned that with the black gloves there was a strong odor).
5	1277164800	In all honesty, this deserves a 4 out of 5 because 5 would probably be for something awesome. This is just cool, it does it's job normally but I have a valeo workout glove and it does pretty much the same. I've only had it for two weeks now so I'm not completely sure on durability, especially cause I don't use it for vigorous weight training or anything, just here and there.It is comfortable and fits me, however, I notice that even though I followed the size recommendation, it is on the tighter size. Not the uncomfortable range, but to the point that if it was even a tad smaller, it wouldn't have worked at all. And the only reason it even fit was because I also have skinny hands so if you have normal or big man hands, get a size up. So if you think you're a large, get a extra large, etc etc.The sizing goes like this, take a tape measure and measure around the knuckle area. Completely around. In inches.6.5 - 7 = XS7 - 7.5 = S7.5 - 8 = L8 - 8.5 = X Letc etc.So if you have skinny hands, you can stay with your size, if you have thick man hands, it is highly recommended to get a size up. I don't have girly hands or anything like that, it's just that my hands are thinner, especially my fingers.How durable will probably take time to determine, but so far I'm pretty happy, the purchase was a decent one. Lifting weight feels better.
4	1275696000	Make sure to size up a little bit, otherwise the gloves are great.  I haven't had any problems with blistering after purchasing the gloves.
5	1275523200	I found some of these locally and I love them. They are well made, comfortable, and look cool. It's party made out of breathable material which I didn't appreciate until a really heavy work out.
5	1275436800	Love them. Super well made, great padding (not to much or to little) and they have little tabs which make taking them on and off easier.
5	1275264000	These gloves are extremely comfortable.  They have plenty of padding for comfort but also allow a good range of motion.  I bought this pair to replace a pair that I lost in the gym, but I had owned that pair for years and they had proven very durable.
3	1272844800	I read some of the reviews that said these gloves tend to run a size too small. So when I saw they referenced the glove sizes by the shoe sizes, I got the 10 to 12 inches, because my foot is only 10.5.  But when I put them on, the gloves felt tight.  I am almost debating returning them to get the next size up.  So yes, take their size recommendation whatever range you fit into, and go the next one up if you want to make sure they will fit nicely.
5	1272499200	I'm a woman with relatively small, but wide (palm) hands.  My fingers are not thick and I remove my rings prior to a workout - after the first time I used these gloves WITH my rings. (More on that later.)  That being said, I purchased these gloves after trying them on at a local store to check the fit. I purchased a men's size 'small'. I wasn't sure that was a good choice as the gloves were very snug, but over time they've held their shape and a comfortable, functional fit has been the result.The Good:The gloves fit snuggly and the palms are wide enough for my hands. The velcro closure at the wrist is adequate enough to cinch up even on my small wrists. The padding on the palm (covered by leather) is comfortable and has eliminated developing calluses, which is why I purchased the gloves in the first place.  Finger movement is not limited by the length of the fingers of the gloves. Seem to be holding up well with 4 day a week use.The 'Not-So' Bad:The finger holes are tight, and if you are like me and your hands swell during lifting, it can be very uncomfortable.  This has eased with time however, and after 10 months, I don't even notice it anymore.The fingers of the glove have no real give to them and right at the web between each finger, the glove tends to 'cut in' and bite. It has been fairly painful at times and was extremely painful with my wedding ring on. This stops after a break-in period of a month or so.Getting the gloves off after a workout is a bit tricky (I peel them downward - inside out) because of the fit.  I did try the next size up, but that was just bigger overall, the fit on the fingers was still tight.My Conclusion after nearly a year of use:If you want lifting gloves that are durable, with a snug fit, give 'em a try.  I've been doing weights 4x's a week for 10 months - machines and free weights.  I have developed a very slight callous inside my hand, under my ring finger on both the left and right side, but never any blisters using these gloves.  The leather palm of the glove is worn, but not thin.  I suspect they will be with me for another year without the need for a replacement pair.  These are good gloves!
5	1271635200	I have had my pair for about 2 years and they are still holding up well.  They dont cover up the entire finger but that is what I wanted.  I still wanted to maintain some decent hand control with the equiment and these gloves do the job nicely.  I would recommend these to anyuone who lifts weights fairly regulary or works the rigging on a larger sail boat and wants to protect thier hands.
4	1271376000	I really liked these gloves when I first got them, but after a couple months of use the stiching on the right thumb is coming a part.... I just figured they would last a little longer. They are still nice gloves though.
5	1271289600	best price on earth and very fast shipping...feels good on the hand i know that this pare will last for a very  very long time you can feel the quality of Harbinger honestly didn't wash them yet but I'm sure they will survivepersonal recommendation check the size chart and masseur your hand i did it and it's fit perfectlylove them and are my first ones actually as wellenjoy!
5	1270944000	Nice gloves.  In the past, I've had issues with my gloves splitting or stretching out too much, even though I only life 2x per week now.  Haven't had that problem with these.  Nice quality and snug fit.  They look a bit bulky in the photo and they are a bit thicker than some, but they're not what I'd call bulky.  I'd get another pair.  These look like they're going to last me a while though.
5	1270857600	These gloves seems to be good quality and stitched well in respect to its priceThe size chart is not accurate and these are much smaller than you think.  I usually wear a M or L, but i had to order XL for these because I read these run very small.  The other reviewers were definitely accurate in their description so be ready to order 2 sizes larger. The XL were very tight the first time i tried them on, but did loosen up after wearing them.  Also, the wrist strap does not really help stabilize your wrist because the gloves are too short in length.  They need to be 1-2 inches longer to effectively wrap around your wrist.  This is going to be important if you are doing heavy lifting.Overall this is good pair of gloves with some minor flaws.  Just make sure to go check about the size.
5	1270598400	I was not sure if these gloves would fit without trying them on.These gloves fit so great and are a quality product.They fit like a glove
4	1270512000	I'm a gym rat and go through gloves every couple of months. Coming from a crappier Harbinger glove as my last pair, these are a much nicer improvement. They feel solid and well padded, yet flexible enough to not be annoying.I'm giving them 4 stars out of 5 for two reasons:1. They are a bit tight in the fingers, despite being a good fit for the rest of my hand. They shouldn't be making gloves for pansy fingers.2. The inside of the glove has a tag right at the bottom of the wrist, as well as a somewhat sharp edge around the wrist. Both issues can be eliminated or hammered out, but it's a bit annoying.Overall not bad, definitely worth a try.
5	1270080000	These are some of the best gloves I've used in a while.  Very lightweight, but provide good protection at the same time.  I like the fact that I can get a good grip on the bad because these gloves are not overly padded or bulky.  I would also suggest cutting a small slit between the ring and middle finger for added comfort and flexibility.  Otherwise, they may feel a little tight in that area
5	1269475200	As it says, these are tough gloves, high quality construction, good fit, comfortable.  I haven't worn them for too long yet, but so far so good.
5	1269216000	Great grip and does not leave him sweaty like his last pair. Worth the money!
5	1268265600	da harbinger glovesdey be da bestmade of leathasoft as big natural breastda harbinger glovesda workouts be goodjust wearin' demmakes me walk with half wood
4	1267833600	I've used Harbinger gloves for some time now and have been happy with them for comfort, fit and durability. I tried these because it said washable and am happy with Harbinger gloves for the most part. The down side to them is the XL size I bought seems to be a large size, so they are a little tight and hard to put on and take off.
5	1266451200	At first, I was very skeptical of these gloves. I had recently bought $15 reebok gloves that were completely useless. You could imagine my skepticism when I saw these gloves were a few dollars less. I decided to take a chance, listen to the reviews, and order a size medium.Pros:Excellent PaddingVery good overall padding, especially for back workouts.Comfortable to wear and reacts to sweat wellInside of the glove it does not get itchy or leave marks all over my hands unlike other brands.Cons:TightThe sizes are a little tight. I have somewhat feminine hands so I bought these mens gloves in medium instead of a large. The fit is very snug and taking them off causes quite a scene. But the tight fit doesn't hurt my workout whatsoever.Over all, good buy!
5	1266364800	This work out glove really improved my workout. People out there work out should buy this.
4	1265155200	I have been using it for over a month, really happy with its quality.  It has a tight fit, the Medium feel small.  Nice price, too.
4	1263772800	First off, they're sized a bit small.  Granted, I have very big hands, but I had to exchange these for the XXL's, and if they had XXXL's, that probably would be even better (I normally wear XL...sometimes XXL in gloves).  If you're debating between two sizes, DEFINITELY get the bigger of the two.Other than that, they're very good lifting gloves.  They do the job, protect my hands while lifting, seem to be well made, reasonably comfortable, and they're nice-looking, as a bonus.  Far less expensive than other ones I looked at, and I'm very happy with them.
4	1262822400	First, I should say that I've never worn another glove, so my opinion of the Harbinger 143s is not the result of comparative analysis.  Several years ago when I first decided to use gloves for weight training, I bought these and they worked well, so I've stuck with 'em.  My recent purchase is my third pair -- they hold up for a long time; in fact, my previous pair was still in good condition (purchased a few years ago) and I only bought an additional pair to switch up the color.  Before the most recent purchase I looked into other gloves -- just to see what was out there -- but they all either seem insufficient or excessive.  The Harbinger 143s are nothing fancy; they just get the job done without getting in the way.
4	1262649600	Good work out gloves, padding is enough. I got the Medium and they tend to fit my mid sized hands perfect. They are snug but not too small, the way gloves should be. I do not recommend getting a size up as some suggest, because they will be lose and the wrist strap will not feel good on you, I tried all sizes before I bought.
5	1261958400	These gloves are just as comfortable or more comfortable than any other gloves I have owned.  They have a great, leather feel, but are machine washable.  Very impressed.
4	1261958400	Exactly what I needed for my PE class as we were getting into weight lifting. They are comfortable to wear and do their job as weight lifting gloves.-One Problem with the gloves was the stress they can exert at the V between fingers when catching a weight ball. Watch out for that, it'll hurt.
5	1260921600	I Bought this pair because my old one was worn out! I chose L size (I wore XL before)and felt comfortably fit while wearing it.But I felt some how a little tight while lifting weights! So choosing one size larger is recommended!
4	1259712000	all I can say is that the gloves are great.  Only down side with the black ones are that they leave black residue on your face if you wipe the sweat from your forehead.
5	1259020800	Love these gloves, though like other reviewers stated, you should definitely order a size larger.  I went up to an XL and they were still fairly tight before I broke them in.
2	1258675200	I love these gloves but they won't last.  You'd be lucky to get a year out of them.  I guess they are cheap enough to buy new ones every 7 months or so.
5	1255737600	Good gloves, good price.Very comfortable, be sure to order a little big though.
4	1255737600	these gloves are great. lightweight and easy to put on and take off. they provide good grip as well.
4	1255564800	I just received these gloves today.  I took an earlier reviewer's recommendation to get a size larger, so I got the XXL size.  My hand is 8" from base to top of middle finger and the gloves feel really nice on, they feel like they're sized right.  However, the reviewer that said the bottoms of the gloves between the fingers dig into your hand is true for me, as well.  Between the index finger and middle finger, and between the middle finger and ring finger, the gloves bite into the hand a little, but mainly just when I'm spreading my fingers.  During normal lifting when you're just closing your hand/making a fist, it's not a problem.So, +1 to getting a size up from your normal size, and just be aware if you have really big paws, you'll want to try these on in person in case they'll dig into your hands (which is why I knocked a star off).
5	1254355200	Good, comfortable, inexpensive gloves for lifting. I've been using them almost daily for a few months now and they seem to be holding up just great. I'd definitely buy them again.
5	1254355200	I've gone through several pairs of gloves over the years and these are definitely up there with the best, especially for the price.  High quality construction, which should last the casual lifter or hobbyist several months.  I like that these breathe, which means my hands stay cool and they don't end up stinking so bad. :)  Also like that they're black, which hides the dirt, grime, and sweat they pick up from ordinary use.  Padding is good, but like most gloves, wears with time.I found mine a bit tight at first, but this lessened with time.  The leather also became more flexible, although not too flexible.  My current pair still has some pretty good "stiffness" after a couple of months.For the price, these are one of my top picks for gloves.  The only people I wouldn't recommend them to are those who prefer a non-leather glove or straps.
5	1254096000	I've had these gloves for about 6 months now, and they work great. I have no complaints.  They don't smell, and they fit well. My hands no longer get blisters. Aaahhhhh. =)
5	1253750400	Very good grip around the wrist which is really important when you are training with heavy weights. Enough cushioning for the palms of your hands. And the price is good too. I do recommend these.
5	1253577600	I have previously bought harbinger gloves and all I have to say is they are made with very good quality.  Never disappointed with my purchases and the gloves hold up to all the weight that it carries. Great enough ventilation for my hands and gives me just the right amount of cushion.  Don't think this will break on me but should I ever lose this pair, I will definitely go back and buy this one.
4	1253232000	gloves are great you might want to get one size up,if you don't it might take you a minute or two to take them off... I wish I got Large instead of Medium.
5	1252886400	This is probably the best glove for light weight lifting and intermediate level... It fit perfectly but I think you better try it at the sport store before you purchase it to ensure the right size... I love this glove and I use it 5-7 times a week..... Great buy
3	1252281600	Compared to the Harbinger 155's, these have more padding and seem to be better constructed. But the downside is, you'll have a helluva time removing them. I wear Medium's, and the 155's were easy to remove, but these are incredibly difficult to pry off your hands.
4	1252022400	I lift intensely four times a week, and this glove offers great protection and will last you up to a year. Very good buy, especially for the price.
5	1251590400	No complaints yet!  I have been working out with these for about 4 months now and have not had a problem.  I went two sizes bigger than I thought to be safe.  At first they seemed a slightly too large... and I was worried.... but I think the conformed to my hands, so now they fit perfectly.  (I was originally thinking Medium, but I went with XL and have been happy.)
4	1251504000	I bought these gloves for my weight training class. They are nice and comfortable, but can be tight in between one or two fingers. But this can be resolved with a little adjustment periodically. Overall a good product for the price. Although at a later date I would want to buy better, more expensive gloves.
4	1250380800	Harbinger makes great training gloves. The Harbinger Pros (Men's) are good quality, offer a comfortable fit, and get the job done. My previous pair lasted for years before finally falling apart. Not a lot of support in this model, just protection and comfortable grip. The only issue is that the sizing seems off. I have a medium size hand and ordered men's medium. What I got was labeled medium but seemed really small. Exchanged for the large and it fits fine...would probably be fine for a slightly larger hand too, but fine. Not sure if this was unique to this model or just this scenario, or if Harbinger's gloves tend to run small.
4	1247529600	The gloves are working great.  It should be noted that they are a bit different than what is pictured.  The velcro part is black and of a different material.  This could be a change made by Harbinger, I do not know.  This is the first set I've received like this.  They fit and perform like other pairs that I have bought before.  Additionally, the packaging was not the usual thick plastic zip-lock type bag with the silica gel but rather a high gloss cardboard backing to which the gloves were attached.  As I said before the gloves work great I just wanted to note these differences so you know before you purchase and are not a bit suspicious when you first receive the product.  These are more than likely changes made by Harbinger and simply not updated by the seller.
4	1247529600	I've owned a pair of Harbinger gloves before so I wasn't concerned about the size.  I like these a lot, nicely padded, fit well.  I haven't tried to wash them yet - so we'll have to see how that works out.  So far, I can recommend them.
5	1245974400	I am a Gym Rat, working out 4+ times a week for 2 hours a day. I do about 1 hour of free weights then 1 hour of Cardio. My last pair of Harbinger Gloves were stolen from me at the Gym while I showered. They were $40 Harbinger Model 1250(Grey colored,with wrist straps). I loved those gloves, but I did not want to spend another $40 for gloves I may lose or have stolen, so I found these on Amazon for under $15(Harbinger Model 143,Natural). I am very pleased with these gloves. The color natural was better looking in person than in the pics. While these did not have wrist straps, they were as nice as the 1250 Model. Very Well Made, Great Job Amazon!!!! Comfortable and Durable. I have been buying weight lifting gloves for over 20 years, and these can hang with the best. I take a large and these were true to size. Also NO Bleeding from Dye inside the gloves that stains your hands after you sweat the first few times you use them. Also these gloves keep your hands cool while you lift, making your gloves less likely to smell of sweat after you take them off. I apply some talcum powder to my hands before I put the gloves on. And the gloves look and smell very clean. I was very impressed with the stitching, it was very obvious that these were not cheap gloves. I would expect to pay at least $30 for these gloves, not $13.49!!! So I truly felt that I got a bargain. I may just buy another pair at this price as a backup pair. So if you are on the fence about buying  , and need a quality, affordable pair of workout gloves, I can't see you going wrong with these.These gloves can be found Online or at some Sporting Goods Stores, though you won't find as cheap as Amazon is selling them for. I don't know if this is Amazon's normal price??, or if the $13.49 was just blind luck on my behalf??I hope this review helped.
5	1245715200	I went through many reviews and different gloves before deciding to get this for my husband after his old pair started falling apart. He works out 5 times a week and uses these every day he really likes these gloves and well so do I as the palm of his hands aren't so dry and damaged from weight lifting as before.
4	1244678400	Theses gloves are simply wonderfull because they are durable, strong and....washable. It is amazing but I do not feel them hot during these last sunny days, very comfortable.I wish they could be little bigger for an XXL size
5	1244332800	I do weight training for the past 8 years and after trying many many gloves, this was the best I found. It's not too tick to make you uncomfortable and at the same time it totally protects your palm and  fingers from getting blisters. I use it for mountain biking too, without any problem. Give it try, you'll love it.
4	1243468800	They are basic lifting gloves, if you want anything more then its not going to be at this price range. They get the job done and keep your hands in one piece. Received a 4 of 5 stars because of the fit. I like my lifting gloves pretty tight and it might not be the glove itself but in the beginning the stitching inside digs a little into the skin between your middle and ring fingers. Hasn't broke the skin but can be distracting at first, they need to be worn a little.
4	1243382400	These are the best gloves that I have own for wait training. The padding is perfect and there is plenty of flexibility for my fingers. My only complaint is that machine washing these things don't seem to get them very clean. I went the hand washing route and it seemed to help a lot... but when I set these out to dry EVERYTHING nearby was stained yellow from the dye of the gloves. Just be VERY careful when washing these and letting them to dry.
4	1242604800	These gloves work great.  I've been lifting with them everyday for about 3 weeks now, and so far am very pleased.  They breathe very well.  The only complaint I have is a minor one, they are somewhat difficult to get off, especially once you get kinda sweaty.  Not a big deal for me though because I put my gloves on at the start of the workout and don't take them off until I'm done, but if you are the type who takes the gloves off and on I suppose it might be a consideration.
4	1242518400	I like the Harbinger gloves because they have great padding and they aren't black. When you sweat with black gloves, the dark color tends to rub off on your hands, making your hands look quite dirty.  The gloves fit snug, but some of the stitching could be a bit better.  In any case, I'll probably buy more of them in the future as these wear out.
3	1242518400	EDITED THIS REVIEW.Left a review for this product a year or more ago, and since then got another set of gloves to replace a worn-out pair.  The quality on these seems to be dropping.  During my first workout I noticed a growing unfinished seam on one of the thumb areas, which I sewed that night.  If I hadn't, the entire thumb portion of one glove would have unraveled.  The next workout, the leather on the other glove separated from one of the main seams on the palm.  Sewing this probably will not be productive.These are still likely the best workout gloves out there for the needs of many but I thought I'd let the Amazon community know the quality of the materials appears to have changed.
5	1239840000	Ive had these gloves so far for 3 weeks, and they have been awesome! They have plenty of padding around the palms, and offer plenty of protection. the only downside is that they don't cover so much of the wrist, but at the same time, by not covering the wrists as much, you have more mobility with your hands than you would with most other gloves.I would recommend these gloves to anyone!
4	1239667200	I bought these to protect my hands from growing a bunch of calluses. I tend to get them easily, and especially so when lifting weights. These are sturdy gloves that also offer some wrist support. The first pair I received had a stitching problem that caused the material around the thumb to come loose so I returned them for another pair. Worth noting is that these gloves run a bit on the small side. I got a large, and they felt pretty tight compared to other large gloves I've used in the past. You could definitely get a larger pair than you usually use and be fine in my opinion.
4	1237939200	The gloves are a little small, so I got a larger pair. The larger pair is the right size, but the fingers are a little long. This makes it a little discomfort when you squeeze a bar. But its minor. Not a big deal, but thats why I gave them a 4 instead of a 5. Other than that they are nice and good quality. Would recommend.
5	1234742400	Initially I bought these with the intent of using them to replace my summer motorcycle gloves. I also lift weights to stay in reasonable shape. I find that these gloves are excellent for both motorcycle and weightlifting. Another Amazon review mentioned that you should buy these gloves in one size larger than you normally take...very true. Even the 1 size larger is snug. The gloves are nicely padded, fit and finish are excellent and they are high quality.
5	1234569600	GlovesHarbinger 143 Men's Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Glovesare comfortable with the exception of the labels sewn to the seam inside the palm, but after cutting them off, it was no problem. I use the gloves at the gym while exercising on their equipment.Order at least one size larger than your normal glove size.  I generally buy large size gloves, but ordered XX-Large and they fit well.  If you've got any concerns and don't want to hassle with a return, go to a brick & mortar store and try some on.
5	1232928000	These gloves are just what my husband was looking for.  He thinks they are great for his workouts and very comfortable.
5	1232582400	i've been using it for a long time and yes its a great product and recommend others to buy it. you may find quality little bit low but in this price its really worth to have one for the work out. Remember to order one size up than your usual size, so Large equals to XL.
5	1231286400	Great product, sturdy and well fitting. Good Padding as well. Great workout Gloves over all
5	1231286400	I bought these gloves for my husband for Christmas and he has been very happy with them.  He lifts 3-4 days per week, moderate weight.  These are perfect for his level of lifting.
5	1231200000	Fit perfectly.Gift for someone else.  They loved them and said they worked well for his weight lifting.  Protected his hands.Now he just has to go to the gym more often to wear them.
4	1229126400	I've been using it for a month now, it seems pretty good, never bought another glove before. One thing though, buy one size up. I have small hands (not REALLY small but just small) and I got the medium, it fits perfectly.
5	1229040000	good looking. comfortable. strong grip on the strap (yet still comfortable). breathes very well. OVERALL A GREAT PURCHASE for around $10
5	1225670400	They fit well, and make sure that it's your muscles that fail, not your grip. Seem to breathe easy, and are definitely comfortable. Make sure you know your size, and remember that weight-lifting gloves are made tight.
5	1223078400	They are great, though they don't offer as much wrist report as certain models do, they are of great quality material and are great for friction protection of the hands, ideal for lifting, working, and even workingout in.They also delievered to Iraq where I'm deployed.
5	1222905600	I got the natural colored ones.  Personally I felt they looked better.Have been using them for a while and they have saved my hands from being all ripped up after working out with different metal bars and rope pulls.  Have even used them in helping people move which in lifting some things can really hurt your hands.One of the other reviewers mentioned a guide for measuring your hands, and I would use that as it worked perfectly for me.The reviewer who said he has to cut out the parts between fingers, while I can kind of see why, and depending on how your hand is built you might, I have had no issues with that.  They fit perfectly for me and I have had no issues with the parts between the fingers.Also recently washed them and they came out fine and still fit perfectly.  They stay in my car all the time in the Florida heat and sun and are still soft too.Whenever these wear out I will certainly buy another pair.  Have been using them pretty regularly and they have held up well so far.
5	1217376000	Lightweight, soft, durable and good-looking gloves. They maintain your hands ventilated while yo do your routine. They're washable and machine dryable.
5	1211587200	I can guarantee you that whoever wrote badly about these gloves is Mr-Warm-Up-Your-Left-Hand himself and a lowly competitor of Harbinger in the glove market. What a phony. Amazon needs to find that jerk and pull his ad! That much is easy to see. I wear these gloves for 2 hours lifting weights, and my hands don't even begin to sweat. They fit fantastic. When you do wrist curls, you don't even notice that the gloves are on. They are that good. They have padding in between the layered, soft-leather palm. If your are bench pressing huge amounts, you might want to consider a Harbinger glove with a Pro rating as these are only rated intermediate --  still great gloves. They have a snug fit because the leather is spliced with small elastic areas, making them cool to wear due to the breathability.
5	1207526400	The gloves work great! As some people mentioned, the gloves are a little tight between the fingers but it wasn't a problem for me. If you are unsure of what size to get as i was just go for the larger size and you should be fine.
4	1203984000	I have bought this product in the past, and have found these gloves to be best weight lifting gloves for the money. They hold up better than other gloves that I have purchased. Will buy again when these gloves wear out sometime next year. I put the gloves thru a lot, as I work out four or five days per week, and my typical session lasts for about 90 minutes.
4	1202688000	I has been using Harbinger gloves for 3 years before I decided it was time for an upgrade.  These gloves are awesome!  Great fit (though I would suggest going one size higher) and feel good too.
4	1201046400	They certainly look nice. I Just wish they were padded a little heavier on the palm which would assist during military press and benching. Also, I wish the finger sleeves were slightly longer as to protect more skin, but thats ok. Im just use to an old pair of ski gloves that i had converted for weight lifting. They had much thicker padding and perhaps in comparison, these fall short. However, these do look great...and are washable. They claim the leather won't shrink in the dryer either, lets hope not. There is a tag on the inside which irritates the wrist at times. Pulling it off would probably destroy the stiching and diminish the integrity of the glove, so i'll just leave it. All in all, a decent pair of gym gloves for the price. I checked around...These gloves are more expensive elsewhere.
5	1200182400	The exercise gloves were delivered on time and in perfect condition.  The entire transaction was perfect from start to finish.
2	1198886400	I've used Harbinger gloves in the past, and recently got these.  But I had to return them because the stitching at the wrist near the label pulled away after two wearings, and it seems like other parts of the stitching will do the same soon.  They were also very small; I got an XL based on my prior pair being XL, but these felt like M or L.
5	1192060800	Since I fell and badly cut my hand I decided gloves would protect me some. I bought my first pair at a sporting goods store and subsequently more pairs at Amazon which was a better deal. These are very comfortable, easy on and off, wash nice, and are attractive.  I don't go out without them.  I like having a few pairs so I always have them 'handy'.
4	1190851200	Resistente y con un buen acabado, un precioso guante que a demas de prpteger tus manos te sirvn de adorno
5	1190160000	The gloves are exactly what I expected. I've always used weight room gloves and this pair is a GREAT fit. One minor problem though, the AMAZON site goes into every important question.....except one.......they don't ask for sizing info ! FITNESS GIANT had to email me for size.
3	1182816000	Picture shown is not what I got.  Mine have pleats that are good for removing (always a pain with workout gloves).  I originally wrote they had too much padding but the more I use it, the more I like them.
4	1173484800	This glove fits very well and is comfortable to wear.  It seems to breathe relatively well and can be secured by the velcro straps.  I'm very happy with mine, for purposes of an everyday workout glove.  Would recommend.
4	1172102400	I recently started casually lifting at the gym. After getting into heavier weights, I found that my limits were more based on what pain my hands could take from holding the metal weights and bars, instead of what my muscles could lift. So I bought these gloves and couldn't be happier. Now I can focus on lifting the weight rather than worrying about my hands getting torn up.I'm new to weight lifting, but even for light to moderate weights these gloves make a big difference.I'm sure other gloves would do the trick too, but these had a great price and look. They run small, so order a size up if you're uncertain.
4	1170028800	I am satisified with these gloves.  However, I had to cut the area between the ring finger and index finger because it was sewn too closely.  When my hand was in the glove that area bit into my hand.  I am uploading a photo so can see what I am talking about because I may not be explaining myself very well :)Other than that I like the gloves.  They smelled of heavy chemicals when I got them.  Just FYI, you might want to wash them with your unimportant laundry to get the toxic smell out.  I did not wash mine.  And these gloves do not turn my hands black.  That's nice.Had I first tried them on at Sports Authority I may not have bought them.  But after making the small cuts in the gloves they perform fine.
5	1168992000	I've gone through several gloves over the years(whether from wear and tear or just losing them) and I've got to highlight these as quality gloves.Weightlifting gloves don't always cover up to the middle of the fingers, so calluses form in the middle even if the bottom of the fingers don't. These glove-fingers cover up just past this section of the finger when the hand is flexed.Also, the light breathable back limits the heat buildup from heavier gloves. Wrist wraps have never actually protected my wrists, if you can't keep your wrists straight, a wrist wrap sure as hell won't be enough to hold it for you. The marginal benefit does not justify the presence of wrist wraps and they're thankfully absent from this glove.The leather here is soft,flexible, and PROPERLY PLACED. Avoid the other Harbinger lifting glove models at all costs, the padding seam in the thumbsection is driven straight into the bone, whereas this pad's seam runs smooth. Another nice feature is that unlike my other gloves, the material doesn't shrink in the wash, so it can be tossed into the laundry instead of having to be handwashed like most gloves. (And you need to wash lifting gloves since gyms are horrendously bacteria-ridden, in addition to the odor).
5	1168387200	I wear them riding my bike to work and back. I work out doors and handle alot of money, they are perfect for counting money, keeping my hands warm and riding my bike. They are well made and strong.
5	1167955200	I wish these gloves were available everywhere, and wonder why not. I've tried many kinds - and these are the best - fit great, grip well, comfortable, and protect my hands just the way I want. I bought an extra pair and fear the day I can no longer get them.
4	1162684800	The item was delivered quickly.  As advertised have not hadany problems at all the stiching was fine.  I would purchase again from this supplier.
