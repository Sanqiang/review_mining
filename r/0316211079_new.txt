5	1405036800	This book was intelligent and engaging as most James Patterson proves to be. I rarely put it down. The ending is excellent and the story is solid to the very end.
3	1405036800	I was disappointed in this James Patterson book. Definitely did not live up to my expectations. While the overall plot was good, with somewhat of a twist at the end, I was distracted by the main character's ramblings. The novel is written in the first person and the narrator is afflicted with either ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) or a mental illness of some sort. He vaguely mentions a doctor and medication early in the novel, but it is not specific and is rarely, if ever, mentioned again. Our narrator, however, is taken with flights of trivia, often tossing in presidential trivia for no apparent reason other than his mind wanders. This lessens tremendously towards the end of the novel, but by then all I wanted to do was finish it and move on. Definitely not the quality I have come to expect from Mr. Patterson, and it made me wonder just how much input he had in this &#34;co-written&#34; novel.
5	1405036800	Good story and Author.
5	1404950400	Holds you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  Loved it!
4	1404864000	great different but I enjoyed the story
4	1404691200	Mistress by James Patterson and David Ellis is a wonderfully suspenseful tale told by a journalist, Benjamin Casper, for an online newspaper. The story opens with Ben going through the medicine cabinet of a woman named Diana Hotchkiss. He is in her empty apartment installing surveillance equipment. Moments after leaving her apartment she plummets six stories to the pavement below. So, needless to say, the book grabs your attention immediately, but it doesn't stop there. Throw into the mix the President of the United States, Russians, Chinese, the CIA, spies, murder, and a lot of guns and you have one very suspenseful twisted story in which you will never guess the outcome.While growing up, Ben's father was a professor at American University in Washington, D.C. In order to develop a relationship with his father, Ben learned a great deal about the various President's. I love the way Patterson and Ellis throw in bits and pieces of trivia surrounding the President's and their terms of office. For instance, &#34;Calvin Coolidge liked to have Vaseline rubbed on his head while he ate breakfast in bed&#34; and &#34;John Quincy Adams regularly started his days by swimming nude in the Potomac.&#34; I'm sure these are facts you would not expect to read about in a book entitled Mistress. I also enjoyed the inner dialogue Ben has relating to the different encounters he has throughout the book and how he compares them to actors and their movie roles. Throughout the book he quotes (during this inner dialogue) actors, such as Sean Connery in The Untouchables, &#34;They put one of yours in the hospital, you put one of theirs in the morgue!&#34;Besides all of the espionage going on in the book, there is a great deal of foreshadowing. One of my favorite quotes from the book was actually first used in a radio address in 1939 by Winston Churchill when describing Russia, but is spoken by Joe Pesci in the movie JFK, &#34;A mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma&#34;. Following this statement is another great quote, this one from President Roosevelt and written to Churchill during the war, &#34;It is fun to be in the same decade with you.&#34; The mention of Russia, Churchill, and Roosevelt so early in the story might be overlooked by some, but has a great impact to the rest of the story.I always seem to be saying the same thing when it comes to a Patterson book. They are great. I love the suspense, the mystery, and the way the story is twisted in so many directions I simply cannot figure out which direction he will be taking the characters. He is a master storyteller and I love losing myself in his books.
4	1404604800	Mistress is the 30th stand-alone novel by prolific American author, James Patterson, co-written by David Ellis. Ben Casper is a political journalist for his own online newspaper based in Washington DC. When he witnesses the apparent suicide of his good friend, Diana Hotchkiss, his grief is soon overcome by disbelief. He is certain that she would not suicide, but as he investigates, he discovers a Diana he does not recognise, a woman with secret lovers and uncharacteristic behaviour. And it seems that people Ben talks to begin to die with alarming regularity. Ben finds himself escaping death by the narrowest of margins. The clues seem to lead to the upper levels of Washington power brokers. As with most Patterson fiction, the novel is plot-driven; the characters have very little depth. Ben is the only character who is expanded upon: the reader spends the novel inside the head of a narrator who relates almost everything he experiences to TV or movies, trivia about presidents, or songs and artists. Ben&#8217;s constant patter about movies, presidents, bikes and music is at once a source of humour, a distraction from the main event and a filler between the action. Without it, the novel would have been considerably shorter. Ben&#8217;s own history is interspersed throughout the novel, but the final resolution feels a little rushed. Ellis manages to incorporate blackmail, several murders, explosions, shootings, the CIA, the Russians, the Chinese, the President and plenty of well-known DC landmarks into the plot. The Russian action is surprisingly topical considering events in the Ukraine. Once again in the format of Patterson&#8217;s extremely short chapters, this is a page-turner that has plenty of twists and turns.
5	1404604800	Totally received as stated...
4	1404518400	Another great Patterson read, lots of twists and turns. Liked the political aspect.
5	1404518400	Always a pleasurable read!  Can I live long enough to get to all of his?
5	1404432000	I can even give out some suggestions of who can play Benjamin Casper the main lead character in the story.The story begins with a suicide or is it a murder??? and our Benjamin is a main witness and suspect of it. As he begins to ask questions about the death of his friend Diana he begins to shake the tree and more and more people end up dead because of his actions.It's a story that keeps you at the edge of your seat and you just can't stop reading....I read the whole book practically in one day 'cause I didn't want to put it down....I just had to find out who did it.....It has twists and turns, Russian spies, the CIA and the Chinese mafia all wrap in together.......
4	1404432000	Fast moving!
5	1404345600	Great page turner, surprised at how good this book is, since it is by a fairly obscure author publishing with Patterson, though obviously not written by him.
4	1404345600	This book is fast paced and an easy read.  The character is interesting and the story stays well connected.  This could easily be a series.
2	1404345600	Not interesting. No imagination.
2	1404259200	It was a movie trivia that made me want to quit reading this book.  I love James Patterson but he really missed the mark here.
5	1404259200	Interesting story. Surprising twists right up to the very end. The unusual hero, Ben, is ADD on meth, bouncing from thought to disjointed thought. Stick with him though, it's worth the bumpy ride!
3	1404086400	Too much reference to movies, celebrities and Presidents.  I'm just part way into it but so far I think it's one of Patterson's worst.  I probably won't  finish it unless it gets starts to get exciting.
3	1404086400	I love James Patterson books, but this must have been an earlier book as it wasn't up to par like his latest ones.
3	1404086400	This was one of the best Patterson and his co-writers have put out in a while. I figured out what was actually going on about the same time that Ben did. The suspense and other emotions were palpable throughout the story. At the same time, I still didn't feel as much of Patterson himself in the story as I would have liked.
2	1404000000	I have always enjoyed Mr. Patterson's books and have always given them 5 stars, but I found this one extremely hard to start.  I found the fall-back and references to movie and TV shows very distracting.  When I finally got into the meat of the storyline, I truly enjoyed it and found that part very much pulling you into the drama.  I just had to ignore the references.
3	1404000000	Usually I really enjoy a James Patterson book but was disappointed in &#34;Mistress&#34;.  I found the constant referrals to lines or action from past Movies to be really annoying.  I just wanted to get on with the plot!!
4	1404000000	It was a great story, he had to deal with personal issues.I would recommend this book to any James Patterson fan.
5	1404000000	James Patterson does it once again . ! I loved this book and I was reading it every moment that I could .  !
5	1403913600	Another great James Patterson beach read . I had a hard time putting it down. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.
5	1403913600	it was one of the best books I've read in a long time. every chapter was riveting with all the twists and turns
4	1403913600	Liked it except for the continual references to movies.
2	1403913600	Typical Patterson pageturner, but plenty of inconsistencies and loose ends.  Would a lesbian affair really have caused all these problems?
4	1403827200	This book was great except for the continuous referral to movies and their characters.  Could have done without that irritating factor.
5	1403827200	I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I hated to have to put it down . Very intense was exciting and thrilling.
4	1403740800	Not my favorite Patterson but good. Took awhile for me to get engaged with plot but I'm glad I finished it
4	1403568000	It had alot of twist and turns in the story. Kept you wanting to keep on reading. Another great story by James Patterson.
5	1403481600	Could not put this book down.  What a fun read.  Very riveting and fast paced.  Will be looking for their next book!
1	1403395200	It took me a long time to get through this book. I thought it was repetitive and lacked solid content.
5	1403395200	very &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; book of who done it - makes you feel helpless--gives you a feeling of deception
5	1403308800	I loved this book.  It kept my attention throughout.  Twists and turns are always fun to read about.  Would recommend
4	1403308800	Things are not the way they appear sometimes. Try to do the right thing even if it hurts. Good read.
3	1403222400	We'll written and held my interest . Loved the humor. A very good story line for the day we live in.
5	1403222400	I was surprised by this book with its frenetic thoughts pulsing throughout the chapters.  After a while I felt like Benjamin was going those his mind or I was.  It was a crazy little ride.
4	1403136000	In the beginning, I didn't  think I would finish this book because I did not like the writing style.  Mr. Patterson's character Ben can be best described as having ADD.  Ben's mind wanders, especially during the most climatic and important parts of the book.  Ben goes on tangents about actors and their movie roles and trivial presidential facts which I found to be annoying. However, as the book progressed with exciting twists and turns in the plot, I viewed these tangent interruptions as book commercials. I could not wait to get past the trivial information and get on with the show. At the end of the book, I got an ending I didn't see coming and even a reason for the presidential trivia:)
4	1403049600	The fascinating perspective of an ambitious, intelligent, and ethical journalist creates an almost-nonfiction plot. The drama includes contemporary political  issues with diversity and equal opportunity for all dimensions of international tension. Do the real good guys really win at the end? The journalist has incredible strength and endurance as he is pursued by so many people covering up crimes. The ongoing references to contemporary film and television scenarios offer a humorous backdrop for the journalist's problem solving. Weaving in WWII events suggests that history repeats itself.
5	1402963200	Very good book. It really kept me on the edge of my seat. This could be the start of a new series.
4	1402876800	I seldom read Patterson, but occasionally pick up one if it's recommended.  I heard Neal Boortz talking about this one and bought it.  It's actually a great story, with a real twist at the end.  I love that! One of the great things about this book is that the main character is a newspaper guy who has very few skills, so when he gets in a jam, he doesn't miraculously turn into a tough guy. He just has to think his way out of it. A good beach read!
4	1402876800	I liked the story.  I did not like all of the references to actors and their movies.  I thought that was totally unnecessary.  The story was compelling and kept my interest.
5	1402704000	Quick chapters filled with witty dialogue and a fast-pace story line. As soon as you want to put the book down for the night, the last line of each chapter makes you want to read the next. Great job on this.
3	1402617600	Not one of my favorites. I thought it seemed long to finish. Did not hold my attention like other books he has written
5	1402617600	Fast paced, never a dull moment! The characters were unpredictable. The plot was seamless. I highly recommend this book. It's Patterson at his best!
4	1402531200	l normally don't read books written in the first person but once you get into this book you are hooked. it really grips you.
5	1402531200	Easy reading, plenty of action with twists and turns along the way; not to mention surprises. You'll never figure it out, or will you. I certainly didn't!
3	1402444800	A little hard to get into until about halfway through the book.  Once it gets interesting, you are intrigued to find out the conclusion!
4	1402444800	Suspenseful enough to enjoy this read, interesting trivia throughout....anxious to get to end of story.for many reasons.Always can rely on a James Patterson story to entertain.
5	1402444800	Loved this book...Ben is really funny & smart. He loves to relate everything to movies, president trivia. Easy read full of suspense. I did not expect the ending to turn out as it concluded.--I would highly recommend this book.
3	1402185600	Not one of his better books in my opinion.  I have liked his stand alone books a lot, but this one took me a long time to get into.  Picked up in the second half , but I would say to look elsewhere for a Patterson book.
2	1402185600	I was disappointed not to read the Patterson style of writing.  This novel had some very exciting moments, shootouts, narrow escapes, but actually read more like a &#34;blow up movie&#34; script than a good novel.  My question would be, &#34;What part is James Patterson playing in this scenario?  Is he just lending his name to sell a book?
5	1402185600	I enjoyed this book, as I do all James Patterson books. He is a great writer and this is another interesting story. Definitely read.
4	1402185600	Mistress I liked, but I love James Patterson so anything he writes gets a good review from me.Him and Coulter are my favorite
2	1402099200	Some of Patterson and Co-writers book are so well written and entertaining.  As far as I'm concerned this one does not fit that bill.  Could have done without reading it and giving it two stars is more than the book deserves.
3	1402099200	Finally finished this book after listening to the audio version for about 2 weeks. I generally don't listen to audio books, but I had been traveling a lot for work, so I picked a few up. Before I get into the book itself, I'll have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of this speaker/recorder. I don't know if it was his voice or just the way he delivered the story; not a huge fan. It wasn't awful, but I prefer listening to others more.Now onto the book. While I'm a huge James Patterson fan, in my opinion, this wasn't his best or one of my favorites. The main character really bothered me and I couldn't connect with him at all. From the very beginning he just irritated me. Maybe that's why I wasn't too thrilled about the book. Overall, the storyline was pretty good and there were definitely a lot of twists and turns I wasn't expecting. I think had I not been so annoyed with the main character, I might have enjoyed it a bit more. Unfortunately, just not my favorite of Patterson's work, but that won't stop me from reading everything else he writes! (:Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com
1	1402099200	I completely agree with the other readers.  What a waste of time!  Patterson's co-author, David Ellis, has no clue of a snappy story-line!  Can't believe Patterson's name is even attached to this work.  Put down after chapter chapter 11.  Should have read the reviews before I bought!!!
5	1402099200	Page turner!! Thanks again Patterson! Best one you have written in awhile.  I love Ben's mind and how he thinks.
3	1402012800	Never have I read a James Patterson book that was this confusing. The story jumped all over and I found it hard to keep up with all that was going on. Not sure if I read any of Pattersons books co-authored by Dave Ellis. If not then I'm not sure about reading any more books co-authored by Ellis
5	1402012800	As usual James Patterson has outdone himself. He keeps you mesmerized. You don't want to put it down.  From the first page to the last it's spell bounding and when it ends you want more.
3	1402012800	I have always enjoyed James Patterson books. They are a quick read, but I found this one a little hard to follow.
4	1401926400	While I felt like this book was one of Patterson's harder books to get into, it had his usual suspense and thrill that holds your attention. I think any James Patterson lovers will enjoy this book.
5	1401840000	His deep connection and devotion to Diana, determination to find what happened to her, his refusal to believe she was dead
5	1401840000	I love James Patterson. He writes the best stories and they are always just the right length to read! !
4	1401840000	In typiclal Patterson fashion, he has a surprise ending thatHe keeps to the very end!  A good read as usual!
5	1401753600	Typical James Paterson....but I loved it!  He's always easy to follow and difficult to put down! I'm not sure if I liked knowing so early but it still kept me engaged?
5	1401753600	Another one of James Patterson's great books, you will be hooked on the first chapter, a great 5 star book.
5	1401667200	A different type for Patterson.Always writing in short, simple style, his plots usually surround some type of mystery.Mistress has several twists that keep the reader looking forward to the next page.It's not one of the Women's Murder Mystery books or Alex Cross.It is a stand alone. I enjoy when he writes about different things, such as Zoo.
5	1401580800	Kept me reading all the way to the end which is the way every book should be.  Can't get enough of Patterson
4	1401408000	Each time I thought I had it figured out, as did Ben, the story took another turn. Only until the very last was all made clear. Very exciting writing.
5	1401321600	It was a page turner to see what was going to happen next, I truly enjoyed it, I hated to see it end.
1	1401235200	Good pace but far too many referrals to the names of movies and actors and USA Presidents. It would make a Z rating for a movie.Certainly not one of James Patterson's even semi good.I do not recommend it.
5	1401235200	I like a mystery that keeps you guessing. A story that makes your pulse speed up and stay up late to finish the last 100 pages. This book delivered!! Great stand alone novel - don't ruin it with a sequel.This is probably one of the best James Patterson books I have read in a while. The ending was unexpected but left you with something to think about. How would you feel if every perception you had about someone you loved is false? From your parents to your lover, what would you do to save their image and keep your reality in check?Thought Provoking. Sometimes the main character, Ben Casper, rambles in his thoughts - equating everything to evaluating the merits of pop culture, but an amusing, entertaining read.
5	1401235200	One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Couldn't stop reading, had to see what was going to happen next.  This is the first book I have read by James Patterson, and I can't wait to read more.  Buy this book, too great of a story to miss out.
3	1401148800	OK read, but not one of his best. His best writing companion is Maxine Paetro. Now she knows how to write a book.  See: Women's Murder Club series.
2	1401148800	Usually love Patterson. This was not one of my favorites. Didn't care for all the movie references.  Plot was interesting. Definitely not a nail biter.
5	1401148800	James Patterson is a hit of miss for me lately.  I used to love everyone of his, but lately he's written some that I really think are lame. This one is NOT one of those.  It was quick paced with a nice twist and I enjoyed the little bits of trivia sprinkled in.  Good story, easy read and one I'd recommend.
4	1400976000	Book to me started out slow but ended with a bang. Really liked it. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
2	1400803200	Not the best! Seemed like there was nothing new or interesting in it. Hope she'll write a more exciting one next time.
4	1400803200	A bit of a departure from Mr Patterson's prior main characters...but engaging once you get the gist of his quirks. Lots of section throughout...glad I gave it a chance.
5	1400630400	My daughter wanted this book to read. The book came just as it appeared on the web site.We will buy again.
5	1400371200	Il love the way the book kept your interest in every page.  I have never been to Washington, D.C.  but the description of streets and sights made me feel like I was right there.  Does he always write in the first person.
3	1400371200	Sorry but this book was a disappointment to me. Advertises it's as good as &#34;Quickie!&#34;  Not even close!!!!  The last quarter of the book was good but not the usual &#34;can't put this book down&#34;. Too much useless trivial wording that didn't need to be there. I struggled to pick the book up to read each day. Normally I can't wait to get back to James Patterson book!  Is it his partner this time????  You decide.
5	1400198400	Reading is one of my favorite things and James Patterson never disappoints me...This was a great book and worth reading.
3	1400198400	As a total fan of James Patterson, I eagerly anticipated &#34;Mistress&#34;.  The plot build-up was well written, but as it continued, it appeared more far fetched than usual.  The ending was abrupt, and I did not realize the book was over, until I saw the ad for the next book!  This was disappointing!
5	1400112000	Enjoyed it - lots of twists and turns. I had to keep reading and finished it all in one weekend.
5	1400112000	The story moved me faster and faster through the action.  Read the last half over just a couple of days.
5	1400112000	One of the best reads I've read. Action-filled, suspenseful. Full of surprises and unexpected twists. A perfect book with which to read during the summer vacation or any vacation for that matter.
5	1399939200	After receiving this book, I immediately got it read and thoroughly enjoyed. James Patterson always delivers a good must read book.
1	1399939200	Could only tolerate to page 80. Incessant references to movies, actors, history were a constant distraction. I usually love his stories and writing, this one however, not so much. Bummer! It looks like it could have been really awesome.
4	1399852800	This book was full of action and packed with suspense.. Full of presidential trivia, which I didn't think I would enjoy, but as it turns out...I was wrong.  Loved the suspense.
5	1399852800	A thrilling page turner! Patterson does it again and takes u on a exciting ride of a story, always leaving u to wonder what happens next?
4	1399852800	This was a slow start for me, but I did enjoy the book.  At first I was ready to chuck it, I kept thinking it had to have a crazy twist to it.
5	1399766400	He's able to keep the readers involved in the story. Like the short chapters. Out come was a surprise.  Could apply to today's political arena.
5	1399680000	Masterpiece till the last page, a great read. Recommend to everyone looking for a fast paced book. Bring me more.
5	1399680000	James and David had at the first chapter of this page turning book. I loved scandals and what a twisted one this book had. Good job guys awesome read.
3	1399680000	It didn't hold my interest like all his other books.It took a week to read not as good as the rest!!
5	1399680000	Patterson is the master of page turners and you can't put this book down. Besides Bosch and Women's Murder Club you can't get enough!
2	1399593600	I am a huge fan of James Patterson but this book was not one of his better ones. The plot was a bit off the wall and the writing in the first person was just annoying.
3	1399507200	I love all of his books and this one I thought was a little slow.  His characters were interesting but not one of his better books.
1	1399507200	I've read almost all of his books &  this was the worst I've read.  I usually read his books in 1-2 days, this took me much longer because it was bad
5	1399420800	Another well written book by Patterson.  I did think that the story was predictable and had it figured out after about five chapters but it was an enjoyable book to read.
5	1399420800	Loved the main character, hope Patterson uses him again.  Great thriller, couldn't put it down.  Lots of twists and turns, very engrossing.
5	1399334400	Love all James Patterson books and this one is no exception.  Seller was great and arrived quickly.  If your questioning buying it, don't it is great.
5	1399334400	This book is one of the best Patterson books I've read in a long time.  I was on the edge of my seat after the first chapter and finished it in 2 days.  Couldn't put it down.  Once I understood the main character's psychological issue, the jumping around did not bother me.  I would definitely recommend this book as a must read.
5	1399248000	I loved this book, it was full of twists and turns I never saw coming coming...it was a great read!
5	1399248000	Bought this for a  friend.  Haven't given it to her yet and am trying to read it before I gift it away.  He is a great read. Thanks. C.Fahy
5	1399248000	The story started quick and never slowed.It was a very detailed multi-murder mystery that was tied together in the end.A very good read that was hard to put down.
5	1399161600	I have read a lot of books during my 74 yrs and this one I could not put down.  Go gettem James...  Sandra
5	1399161600	I love James Patterson books he is one of the best authors today.  This book is no exception  He definitely lives up to his reputation as an author.
2	1399075200	Basically a good read, but too many references to movies and actors and specific scenes in a movie. If you are not a movie enthusiast the references mean nothing .
2	1399075200	Way too much frivolous internal thinking of main character. Hard to follow at times. Love Patterson, but I've read better
4	1399075200	I was tempted to give up on this as another of Patterson's poorly crafted co-authored works but am glad I continued as the standard improved significantly as the pages turned and it ended up being a decent holiday page turner.
4	1398816000	Great book , exciting read. Kept me interested right to the last page with an unexpected ending. I love this author
4	1398816000	I truly enjoyed the book lots of twist and keeps you interested and guessing until the end. Would recommend reading
5	1398643200	How ever does Patterson think of these things and yet get so close to reality.  Friends are already reading it.
1	1398643200	I bought this book for $8.00 at a second hand book store,  not on AMAZON. I dove into it immediately , super enthused... and was let down pretty hard after the first chapter or two. The other readers are definitely correct when they express how very distracting the character's out-of-the-blue useless trivial tidbits are.  It really does disturb the whole flow of the story. Just when you start to get lost in the story, BOOM. Distraction. It's the most bizarre,  uncomfortable, obnoxious style of writing I ever had to endure. I made it about 80 pages in and couldn't take it anymore.
5	1398643200	This book is an exciting and thrilling read from page one to the last page.  I pride myself in discovering the plot early on but there are so many twists and turns you need to read and find out the details for yourself.
3	1398384000	It moved right along at a good pace but did not get my juices  going.  I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea.
2	1398384000	This story went on and on with I was falling asleep everytime tried to read it.  Couldn't keep interest. What I did like was the distraction of person who would go off on random thoughts in middle whatever was going on, it took awhile to figure that out, he had hard time focusing, it was somewhat amusing.
5	1398297600	i love all of james patterson's books. if you like suspense, any of his books will keep your attention. i received it right a way & in great condition.
5	1398297600	There was suspense with every chapter. You never knew what was around the corner. Mr Patterson never disappoints. Loved it.
3	1398297600	This was not a favorite of mine. I enjoy all the James Patterson books. This one was all over the place and I liked it t for a couple of chapters and then had a hard time reading other chapters.  I had a love/haterelationship with the main character.
4	1398211200	This book has a slow beginning, but becomes a page turn about 1/3 in.  The title is deceiving and this is a true Patterson mystery.Quick good read
5	1398211200	Thrilling, witty, surprising. Couldn't put it down! Just gotta love the humor. Unpredictable twists and turns. Probably on my top ten favorites list now. Perfect!
5	1398211200	It was a terrific rainy day book, with lots of turns and twists. I enjoyed it immensely. James Patterson is always a good read!
4	1398211200	Keeps you guessing. Can be somewhat slow in areas, but I felt the need to keep reading to find who/what/when/where.
4	1398124800	As always patterosn has done a great job if you are a patterson fan you will love book. very fastread
5	1398124800	I loved the suspense and all the trivia with regards to the presidents.  I would have loved to read Ben finally recovering the video of the illicit affair
3	1398124800	Like James Patterson books. This one had a good plot but I found the constant references to old movies and old movie stars distracting from the plot.
3	1398124800	I was finally able to finish this book. I only gave it three stars because it confused the mess out of me! It was a good read though as far as the story and plot. After going over the book in my head at the end, I understand now that the confusion was apart of the story.
5	1398038400	A little slow in the beginning...... but after that I could not put it down.  Written in a way that pulls you in, shakes you up, twists you around, and just as you think you have it all figured out........ well, I guess you'll have to read it to find out!
4	1397952000	Patterson continues to weave his magic, leading and leaving the reader wondering where this might go in the next chapter,
3	1397865600	Kept you on edge, but in usual Patterson fashion it all wraps up so quickly. I find that with all his books....I do like his books though.
4	1397865600	A very fast paced story with an unexpected turn of events in the end. I don't usually like stories that involve politics but I did enjoy this one.
5	1397865600	Well written page Turner.  interesting trivia interspersed throughout the book.  Plot and characters engage you right away.  a "must read".
5	1397779200	A good light read, very fast-paced page-turner.  Protagonist well-developed, plot line very believable.  Easy to see why James Patterson maintains his nest-seller reputation.
5	1397779200	I'm a great fan of all of James Patterson's books.  I haven't read this book yet but am sure that I will enjoy this book as much as I have all of the others.
1	1397779200	I could not stay awake when reading this boring and preposterous piece of nothing literature. One could tell that Patterson did not write this book due to the total change in the writer's style.
3	1397692800	It takes time to get into.  Not the best of Patterson, but an interesting plot.  Really picks up pace, and a good ending.
4	1397692800	I just don't understand how people still think Patterson writes these co=authored books. This book is David Ellis all the way. Yes it starts slow but it really becomes quite good. It was very twisted and when you thought you had it figured out something changed and what you thought wasn.t right. I dislike Patterson as a writer he is simply to inane. The chapters alone drive me up a wall! But the co-authored books, at least a few are better. David Ellis and Andrew Gross are quite good, especially with oddly twisting plots, short chapters not withstanding.
1	1397606400	Wasn't anything I expected from James Patterson.  Have always enjoyed reading his work but not a fan of this one.
4	1397606400	I definitely got caught up in it from the beginning  and it kept me right there even though it got a bit confusing at times.  The references to movies and celebrities was so entertaining as well as the references to history and presidential trivia enlightening.  I loved the many sides and depth to Ben Casper.
5	1397520000	each of the characters all very well developed. story line kept my interest throughout... the political undertones were certainly time appropriate...
5	1397520000	this is a real good book it will surprise you when you read it you will understand buy it now
2	1397520000	I usually love James Patterson's books but I really did not enjoy this. It didn't grab me from the start and didn't get any better as I read on. It will not put me off reading his books but this one was disappointing.
3	1397520000	I love James Patterson and read all his books. This was not one of my favorites. It was hard to keep interested until the end
4	1397433600	James Patterson has done it again, this book is a real thriller with many plot twist and turns it makes you want to turn the page.
5	1397433600	Great read. totally enjoyed.Would recommend to anyone that as read any books written by James Patterson. Really good and hope you enjoy as much as I did.
4	1397347200	It was good but was a little cluttered. Had trouble keeping with the plot. Not one of Patterson's best novels.
3	1397347200	A lot of action that keeps you reading. But it is a little too hip for me.; His recollection of old movie lines throughout his adventures seems a little contrived and out of place. The confrontation with Russia seems from today's headlinesal
2	1397347200	Not one of his best!, I felt like I was reading one of his young adult books. I'm sure he will get better!
4	1397347200	James Patterson never fails to provide interest. Another winner. I enhoyed this one and I think I've read them all.
5	1397260800	Mistress, like all of James Patterson's book, was an awesome book that is so hard to put down once started!!  It is action packed with several different elements brewing. His books are all entertaining fast reads where u feel like you actually literally know the characters in the story and when coming upon the end of the book, you are a little sad that you won't be with the characters any longer, if that makes any sense. I really enjoyed this book, just like his previous books!! I'm such a fan of James Patterson and this new addition to my collection of his books fits right in with his others! Mr. Patterson has done it again!!
2	1397260800	Slow moving and not the usual flow and suspense of Patterson's books.  For me this book was slow and disappointing.
3	1397260800	Certainly not one of Patterson's best efforts.  Plot was not believable and was not enhanced by the irritable attempts at movie trivia.
2	1397260800	Too much &#34;DC History&#34; and not enough &#34;story&#34;. Mistress does not have the usual James Patterson wording. I love James Patterson books, but must rate this one as not one of my favorites.
5	1397260800	I thoroughly enjoyed Patterson's Mistress. It is a political novel that pushes the edge.  I enjoyed the character development of Benjamin.  Makes you wonder how far from fiction it truly is.
4	1397260800	I really enjoyed this book and felt that there were lots of interesting twists in the plot!  I would recommend it.
5	1397088000	Best book I have read in a while - lots of action - kept those pages turning. A fun read.
4	1397088000	I'd recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of James Patterson.  The constant history lesson and the anomalous ending kind of grated, but the story line was good, and Patterson makes his people real to the reader.
2	1397088000	Did not particularly like the story as a James Patterson fan I was not impressed with this book it did not hold me like previous booms
3	1397088000	I have been a patterson fan for many years.  This book is okay-not one of my faves.  Although it did keep my interest, it was not as intense and thrilling as most of his work.  The main character had an interesting thought process how he would relate various movie lines to his current state of affairs.  Three stars for this book.  Hoping the next one patterson will get back to his horrific ways and keep me at the tip of my seat.
3	1397088000	This book was not up to James Patterson quality and I got sick and tired of the mind running off on tangents.  I just wanted to read the story.
1	1397001600	This is one of the worst books I've ever wasted money on.  I couldn't even wortk up enough interest in it to finish it.
2	1396915200	Thought it was a drawn out story.  Didn't move along very fast.  Didn't think it was one of his better books.
3	1396915200	Interesting characters and plot. too many movie quotes. Worth reading. Several good surprises having lived inDC, I like the street description .
2	1396828800	I love love love James Patterson!!!  That being said, I thought this was a terrible book. Hard to follow and quite boring. I kept waiting for it to finally grab me like every other book he has written, but sadly that is about 3 hours of my life I will never get back.  :(
5	1396742400	Loved this book, couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book. James Patterson is a great author and can't wait to start a new book by him.
1	1396742400	I felt this book was written in hast with too much reference to movies.  The stirring felt like he may have been up against a deadline.  I hope this doesn't happen again since he is one of my favorite writers.
4	1396742400	J. Patterson once again does not disappoint. This book is full of suspense and unexpected twists with a touch of humour. Very entertaining, perfect companion for a rainy weekend.
5	1396742400	Enjoyed these books . They make you think it can be happening now. I do recommend them for your enjoyment.
3	1396742400	I'm a James Patterson fan but this one fell short. Usually I can't put the book down but this one took forever to finish. Just didn't pull me in like the rest.
1	1396656000	I decided to try a Patterson book again.  He use to write good books.  This book is just plain drivel.  I cannot continue reading it.  I'm only on about Chapter 4 and am not going to continue wasting my time reading this.  I can't imagine that any one would enjoy reading this.  What a waste of money.
3	1396656000	The mind wandering  diversions of the lead character were annoying. With the numerous co writers James Patterson now uses, he's become a factory and his books have become mediocre.
4	1396656000	I did not think this was one of James Patterson's best works...It started off very slow and I almost stopped reading it! About half way it picks up and begins to make sense.  You also need to like history facts and movie facts to figure out what the main character is talking about!!!!!Wish I had checked this one out at the library instead of purchasing it on kindle.
4	1396569600	Great book ...hated to put it down..made walking on the treadmill a snap:) I told many of my friends a must read..
4	1396569600	The first of the book didn't hold my attention like most James Patterson books, but after a few chapters I was caught into his intriguing story.
5	1396569600	Great read. Loved the quirky dialog and story shifts. Very hard to put down and an equal to &#34;House of Cards&#34; on TV.
4	1396569600	Great, with quite a twist at the end. A good read and kept interest well. James Patterson is very good
5	1396569600	Great read kept you in suspense through out the book I would recommend this book James Patterson is one of my favorite authors
1	1396483200	The book doesn't have James Patterson feel to it. Poor story line . Jumps around to much talking about FDR's dogs.It's boring with a Capitol B
4	1396396800	Very different approach used to write this book.  I love the fact that history and classic movies assisted in solving  the case.
5	1396396800	This was my first Ebook ever.  I love J. Patterson and this didn't disappoint.  It was a page turner for sure.
1	1396396800	Patterson needs to begin writing alone.  None of his books are as good when he writes with others.  This was a &#34;DUD&#34;
3	1396396800	Sometimes hard to follow. Very unlike many of his books.  Maybe it was too much of his co-author's influence or not. Just didn't care for it.
5	1396396800	was an interesting and engaging read would recommend to others was a suspense thriller that kept your attention making it difficult to put down
5	1396310400	Very good read, main character was a little nutty, but I guess all brilliant people are right? :) Anyway I recommend it, fast paced, easy read, keeps your attention.
4	1396310400	Very good story told in a easy-to-read fashion.  I could read for 15-20 minutes, put it down, and get right back into the story.  Lots of new twists throughout and quite exciting.
5	1396310400	Another thriller and great book by James Patterson!  He never disappoints and I am always eagerly awaiting his next book!
3	1396224000	I love anything James Patterson but this one was a little much for me. Not what I expected but still a good read
3	1396224000	The book starts slow but heats up about half way into it.  The pace picks up and makes it a worthwhile read!
5	1396137600	Wow-what a page turner-just when you think you know what's going to happen-it doesn't -it go's  in a whole different directions.  Just read and enjoy!!
5	1396137600	This book started slow with the main character rambling on about things that I didn't think was important but hang in there it gets much much better.  It gets very exciting.  Murder, spies, and blackmail involving foreign countries with the main character running for his life.  There are lots of twist and turns.  Just when you think you have it figured out you are wrong.  I think anyone who loves a good mystery will enjoy reading this book.
3	1396137600	Interesting, but not the usual J. Patterson story...still not sure if I enjoyed it or not...hopefully Confessions wii be better.
3	1396051200	The story is excellent, it has all the earmarks of  great Patterson mystery but all the movie n TV references distracted from the story. GREAT twist .
3	1396051200	Usually his books are quick readers and I felt it was a good book but it seem to drag on w/the story
5	1396051200	Action packed and full of history.  Written well, with a great mix of humor and intrigue.Very entertaining.  A real page turner.Loved this book
4	1396051200	I always like James Patterson books with the twists a n d turns  but really enjoyed all the movie references and presidential history in this one
1	1395964800	This was a hard read, and really not worth the effort.  While there is lots of action in the book it's hard to following because the author mires the character in a great deal of sub-references material regarding his thoughts on movies, actors, presidents and other trivia that just aren't pertinent.  In the end these sub-references had no relevance to the story whatsoever so there was no payoff for the reader's persistence.
5	1395964800	always enjoy patterson books the plots are full of surprises and keep you  guessing to see what happens next with all actions
4	1395964800	I've read where some reviewers didn't like the main character. I liked his quirkiness. Made the book more interesting compared to so many books anymore that are just cookie cutter where you can guess who, what & where, way too soon.
5	1395964800	Once I started reading this book and got into the second chapter I was hooked.  I found it hard to put down.  But then I read just about everything that James Patterson writes.
5	1395964800	I wasn't sure about this book for the first few pages - Ben is a little weird. But then I really got into it and had trouble putting it down. Overall a great read, with some wonderful twists!
1	1395878400	just awful no wonder Patterson had to push this on tv---this was just awful--I read a few chapters and just gave up
4	1395878400	Loved the sense of humor of the main character. A enjoyable quick read. Patterson always writes aIively and entertaining mystery.
4	1395792000	It took me awhile to get into this book but in the end turned out to be excellent. Lots of twists and turns.
1	1395792000	Mistress is absolutely the WORSE James Patterson book I have ever read.  It was a total waste of money and upsets me that I actually bought it.  There is a very poor attempt at humor contained within this book and whether Patterson was responsible or Ellis was, it is not funny and the attempt at humor is irritating.
5	1395792000	MISTRESS by Patterson is one of those rare reads that "grabs" and holds your interest.  The story line, liberally sprinkled with amazing bits of Presidential and other trivia, leads the reader through an amazing cast of characters and events that generates a wide range of very strong emotions from love to hate to anger to fear and distress, etc.  As is usual for Patterson, the climax is breathtaking and startling!  Now that it is finished....WHAT shall I next read that could possibly compete with this?
2	1395705600	I had to finally shut the audio book off by chapter five. I couldn't keep up with the character's racing thoughts and obsessiveness with trivia and the motorcycle, and I like trivia, and motorcycles. The story simply wasn't resonating with me and I found myself nearly exhausted by chapter five.That being said, Patterson and Ellis obviously did a masterful job of detailing this character, because it's painful to step into the character's place and try to see the story through his eyes, and keep it in the proper perspective. The usual quality is there in the writing, in the descriptiveness, in the build-up for the scenes, but the first few chapters sound too much like publicity for Hollywood films or the rantings of a wanna-be movie critic. It's obvious that the authors wanted this character to be unique, and they certainly have accomplished that. I just don't see myself getting the rest of the way through this. Too challenging for me.
5	1395705600	I always have liked James Patterson books, but this one was especially compelling.The main character had a way of spilling out information, trivia, facts in a humorousway.  I wondered the whole book just what made him tick, so was glad toget some of the answers near the end.  An excellent read.
5	1395619200	I could not put it down. Read beginning to end in a few hours.  Absolutely fabulous as are all of Patterson books
5	1395619200	Excellent book!  It was hard to put the book down.  Always excitement and the ending is surprising.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and mystery.
4	1395532800	Something continuously different happens that keeps your mind churning with different scenarios. A great suspense thriller that made me feel what the story teller was going through.
5	1395446400	This a great read. Very entertaining . A story that could have come from today's world news headlines ~ Moochele and Barack....why are the Russians being allowed to grow their Soviet? Hmmmm....read and decide for yourself.
4	1395446400	Starts slow takes time to pick up the threads of the story but a few chapters down it it gets gripping , leaves one intrigued and racy and the it is so till the last page
5	1395446400	I love James Patterson. He grabs you from the start, and keeps on pulling until you are knee deep in his twisted visual mind.
1	1395446400	James Patterson at his worse!  Skip it.  First chapter was an attention grabber but it was downhill after that.  Save your cash.
2	1395360000	the rambling the main character did to himself, did not add to the story....almost predictable story line....not as bad as toys
4	1395360000	Good plot.  Too much daydreaming.  Too much presidential trivia.  Skip over that and it's a good read. Rent don't buy.
4	1395187200	I enjoyed the writing style -- a little different than the typical thriller.  Also enjoyed the humorous thoughts of the main character.
3	1395187200	Good but not my favorite. Too wordy for me.  I'm a nobody so who cares. Thanks for asking my opinion
5	1395187200	Loved it.... James Patterson is the best author ever~  I love all of his books.  Can't wait for the next one!
2	1395187200	I have read the majority of his books and I didn't enjoy this one. A little slow moving and I did not like how they wrote the main character
4	1395100800	It is a different mystery than he usually writes.  I do find that when there is another author involved things are different  but the mystery is still great.
3	1395100800	Boring in places.  All comments added nothing to the story  would have been a  good book w/o extra comments.  Take me off your list
3	1394841600	This novel begins with the death of a glamorous woman who turns out to have known quite a few secrets that she obtained through her liaisons with powerful men. The narrator is a sort of down-at-heels guy who was friends -- just friends -- with the mistress. I quit this one about a third of the way through. Just boring.
2	1394841600	Very erratic writing in my opinion. Main character felt like following the thoughts of a schizophrenic. Not my favorite Patterson novel glad it was loaned and not purchased.
2	1394668800	This was not up to his writing == Didn't like it at all !!  It was not at all something you could get interested in!1  Could not in any way live up to the advertising!!  I feel I wasted my money!!
2	1394582400	unfortunately, James Patterson isn't one of them. I remember reading a Stephen King article about his favorite writers and there King stated that he felt Patterson was not very good. Sad that this slug sells more novels than anyone else in the crime fiction field. Just strengthens my belief that no country supports mediocrity more than the good ol' USA.
3	1394582400	Did not like the movie references throughout story. Made reading a drag. It broke the flow of the actual story.
4	1394582400	I honestly had a hard time up until the second Half of the book, then it went into high gear and get a great book.
5	1394323200	In his usual style, James Patterson has produced a fast-paced, suspense filled mystery.  With lots of twists and turns, this mystery keeps you guessing.  He creates a very likeable main character.  If you want a fast read this is it.
3	1394323200	I don't usually read James Patterson novels, but this one intrigued me somehow. But after I bought it & started reading it I couldn't find the reason for it. I continued to read it, because that is how I am, thinking it has got to grab me some time. It never grabbed me. But then maybe if you're a James Patterson fan it might grab you. Don't let my review stop you.
4	1394236800	After reading the other reviews on this site I approached the book as if reading a new author.  With that mindset I found the book to be interesting.  While not deep and rambling at times it is certainly an entertaining read.  I would recommend this to others.  Just remember this does not read like a James Patterson book.
3	1394236800	Very fast pace book I liked the ending but had a hard time keeping track of the events not sure if I would re read
4	1394236800	I liked this book. It had so many twists and turns and the bad guides were caught.  It kept me reading and unable to put the book down until I finished the book.  I read it until my eyes were getting exhausted.  A GREAT BOOK. . . .
5	1394150400	I love Patterson and the authors he co-writes with seem to be a good match. I can truly say I have never read a back Patterson book and constantly watch for his books.
4	1394150400	Good book.  Made me want to pick it back up again and again to see what happens next.  Main subject is a little exhausting with his mind ramblings, but I was swept in and couldn't put it down!
5	1394064000	I love this character, so many twists and turns couldn't put it down!!!!!!!!! He's like MONK smart and witty, qwerky with a edge and a past and LOTS OF MONEY,
4	1394064000	Suspenseful, quick and engaging. Lots of current movie references, which I thought was neat. New to Patterson, will definitely keep looking for his work.
5	1393977600	This book kept you on edge til the end. loved loved loved it!!!!!!!! We love all of James Patterson books. It's like craving a candy bar.
3	1393977600	A good twisty-turny plot, fine action; being inside Ben's head gave me a headache.  A mediocre Patterson, however, is better than most others.
5	1393804800	Everyone should read a james patterson book, they would fall in love with his writing.  i have read every book he has written
5	1393632000	The best political thriller I have read in a really long time. Great Great Great!!!! Fast paced a lot of twists and turns.
1	1393372800	Worst book I have ever read  Usually I give books I have read to my husband to take to his work place, but this book I actually threw into the trash can.  Incredibly and annoying constant referrals to famous actors, movie and TV scenes it was painful to read. I can't believe Patterson would put his famous name on this book. Wish I could return it.
1	1393286400	this sounded like a book a would really like so I ordered it and  I only read a few pages and put it down never picked it up again it was that boring
3	1393200000	I expected something more than this.  No cliff hanger. Nothing suspenseful.  The story was good but needed a lot of something extra
5	1393200000	I purchased this book for my wife who loves all of the James Patterson mystery novels. She has already read this one and enjoyed it very much as I thought she would.
5	1393200000	One of the best books I have read. Once I started it was hard to put it down. Highly recommend!
5	1393200000	I really enjoyed this book.  It held my interest.  I liked the characters, they were believable.  I have most of his books enjoyed them all some more than others, this is I enjoyed more.  Very good read.
1	1393113600	I read 45 pages in about 4 minutes.  Dumbest reading I have ever done.  Very surprised and Patterson for writing such a bad book
4	1393113600	Mistress is a pretty good read. Don't expect this to be a thriller. It is a good narrative, though. Enjoy!
5	1393027200	LOVE JAMES PATTERSON'S BOOKS, VERY FEW I HAVE NOT ENJOYED.I EVEN SHARED IT WITH A FRIEND AND SHE LOVED IT TOO
1	1392940800	I love his books but this one was awful.  Hated the movie references all the time it got old after about the first 30 pages.  Very difficult to follow the plot with so much skipping around.
1	1392854400	I have always felt and believed that no group or committee or two people could come up with a work of art including music, art, or even great decisions.  However, I especially feel that no two or more people can write a good book....wonder how they get away with it.
2	1392854400	This must have been written mostly by Patterson's co-author. It was about the worst novel I've read with Patterson's name on the cover. James, if you can't maintain the quality give up the $ and stop churning out junk.
5	1392854400	I really enjoyed this book.  Very interesting and suspenseful. Great read for these long winter months.  I hope hisnext one is as good as this one. Would definitely recommend this!
3	1392681600	So much info in one book.  Almost made me think I was the one that was nuts.Real page TURNER.uhh
5	1392681600	We received this book as promised.  It is a very good read and I would highly recommend it to all of my friends.
5	1392681600	I didn't buy this earlier as some of the reviews said Patterson is &#34;losing it&#34; and cranking out too many books each year; all seemingly in the same pattern.  Frankly I thought this was quite different and a refreshing change.  I enjoyed the main character's  eccentricities, like his obsession with presidential trivia, etc.  The story itself was interesting and well woven.  I might even read it again!
1	1392681600	I have read almost All of James Patterson's books, so I didn't read the reviews for this one...........I should have.  This book was So Ridiculous!  After the first chapter, I almost threw it away but decided to wait and see if it would improve.  It Did NOT.  I skimmed over the ridiculous amount of 'movie' references and read this book in about 3 days.Other books..........Maxine Paetro is an Excellent author!  I look forward to more of hers!Mr. Patterson - wake up and cut this guy (David Ellis) loose........Edgar awards or anything else.......p.s.  your last three (3) Alex Cross novels were pretty poor, also.......
5	1392595200	I have read about half the book so far and I don't want to put it down. What a thriller.
5	1392422400	Of Patterson's novels!  So many twist and turns, ups and downs, never know where he may lead us next!  Absolutely great read!
4	1392336000	The book was pretty good but I really didn't understand the ending. I don't think they had been any James Patterson books I didn't enjoy reading, he's the best writer.
5	1392249600	Thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I  finished it in two days.  Ben, the main character was wonderful and I loved all the trivia he quoted throughout the book.  I had no clue as how it would end.  Enjoy! it's a great book.
5	1392249600	great writting. suspens and action. Patterson does it again. i love the way he writes. please sir may i have some more!
5	1392249600	Two stories in one never knew the end until I was there. Really keeps you reading.  Has a surprised ending for both stories.
5	1392163200	I have not finished this book yet.  I am 1/2 way through and still have no idea "Who Done It!" I love his books. Not sure how many I have read.  Almost all of them and enjoyed each one!
3	1392163200	good story. the only thing I didn't like was all the main character Ben,s trivia about former president,s and movie stars.
4	1392076800	This book is a good read as always for James Patterson, he never disappoints me which is why I purchase his books
5	1392076800	This book really keeps you guessing and trying to tie it all together.  It has an ending that is very worthy after the reading.
4	1392076800	Very interesting. Ran on to long. Strange turn of events that it ended up about a gay affair.  Ben fantasized slot.
5	1391990400	Great contemporary story joined together with movie titles and excerpts, wow those Chase scenes were intense and wild with authentic street names and Washington D C places of interest.
1	1391817600	I am shocked this has James Patterson's name on it.  Its written in 1st person.  I can't even finish the book I'm so annoyed.  I am stopping at chapter 33 and have to say that was a struggle, I just kept hoping it would improve.
3	1391817600	Liked the book.  A bit slow and predictable in places.A good read altogether. Look forward to the next edition.
4	1391817600	Good read and very entertaining. The story is typical Patterson. There is a lot of action. The sub plots are very interesting and unexpected. The ending is not a "they lived happily ever after" one and is a big surprise. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
3	1391817600	Good story but hard to stay focused. The story kept going off in to many directions to keep me involved.
5	1391817600	This was merely an okay read for me. I wouldn't recommend it  really didn't like all the celebrity quotes.  I found them confusing as well as annoying.
4	1391731200	well I just started reading the book and it is so far good. the book keeps your attentionand and when you get further into the book I'm sure you
1	1391731200	I read all of James Patterson's books. Until now I can honestly say that I have enjoyed every one.  But he should stick to his thrillers and mysteries. If I had known that this book was mainly an exercise for a trivia contest, I would never have bought it.  The plot, if you can call it that, is disjointed and overrun by the nonstop mental musings, trivia and ever present ramblings of the main character.  Worse book I've read by this author.
1	1391644800	Not the usual writing style...normally can't put one of James books down.  It did have a surprise twist at the end.
3	1391558400	I've read almost every James Patterson book out there and this one was not as good as I come to expect from him.  The story was somewhat hard to follow with who was selected to be the main character telling the story.
3	1391385600	A little hard to get into at first but a pretty good finish.  This didn't seem as exciting as some other Patterson books.
5	1391299200	This story kept me in suspense.  Could not wait to see what was going to happen next.  I love James Patterson books.
4	1391126400	I couldn't wait to get home from work to continue reading this book.  Totally didn't see where it was heading!
1	1391126400	The most boring JP book I have ever read and as a huge fan, I have read them all. Seems like he was just trying to meet a word count with all the annoying references to movies and actors! What's happened James?
5	1391040000	Enjoyed this Patterson better than most of his corroborations.Plot twists I never saw coming. I highly recommend this novel. Intense at times.
5	1390953600	I am a huge Patterson fan and I loved this book. This book has a lot of twist and turns but it kept me reading. I love the extra facts they did along the way. Its the kind of book where you think you have it figure out and then something happens and you see you are wrong and has you right back trying to figure it out again.  I couldn't put it down and needed to know what happened. I finished it in a couple of days.
2	1390953600	Peculiar - too much backward and forward - not relevant. I wasn't impressed with the plot.  I was very disappointed.
4	1390867200	I liked it!  It was a fast read and kept my interest.  The reason for only three stars is I didn't like when he referenced movie plots in the narrative.  All it did was ad words to the script.
5	1390867200	Moves fast...good twists and turns!! A really good ending...answers all the questions! Couldn't out it down until I was done!
1	1390867200	For a James Paterson book - worst I have ever read - waste of money! Would not recommend to a friend...
1	1390867200	Although I am generally a Patterson fan, I found this book very irritating to read and stopped about half way through. It took forever to get into the book and figure out what was going on, and then because you don't have any background on the players in the book, you don't develop any kind of feelings toward any of them.Couple that with the irritation of the main character's stupid and continual mental comparisons to movie trivia and presidential trivia, and it seems like you're jumping on and off a train rather than simply riding along. Very disappointing for me.
1	1390780800	Did not hold my interest. Would not recommend to James Patterson fans. Not enough storyline & too much small talk/thoughts.
1	1390694400	This was a disappointing read. The constant references to movies was distracting and had nothing to do with the story line. I did not like the book at all and considered discontinuing the read. I hope the next Patterson/Ellis book is better.
5	1390694400	Excellent read!!!  Couldn't put it down!!  Explosive and a real page turner!!  Many layers to this book!!  Love Ben!  Awesome
5	1390521600	This book is a great combination of mystery and suspense.  Recommended to all Patterson fans as well as mystery and suspense readers.
5	1390521600	It was hard to put it down.  Keeps one guessing and I wish there was a sequel.  A very unpredictable ending
2	1390521600	I don't feel this book was one of Patterson's better works.  If I hadn't  bought it, I probablywouldn't have read it all the way through.
2	1390521600	I found the book to be slow and boring. One of those books that it takes you the longest to finish reading it.
1	1390435200	I seldom write reviews and, up until this point, have had James Patterson on my &#34;top authors&#34; list. Now, post &#34;Mistress&#34; I felt compelled to provide some feedback: This is a terrible book . . . the protagonist is narcissistic to the max and the POV (point of view) and tense all screwed up. Re plot, I never knew what was coming next . . . just like digging in a stranger's trash can &#60;g&#62;. Patterson has vacated the ethics of publication and authorship. No more Patterson for me!
1	1390435200	The worst James Patterson book I have ever read could not be bothered finishing it. Would not. Recomend to anyone
2	1390348800	I'm slowly working my way through James Patterson's catalog and started this book.  I'm on chapter 18 and I have a huge WTH? on my face.  It was so bad, I had to came on amazon to read the reviews regarding this book and quickly learned I am not alone. I should have checked the reviews prior to getting the book, but Patterson's name was on it, so I just assumed it'd be good.  Won't make that mistake again. I don't usually write reviews, because everything I need to say has usually be said by someone else, better.  I just feel compelled to let people know that this book (well I can only speak up to chapter 18) is filled with ramblings, trivia nonsense and pure gibberish.  I'm certain if you've compiled the actual plot that's happened so far, it'd be a total of 1.5 chapters.  I absolutely hate starting things and not finishing, so I really am going to try and finish this book, but it will be painful.  If you are like me, I recommend that you don't start it at all.  Skip this one and go to one of his excellent other non series books like Now You See Her.
3	1390348800	It was a  exciting  start  but  it has  dragged on.  I thought it would  be more 'steamy&#34;,  sexy...  not that way at all.
4	1390348800	Very fun and engaging read. Definitely keeps your attention. Great for reading on vacation. I would definitely recommend this book.
5	1390348800	James Patterson never disappoints ..... This was as amazing as I figured it would be!!  I can't wait for the next one!!
5	1390262400	I don't read all of his books but thought this was a good one to recommend.  Was a fast read.
4	1390089600	I haven't read this book yet but how can you o wrong with James Partterson I love reading all his books
5	1390089600	How does James Patterson think of these things?!?!  This was a DEFINITE page turner!! Page after page you never knew what was coming next!!You will love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	1390089600	As always James Patterson came through with another good book.  I believe this author is very hard to beat.  As soon as a new one is released I purchase it.  If you have not already read this one I recommend it for some good reading.
5	1390003200	The store starts slow but you get to know the main character in depth and feel his emotions and pain.
3	1390003200	Still haven't finished it - it just does not hold my interest - I think I have read too many Patterson books.
3	1389830400	Story was good, but diluted by frequent referrals to Hollywood actors and movies.Disconcerting to follow story line for me.
2	1389830400	Not one of his better books. Over time he has kept you on edge with suspense this one fell short. You can only hope the next ones are better
3	1389744000	The plot was basically good but the movie quotes were an unnecessary distraction and a waste of many pages.  Will carefully check future books co-written by David Ellis.  This work discredited James Patterson
3	1389744000	This book was not as good as his other books but I read it and half way  though it it became interesting.
3	1389657600	Not one of his bestI have read a of his books but this one le cold. But I will continue to read mr. Patterson
4	1389657600	I really like this book.  When you start reading you have no clue where it is going to lead you.  It is a totally new concept for a political mystery and one get realize it is unusual you can't it down.  A good job Mr. Patterson as with all of his books I have read.
1	1389571200	He would get my interest and then compare the situation to a movie or play and go on and on until my interest was gone and so was the story.....Sorry
4	1389571200	I'm glad I don't go by reviews or I would never have read this one. I'm glad I did though. Rarely does a Patterson thriller disappoint, even if it's co-authored. I really liked the protagonist and his obsession with trivia and movies. From a first person perspective he was very likeable. I found this thriller to be very entertaining to say the least. Good job!
5	1389571200	Interesting book; one of his best.  Nice hardback book for a low price.  Gift for daughter in law, but I asked to read it after she does.
4	1389484800	I really liked the short chapters.  This allowed me to pick it up when time was sparse and complete a chapter or two and move on to other things.  The story was well written and had enough suspense to keep my attention to find out what happens next.  I'd recommend this book to anyone already familiar with the author or anyone looking for good action and the suspense of whether the main character survives to the end or not.
5	1389398400	Love the main character and how he gets out of the dilemmas he gets into!  Suspenseful and small twist at the end.
2	1389312000	Once I started reading James Patterson I couldn't stop.  I have read a lot of the Alex Cross series, Women's Murder Club, and some Michael Bennett.  I LOVED them ALL.  I do like the books he has co-written with Maxine Paetro.  This book was a complete struggle to get through.  I got this book on CD and listened to it while driving.  The narrator's voice was so annoying and you really think he is a nut job.  It is his story throughout the whole book.  DEFINITELY NOT worth the time to invest in this one!  Sorry Mr. Patterson, this one is a MISS!
5	1389312000	I was full of "what in the world is going on?"  for the entire tale.Well said and full of suspense. SuperKicker@72.
3	1389312000	This is not the best James Patterson book that I have read.  Maybe he is churning them out too fast?
3	1389312000	Not as good as I was anticipating James Patterson's novels, when he uses a co-author are not written very well. I think it is all about the money, for James Patterson, these days. Too bad. He was such a good author.
4	1389312000	Liked some of his other books more.  Too much trivia.  PreferAlex Cross and Michael Bennett stories more.  I really do like his writing.
3	1389312000	So fast and so wild!  The references to movies were sheer genius  unlike any other Patterson I ve read. Fun.
1	1389312000	One of the most boring books ever.  I usually love James Patterson books so it must be his co-author David Ellis who wrote this so badly.  I will never read a book by David Ellis.
5	1389225600	this book was a gift,the person i got it for said it was another great book by j.p.,seems like a pattern.
5	1389139200	Enjoyed this book.  Lots of action.  I would recommend reading it.  Lots going on and a lot of action in this book.
2	1389139200	Patterson has written much better. I enjoy his Alex Cross  and the girls(detective, lawyer and coroner) etc.I usually finish his books in 4 hours, I really didn't care if I finished but I did.
5	1389052800	I loved all the twist and turns . I figure out most mysteries before the end ,but not in this one!!!! Great!!
5	1389052800	Great book.  Loved it.  Great read!!!  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.  It will keep you hooked!!
1	1388793600	I love James Patterson books and have read them for years, but this was a mess!  I read 8 chapters and could not believe what I was reading.  I could not understand the relation to movies and movie quotes. They became annoying to the story line. I finally decided to go back and read the reviews on this book. I soon realized I was not alone in my assessment of this book. I did not waste my time any longer hoping it would get &#34;better.&#34;  I am moving on and never buying another co-authored James Patterson book!
4	1388793600	Starts out slow.  Once you get into it, it is hard to put down. Would have given it 5 stars but I didn't like the references to movies.
5	1388793600	Go figure.  I rather enjoyed the story line and don't understand why my friend who also lives for his books to come out can't get into it.  I think she's just getting old and senile or something. Maybe she was dropped on her head recently.  Good book and recommended.
5	1388707200	Not sure what to say except this was great and well made and exactly what i wanted.  Loved th item, with quick delivery and payment
5	1388707200	I love James Patterson books and this book was fantastic! Before purchasing it, I read several of the reviews and was surprised at the number of negative reviews. This book was packed with action and mystery and had me continuously muttering, "What the heck!" Patterson and his co-authors do a fabulous job of developing the characters in the story, to the point that I feel as if I know them personally, and of grabbing the readers full attention from the very first page.
2	1388707200	The slowest Patterson book I've ever read!!! It took me an extremely long time to finish this book. I almost scraped it before the end.
4	1388620800	I always enjoy James Patterson and have read everything he has written and co-written.  Great twists in this story. Could not put it down. The only down side are the movie quotes and references. this book could do without those trivia.
5	1388620800	This is a great &#34;read&#34; and was thoroughly enjoyable on a long road trip.  James Patterson (and his crew of support writers) did it again!
5	1388534400	From the very beginning right down to the end this book kept my curiosity peaked. Normally at the end of his books I'm left wondering  what will ever happen to the hero... this time I believe that the hero will be just fine. Loved the extra info about the movie and president while it could be a little distracting, it added to the suspense.
5	1388448000	Never wanted it to end!  Great story!  Ending is total surprise,  Excellent read.  Highly recommend for suspense lovers.  Does not disappoint.
5	1388448000	This is my first time reading a James Patterson book and I will definitely be back for more. It kept me on the edge the whole time.
5	1388361600	The who, what, and where was kept in the dark in this love story.  Many twists and turns left my mind racing to finish and determine the who, what and where.  Several surprises here.
1	1388275200	IIT WAS A STUPID BOOK I WILL NOT ORDER ANY MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS  I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND I AM TRIED OF WRITING A REVIEW SO THE SAME GOES FOR CON FESSION OF MURDER SUPECT
4	1388275200	Very fast paced well written lots of intrigue keeps you guessing page after page read it in 2 days x
5	1388016000	This book engages the reader from page one.....you become totally invested in the welfare of the main character.  Many twists and turns.
3	1387929600	It moved right along although the side tracked way the hero thought was distracting. I still liked the story. Lots of twists in the plot.
2	1387843200	Did not finish as I was very bored with the chase.  I guess I'm a British mystery fan.  Just not my read.
5	1387843200	My first Patterson book.  Hard to put down. Entertaining. Great mystery. I am eager to read more of James Patterson.
1	1387756800	and would like to have a refund.  I read the first two chapters and couldn't go any further.  I deleted it from my Kindle.. Terrible!!!
3	1387670400	Too much empty dialogue and the story takes too long too take off. I had to skip through the inconsequential diatribe to keep to the story.
2	1387584000	This is definitely not one of James Patterson's better books. It took me forever to read it because it just didn't keep my interest. I'm not a fan of the books that are co-authored -Patterson is better on his own.
1	1387497600	Such poor writing could James Patterson really have signed off on this? Sorry I spent the money. Next time I'll read the reviews before purchasing.
5	1387497600	This book is a little different from other James Patterson books, but it was a page turner. I really enjoyed reading it
4	1387411200	James Patterson is one of my favorite authors.  He keeps coming up with unique twists and turns, but keeps you want to keep reading without stopping.  Liked the book very much.
5	1387324800	The twists and turns always surprised and thrilled!  Never a disappointing story teller!  Thanks once again for a great adventure!kelly a. smith
1	1387324800	I read about 25 pages and found it tooooo boring to continue. Very disappointing because I usually enjoy James Patterson's books, even though I doubt if he ever writes a whole book. But generally a book with his name listed as the author is entertaining and a good read. But not this time!
5	1387238400	I don't recall Patterson writing an entire book in the first person previously.  The character was very humorous but took too many risks.
5	1387238400	James Patterson is one of my favorite authors!!  Although there are a few books of his that I had a hard time getting into, this one wasn't one of them!
2	1387238400	This one is ok but not up to par with what I am used to from James Patterson novels. You get spoiled by the great stories and it is obvious from the start this one is not one of the great ones.
3	1387238400	Didnt want to even finish this book which is something I never do. Boring, boring, boring. Glad I ordered the last Patterson book as it restored my faith in Paterson.
5	1387238400	I can't really say too much about the book as I haven't had time to read it but I am sure I will like it . What I really liked was the condition it was in for a used book. I got another one  thru the same people and the condition was excellent also.
5	1387152000	Whats not to love about this book?. It has everything: a brilliant reporter who is an average person with no special self defense skills., nail biting suspense,. sarcastic humor,,, great characterizations,, a dizzying plot,,, a mystery that keeps you guessing until the end. it would make a great movie.
1	1387152000	Just figured I'd add my opinion of this book to the cacophony of people who disliked it.I got the audio version of it from my local library and just finished it. The writing style led me to believe that it might've been an abridged version, but was shocked after the fact to discover it was in fact unabridged.For me, the book starts off on the wrong foot the second the narrator/protagonist is introduced. I found him wholly annoying, mainly due to his incessant movie references and presidential trivia. For audiobook 'readers', it was quite difficult to figure out what thoughts were going through his head and what he was speaking.As it's an audiobook, I made it all the way through mainly because I was curious as to see how all the loose ends were tied up. And it left me equally unsatisfied.This was my first Patterson book and I doubt I'll bother with any of his others.
5	1387065600	Again he grabs you from page one and hold you in his grip til the end.  Can't get enough of his books
3	1387065600	This was my first book by him. While I liked the book it wasn't a page turner for me, but it wasn't a bad book.
3	1386720000	Not his best. I think the quality of his books have gone down since his collaboration with other authors. The stories seem inferior to his previous work.
2	1386633600	In general I am on the edge of my seat and engaged in each of the James Patterson's books I have read.  This one did not do it for me.....maybe because it was written in the first person.Although I finished it.....I can not recommend it.
5	1386633600	This was an absolute page turner. I couldn't wait to turn the page. Each new page brought more an more excitement an intrigue. A great read!
1	1386374400	I took the advice of another reviewer and borrowed it from the library. Thankfully! If i had spent a dollar on this, it would have been too much! The others tell you the plot so I won't but suffice it to say it was one of his worst!
4	1386374400	I've been reading James Patterson for many many years probably have read 50 of his books. I must admit they're starting to be very similar  and not as intriguing as they use to be.
3	1386374400	Mistress, with all its danger and deceit, reads more like a political type thriller with espionage overtones, rather than the usual suspense platform that Patterson and his co-writers &#8211; in this case, David Ellis &#8211; undertake. The protagonist featured in Mistress is none other than, Benjamin Casper the wealthy owner of Capital Beat, an Internet newspaper.Benjamin&#8217;s seemingly mundane world is suddenly turned upside down and he is thrust into a hellish nightmare of danger after his beloved friend Diana Hotchkiss, a senior Capitol Hill staffer plummets to her death.You can read the full review, [...]Mistress is not necessarily a must read and probably won&#8217;t keep you on the edge of your seat. However, there are so many twists and turns that will keep you fascinated in the story, you just may not be able to put the book down.Rating: 3.5 stars
2	1386374400	i do not Patterson any moreHe hires others to write to the thousands of books he turns our ever year.
5	1386288000	James Patterson never disappoints. This book definitely keeps you guessing. I liked it so much, I passed on as a gift.
4	1386288000	I enjoyed reading this book. Different from other James Patterson books but different is sometimes good. I would recommend to others
5	1386115200	Couldn't wait for free time to read this book!  Different than other Patterson books, but definitely kept my interest.  I truly cared about the character.
1	1385942400	I agree with everyone else on how awful this book was.  First it starts off with a bunch of rantings that make you want to pull your hair out and for me that is tough as I am already bald!  Then it jumps around with this guy suddenly able to pretty much walk on water as he avoids death at every turn and yet somehow is able to get information no other person outside of the government would be able to gather.  The best part is Benjamin gains all of this knowledge by having the reader just turn the page and it is amazing!  You begin to think to yourself &#34;did I miss something&#34; so you go back and look and nope he went from knowing nothing at the bottom of the previous page to knowing everything on the next.  An example is the fact he didn't even know the Russians were in the book and suddenly he knows everything about those involved and then 200 pages later we meet the Russian History Professor who happily confirms everything he figured out on his own!  I am saddened that James Patterson continues to be out for volume and dollars instead of accolades for excellent writing!
3	1385942400	I gave the book 3 stars because while it peaked my curiosity I thought it was slow moving and not as thrilling as most of the author's books.
5	1385856000	This is my first James Patterson book, not my last.  The book grips the reader immediately!!  I am 1/3 the was through and can't wait to continue reading
3	1385769600	Book dragged a bit compared to other James Patterson books.  Enjoyed the different twists with presidential and movie trivia  some good twists with a few predictable
3	1385769600	Story was excellent. I personally didn't care for the main characters play on presidential trivia. Deviated from the whole story
4	1385683200	Usually I don't have a hard time getting into Patterson'sbooks. I was having a hard time, but as I read on it drew me in.  I have read all of his books.  This one really had you guessing  until the end.  I even suggested that my daughter read it.
5	1385683200	Another fantastic book by James Patterson.  I purchased this book just because it was written by James Patterson and have not been disappointed yet.
5	1385596800	Great read and keeps you wanting to not put it down. The story gets more and more interesting with many new twists and turns to the plot. Highly recommended for those who love good mysteries
3	1385424000	Review of Mistress by James PattersonIts not like the pattersons I have read.  Couldn't keep my attention.  It sounded like the hero was a nutcase.
2	1385424000	Just my humble opinion, but this was too far off from Mr. Paterson's norm!! It was too hard to read to enjoy. The overall plot was good, but this particular first person narration did not do it for me.
4	1385424000	It&#8217;s been a while since I have read a James Patterson book and even when I finished reading this novel, I had a hard time believing I had just finished a James Patterson book as the storyline was so quirky for him.  It was almost humorous, offbeat and I found myself chuckling to myself as the main character Ben, flirts through the city dodging the many individuals who want to see him dead.  Ben, this fixated, high-energy character put smiles on my face, as his obsessive behavior and his forte for movies and trivia filled his mind and the pages I was reading.  Need to know something about a movie or a presidential official, Ben is your man.  Ben owns an internet newspaper but he has connections as he used to be a reporter.  Ben thought he knew everything about Diane until her body is found outside her high-rise apartment, how she fell off her balcony becomes Ben&#8217;s new obsession.  Things just don&#8217;t add up and when he is threatened to step aside, Ben steps up this investigation.  It&#8217;s not simple, is it ever.  It&#8217;s a cast load of characters as it seems like everyone got in on the action.  Car chases, bike getaways, Secret Service agents, assassins, the police and CIA, the President and a variety of foreign individuals.  The pages turned fast and the story was high- tempo so be ready, just don&#8217;t expect a James Patterson novel.
5	1385424000	I have only read a few books by Patterson and like the others, I loved it. Every time I thought I figured out something, I was wrong. That, to me, is a fantastically written book. I read a lot of crime books and am able to figure out events before revealed quite often. Which, to say the least, I do not enjoy. A must read if you love crime and murder mystery books.
3	1385337600	I was quite disappointed in this book.  Being a huge Patterson fan, it wasn't what I expected at all.  I read the first 50+ pages, was ready to put it down (return it to the library), then I read another book, and after that decided to pick it up again.  It was an okay story line, but the ongoing back-and-forth banter with the main character's thoughts was very distracting.  If that alone was eliminated, the story line would have been easier to follow.  I also think that  dark secrets of US presidents is an overused topic in books unless it involves real-life espionage and not out-of-the-closet sex secrets.
2	1385251200	I like his writing but I know little about movies and actors or actresses so much was lost on me. Plot was great.
1	1385251200	I've read every James Patterson book and this is the worst.  Been reading since it was newly released and still not 1/2 way done.  Only read it if i can find absolutely nothing else to do :-(
5	1385251200	Took a couple chapters to get used to the way I was in the characters head.....then I felt everything the character was feeling.  Twists to the end.  Quite enjoyed.
5	1385251200	I actually enjoyed it.  There were a number of negative reviews that kept me from buying this book earlier.  However, I thought it was interesting.  Enjoyed the style of Ellis and Patterson.  Like with all books, read a mixture of them before deciding.  You never know how you will feel.  Great read!
4	1385164800	Very interesting manner in which it was written - I enjoyed it.  It had a twist I did not expect.
1	1385078400	I have read everyone of James Patterson books and this was the worse.  I just couldn't wait for it to end.
3	1385078400	I generally &#34;love&#34; reading James Patterson, but this one is not in my top 25.  It would get intriguing and then it would go off on a tangent from some movie, etc !!!!  Too much &#34;babbling&#34;.
5	1385078400	Oh my gosh, this book keeps you on your toes from the very beginning! Excellent, excellent book! I will be reading more of James Patterson
1	1384387200	very confusing. could not stay focus, did not finish book,normally i love james patterson. but some of his books lately leave alot to be disire.
3	1384300800	This was not my favorite James Patterson book.  I guess three stars is a gift.  I will look for his next book and try again.
1	1384300800	i did not enjoy this audio book at all..i expected better from this author.soo sad.didnt even finish it
5	1384300800	I love anything and everything by James Patterson. I feel this book was one of his best. I highly recommend it.
3	1384300800	All the reference to movies, actors, presidents, to me, took away from the story.  James Patterson seemed like he was trying to fill in voids in this book.
5	1384214400	Enjoyable reading with an unexpected twist at the end. As usual great book by this author. Would recommend it to Patterson fans
4	1384214400	Always a good read. Patterson&#34;s books are easy to read and move along very quickly. So I cannot wait to turn the next page.
4	1383955200	I loved the book but found bouncing between thoughts often confusing.  I would recommend it to any mystery lover and have.
3	1383868800	I just couldn't keep interested in it. Not the usual &#34; I can't put down,&#34; from Mr. Patterson.Looking forward to his next book though.
5	1383868800	Good book twist for jp I give it five stars never saw the end coming good do a series with Ben Casper
5	1383868800	page turner, sort of like reading Kerouac at times. great twists and turns. very entertaining and different from his other books.
5	1383868800	I love James patterson's books.  They always have a great story.  I started reading Max ride.  After this series i washooked.
3	1383782400	I was slightly disappointed in this book. I seemed to be written in the third party at times and I had a hard time keeping interested. I normally can get through one of Mr. Patterson's  books in just a few days this one took me 3  weeks.
4	1383782400	Last week, I was told to go read James Patterson if I wanted to see what the market wants these days.  I picked this one up because it's fairly recent and sounded interesting.  Well . . . this book restored my faith in writers!  So many books are vanilla with no voice and have characters whose IQs are around room temperature at best.  This one is full of voice.  The writer has style!  I rejoiced at the writer being allowed to let his character have a real and different personality!The many, MANY reviews from angry Patterson regulars are understandable.  They do not want anything different from what Patterson is trusted to give them.  They likely can't comprehend or enjoy a character who is different.  This hero is nothing like the Alpha Hero type.  This character is damaged and gets distracted by his huge internal knowledge base about movies, Presidential trivia, and so forth.  I am like that (except that I don't allow myself to get distracted in stressful situations--what I mean is that my internal monologue is something like this character's on occasion, and funny to boot) and I can identify with someone who is not mainstream.  The mainstream characters who constantly stream thoughts of nothing but sex or money or how sad they are (and so forth) bore me.  This character interested and intrigued me from the beginning!However, I do not recommend that Patterson fans, and Vince Flynn fans, and all the other people who do not appreciate subtext and basically just want to read the surface story for its action, waste their time with this one, because it will only make them angry. And pleasure reading is supposed to make us happy and let us escape to enjoy a bit of vicarious sex, drugs, and rock and roll!  So just allow the book to go to someone else who might like this sort of story better.Now for a couple of plot spoilery things.  I was hooked when the first few events took place because they were nonstandard.  thought the plot ran along very creatively until about a third of the way through. Then the author started to have to explain some of the crazy stuff that had been going on, and it became more of a standard thriller.  (The protagonist even forgot to do his digressions as often.)  It all became more dependent on my suspension of disbelief.  Then when the hero *SPOILER ALERT* got hold of a certain laptop only to wipe out on his motorcycle and destroy it JUST BECAUSE THE SCRIPT SAID SO, it really jumped the shark for me.  That was a cheap and too-easy way to keep him from finding out the info on the laptop that he needed to know.  It could have been done more creatively.  For instance, I would've had him get mugged by some lowlife who would take the laptop and run off, and the hero would have been scouring pawnshops and college campuses and Craigslist to find where it went and if he could recover the data.  Much funnier and not just a "coincidence/accident" deal.  I mean, if the Russkies had run him off the road, it would have been better, but he just laid the bike down for no reason but dumbth.  Ack.ANYhow, from that point on, I felt Mr. Patterson's hand in the cauldron and the book got FAR more typical of an over-the-top sort of thriller.  Another reviewer mentioned that the chase scene with machine guns going down in front of the White House with no one noticing for a long time broke his suspenders of disbelief.  I would say that from THERE on, the book was just standard stuff.  I will also say that the hero WOULD NOT get to talk to the U. S. President alone in a room!!  Where is the Secret Service?  This would NOT happen. Jumping the shark a little bit, are we?  If we're playing along to see how it ends, though, we can pretend and allow this bit of fancy.  Or not.  I did appreciate the explanation of what had made the hero so messed up (which came at the very, VERY ending and was cool.)But I really enjoyed that first third or so of the book, saturated with and filtered through the interesting new personality who was kind of Sheldon Cooper-ish.  Readers who did not figure out that the digressions were supposed to be indicative of a personality disorder or damaged mind on the part of the hero are not thinking, IMHO!  You should have realized that!  Writing that you didn't understand why the hero was doing that . . . hmm.  Think, people!  It was pretty obvious, really.  And it's perfectly OK if you don't like that.  Say you don't like it.  But please tell me you knew what the author was doing.  I really appreciated the editors trusting the readers to know what that meant.  It put things on a higher level than the typical crash-bang-boom, wham-bam-ma'am stuff.Plus I always love trivia questions.  I learn a lot of oddities that way.So the bottom line here is--if you are a hardcore Patterson/Flynn person, you will not like this one.  The prose in a typical thriller is workmanlike and the characters are flat (compared to what I'm used to), and the focus is on the action of the PLOT.  This book is different.  However, if you want something that is not just like everything else on the shelves but is still familiar enough to be satisfying, you might try this one.I'd download the sample or do the "Look Inside" to see if I liked the style of the book first. That is going to be the deal-breaker for many readers.  That way, you don't waste much time if you aren't in the group who likes this sort of book!The downside for me is that I still did not find out what the market wants in terms of Patterson/Flynn sort of writing in thrillers, so I'll have to go find another book to typify what the market likes best.  Oh, well!Have fun out there and keep reading, whichever kind of reader you are.  We're all in this together, print fans!
5	1383782400	Edge of your seat thriller keeps you guess a great read you don't want to put down! A must read!
2	1383696000	Half of the book is irrelevant. The main character, Ben,  wastes the reader's time by filling the pages with presidents and movies trivia. The plot is illogical, Ben makes very incredible decisions.  I had to check the author's name several times, it does not read like a Patterson book. I believe someone other than Patterson wrote this less than mediocre book, very disappointing.
1	1383696000	Sorry, this book was just not that good.  The main character is so annoying.  The whole book is written like someone directly telling you their encounter getting off subject and all.  Movie quotes and presidential trivia constantly interrupting the storyline.  I kept thinking they were going to finally explain that this story is being told by someone with  Aspergers.  No such luck.  Don't waste your money, if you feel like this is a must read just go to the library and you will find out for free. :(
3	1383696000	Full disclosure - I listened to the audio version, excellent reader.Things I liked about the book - the narrator's continuous movie references and the presidential trivia that he kept referring to. Others may find that annoying, but being a mild movie buff, I liked it. Even tried to alphabetize the presidents by last name myself. Left out five of them. Also liked the way that the narrator got off track when he should be concentrating on stuff. Oops. Did not annoy me.So the book is basically about a dweeb that gets involved in a situation that ultimately leads him through the corridors of power, and he alone can save the world from a nasty plot. Sound familiar?Anyway, I lost all credibility with the story when - mild spoiler ahead - a powerful foreign government has men in a black Mercedes  chase our hero through the streets of Washington DC in broad daylight with a machine gun close to the White House! Really?? Could someone really be that stupid??I checked out the audio version from the library so my cost was nil. Anyone that feels they must read anything written/co-written by Patterson should do likewise. My review would be harsher had I spent money on the book.
1	1383609600	Mr Patterson what were you thinking when you wrote this book. I can only imagine that you were suffering a brain freeze or was it all by the co-author. The storyline and plot was good only to be destroyed by the endless references to film's and actors involving almost every film ever made to say the very least were distracting and non-productive to the story especially to those of us readers who are not film buffs or avid viewers. If Alex, Lindsay &co or Michael start having these useless thoughts I will have no choice but to move you form the no. 1  spot as my favourite authors. Please Please please take a break and give your head a rest and get back to your usual writing. Let Ben disappear into his now found freedom only to be happy and silent never to enter your thoughts or bother you again.
5	1383609600	I don't even want to imagine not being able to look forward to the next James Patterson novel. Another can't put it down novel.
4	1383609600	Interesting main subject and believable characters, well written story line and enjoyable read. Would recommend this captivating book to anyone.
2	1383523200	Not up to his usual standards.  Very hard to read and follow.  Characters not easy to like or dislike.  Boring
5	1383350400	james Patterson writes good books,they grab you and take you on wild ride.this book mistress is very good story.what I like about this book is you don't figure out what is going and why til the end.cant go wrong buying mistress.
5	1383350400	This is a very exciting book. It is suspense throughout. It is very well written. It also has a lot of information about American movies. It is also different than most similar stories in that the defenseless hero did not have a strong arm macho former special forces man at his side. The book is hard to put down. Five stars.
4	1383264000	I chose the 4 star rating because of my preference for  action/adventure type novels. This book maintains a fast pace with constantly changing situations to keep your interest. I did not. Care much for the frequent cutesy movies references ala Tony Dinozzio (N IS).Definitely recommend.Leroy@fastener.com
5	1383264000	Great story, great action, great opportunity to learn about one's self.New twists and turns every chapter.Would make a great movie.
5	1383264000	Not what I expected but fast paced and interesting. I liked the ending and explanations. One of his best books.
4	1383177600	I LUV James Patterson so of course I think this is a good book.  It was very different from anything I've read of his
5	1383091200	He is my favorite author and has before I have read all of his books.  This was good read and some interesting developments.
4	1383091200	Well written with multiple sub plots.  Unique mental perspectivs of main character. Multiple twist and turns require close attention to story line
5	1383091200	I'm a James Patterson fan so I'm drawn to his books.  This one gets more interesting with every page and even has some Stephen King type moments where you're scared to keep reading.  But somehow the hero is still alive and I'm on Chapter 41.  Doesn't disappoint.
4	1383091200	This book is non-stop go, go, go! Never a dull moment.As always liking forward to James Patterson's next book to come out.
4	1383091200	Not as riveting as some other novels by this author, but gained momentum. I ended up really enjoying it. Give it a shot.
3	1383004800	I didn't think the book was as good as some of his others.  It was okay but I wouldn't highly recommend it.
4	1383004800	This book was a good read.  Love how James Patterson throws in the trivia stuff, loved the Ben Casper character, along with all the intrigue.  Kept me guessing!
4	1383004800	It took awhile to begin feeling the avid enjoyment that most often occurs when reading a Patterson novel, but once hooked it was hard to put down. Keep them coming!
1	1382918400	Did not like all the &#34;fluff&#34; to much descriptive and weak plot.  Skipped over a lot of it of the text.  Not one of Patterson's better works.
5	1382918400	I have read almost all of James Pattersons books. He is one of my favorite authors. This book kept me guessing.  Took till the end before I figured it out.
1	1382918400	Returning this to the library today....was so excited when I got my hands on the latest Patterson novel, but this one bored me to tears so badly, I could barely get through the first few chapters.MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.
3	1382918400	Too much referral to old movies. It sometimes broke the train of thought or you stopped to see if you remember that movie
4	1382918400	Lots of action and very exciting.  A little confusing with all the Russians and spy stuff and a little hard to follow who did what to who.  But overall its a good read.
4	1382832000	It was very good just not Mr. Patterson's usual weighting. It kept me wanting to read it just to figure out how he was going to get out of the mess he was in.
4	1382832000	This was not the usual Patterson novel, but it held my attention.  When I first started reading it, I could not figure out why the character kept talking about different things, which I thought were not related to the story,  but later I got deep in reading and disregarded the zany things he was talking about.  The story held me right to the end, which I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to finish.  I have to admit that Patterson is my favorite author and I don't find many of his books that don't hold my interest all the way through and this one was no exception.
1	1382832000	Worst book ever read. I am a huge Patterson fan. This book did not read like a Patterson writing. The constant movie references were exhausting. If I wanted a movie I would have gone to Redbox. I want a refund.
5	1382745600	Patterson again weaves a plot to blackmail the President, a tape to blackmail him by the Russians and the Chinese who want the Russian yo fail,Wonderful characters. Both good and bad! Could not put it down! Patterson at his fun best
2	1382745600	I liked the way the movie thoughts and presidents were incorporated, but I disliked the overall story. Patterson usually does so much better.
1	1382745600	I have most of james pattersons novels and have enjoyed most of them until this thing came out. If I were james Patterson I would be ashamed to put my name on it. I returned the book after 20 chapters. P U
3	1382745600	A little misleading about content.  Obviously most of it was not written by Patterson--has a bit more humor (not funny humor though) and references to movies and songs along the lines of the Corey character in Nelson DeMille books which have not appeared in prior books although it is almost impossible to keep up with all is books currently on the market.. Time for Patterson to put his name second as author on the almost weekly publications his mill turns out although that would probably affect sales and profits.
5	1382745600	This book starts out kind of slow and then progresses into a really good on the edge of your seat book. I would've never guessed the ending.
2	1382659200	Did not enjoy all the movie rambling.  This is not what I have come to expect from a Patterson book - and I have read them ALL.
4	1382659200	This book kept me entertained the whole way thru. Enjoyed it very much, as I have enjoyed all Patterson books.
1	1382659200	I did not enjoy this book at all - It was too long and found the main character infantile.  Did not appreciate how he kept bringing in thoughts of past films he had seen, this did nothing for the plot.  Least favourite of James Patterson
5	1382659200	I love anything James Patterson writes. This book was very good just like all his other ones, There is not much you can say about him other then he is fantastic and I have read everyone of his books.
2	1382659200	Not a favorite.  This took me longer to read than most Patterson books do.  It had excitement and an interesting ending, but it just didn't &#34;capture&#34; me right from the beginning.
4	1382572800	I had a hard time getting into the story because of the stream of comciousness narrative from the principal character which I found distracting. There was just enough intrigue to keep me engaged and the back half was a spellbinder. I ended up reading the last 25% of the book in one session because I couldn't put it down. Very interesting and very current. For me, this was a very different style than I am used to with James Patterson. My advice to readers is to stay with it-its hard to get into but worth it in the end.
4	1382572800	I had a hard time getting into the book.  However I liked it. I recommend highly. The ending is great.
5	1382572800	This was an amazing story from the first person. Lots of twists in the tale but also some very interesting facts. Great read as always
5	1382572800	James Patterson never lets you down. If you've never read anything by him and his co-authors,try a book you'll like it
3	1382572800	It was a good read . Kept my attention and a page turner. But not my favorite from Mr . Patterson . But still read it in just a few days .
2	1382486400	Patterson may be losing his oomph. Not sure what else to say. Read it, just to say you read it, but beware. It is a slog.
4	1382486400	James Patterson is my favorite  Author. I found this book full of twist and turns that kept me reading. Mr. Patterson has done it again,this one is another winner
1	1382486400	I have read nearly all of the Patterson books and was looking forward to a new one. James Patterson has always been an excellent writer using tight prose and beautifully crafted cliff hangers, but no more. I actally have a very difficult time believing he wrote this and believe he simply loaned his name to the novel. I certainly hope this is the case, as I would hate to think this wonderful author has slipped so low. The writing style is convoluted and and relies on cliche and manufactured chase scenes way too much. The main character appears to be copied from a very popular prime time TV series---Tony from NCIS--in that every situation reminds him of a movie scenario. Not only does this border on a copy-cat character, but it is highly distracting to the plot and makes for difficult reading. I am not a movie buff, so at least half of this drivel made no sense to me. Additionally, when I did recognize the movie scene, I could not see that the discussion added anything to the plot movement---just words to fill up the required number of pages for a new novel. I skipped at least a quarter of the book because of this distraction. As to the plot, it was okay and a bit refreshing to have something NOT realted to international terrorism. Unfortunately, every thing else detracted from the plot. Shame on you, Jamesa Patterson for putting your name and reputation on this one.
4	1382486400	OK, I thought this book was really good. It seems the people that did enjoy the book hated the main character's OCD trait of launching into presidential.and movie trivia when he was nervous or scared. I enjoyed reading those parts so much and the main plot was complicated and suspenseful. I loved Ben for his quirks and rooted for him hard! Normally, I am not a fan of Patterson's cowriters. I loved this one. It wasn't very much like Patterson but I didn't care.
5	1382486400	Great book and well written.  I'll recommend to all my reader friends and excited to read another book of James Patterson.Keep up the good work.
5	1382400000	As usuall James Patterson wrote a very good book.  Anyone who likes James Patterson will enjoy this one very much.
4	1382400000	This book started really strange with the main characters mind wandering all over the place.  Stick with it.  It works and is a great book. After understanding the characters I couldn't put it down.
2	1382400000	Just did not enjoy this book  to the point I did not even want to finish it  not one of Patterson's best
5	1382400000	First read for me by James Patterson and it was a book I had to keep reading every chance I had to see how the storyline worked.  It was a great book.
4	1382400000	I highly recommend this book. It was entertaining and action packed. It kept me wanting to read more. If you like action and suspense, check it out.
1	1382400000	I usually tear through a J.P. book but this was a tough read. Every other paragraph he compared what he was writing about to an old movie  or past president's or tv shows. I found myself skipping every 2 or so paragraphs just to &#34;get through&#34; this book.Please stick to your normal way of writing of  your usually fast turning pages.
5	1382400000	Great from beginning to end so many twist and turns. Action packed the whole way thru. It's a must read
4	1382400000	Patterson weaves a complicated tale as usual. His characterizations are strong and the twists and turns of the plot continue to surprise. This is a good read for soggy afternoon.
4	1382400000	Great book! Very suspenseful and fast moving. I like a book that keeps me so absorbed, I forget about everything else I have to do.
5	1382313600	I thoroughly enjoyed Mistress! As usual, it's fast paced, well written and full of Patterson style twists and turns! Couldn't put it down!
2	1382313600	This book couldn't get my attention like most of James Patterson's books. The story line was slow and boring. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
3	1382313600	Was an ok book .All the movie reference s kept me unconnected with the plot at times.I would not read this book again because it just wasn't interesting enough to keep me interested
2	1382313600	You know the story....Bill Cosby blows away every audience, then enamored with his success, he starts modeling  himself.  He wants to be molto Cosby.  And his fans start to dwindle.  That's what is happening with James Patterson -- he (or his writing partners) have been cranking out cookie cutter Pattersonisms, just putting a new wrapper on stale style.  In &#34;Mistress&#34;, his character devices become annoying.  Chatting with himself, his hero is repeatedly diverging from the plot. How many times can Benjamin muse about his favorite film stars? How many of these &#34;cute&#34; asides can one reader tolerate? I have loved Patterson over the years.  This might possibly be my last purchase of any title with his name on it.
3	1382313600	It took me a long time to get into this book.  The story seemed disjointed and didn't follow a logical sequence.  I finally got into the story and started to enjoy it about half way through.
5	1382227200	Twists and turns keep things very interesting. Keeps character with a keen sense of humor, yet he is believable. Would like to see more of this kind of storyline.
2	1382227200	This was a very long and boring book, not like your usual James Patterson's books.  He needs to be more particular in the authors he selects to write with him.
5	1382227200	Couldn't put it down.  Addictive.  Great storyline that wouldn't let you stop reading to the end.  Patterson is such a master.
4	1382227200	Very engaging. Keeps you guessing till the end. A good read. James Patterson is 1  of my top authors whose books I love to read.
2	1382227200	Somewhere amidst the overdone commentary on presidential and movie trivia lurked an interesting plot. Since I tend to be a skim reader, after the first fourth of this book, rather than toss it aside, I began to pick out plot pieces and ignore the other. It did tone down a little toward the end.Although rather grandiose and rather unbelievable at times, as a reader I did want to know what really happened to Diana. The ending also felt a little extreme. I'm getting weary of books that have one person bringing down an entire conspiracy single-handedly.Hard to recommend this one since I'm not even sure why I stuck with it. Definitely annoying, especially in the beginning.
5	1382140800	James Patterson has done it again. I could not put this book down til the end and of coarse we found out at the end what it was all about.
4	1382140800	Its a good read at times I felt the plot was a bit droll at times could have been made more believable if it wasnt trying tobe so complicated
4	1382140800	Good book but more action then character development. Very interesting plot but improbable handy help for main character not quite believable
1	1382140800	I did not like hearing the main character (Ben) mentioning all this trivia stuff on movies, actors and presidents while he is trying to solve the mystery. What does it do for the plot? It was a waste of time to read. This co author needs to go.
5	1382140800	Loved the twists and turns in this story, couldn't put it down.  A very well written story and testimonial as to what big brother is capable of doing to the citizenery.  You will not be disappointed.
1	1382140800	Stupid, annoying movie/presidential trivia nonsense.  Very difficult to keep up with the plot. Not worth my time.  Hate I spent my money on this book.  Would not recommend.
4	1382054400	I found the main character's chatting continuously a little off-putting originally but ended up enjoying the book tremendously!  His disillusionment shone through.
5	1382054400	Took me  a while to get into this book, but then I couldn't put it down.  The beginning was slow and I couldn't quite grasp who, what, where.... but once I kept reading I was rewarded with a thriller that wouldn't let me go.  Great book! Great story!  Read it.
2	1382054400	Have read every JP book but didn't really enjoy this one.  It was slow paced and not what I expected from a JP book in terms of pace.  Didn't keep me hooked.Write fewer books JP with higher, calibre of suspense and engagement.
1	1382054400	the story is good, but the constant reflections to old movies is a real turn  off, he needs to get back to the style that made him famous.
1	1382054400	Couldn't even read past a few chapters, kept thinking it would get better but finally gave up and started new book!
5	1381968000	I love every book that James Patterson writes. Regardless weither its  a, romantic  story a love story a murder story.
5	1381968000	I loved the book, one of the better reading I have had. james Patterson never disappoints me, best writer ever
4	1381968000	I always like Patterson but found this book just not that interesting. I finished it last week and don't remember what it was about. I liked it when I read it but it did not make a big impression.
3	1381968000	This one is on the slow side, but still good. This would not stop me from purchasing more books from him.
4	1381968000	It was totally enjoyable mystery with twist and turns you did not expect. I would definitely suggest reading it, happily
1	1381968000	I read this all the way through for some reason, waiting for the plot to become interesting. It never got there. I was able to read it quickly by skipping over paragraphs and ignoring the ridiculous ramblings of the main character. This was not worthy of being published I think.
5	1381968000	I always love all James Patterson books!  It was good from start to finish!  Thanks for the entertainment over the years........
1	1381968000	I listened to this as an audio book, otherwise I would have stopped reading after first few chapters.  This is the worse book of James Patterson's that I've ever "read". Patterson's thoughts seemed as scattered as the main character's were and his constantly referring to old movies was a total distraction.  Too many times I wasn't even paying attention to what was being said but still managed to get though the whole book without missing significant details, whereas normally I hang on to the very last minute that I have to get out of my car.  I will stick to his series books -- Women's Murder Club, Alex Cross, Michael Bennett -- from now on and leave his stand alone books on the shelf. He needs to stop lending out his name and stick to his own writing, unless the above 3 series are all written solely by his co-authors.
5	1381881600	Fast moving! Intricate plots! Another great Patterson mystery! You won't want to stop reading until the plots are resolved and the story is told!
5	1381881600	Mistressmy wife reads these books and she said that it was a new smelling book, i guess readers know what that means. she was very happy with it
5	1381881600	This book kept me guessing.  I enjoyed the movie quotes and references. It felt that I was in the mind of someone with ADD and brilliant.
2	1381881600	Reading this book is painful. All of the trivia references  are awful and very unnecessary. Can you imagine listening to this.
3	1381795200	It was a quick read however, I have read better by Patterson.  My recommendation would to bring more of Alex Cross books.
5	1381795200	This book is not a great story but is an OK read. It is not up to the usual standard.
1	1381795200	Implausibility stacked on top of implausibility.  I honestly thought I was reading a dream sequence until about 30% through the book.
3	1381795200	I'm usually not attracted to these types of books but  it was on the best seller list so I gave it a try.It was just ok.
1	1381795200	Let me say first that I don't care for 1st person novels so this book had one strike when I opened the cover. Then the major character tries to relate too many  situations to a movie scene. I am glad Mr. Ellis sees so many movies, but for me it added nothing to the story and was a waste of space. The first person dialog was tedious to say the least and goes on and on. I've read many of Mr. Patterson's books, and for me this rates near if not at the bottom. You can skip not only paragraphs but pages and not miss the story line. I am so glad this is a library book so it did not cost me anything.
4	1381708800	Say what you want but Mr. Patterson writes a good book and I myself enjoy every one of them.  Keep writting.
4	1381708800	Once I started reading, I had a hard time putting it down. A great Patterson  offering into intrigue and politics.
4	1381708800	I read this while on vacation - it was a good page turner with an interesting twist.  I would recommend it.
3	1381708800	This was a little different for James Patterson.  I had a hard time at first with the book as it seemed that with the President and Movie trivia, the focus seemed to drift but as the Chapters flew by I understood what was happening.  I ended up enjoying the book.
1	1381708800	ONE OF THE WORST JAMES PATTERSONS BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ,THE REFERALS TO MOVIES  ETC HAD NO POINT.I FINISHED THE BOOK BUT WITH GREAT EFFORT
5	1381708800	I love all Patterson's books. This one is a real page turner. I even learned a lot about Presidential trivia!
3	1381708800	For some reason I find this book boring & hard to hold my interest, some of Patterson's book aren't as good as they used to be.I have almost all the book he has wrote
5	1381622400	James Patterson did it again with this one. Love this man and his thrillers. Must read for every Patterson fan and even those that have not read a Patterson book.
5	1381622400	Scary to think- is this fiction or did someone have access to confidential government info?We may never know but a GREAT read
2	1381622400	I am over half way through the book and struggling to finish. The main character makes constant reference to movies and movie dialog. If you aren't a movie buff you have no idea what he is talking about. It really takes away from the story.  I'll need to take a break from Patterson after this one!
3	1381622400	This book was very slow and not filled with intrigue like most of his books. I am still a big fan of his though.
3	1381622400	To much story telling that had nothing to do with the story.  I could care less what some actor did in a TV show or movie, just stick to the story at hand.
5	1381622400	As always James Patterson tells a great story. I wish he would write more stories on his own like he use to.
5	1381622400	Every time I read a James Patterson Book, I don't want to put it down. This one is no exception.
5	1381622400	To preface this review I have to say that I read Gone by Patterson and Ledwidge and found that the first eighteen chapters were good when I previewed them. I ordered Mistress and didn't have time to read it. After reading the remaining chapters of Gone  I decided I was off Patterson and didn't plan to read Mistress but there it was on my kindle and I decided to give it a shot. Immediately I had to know what the brilliant but disturbed Benjamin Casper was up against. Why was everyone who mattered to him being knocked off. Who was Dianna, really? Character development and the complexity of the plot pulled me in and I had to finnish it in a day.  Five stars all the way.
3	1381622400	I usually love James Patterson books, however, this one was not one of them.  There was a lot of facts embedded into the story which I didn't like.  It slowed the story down a bit.
3	1381622400	I enjoyed the book, it was an easy and entertaining read.  That said it was nothing too special, similar to watching a cheap action movie; entertaining but generally not a great story
3	1381536000	I read lots of Patterson with his various co-authors.  This one was difficult because I didn't get absorbed into the story.  I felt like I was outside and just watching the story but not really getting pulled into it.  I felt no relationship to any of the characters.  Definitely wouldn't buy it again at top ebook price.
2	1381536000	Not &#34;typically&#34; James Patterson.  Took forever to get going, but never did get going.  Too much time on reflecting history, without moving the story along.Normally LOVE James Patterson......not this time.
3	1381536000	this book is not one of Mr.Pattersons finest perhaps because of the other Mr.Ellis either way it was a lingering baseline of a story that appeared to have come to a conclusion after a writters block of some sort would have been great if they had stayed with one country became too lingering &then confusingly branched out
5	1381449600	Excellent book. Well crafted story. Would like to read more by the author. It kept my attention with such an unusual plot!
3	1381449600	Enough suspense but just a bit drawn out. The inserts about the past could have been a bit shorter. Otherwise enjoyable relaxation .
2	1381449600	This is a typical john Patterson book,...written fast and not that good.  I'm through ordering his books!  His co-authors leave a lot to be desired.
5	1381449600	Very exciting book, but I did guess who the mistress was with, did not care for the repeated references to movie scenes and actors.
3	1381449600	Good plot; narrative a bit sluggish. Found myself anxious, at times, to get on with the 'meat of the story'.A good read, but not one of the author's best.
5	1381449600	His books haven't been as good lately but this one was. I would suggest you read it . Fast read
5	1381449600	James Patterson never disappoints. He keeps you on edge from start to finish. I was unable to put the book down. Truly enjoyed. And reading his next book at present. Can not get enough.
5	1381449600	where am i going to come up with twenty words?  as i have said before his books are what i order most..
5	1381449600	It's hard to imagine the secret activities of governments and even more of a surprise when they are like this.
5	1381449600	Kept me guessing until the end.  Have never been disappointed with any of James Patterson books.  Please keep them coming.
5	1381363200	Love the book. I've always been a fan of Patterson's work. I can't wait to read the next book on my list
4	1381363200	Very interesting story, with many Turns.  In true Patterson style, this one is a page turner from start to finish.
5	1381363200	Patterson and Ellis have created an exceptionally likable and thoroughly believable character who maneuvers through unknown waters of international espionage in Washington DC.  It is extremely easy to identify with main character Ben. Ben's humor, insights and fears make him entirely human. Hopefully there will be more novels with the intrepid Ben. Be prepared for long reads, because it's not easy to put this book down,
4	1381363200	Takes you to a whole new level. Of James Patterson's books.  I do recommend it.  However, it start slow, but keep reading.
1	1381363200	I always buy JP's books the day they come out and finish them within 3 days. I've been reading this book since the release date and haven't made it past 40%. It's the most boring, unrealistic piece that he's ever put his name on. I wish I could demand a refund.
5	1381276800	I love James Patterson (most of his books, don't like the Witch & Wizard Series or Daniel Series) and with this book the writing and the story line certainly lived up to my high expectations that he has led me to.  This is an old clich&eacute; but one that is certainly true in this case:  I just couldn't put it down until the end
5	1381276800	Mistress was another great story by Mr. James Patterson.  It excellent and I could not put it down.  I thought that I knew who did what but it is so mind changing to see to what extend people will go to cover up or keep things secret.  There are not secrets that will not be revealed one way or another.  I did not think that there was a love affair of another nature that was being apart of the story.You must read it and enjoy it as I did.
1	1381190400	I only made it to chapter 3. How can anyone concentrate on a plot with all the trivia running around in Ben's head and clogging up every page. I wonder if Patterson ever read this one.
3	1381190400	Not a memorable read, however I finished it but the plot has not left a me wanting to read more.
5	1381190400	This book had some unexpected twists and a surprise ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it was a quick read.
4	1381190400	Not quitw up to Patterson's usual but all in all a good book.  Some strange twists and turns that make it interesting and wanting to see what comes next.
3	1381104000	If you want to get to sleep, read this book.  I hope the insane character that is a reporter does not become a featured character in any future books.  Ben is insane and people are out to get him. There really isn't any reason for anyone to be chasing after Ben, but that's the way the story goes. Nearly everyone that has any dealings with Ben gets killed.  It was a shame that Ben wasn't the killer.  It would have been interesting if at the end, we found thathe  was an assassin and in cahoots with Diana in bringing down the White House, or at least have a threesome with Diana and the 1st Lady. David Ellis - keep your day job (hopefully not as a writer in the Patterson Publishing Mill).
5	1381104000	This was a great book that kept me on the edge of my seat.  It has many twists and turns and keeps you interested till the end of the book.
4	1381104000	it's well written and quite funny in parts. Main characters well developed. I enjoyed the read, but not life altering by any standard.
1	1381104000	I wish that Patterson would eliminate about half of the co-authors and concentrate on his own fine writing.  Think he is spreading his abilities too thin if Mistress is a recent example.
5	1381104000	LIKE ALL JAMES PATTERSON BOOKS THIS KEPT THE STORY MOVING AND HAD A TWIST I WASNT SUSPECTING TILL RIGHT TO THE END. GOOD STORY LINE READ IT RIGHT THROUGH.
5	1381104000	Didn't expect it to end the way it did. Very good as are all his books!!  Fast read and unpredictable.
1	1381104000	I am a fan of James Patterson and was excited about this book; however I found myself skipping pages to get through it.  The main character was annoying.  He frequently threw out random thoughts about movies, songs, etc. that just interurpted the flow of the story.  This one character (who is a reporter, not a special forces op)  has the CIA after him, the President after him, The Russian mob and others and none of them can catch up with him. Seriously???
1	1381104000	This was one of the worst James Patterson books I have ever read.  It was slow and I really struggled to finish it.
2	1381104000	It just needs to more dynamic. You can easily lose interest in it because it does not flow well. Unusual. He usually does better.
2	1381104000	It was ok. Not One of my favors. Great plot. Just alittle to follow at times.  But all in all it was ok.
5	1381104000	Great Patterson Story. Read it on a 4 Hr. Plane flight! The style & quality you expect from this writer.
2	1381017600	Very disappointed in this read.  First Patterson book that I could put down.  I only finished it because "I always finish what I start"....ending was flat.  would not recommend it.
5	1381017600	Fast-paced and exciting to the end! It would be a great made-for-television movie! Suspenseful and thrilling all at once! Great!
3	1381017600	I did like the story and it had me wondering how it was going to end BUT all the president references annoyed the heck out of me. Maybe in small doses it would've been alright but it was just too much.
1	1381017600	After the first say 50 pages it is sooo boring.  Don't think I can even finish it.  Totally disappointed in Patterson and he is one author who always commands a pretty high price.  Not a good value for me.
5	1381017600	Another James Patterson book that I couldn't put down once I opened!!  Wouldn't of expected anything less!!!!  A must have for any Patterson reader.
4	1381017600	Slow start ,but hard to put down once all the action takes place. Another good Patterson book!Hope everyone enjoys it too.
3	1381017600	I usually can't put James Patterson books down but this was definitely not a favorite. I found the main character's inability to concentrate because of a psychiatric problem quite annoying. I did not like that he was so distracted ALL THE TIME. In my opinion, it did not get interesting until towards the end. It had some surprises but also some saw-that-coming moments.
1	1380931200	The first couple of chapters were okay.  He would metion movies,tv shows and history way too much.This is the first time I was disapointed in a James Patterson book and I have read many of his books.
5	1380931200	This book was very  exciting .  There were lots of twists and turns in the plots.  Many surprises in the plots.  I could not put the book down.
4	1380931200	Patterson is an awesome writer, however, I did not care for the flash back style in this book.  The format was very entertaining.
1	1380931200	One of the worst JamesPatterson books ever. I have read almost ever thing he's written.  This by far is not a good book.  I am sorry to have purchased this one.  One bad one won't stop me though.  I can't wait to read the next book in the Michael Bennett series.
1	1380931200	Churned out garbage by a washed up has-been.  Patterson should be ashamed of such drivel.I seriously consider this to be the WORST book I have ever read, not the worst by James Patterson, who clearly gave up writing a decade ago to cash checks and vomit on paper, but the worst book in the history of written word.Everything about this book is awful, from the lame and horrid plot, to the truly stupid story, to the transparent and amateurish writing. I don't know who the second writer credit is, but I must assume he is a barely literate third grader.Nothing, not one single paragraph, of this horrendously stupid, boring , drivel is entertaining.  It is trash. It is garbage. It is pure unadulterated feces on paper.James Patterson, RETIRE!  You were good once, sadly that was long ago. You should apologize to everyone you ripped off with the book. ugh. Thumbs down.
5	1380931200	Another great Patterson book! Always a supreme pager turning writer. Just can't miss by picking up and reading his books.
1	1380931200	i used to read all of james patterson's work, but his last few books have really not been able to keep my attention.  this one i gave a lot longer, read almost half before i gave up on it becoming more interesting.
3	1380931200	The story is slow in places and the main character is not believeable. I will not recommend this book to friends.
2	1380844800	I found his asides of trivia to be very distracting. I started the book several times only to put it down. I finally had to skip over the trivia to get a sense of the book.
5	1380844800	I never miss a James Patterson book.  Though I dislike the short chapters, the stories a great.  He has several on-going series and somehow spits out a new book every four months or so..  Even still it seems a long wait in between.  So far I have not been disappointed in any book of his.One series, Max the flying mutant girl and friends, is really great for teens, but I lost intrest after the &#34;comic-like&#34; books started coming out and lost track.  I'm not a teen, haven't been for over 40 years but I liked the books.  I recommend this series for all readers from 10 to 15 years old.None of his books are vulger and even with a name like MISTRESS you'd think otherwise.  Enjoy it!
4	1380844800	I really like almost everything James Patterson writes.I am one of his biggest fan.He is one of the four author's I read.
5	1380844800	I love Amazon products! All my books are bought from them. I can always count on the to have the books I want!
2	1380844800	It's time to stop buying JP books, so sad. Your going to have to wait till you see how it goes! Never had this happen before!!! They used to be great!!!JAMES PATTERSON what happened????
4	1380844800	I see that this book received a lot of poor reviews, however, I enjoyed the book tremendously!What a clever idea adding the character's thoughts to the story. Many of us have that sameproblem--made the story and character more interesting.  Bravo James and David Ellis.
5	1380844800	This was a  different writing  than past Patterson stories but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and wasn't ready for it to  end.
4	1380844800	There are parts of this book that almost put me to sleep, but for the most part it was a good read.
3	1380758400	Took too long to get to the finality of the plot. Lost interest half way through it. Not one of his better books!
4	1380758400	It's hard to get into the book.  Each chapter gets more exciting. Events seem to get worse for main hero. You wpnder when things will turn round. The more you read thethe more interesting its becomes.
4	1380758400	I read James Patterson all the time, and this was not his best work.  I did not enjoy the first person narrative, and the movie references.
1	1380758400	O.K. story if you are prepared to "fast forward" through the "fillers" (movie / presidential / whatever else the author could come up with trivia). $1.99 @ the most.
4	1380758400	I can understand why some didn't finish it. It started very strangely and disjointed but I kept with it. I actually really enjoyed it.  Found it to be a great vacation read.  Is it his best? of course not, but I don't believe it warrants a 1 Star.
5	1380758400	Fast paced. A real page turner with lots of twists and turns. An excellent read as all of Patterson's are!
1	1380758400	Very disappointed in this book - not up to the usual James Patterson standard.  Quite unbelievable and just too many references to film stars etc.
4	1380758400	Love this book.  Kept me wondering about the title to the end. Where does mistress fit in?  Full of intrigue and suspense until the very last page.
4	1380672000	I just finished reading and enjoyed it.  As always Patterson excelled.  He is fast pace and interesting all the way through.  Guess that is the reason he has so many followers. There is another book of his that is his all time best though.  Can I say &#34;Quickie?&#34;
2	1380672000	I'll bet David Ellis wrote most of this book.  Not your typical writing style for Patterson.  The plot was good, there was a lot of action but it was too uneven. Too many references to other scenes from other books and movies! in fact they were overused so much it became comical.  I started skipping those references and moving ahead.
4	1380672000	I found the story very interesting, good plot with a twist, something different to what I expected from the title of the book.
4	1380672000	Very riveting, though at times I got a little bored with the story. Overall an enjoyable read & would recommend to other fans.
2	1380672000	It does not hold my attention. Too much use of TV shows and movies. Does not reflect Patterson's writing style.
5	1380672000	Like all Patterson books, it was great. A page tuner keeping you guessing all the way.I liked it very much.
5	1380585600	First of all, I listened to this on CD and the reader was fantastic!!  I could just see his funny, strange mind working.  For that reason, I am really pleased that I listened to it.  I laughed out loud so many times when I was listening to this.  Ben really does have a quirky mind.  :>)  I thought that it was interesting that in the middle of  listening to this, Putin, was so vocal, Russia has re-surfaced.  Very implausible, but very, very entertaining!
5	1380585600	Once you start, you can't put it down.  I liked the new character, Ben. I was shocked many times over.
5	1380585600	Up is down and down is up , in this fast paced and well written winner.  Any one who loves a mystery  will find this a good read
2	1380585600	It wasn't one of his best by a long shot.  I kept reading, thinking it would get better, but couldn't finish it.
4	1380585600	This was a strange unusual way for Patterson to tell this story. The main character utilized a verbal narration. It appeared to the reader to resent what he was thinking! Sometimes rambling, sometimes confusing.The story had a lot of twists and turns. Some only added to the confusion and needlessly Added to the number pages - are authors paid by the page?
3	1380499200	Unbelievable he could outwit three different government agencies trying to kill him!I liked most of the movies he mentions throughout the book.I liked the ending.
2	1380499200	Not one of his best. Rather he just told the story without all the  movie trivia. To much trivia for me to stay interested. Kept losing me and when the story line picked up it would hold my interest again
4	1380499200	It started off a little weird but when it picked up it took off and I couldn't put the book down.
5	1380499200	Excellent, you are hooked at the beginning.  Hard to put down.  Would have never guessed the ending. Makes you wonder if this could happen in real life.
5	1380499200	Unlike others who may have had a preconceived idea about how the book was written, I have not read any James Patterson before. I chose this book because it was a stand alone book and not in a series with repeat characters and involving some character development.  I found the book very entertaining and believable, written in chronological order as events happened. It did not jump around, therefore it was easy to follow. It may not be written in James Patterson's normal style as reflected in some of the ratings, but I had no such preconceived idea of what to expect.  It was an excellent suspense novel with spies, politicians, Feds, and the press involved in a mysterious murder in Washington DC. It only took me 2 days to read it...hard to put down.  I think you will like it.
1	1380499200	I couldn't finish this book.  I hate books written in first person.  Didn't hold my attention at all.  I didn't care one way or the other the outcome of the crime.
1	1380412800	Need to be able to give minus stars this is another one of those where James Patterson name is put on a book he probably never read  much less had a part in writing  the book is boring to say the least and if all references to movies tv shows and celebrities were eliminated it would be half as long. How do I request a refund?
3	1380412800	It was okay....not cropping like most of the others...would prefer Alex Cross any day to be honestTry it yourself!
3	1380412800	a friend recommended this and it is a fast paced and quick witted read.  You need to appreciate the main character stream of consciousness but I liked it and could relate.
5	1380412800	Mistress was a book that I could not put down. It was a real page turner!I would definitely recommend this book.
5	1380412800	I totally enjoy the book. Just superb. Couldn't put the book down. The writing is so imaginative. Very good ending.
4	1380412800	The story line was a page turner.  The narrator's mind wondering rambling was interesting.  Could not figure out the solution until the very end.
4	1380412800	I really like all of Paterson's books. As soon as one comes out I read it. This one kept my interest though out.  t.
2	1380412800	unlike other books by James Patterson, I started this one and never finished.  Other books by him I could not put down until I finished.  Very disappointed in this one.
5	1380412800	great read once again. certainly a  different story line to what I predicted. which is why I love James Patterson books
3	1380412800	was not one of my favorite James Patterson novels. did not keep me wanted to read more into the wee hours of the night
4	1380412800	I liked this book because it is written with only what any James Patterson book has...that &#34;can't put it down&#34; feeling. I would recommend this to anyone that likes thrillers and other James Patterson enthusiasts :-)
3	1380412800	For me it was not one of his best, A little disappointed. Had to get through the first couple of chapters . Then it got better.
4	1380412800	First, I enjoy reading books by James Patterson, and he is my favorite author.  This is the first review I have ever written.MISTRESS.  Although I did enjoy reading this book, I also got a little annoyed at all the numerous mentions/references of movies and what characters did or thought or experienced.  When the content was about the story of the book, I enjoyed reading it and found it hard to put down.I would recommend this book to a friend.
3	1380326400	A good read once you skip all the things I felt were unimportant. It ran on a bit longer than I felt it needed. The main character has a fascination with movies, poets and books and rambles. It made me want to skip a lot of pages to get back to the original story line.
1	1380326400	Not up to Patterson's quality very disappointed. I seem to notice this when he authors with someone else. Very, very disappointed.
5	1380326400	A cannot put it down book.  I found the plot excellent with a twist at the end.  Didn't see that one coming.
5	1380240000	I sampled the first 15 chapters in one day and had to have the rest.  Really good novel, as expected from Patterson
1	1380240000	I love James Patterson books, and I love David Ellis books. But this co-written book was just too boring and tedious for words - I kept trying and trying and trying to find something anything to keep me reading... But, nope, I just couldn't finish it. While reading the book, it felt like hours and hours had passed very slowly, and yet it hadn't been that long and my mind was wandering and drifting every place else. Sorry, James and David - I eagerly anticipate your next books - as in the next ones you write individually.
3	1380240000	This was probably my least favorite James Patterson book. The story line was intriguing but I didn't care for the style of writing. The main character telling the story and references to movies, stars, etc. got a little confusing.
3	1380240000	This is one of Patterson's active chase...threats every direction...thrillers with murders, yes plural murders, power plays, last minute survival action. It's fast...yet it's the voice mainly of the chased one, a writer who owns an online newspaper. That's really an oxymoron to this reader.  If you like his style it's also a trip through great music and cool jazz from the best of the past and the constant mind race of the narrator.The protaganist knows that an apparent suicide is somehow a complex, global murder, that has the full attention of the domestic and international spy communities.  Even the President mentions the dead woman, who is named Diana, is a suicide. It seems everyone wants our narrator to face the fact that the Diana is dead, and especially to accept it was  by her own hand.That works to the advantage of the action but breaks the heart of the friends of the dead woman.  Even on his bike being chased by a generic black SUV, this guy manages to visit and comment on films, TV shows, think "Castle," as well as directors or writers.Certainly a fast and easy weekend read, and for puzzle solvers of sleuth fiction, never forget the title of this one.
1	1380240000	I have never been much of a Patterson fan, but I got this because of some good reviews. I'm beginning to think the reviews were plants because this is the most gawd-awful book I've read in years. I stuck through to the end because I no longer post reviews on stuff I have not completely read, but it was a real chore. This book is not only badly written, it is badly OVER written. The plot is preposterous, which isn't that big a deal, but in this case it is seriously silly; I mean the CIA, The Russians, The Chinese, The FBI all involved in a plot and unable to kill one sad sack on a bicycle? As to the writing? "What am I doing here? I can't believe I'm doing this. What am I going to do?" I'm not kidding! Endless digressions into movie and historical trivia which is mildly amusing at first and a major annoyance as it goes on and on and on.If you are thinking of buying this because you are a Patterson fan save yourself the agony; this is a lousy book.
4	1380240000	I was a little disappointed in this book.  Other books by him have kept my interest. Not a good story
1	1380240000	Unfortunately this is the very first book ever of James Patterson that I have not finished.  I read up to chapter 13 and stopped.  I love James Patterson and have read all his books but this one was not fast moving like all his others. With others you think I'll just read this chapter, but you don't, you get to the end of the chapter and you want to read to see what happens next. This book is not like that at all. I'm very disappointed. The story wasn't fast moving and flowing there were far too many digressions usually when James writes a book in conjunction with another it stays true to his usual style. This one does not. I still love James Patterson and will read future books
5	1380240000	I am a fan of James Patterson's work but the book were getting far too predictable that we're almost not worth reading.  This was new, new characters, new theme, with some twists and turns.  A worthwhile read!
4	1380240000	This book by James Patterson and David Ellis catches you from the first chapter and never lets go. At the beginning of the story, a woman the male protagonist is infatuated with has seemingly committed suicide by jumping off the balcony of her high-rise apartment building. The frightening part from the hero's standpoint is that he was the last known person to be in her apartment near the time of her suicide, which is eventually investigated as a homicide.From there, the story takes on many new facets and involves many people. Everyone from the Russians, to the Chinese, to the CIA, and the President of the United States is related to this case. There are shootings, murders, explosions, and enough excitement to keep you engaged to the very last page. There are plenty of twists and turns.If you are looking for a real page-turner, this is your book. In the end, however, it was not what I expected. Still I give it four stars. Good work, James Patterson and David Ellis.
3	1380240000	This book was different from the others I've read, but still a good read. Lots of twists and turns. Enjoyable.
1	1380240000	The book has a rough beginning- hard for me to get into. Could be a good book???? I just didn't like it.
1	1380153600	Had difficulty with this novel. Found it hard to follow and to keep the story straight. Glad to have finished.
5	1380153600	The title had me thinking something entirely different altogether. Then I meet the main character Ben, who had all the markings of a stalking, serial killer, and this is where it takes off like a runaway train that's jumped it's tracks. You don't know where you're going, but you're trying to figure out the outcome by the scenery that's whooshing by.  Murder can be made to look like suicide, and suicide like murder; and this is what Ben has to deal with. Throw in blackmail, political intrigue, Russian spies, Presidential trivia, movie references, and Seinfeld; you've got a nice little espionage thriller that although intense, let's you come up for air to enjoy a few laughs along the way.  Enjoyable read.
5	1380153600	A great mystery that kept me wondering until the last page.  I love the way James Patterson writes.  Keep them coming
5	1380153600	I enjoyed this book very much...  Benjamin Casper is an intriguing character of whom I changed opinions many times during the reading of the book.  It kept me guessing most of the way through the book and waiting for the next footfall was unreal!  Another James Patterson hit!
5	1380153600	I lived this book I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happened next! James Patterson did it again!
5	1380153600	The review's were poor and I have never read a Patterson novel that I did not truly enjoy. So I had to purchase Mistress to see what the disappointment was about. I loved it. Great story line. Kept me engaged and enjoyed the quirky dialogue. I'm very pleased I didn't allow the poor review's from keeping me from reading a thrilling, twisted novel with a perfect ending.
3	1380067200	I want to give this 3 1/2 stars. I had a hard time following the main character as he was mentally all over the place. The plot was good but if you're a fan of Patterson, you can tell he doesn't have much influence in this book.
3	1380067200	This one was a little disjointed with all of the trivia thrown in randomly throughout the dialog.  This made it harder to read.
4	1380067200	like all Patterson's books, it moves and keeps your heart racing all the way through. was expecting one more twist at the end but didnt happen. I enjoyed the book very much.
2	1380067200	Not as good as his other books. Actually disappointing following all the hype. Clearly his co-writer did most of the writing. Not up to the standards of previous Patterson books.
2	1380067200	The main character's rambling about  seemingly unrelated trivia was really annoying. Would definitely hesitate buying Patterson again. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!
4	1380067200	Great storey that keeps you wondering what is going to happen next so you can't put the book very good storey line
4	1380067200	Excellent plot although the narration style of the lead character got a little tiresome. The overall book was good and the Patterson factory keeps turning out great reading.
4	1380067200	I liked Ben and his thoughts, his since of humor.  Different from other James Patterson books but he is my favorite author and he never disappoints.
3	1380067200	Almost boring, with a surprising outcome, albeit almost expected. I had to read something else in between the chapters just to keep my mind going.
5	1379980800	Kept the suspense going from start to finish. Really surprised by the twist. Didn't expect what was going to happen in the end.
1	1379980800	I read alot of James Paterson's books.  I downloaded Mistress from the Overdrive system at the local library for free.  I have a 45 minute commute to work.  I listened to the first hour and a half of the audio version and I really don't understand where the book was going.  I had to stop listening. Hopefully it reads better than the audio version.  Based on the reviews here though, I guess not.  No wonder it was a new release and available to me without a wait.
5	1379980800	I didn't see the type of affair coming anywhere in the novel. I was really surprised. The main character is crazy but nice and  mistress well she is a horse of a different color
3	1379980800	Lots of twists and turns. Hard to put down.  Good read. Kept me guessing until the end. Could there be more Ben Casper in the future?
5	1379980800	KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. A MUST READ FOR FANS. HOPE TO SEE MORE BOOKS IN THIS FORM
1	1379980800	Boring. Poorly written. Cumbersome. Another bland read from the &#34;Patterson&#34; book mill.Remember Along Came a Spider? Where is that author?
3	1379980800	This book was kind of hard to get into because the main character rambled at some parts. Otherwise a good read
5	1379980800	Best book I have read in a long time! The element of surprise masterly played. Found out a great deal of Presidential trivia narrated by a likeable character with a great sense of humorIn the middle of chaotic circumstances.
5	1379980800	james Patterson did not let us down with this one, it was fast and furious and I really enjoyed it
4	1379980800	I couldn't' stop reading since I had to know what was going to happen. Fast moving and I was surprised often. Will we be seeing more of these trivia obsessed reporter?
5	1379980800	This book has to be one of his best. Loved the both tv and movie trivia.  A must read for Patterson fans.
4	1379894400	Intriguing! A good story and kept me surprised throughout the book. A reporter mixed up in a mystery and tries to get himself out of a big mess. Couldn't wait to see how he gets out of it. I liked it!
5	1379894400	GREAT!  James Patterson has always been in my top-5 mystery authors, but in my opinion, Mistress was above and beyond &#34;who done it&#34;.  Each chapter introduces more and more action, close calls, recovery and just plain good luck. Great Kindle-book.
3	1379894400	As always, another interesting read from Patterson!  Easy read, keeps you guessing, and is very entertaining. This one didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, however. Hopefully, his next one will
3	1379894400	The Mistress wasn't as exciting as I expected.  It was difficult to read and maintain any interest in the story.  I was kind of disappointed with James Patterson on this one.  I purchased it because it was written by James Patterson.
5	1379894400	I love James Patterson , a friend turned me on to his & so glad she did to. he my faviorite author now
4	1379894400	I really enjoyed reading this book. Absolutely loved the main character Ben. I laughed out loud many times. Will be waiting on another one soon...
3	1379894400	The many references the character Ben uses with the movies just reminds me of a copy of NCIS agent Anthony Denozo. Perhaps Mr.  Patterson has never seen that show. Did not hit me like his other books. But a good plot and I would recommend it.
5	1379894400	The entire time I was reading this book - I had a movie playing in my head.  Excellently written!  One of the best James Patterson books I have ever read!  If you like the movie &#34;Conspiracy Theory&#34; - you will love this book!  Mel Gibson would play this part extremely well!!!
3	1379808000	I am lost and it is slow for being in the middle, might get better towards the end, but his books grab me right at the start
5	1379808000	Great book! Looking forward to the next one. A real thriller. Always has a twist and always hold my interest
1	1379808000	I have, in the main, enjoyed James Paterson until the Mistress, it is a pity that I did not try to read it straight away, otherwise I would have asked for a refund.
3	1379808000	Loved the story but to much flash backs.  His stories always keep you on the edge but this time I kept losing interest because of the many flashbacks
4	1379808000	Really kept my interest and quite a twist to the storySounds like something that can really happen in this day and age
5	1379808000	The non-sequitur style writing was a little off-putting at first, but I grew to love it, and the story.  Great read.
1	1379808000	i could not get into it worst patterson book i bought an only book i bought that jim wrote that i couldn't get in to
4	1379808000	I liked the book, but i wasn't thrilled with the way it ended. I would recommend it though for reading.
4	1379808000	Fast-paced story with twist in plot line.  Good summer reading.  Enjoyable.  These reviews require too many words before they will be published
5	1379808000	I always look forward to James Patterson's mysteries.There is an attention grabber with every page,and I always look to Amazon.com.,for the latest book.I usually go for the audio version,as I spend a lot of time in my car,and I have 2 son's that I pass them onto,when I finish the book.Always a thriller!This had an anti-hero type,and a great ending.
5	1379808000	Typical of Patterson the action is fast.  Plot is well written with the expected twists and turns.  I didn't initially pick this book up because I didn't care for the title; once into the book I understood.  This is a fast read.
4	1379808000	I did enjoy it, but not up to James Patterson's books He keeps referring to events that happened . Mentions movie starsand past Presidents.  Sometimes amusing tidbits.but I found it distracting from the story
2	1379808000	It was a hard book to get into, not one I would recommend. Not as good as his usual books.
1	1379808000	I was very disappointed in this James Patterson book.  I have read so many of his books and I think this is his worst.
5	1379808000	it lived up to my expectations, I didn't put it down once I started reading it.  James Patterson is my favorite author.
3	1379808000	Not one of his best. Didn't like the reference the character made to old movies or presidents. If you were from a different generation then you didn't make the connection. Will still read his books. Looking forward to his next &#34;Gone&#34;
5	1379808000	Great story line and it puts you on the edge of your seat.  One of his best books ever.  You will love it.
4	1379808000	For holiday/beach/airplane entertainment, hard to beat. James Patterson is always entertaining in a well-written and researched way, his writing fulfills a need for leizurely need for simple but intelligent entertainment.
5	1379808000	Mystery was never as provocative. It's all here -- life , love and the pursuit of truth. As for happiness, you'll have to decide that for yourself.
4	1379721600	Loved every page!  I hope to read more featured books from Patterson and Ellis.  Suggested to all Patterson followers.  Read it!
3	1379721600	Not what I expected from a Patterson book. Too much trivia and Ben was not a wholly likable main character.
3	1379721600	The rambling of trivia from Ben was annoying. It made you thing he was crazy.  Not one of Patterson's best, in my opinion.
2	1379721600	The book starts of boring trying to get though  I can read his books in a flash this one is not as interesting like all the other twenty books of james Patterson
4	1379721600	Not bad for a fast and easy read.  The story really starts on page one and just keeps going at a fast clip right to the end.  Hard to really get a feeling for the characters, even the main one, but you'll be done reading before you notice that.
1	1379721600	This is about as close to a zero star book as possible. By chapter 13, I still have no interest in  the characters. I don't know if James Patterson sold his name for this book but it does not read and flow like a typical Patterson book. Probably a book I won't waste time to finish.
5	1379721600	This book kept me on the edge of my chair.  I loved it. Would recommend it to all my friends.
3	1379721600	Not one of his best, in my opinion.  WAs hard to get into it - unlike the majority of his other books/characters
4	1379721600	I thoroughly enjoyed the main character, his continued references to history and presidents was very interesting.  The movie quotes brought back lots of memories. The story line kept you guessing through out the book.
4	1379721600	Not his best but ok, I think he is trying to write too many books.  Hope his next book will be better
5	1379721600	Mistress is a book with lots of twists and turns. Just when I thought I had the plot figured out, it would take another turn and go in a different direction. This is one of James Patterson's best novels and I would rate it a &#34;must read&#34;!
5	1379721600	Could n't put it down. Grabs you by the suspenders, even if you are not wearing them. You are held in suspense until the last page!
1	1379721600	I'm so disappointed. This was just ridiculous, contrived, unbelievable, and I really can't believe such nonsense was published. Moreover, that either author would claim responsibility for such drivel. This was worse than a fourth-grader would write and far short of what I expect when I pay for a book.
4	1379721600	Although the book started a little slow, I enjoyed my first James Patterson read.  Definitely didn't see the ending coming!
3	1379721600	Can never say enough about James Patterson books this was another interesting read, but I always prefer Alex Cross series they are exceptional,you be the judge
3	1379721600	This book was ok, but I was disappointed some I don't know what I thought it was but it was just ok
5	1379721600	Great read lots of twist and turns. All his books are like watching an action movie. Can't wait for the next one!
5	1379721600	Well James Patterson is the master of writing any book there is this was well written had me turning the pages love his work
1	1379635200	I was disappointed. The tangent facts made the book dull.  The main character seemed too obsessed with the victim.  He was too strange.
5	1379635200	I liked the entire book.  Another book I couldn't  put down.  It is different from some of his other novels.
5	1379635200	James Patterson at his best, again! The story moved so quickly, I devoured the book in two days! A must-read!
4	1379635200	Absolutely loved this book.  I have purchased a lot of his books and would recommend him to anyone. I would also recommend to anyone try the preview first.  I am certainly glad James Patterson offers this.
4	1379635200	It took me sometime to get into the story,  but when I did.It was excellent.  I liked it  veryMuch.The Mistress
3	1379635200	not the usual from james patterson.  slow to start and jumps around a bit, took a while to get to what the title was about.
5	1379635200	As usual I can never put a James Patterson book down.  I believe I have read almost every one he has written.  I keep the hard covers and have 2 bookshelves of his books now and more to com.e
5	1379635200	This is the first book I've down loaded and found it really easy.  I am a big fan of James Patterson and this book is a good one.
1	1379635200	I love James Patterson books but this one is a terrible read.  I kept reading but finally gave up and if I could I would ask for my money back.
3	1379635200	I didn't find it up to what I expect from a Patterson book.  Not enough story and too much foolishness to suit me.
4	1379635200	I, unlike the other people who have written bad reviews enjoy a new twist. So far I'm half way thru and am enjoying this new read. Just finished Second Honeymoon so it was fresh in my mind. Yes, you do have to think a little more while reading this book but I personally enjoy a change. Keep writing. I have yet to be disappointed. All time favorite is Honeymoon. Catches you from the first chapter.
4	1379548800	I didn't want to it the book  down. Very well written. I would recommend this book to a friend  Superb!
3	1379548800	It was slow getting started and then just too unbelievable with all the accidents, shootings, and chases.  The protagonist was interesting but I never really got into the story.
4	1379548800	Very good story line. Good character development. Wouldn't put the book down after I really got into it. The constant comparisons with movies and movie stars was a waste of time and was boring for me. I found myself skimming these passages.
4	1379548800	I liked this book, but I like James Patterson's other books better. I can't wait until another of the Bennet series becomes  available. James Patterson is always a good read.
3	1379548800	First time l read anything from this author and to begin with l wondered at what all the fuss was. That was until the story just got better and faster and kept up the pace. Three starred it only because the ending was no surprise. James Patterson is interesting enough for me to purchase another of his.
3	1379548800	I still enjoy his books, but not as much.  Maybe it's because he has so many coming out with different authors. Still easy reading with short chapters so you can always put it down when you have too
3	1379548800	Not like the Patterson Books I am used to.................  To many characters, too lengthy, it dragged out terribly.it bogged down.
3	1379548800	I though there were too many flash backs to movies which if you did not see was annoying.  It would have read easier without the constant references.
2	1379548800	I think this is the first time I almost didn't finish one of his books.  I was probably 2/3's through the book before I became interested, enough to finish reading it .
4	1379548800	This was a very convoluted plot but very entertaining --I am sure most of us readers never considered that it was the wife who done him wrong
5	1379548800	This was a very good story, I love to read James Patterson books, the story was well written and it was hard for me to stop, I read the book in two days.
4	1379548800	This story has lots of twists and is Patterson's best work yet.  One has to pay attention to follow the twists, but it is not so complicated you get lost.  He has a great style.  I like the shifting from one person to another and the short chapters.  Easy read.
5	1379462400	One of Patterson's best . Twists and turns at just the right times.  I had no clue what would happen and I am pretty good at guessing what might happen.
5	1379462400	Very surprising turn of events.  The title was misleading but thatwas o.k.  The story kept me reading - finished it in two days
1	1379462400	With jamesWith James Patterson  he sure has some good plots. What a mind he has to write such gripping stories.
3	1379462400	It was just ok. Not the best James Patterson book I've ever read. At first I was really into it and could not put it down. Then it got kinda boring. More political then I prefer. Got sick of being in the main characters brain all over the place
3	1379462400	it was the worst jp has signed his name to. james  Patterson should stop having these other writers working with him and stay with his own characters.
1	1379462400	Inconsistent lead character is probably the most annoying character I've ever encountered in a story. His breaks in thought were far from stream of consciousness, instead, these lapses chop up dialogue and interfere with his inner monologue. This story is entirely predictable. This is the first James Patterson novel I've listened to, and I'm very confident when I say it will be my last. I am wholly underwhelmed and disappointed.
4	1379462400	Mistress is a page turner. The action is fast paced and  just when  you think you know what  Will happen next, the authors surprise you with new information that heads you off in a new direction. The  main character is a likable  in a brilliant,yet ditzy way.  He compares all  situations and characters to those in movies he has seen.  This quirky behavior ,while interesting in the beginning, gets extreme as the tension increases, and he has to tell himself to move on. It is a good read, and the strange fixation of the main character actually increases the intensity in the end ..
5	1379462400	Like any of James Patterson's mysteries.  Never have read a disappointing mystery of his.  Liked everything about it.  Love the thrill of his mysteries.
1	1379462400	I do not like books written in the 1st person, I like conversation between people. I also thought it really had not story and not a bit like James Patterson. It is the 1st of his books that I have not enjoyed.
3	1379462400	I'm not enjoying this one as much as most of Mr. Patterson's books. Started out slow, just hasn't grabbed me yet.  I like his familiar  characters books better than his independent books.
5	1379462400	Mistress kept me guessing the entire read. I loved all of the historical facts and the way Ben's mind worked.
2	1379462400	Just not my type or book. Not that interesting. Not done it yet but can't wait till I am. I'm 3/4 way through it.
1	1379462400	This is Patterson 's worst book. Could not finish it. Movie references were ridiculous.  Book went in too many directions.
4	1379462400	good book, but it wasn't scary like I thought it was supposed to be. Love me some James Patterson. bye
3	1379462400	I probably shouldn't be reviewing this book yet as I have yet not finished it. Unlike all the other James Patterson books, and I have read most of them,  I am having awful trouble getting interested in the main character. I will press on and perhaps update this review when I finish.
4	1379462400	Not as risqu&eacute; as I was lead to believe prior to readin.  It was a good book, like  most of Patterson's work.
5	1379462400	Loved it, but abrupt ending! Never can go wrong with James Patterson! On to the next book! Probably not a Patterson this time!
2	1379462400	The plot was confusing and the main character had a mental disorder which kept him constantly interupting the flow of the plot by reminding himself of former movies or movie stars that he thought were linked to someone or something going on around him.  I found this terribly distracting and definitely did not add to the story line.  I thought the plot was a little confusing in spots and at times totally unrealistic. I know James Patterson co writes with others or probably just edits what others write, but this was not one of his best alliances.  The writer is probably a pretty good writer, but needs to leave out all of the miscellaneous and extraneous verbiage.
2	1379462400	Not as good as expected . Love Patterson novels. Have read most. This was a great disappointment to me. Sorry.
3	1379462400	A little disjointed-hard to follow. The ending was a real surprise making up for any other short comings in the story
5	1379462400	I LOVE ALL OF PATTERSON'S BOOKS, & THIS WAS ONE OF HIS BEST.  COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL FINISHED.
1	1379462400	I am a big JP fan and I just can't wait until he releases another book but after reading this book I am going to have to really review it before I buy another book.  I did not like the main character  and how it was written in first person.  Also all the presidential trivia  became monotonous.  Very disappointed!
5	1379376000	James Patterseon has done it again.  Will be looking forward to see who he teams up with again to co author with.
4	1379376000	Enjoyed Mistress but the movie flashbacks got to be a bit old. Ben was a fun, quirky character. Will he return in another novel?
1	1379376000	I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE PATTERSON WOULD PUT HIS NAME TO THIS BOOK. IT IS SOOOO BAD, STUPID AND BORING.I HAVE BEEN READIN HIS BOOKS FOR YEARS...MOST ALL OF THEM AND NEVER ONE HAS BEEN SO BAD.TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY TO BUY THIS BOOK.
2	1379376000	main character is a movie buff...every chapter has several paragraphs of obscure ( to me) movie references..plot not bad..good for speed readers
4	1379376000	Started off with historical trivia being quoted and I had trouble getting into the book. Once action started my interest was engaged and I found it hard to put the book down till Don. THANKS!
5	1379376000	Slow start but it became a gripping mystery I could not put down. It is why I never pass on a James Patterson book.
3	1379289600	don't really care for this book it is not his usual writing I was surprised that I am not enjoying it as much as his other books
4	1379289600	The book has three stories in one book.. Patterson keeps you on the edge in this one. Poor Ben is used his entire life. Don't guess the ending you will probably be surprised just like Ben !
3	1379289600	The last part is better than the beginning. It keeps you guessing and the main character is constantly on the move. Wholely believable.
4	1379289600	I enjoyed that Mr. Patterson incorporated movies and movie stars comparing some of the characters in this book.  He has not done that in his previous books and it was quite refreshing.
5	1379289600	Rarely do I dislike JP's book and this is no exception.  Took me a few chapters to get into it but I did.  Didn't want to put it down
1	1379289600	I thought it was awful!  I was so disappointed because I usually enjoy Patterson books.  It was so boring and difficult to stay with it.
4	1379289600	A slow starter but once you get into the meat of the story it is quite interesting. I would recommend it.
5	1379289600	I gave this book 5 stars but would give more. I love the main character and the presidential trivia. The politics is something you don't usually see in Patterson's books.
5	1379289600	This book was awesome. I read this book so fast. Haha. But it was worth every penny. Patterson has done it a again. Can wait for Gone!
3	1379289600	The first half of this book is just downright boring, convoluted and badly written.  The protagonist has many movie and presidential facts that he tells us. It becomes a bother to read about all of these musings. They have very little to do with the boring story.  All of a sudden, a little more than halfway through the book, Patterson, smacks you in the face with a twist that you can't see coming, can't believe and the story goes in a totally different direction and the second half of the book is a fun ride on a literary James Patterson roller coaster.  I read very slowly, but was up many times in the middle of the night, wondering what was going to happen to our publishing hero, Ben.  Not one of Patterson's best, but I'm glad I stuck it out.  BTW  "I Like Ike"and loved Kim Novak in "Vertigo."  Read the book and find out what I mean.
5	1379289600	An excellent read by Patterson followers.  Highly recommended!  Friends are waiting in line to read it!  Buy this bestseller now!
5	1379289600	If you like/read James Patterson you will love Mistress.  If  you've never read Patterson, Mistress will be an excellent introduction to his work(s).  I LOVED this book.  Rave about it to all my friends & acquaintances. Mystery at its finest!!!
5	1379289600	Haven't quite finished this yet, but it's so exciting and I can't wait to know the ending.  Good job, Mr. Patterson.
3	1379289600	I am an avid James Patterson fan and have read almost ALL of his books. I must say that I was not as impressed with Mistress as I thought I was going to be. The biggest detractor for me was the scatter brained thoughts of the main character and the jumping around to movie quotes and random thoughts. Once I knew the author was going off on one of these situations, I found myself skipping the actual paragraphs and getting back to the story without reading these random thoughts. It was very distracting and I for one could have done without it.That being said, I will continue to buy and read ALL teh Patterson books I come in contact with as I am still a FAN!!!!!
5	1379203200	Lots of twists and turns...unlike what I thought it would be like.  Enjoyed this page turner immensely!  A must read for you Patterson fans!
1	1379203200	What's with all the movie quotes??I have read and finished all but 2 of Pattersons books, this being one of them...very disappointed.
3	1379203200	I like James Patterson's books.  Always a good read.  His constant referral to movies, plays, television, presidents, etc.....were very much in the way and totally useless for my enjoyments.  I know he was portraying his main character, but it just got in the way.
4	1379203200	Typical Patterson.  A bit slow at first but picked up about half way through.  All the movie quotes were a bit tedious at times.  Did not see ending coming which is why we read this author.
5	1379203200	Brilliant . Keeps u guessing till the end . It is james patterson at his best. I am his number 1 fan
5	1379203200	I loved reading from this perspective.  Kept me guessing ALL the time! Recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery thriller.
5	1379203200	After being hooked on the first 15 chapters free I had to order the book.  It was a page turner that I didn't want to put down.  Wonderful reading.
4	1379203200	A true page turner ... Ben's obsession with trivia was perfect ... it would always make me chuckle out loud even when the storyline was anything but humorous ... lots of wonderful twists and turns to keep you guessing.
1	1379203200	I am a James Patterson fan, but this book was very disappointing. All the "flights of fantasy" taken by the main character, all his movie & presidential trivia got to be very distracting & annoying. It seems like this main character is a mental case. In addition, it is completely unbelievable. The Russians having a big explosion & shoot out right there in Washington over this man MAYBE having a videotape??? Stupid plot. I listened to the end because I spent good money on it & like the author, but was disenchanted to say the least!
4	1379203200	One of the books Patterson writes that I would put in the top 20.  Very enjoyable.  A very easy, fast read and kept my interest throughout.
1	1379116800	I started to read the book and before I knew it, it was over.  Undeveloped characters and when I finished, I felt like I missed a whole part of the book.
1	1379116800	No.  I didn't.  Had to get through so much jibberish to get to the real story.  Took forever.  Very disappointing.
5	1379116800	Enjoyed this book very much! I loved all the presidential trivia they made reference to. The book was finished to quickly!
1	1379116800	Very disappointed in "Mistress" by James Patterson.  Sorry I wasted my money.  Unlike most of his books, which I loved.  Will have to read more carefully before I buy another of his books.
5	1379116800	This is one of the best books Mr. Patterson has ever written and I have read all but 2 of his books. It is right up there with his Alex Cross.
5	1379116800	I LOVE James Patterson and have about 20+ of his books. This one has, to me, comedy in it that most of his other books do not have. If you like the Die Hard movies, RED or Lethal Weapon movies then you will enjoy this book. It has suspense but I found myself laughing out loud at a few parts.
3	1379116800	This book is interesting with an interesting plot.  I don't know what I continue to buy James Patterson.  This is my third book by him, and I am not a big fan of his choppy chapter-happy writing style.  For some reason, I seem to forget his style of writing annoys me and I purchase another of his books a  couple years later.  The plot line is very intriguing which is why I continued to read.
1	1379116800	This book was so bad I proably won't buy another Patterson book.I have read most of his books and felt this one was an insult to hisreaders.
5	1379116800	One of the best I have read recently.  It has a really great story line and holds your attention until the end.
3	1379116800	Decent who-dun-it mystery, a LOT of running around and dodging from assassins, NO sexy/sensuous scenes, cute protagonist. So, overall...  Meh.
4	1379116800	The book has lots of action and plenty of intrigue. The web of conspiracy is a little hard to follow at times, but it's a fun read.
5	1379116800	I gave this book five stars because this book kept me on the edge of my seat, and trying to figure out who did the killing. This is one of the best James Patterson books I have read, and I hope the next ones are just as good.
1	1379116800	I did not like the writing of the book to reference to movies and actors.  It totally took away from the story line.  I got 75 % done and closed the kindle....
3	1379116800	Too much of going into different movie plots etc., and I wasn't please with a couple of pages that were torn and pasted back together during printing.
1	1379030400	One of the worst ever! Don't waste your time or money . it was very hard to read and to finish
3	1379030400	The novel in almost each page makes a reference to an episode of a movie or a cinemma actor. Here and there it will be OK; but not on every page. Many of us did not see those pictures. Thus it is redundantSo many bullets on Ben's Casper and not a single scratch ??? I don't buy the idea.I haven't finish the novel (80%), but I imagine what comes next.Best regards
1	1379030400	this was a very strange and boring book, really had to work to finish it! So not like the normal James Patterson books that I know and Love !
3	1379030400	I usually love James Patterson's books but found this to be difficult to follow at times with too much filler regarding the main characters constant movie lines and talking about the Presidents. It took away from the plot although I realize this was supposed to be part of his personality but I found it distracting because there was too much of it.
2	1379030400	I wasn't a fan...didn't like the tangents the main character went into - thought it was totally unneccessary. Ending not that great either! And I love James Patterson...won't get another one with this co-writer.
1	1379030400	Very hard to follow. Not the best book of Patterson'sTried to give it a chance just could not get into it.
1	1379030400	I read all James Patterson's books that come out. Some you can predict because of his formula.  Usually a quick beach read.  Not impressed.
3	1379030400	The overall plot line was interesting, but I found the narration technique off-putting.  Though there is some didactic dialogue, it wasn't enough to fully engage me.  Patterson has definitely done better work.
4	1379030400	It was ok,  James Patterson is one of my favorite authors.  &#34;Mistress&#34; was not one of my favorites.  Will always keep reading his books.
2	1378944000	IT WAS A RATHER DRY READING.  I HAVE A GOOD &#34;RELATIONSHIP&#34; WITH CROSD, BENNETT AND MURDER CLUB.  I TEND TO COMPARE ALL OTHER CHARACTERS TO MY FAVORITES.
2	1378944000	Not at all like Pattersons writing to many silly parts of him referring to movies and actors.Not worth the price.I would of stopped reading only it was not a cheap one and I had pre-ordered it. Patterson goes on my back shelf after reading Mistress.
5	1378944000	A real page turner that I could not put down.  If you like James Patterson, you will love this book.
5	1378944000	The plot  had a large surprise and the story moved rapidly. I love James Patterson's style of writing. I really do no care about scenery being described
2	1378944000	The story line with the star character being &#34; on the run&#34; from page 1 just doesn't hold water. He evaded everyone with machine guns for days !!!
4	1378944000	It was a little hard to get into, which is unusual for a Patterson book.  But overall I enjoyed it.
5	1378944000	I can't put it down!!! It's been awhile since I've fallen in love with a character like Ben. Can't wait for series.
2	1378944000	The story line was totally unbelievable!  I hated when the character would regress with memory things or facts about Presidents! Not my style of book writing!
3	1378944000	Interesting departure from other books. Enjoyed the light script. Definitely not to be taken as a serious novel. Well paced with twisted humour.
3	1378944000	I thought there were too many unrealistic situations that happened to this guy- and didn't like the ending. Seemed rushed to finish.
5	1378944000	Over all good book. Love Patterson and everything he writes. I look forward to each and every one that comes out.
3	1378944000	In this instalment of Patterson Novel we meet Ben Casper as the protagonist. He has always been in love with his best friend Diana. When he watches her fall from her apartment balcony, he knows for sure that no matter what people say, it was no suicide. Being the owner of an Online Newspaper, Ben's journalistic inquisitiveness kicks in and he starts to investigate the murder. Only the more he digs the more he is confounded as he discovers that Diana was living a double life. Questioning himself about exactly how much he knew his best friend, Ben continues his quest as the plot just gets bigger and bigger as the people involved in Diana's second life start to fall prey to mysterious accidents costing their lives.Ben Casper is an interesting character. He is paranoid and somewhat crazy. Whenever under stress, Ben rattles off trivia like a maniac. Some of his dialogues in the book are outright funny. Ben grabs your attention in the very first chapter as he goes about installing hidden cameras in Diana's apartment. Then as he goes off investigating the murder, he had me either cheering him or wanting to smack him for his very foolish ideas. The plot is huge. The Chinese, the Russians and even the President of America are involved in it. Though it may sound way too unrealistic at times, I love these larger than life situations when I am reading a fictional work.Full of action, drama, suspense and a bit of romance, this novel has every element of a page turner. I just wish that the ending was a bit different and a bit more plausible.
3	1378857600	Found it to be an easy &#34;beach&#34;read. Far fetched, I would like to have felt more invested in Ben.  His character a bit shallow and undeveloped.
4	1378857600	A little different for James Patterson, but very engaging.  I was surprised at each twist and turn....right up to the very end!
4	1378857600	Good book. I'd recommend reading this! Didn't really see the book ending like that thought. It was a good ending!
5	1378857600	Boy I did not see that coming, what a great suspenseful read.  Mistress is nothing like the title suggests, it's more about spies and terrorists
5	1378857600	Thought I had it figured out! You will enjoy this James Patterson book as you have enjoyed all his other ones like I have !
5	1378857600	I am so amazed that I can say great things about this book.For many of the first chapters I was shocked at the unusual style of writing.However,as the book continued I felt great empathy for the lead character. I am really sorry it had to end.l can truly say that James Patterson has another success.
4	1378857600	I liked this book even though it wasn't a typical  Patterson novel. It seemed like a John Grisham book. I liked Ben and his use of trivia and love of Seinfeld. I thought he was endearing and kind of charming. Of course you have to suspend belief for the whole story, but it was still entertaining. Hard to put down!
4	1378857600	James Patterson is always a good read. This book is easy to read and has some cool twists. Always fun to read this author.
1	1378857600	I am still trying to read it.What has happened to James Patterson.?  Is he on drugs or something?First Honeymoon, then Second Honeymoon and now Mistress.  All 3 not up to par. They just bounce all over the place.I have read just about all his books and am very disappointed in these last 3.I am looking for a new author .  Any suggestions?I only gave it 1 star because I could not submit with no stars.
3	1378857600	I felt it moved slowly until the last 100 pages.  His previous books have me captured in the first 10 pages.I am a big fan of James Patterson et. al. but his one was not up to the usual level of suspense .
5	1378771200	I just finished reading &#34;Mistress&#34; by James Patterson.  Talk about intrigue, how does a reporter get himself mixed up with the CIA, the Russians and possible the Chinese?  Read this book.  Of course, if you are a James Patterson fan as I am, you always know that he takes his readers on a ride that is constantly up and down and whirling all around.  This could become a motion picture with plenty of characters that we can possibly name.  What I enjoyed the most about this book was that Ben Casper, the reporter, just would not give up on trying to find out the whole story, and while it took some time to put the pieces together, he relentlessly followed his heart.  You will be quite surprised.  Get this book!
4	1378771200	Typical Patterson.. Well done , as usual.I really enjoyed this book.  I will keep reading his books for s long as it takes.
4	1378771200	I like the drama in between the ( not so great) constant references to song, movies, etc.It takes away from what is happening (it is a filler to extend the story).
5	1378771200	I liked the crazy narrative and the story's movement.  The narration takes the reader for a good ride!  It's a great quick read for all Patterson fans.  Read it!
4	1378771200	this was a bit different to some of his other stories .was easy to follow and held me enthralled to the end
1	1378771200	This is one of his novel's I did not like! To loon, to many characters, and toooo many situations! Bring back ALEX!
5	1378771200	It is a roller coaster ride that keeps your attention at every turn.  Love the way the authors wove Congress & government through the journey
5	1378771200	Loved the pop culture references, loved the humor, loved the suspense, loved the romance. Wish I had 5 more just like it in queue right now.
2	1378771200	I usually love James Pattersons books but did not enjoy this one, I just did not care for the book.
5	1378771200	Took me a while to get into this book but once I did couldn't put it down!Well worth it!!
5	1378771200	I love James Patterson's books.  This was another page turner.  Keep them coming.  I always like the short chapters and each one ends and you can't stop reading.
2	1378771200	Not typical James Patterson. Wasn't interested after reading the sample to buy the book. Disappointed. So look forward to new releases
1	1378771200	too much reference related to old movies and presidents. could have left that all out. not quite finished reading yet.  very disappointing.
1	1378771200	I was supper excited to read this book and found that I was let down very quickly. Didn't take long to realize I didn't like this book. This is the first book by James Patterson that I have been disappointed in. Sorry to say but had to make myself finish reading it.
4	1378771200	As usual, I was captivated. Never read a book quite like this but I enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to several of my friends and my Mom.
5	1378771200	a really good book.  I can't get enough of Jame Patterson.  I hope he never stops writing.  I look forward to his books.
5	1378771200	I love all of James Patterson's books. I usually cannot put them down and read into wee hours. I have read almost all of his books. I really enjoy reading them on my Kindle.
1	1378771200	I stopped reading after the third chapter. I was tired of the minutia details of US Presidents' quirks. It did not read like Patterson written novel.
1	1378771200	Yes Mr. Patterson where is the beef, character development, location development. Your writer, if he can be called a writer, forgot what  makes a book great. It's the small stuff! Now take a first time writer like Mary Louise Kelley, she filled her book with all the small stuff. Your writer needs to read her book.
5	1378771200	I have read almost all of Patterson's books and this one was one of my favorites.  The story line held my attention and I read the book in less than three days after work  because I didn't want to put it down and kept anticipating the next twist in the plot.  Great read and worth the time spent.
3	1378771200	Fairly suspenseful, but pretty much what you expect these days from James Patterson. Why doesn't he just write total books himself? his first ones were pretty darn good if I recall.
2	1378771200	Written by rote. The president's wife was characterized as a &#34;wooden &#34; doll and that's the description. The story reminded of the Obourne series. Do waste your money. I wish I hadn't
4	1378771200	I was a bit disappointed in this James Patterson.  It had a good story line but the main character rather drove me bonkers quoting lines from movies continuously.  I pretty much skipped over there references because it had nothing to do with the story.
4	1378684800	Fast, entertaining read, although, at times I felt that the main character's ramblings went a bit too far.  Patterson, and his co-author, keeps the reader interested with twists, turns and action throughout.  (How many books does Patterson actually write?  Seems like most of them are co-authored, which leads me to believe that he might come up with an idea and throw it out to his cadre of writers to complete the project!)
4	1378684800	This is one of James Patterson collaboration books that took some time to get hooked but finally the story picked up and became a good read.
3	1378684800	Took a couple of chapters to get into the flow, found some areas slow and very drawn out also confusing in some parts
3	1378684800	Didn't seem to be the usual way that James Patterson books read, but I'll read anything he writes!!!  Have never read anything I regretted!
5	1378684800	I enjoy reading books that I can picture where they are.  I also like mystery / suspense type books.  I recommend it highly.
3	1378684800	I was not impressed with this book.  A very slow read.  Patterson was not at his best on this one.
5	1378684800	I love James Patterson.  He is an excellent author and I never tire of reading his books.  I was on pre-order for this book.
3	1378684800	story line was slow. did not live up to hype. patterson is much better than this. was not a page turner like other books of his. i know he will do better, maybe he should re-read the book himself!!
4	1378684800	A surprising last few chapters! A real page turner or should I say,  a fast skipper! I enjoyed it a lot.
3	1378684800	Disappointed!!!  I am a die heart James Patterson fan but this one was just okay.  If I had know before hand what it was about, I would not have gotten it.  I will however continue to read his books...  I guess you can't strike a hundred on every book....
2	1378684800	Over the years and after reading aboout all of James Patterson w/ partners or not, Mistress wasthe worst! I have enjoyed all the previous bookls I do not reccomend this book!F, Hileman
5	1378684800	Read every chance I could really a major page turner.  Hope it's a movie someday.  Read this book you won't be able to put it down
5	1378684800	I really liked it becaues it kept you waiting for the next page. The ending is a surprise something you don't expect.
4	1378684800	Great read really enjoyed the story. I always read last thing at night this book kept me turning pages long after I was sleepy.
5	1378684800	you didn't want to put it down once you started to read it.  all of those who like suspense stories this one was very good
3	1378598400	I am a big fan of Patterson and read almost all of his books. But this time for me he missed the mark and I was disappointed. I didn't like the ending.
3	1378598400	Disappointed!!  I'm a great fan of Patterson's books, but I was greatly disappointed with this one,  usually his books have me from the first few chapters, but this one had TOO many movie and actor references.
3	1378598400	I usually don't read patterson's books. Not even when I am bored to tears and there is nothing else to read. His writing style usually kind of reminds me of the want ads. The plot in this one is very much a boilerplate thriller story.I had the big secret figured out halfway through the book. And parts of the ending felt copied from two really popular john grisham books.But the main characters especially  ben makes the book.Ben seems like he might have attention deficit disorder and has these constant sometimes hilarious racing thoughts which makes his brain work like google. I like all the little bizarre tidbits about pop culture and the presidents. Like coolidge enjoyed having his head shined with vaseline while he ate breakfast in bed and adams like to go skinnydipping. Who knew ?This would make a better movie.The short cute guy from its always sunny in philadelphia would be perfect as ben.
4	1378598400	The book was good, but I am a big fan of The Woman's Murder Club and Alex Cross. The book was a good read though.
2	1378598400	Patterson books were amazing, then he started being strictly out for the money by taking in all these other &#34;writers&#34;Talk about something being fiction, this could take the award for most rediculous.
4	1378598400	This was a happy departure from the typical very quick Patterson read.  I was pleased with the plot and characters.
1	1378598400	This book lacked the normal JP intrigue and drama. The story line is unrealistic, a totally forgettable read from James Patterson.
1	1378598400	I used to make it a point to finish every book I read. No matter how godawful. This book made me change all that. It was such a crappy book! My God, the guy has ADD and is rattling off president's foibles and quirks.I wanted to check out a Patterson book, everyone raves about him. No thanks, no thanks
4	1378598400	twenty words are seventeen words to many, when just three words will do, such as &#34;I liked it. Does that satisfy your requirements?
4	1378598400	Good reading. After the firs day I had trouble putting it down. Enjoyed all sub plots and the story. Generous to the reader.
1	1378598400	This was the worst James Patterson book I have read.  I can't believe he actually worte it.  It was a waste of time and money.
3	1378598400	The main character's flight of ideas made it difficult to get into the book.  Once I did, it was less annoying.  In the early part of the book, it made the character seem more disturbed than a serious journalist.
2	1378598400	I love James Patterson Books!!! But this one just didn't do it for me unfortunately!! It was boring in my opinion  a friend though really liked it. I never got invested in the character of the book!
5	1378598400	James Patterson always seems to write thriller after thriller and this one is no exception. I don't think Ive  ever read a Patterson book that I didn't like. This one takes his usual twists and turns. Buy it if you're a Patterson fan. If you like Patterson you will probably enjoyLee Child as well.
1	1378598400	They said it is his best since the quickie. I read the quickie and it waa awesome. Waisted my money on this and I am a HUGE James Patterson fan.
1	1378598400	I must say, he has written better books. Normally I can read his books in 2 days, this book took me 3 weeks, it kept putting me to sleep. To be honest this book is probably one of the worst books I have ever read by him, next to The Zoo.
2	1378598400	the story has way to many twists and turns and the main character with his constant president trivia becomes boring very fast .the ending is horrible it just drops you off a cliff
5	1378512000	I just started reading James Patterson, now I'm hooked.  This book had so many twists and turns.  I hope all his writing is like this.  Kept me guessing  He developed the characters well too.  I can see this as a TV movie.
5	1378512000	Loved Mistress;  Another winner by James Patterson.  Difficult to get anything else done as the book kept pulling me back.
5	1378512000	James Patterson  is a brilliant writer in that his novels are so easy to be a part of. He draws the scenes so well I feel as if I am a part of the story.  The Mustress is no exception to his talent.
3	1378512000	I did not like the references to actors and movies it took away from the story line. I did pass over these parts, did not read them, was not interested in the movies or actors. Hope he does not write like this again.
5	1378512000	Another great read by JP. Can hardly wait from one book to another. I started this and did not like it. Waited a few days and started over kept an open mind. It soon got to the "can't-put-it-down stage.
5	1378512000	exciting to read...storyline excellent...suspenseful...could not put it down..wondering how it would end & it ended the way i hoped it would....
3	1378512000	I'm a stone Patterson fan. Read all or most of his - even other collaborations. However, I thought this was one of Patterson's books that made it obvious there was more than one author and as a result, more than one style to weave together. Parts of the book were repetitive and drawn out. I loved the story; it was just a bit tedious telling it.
5	1378512000	Loved the twists & turns this book takes, hard to put down!!Seemed very possible all this could happen!! Loved it!!
5	1378512000	Great read. Keeps you coming back for more.  Love this author and does not disappoint as always. Highly recommend this book.
5	1378512000	1 of my favorite Patterson stand alone. Hard to set down. If you like suspense mystery you will love this read.
2	1378512000	I just couldn't wait to finish it and get it over with. I'm a true fan of Patterson but this was the worst book he has written.
3	1378512000	I read it fast, just because I wanted to get to the end and see what happened, but I wasn't thrilled w/this James Patterson book.  Too much going on, it was all over the place, nothing like his usual books.  Looking forward to the new Michael Bennett book coming out at the end of the month.
5	1378512000	Eas total ally surprised at the ending. Lots of action and very intriguing. It kept your mind wondering through the whole story of what the hell was really going on.
2	1378512000	This was really difficult reading,  David Ellis is nowhere up to James' status and I feel, pulled him down on this one.
4	1378512000	Good read. Would tell anyone to buy this book. Good story line that keeps you there page after page. thanks
5	1378512000	The best book so far from James Patterson.  He is a master storyteller.  I'd say this book is one you can't put down until the end..  Can't wait for his next book.
2	1378512000	Mistress was way off base for James Patterson. I could not finish the book.  So disappointing and a waste of time.
2	1378512000	Slow starter, too much unimportant detail. James Patterson always has a fairly exciting and interesting book. so far t his one is just not his usual work.
4	1378512000	I like most anything James Patterson has a hand in writing.  I liked the book and the story.  It isn't the best I have ever read but it kept my interest and i enjoyed reading it.
3	1378512000	Not the page turner that I am used to but still a good read. The content is engaging enough for light reading when you want to relax.
4	1378512000	Another fast paced well crafted Patterson mystery with lots of twist of plot. Most entertaining with a lots of interesting past plots.
3	1378512000	too many references to movies. I wonder if it was it just to add verbage and pages to the volume of the book?
2	1378512000	it was too calm not enough suspense usually I can't put the book down it is so good, will wait for his new book, where is Alex Cross they were good?
5	1378512000	Mistress by James Patterson was very much different to his usual mystery  stories.It was written in the first person, fast moving and gripping.For those of you who love Patterson I suggest give it a try as you will be greatly pleased.Mind you it takes a little while to get into the method of story-telling engaged by James,but it is worth it.
5	1378512000	In his latest thriller, James Patterson does not disappoint.  His latest thriller plays on the mind of the obsessed and keeps the reader guessing--is it real or is it....
5	1378512000	This book is a great read, it had everything in it to make an exciting, thrilling, edge of my seat read.
3	1378512000	Was not my favorite book. Just could not keep my interest. It was slow reading and was a little boring
3	1378512000	I found this book slow...not the page turner you expect from Patterson..I love movies so the refrence to actors and movies was fun but if you aren't in to that stuss ( my husband) you will feel boged down....I did see the turn coming however..
1	1378512000	OMG, I just finished this book last night and it was all I coulddo to keep reading.  I hated to waste $12 or whatever it wasso I was determined to read it.  I must say it was the most boringand confusing book I've read in a long time.  Patterson just keeps turning outbooks with co-authors and they progressively are getting worse.I'm done with Patterson.  How he could come up with such apoor story line is beyond me.
2	1378512000	Bottom line: Mistress is not worth your time. Ben, the narrator and lead character, is in every scene.  Since he annoyingly rambles throughout the novel and goes off an constant tangents, I felt like he would be the worst person to sit next to on a plane - nice but won't shut up.  I borrowed the audio CDs from the library to listen to in my car and found myself happy when I would finally get home, whereas with other books I'm so engaged I bring the CDs inside to keep listening.  I rated this book a 2 rather than a 1 for a couple of reasons.  Primarily, I added a point because the actor who performed the audio version did an excellent job and his voice was well-suited for the character he was portraying. (I hope to hear him again when he is given better material to work with.)  Also, the last 1/4th of the book moved a little better than the rest of it.  Overall, however, the plot was completely implausible and I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5	1378425600	I had read the book and enjoyed it so much, I sent a copy to my cousin since they had to wait for it in their library's queue.
4	1378425600	Huge Patterson fan... but this book seemed to drag a little for me... especially in the beginning! Half way through it picked up and became the Patterson page-turner that I love!  Had some interesting twists that I didn't see coming!  It's a good read!
3	1378425600	Kept me turning the pages but not typical Patterson style...seems he is making a boat load of money by just adding his name to all these other writers books..??
2	1378425600	This is the worst of Patterson's novels.  The constant references by the main character to old movies while literally running for his life does not make sense at all.  Very disappointing.  Hope GONE is better.
5	1378425600	Very suspenseful read.  Really enjoyed it.  One of his best.  I always look forward to his books.  He is a master story teller.
2	1378425600	I usually really enjoy Patterson's books, even those that are co-authored.  This one was nonsense from the very beginning.  Nothing but a lot of comparisons to different movies and movie stars.  Found myself skimming ahead just to get past these.  A waste of time and money.
1	1378425600	Wow, I keep looking at the cover to make sure it's a Patterson book. I'm sure glad I got at the library and didn't pay for it. I've read almost everything he's written and aside from 2 very early books this is the worst. Not sure if I will even keep reading it.
3	1378425600	Good book but hard to read,because the character kept rambling on about different subjects like movie stars and the film's they were starring in.
5	1378425600	Loved it-love James Patterson. A must read! Intriguing. Read it in 2hours. Anyone will enjoy this novel by JP. Read it!
3	1378425600	I would reccomend this book.The mail character is interesting . Fast paced and lots of action.Hard to figure out until the end.
3	1378425600	Not as exciting and suspenceful as his other books. It took me longer than usual to get through this one.  But I'm still a huge fan of James Patterson.
5	1378425600	Excellent book. I started reading it and couldn't put this one down!  This is one of Patterson's best books yet!
3	1378425600	Mistress is a highly imaginative story of the horrifying tricks that the government can impose on citizens, and how agencies' arrogance and lack of willingness to work together have costly consequences. While I have read enough accounts of how our government agencies focus on their survival at any cost, Patterson's story is weakened by how he involves his man character, a publication editor, in a set of events that are totally unrealistic. Furthermore, to me the sign of a good story is when outcomes to critical story issues are well blended into the story, or allowed to hang for the reader's imagination. Instead, Patterson adds supplemental chapters at the end of the book to explain many events that should have been dealt with throughout the story. The end is like an appendix of explanations for critical story events that the author needed to clean up but could not figure out how to do so during the body of the story.
5	1378425600	Very well written. Keeps you wondering who and what. Could not wait to get to the end. Really enjoyed reading this book.
5	1378339200	I admit I'm not a big James Patterson fan and my opinion did not change for most of this book. BUT, the final chapters convinced me that I can list Mistress as one of my favorites of all writers. I was completely caught off guard that it would be this good.
5	1378339200	A little weird at the beginning but picked up and was a good book. Kept me wondering what was going to happen next.
5	1378339200	James Patterson does it again with another thriller, can't put down,  bestseller  how  he does it  I will n ever know,he as long  he keeps writing I will keep reading
3	1378339200	A good typical Patterson.  Exciting and keeps you guessing until the end when it ties up all the loose ends.
1	1378339200	I really tried to like this book. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it, then I would have been able to buy something I would enjoy.At chapter 10 I gave up. I wish I could get my money back.James Patterson should be ashamed to put out this drivel.
3	1378339200	I call myself one of James Patterson's biggest fans. I have read almost every single book he has written.  In my humble opinion this was not one of the best.  The storyline was good but the main character did to much rambling.
5	1378339200	I started out thinking I was exactly like the narrator--mind jumping off in all directions, and probably a clear case of adult ADHD. By the end i was wondering what else could possibly happen to this guy, and then something else would. I really wasn't ready for the plot twist at the end. Great read.
3	1378339200	This is not one of Patterson's best book.I could tell that Mr. Ellis had a hand in it. Towards the middle it did pick up and I really couldn't put it down. Mr Peterson.....do one on your own next Tim. Gotta go as and get the new Alex Cross! Now those are good reads!!!!!!
1	1378339200	This book was extremely disappointing.  This was the worst book I have ever read by James Patterson and his co-author.  The entire story was unrealistic.  The main character quoting lines from authors, movies, celebrities etc. was boring.
5	1378339200	I downloaded this to my kindle and read it last week while I was on vacation.  It is such an easy way to take some books with me.
3	1378339200	A protagonist with ADHD & a bottomless trust fund helps the storyline move forward.  Otherwise, it was a fun romp that kept my attention albeit unbelievable at times.  Set in Washington DC, Benjamin is the owner online political newspaper & rubs elbows with the &#34;movers & shakers.&#34;  But, he never expected to be framed for murder & involved with secrets that go all the way to the top.  A delightful  diversion, but a little superficial.
3	1378339200	This book wasn't as good as what it was revved to be. It only got good more than 2/3 of the way through. I expected it to be much better.
3	1378339200	At  first I didn't think I liked it. The main character is all over the place.  Songs, movies etc.. going on in his head..  I thought he was autistic or something.  I kept reading  the book, it was actually enjoyable.
1	1378339200	Not one of my James Patterson.  I don't know what has happened but his earlier books were the best reads.
3	1378339200	I would be so happy if James Patterson went back to never writing without &#34;guest writers&#34; and just wrote a few books a year all by himself. I find much of his work watered down and silly and very thin story lines since he started churning them out on a monthly basis with guest writers. Even the ones he writes alone now are not up to the quality of his early works.MIstress was all over the place. I found if I read every third or forth paragraph I could finish the story. The babbling and ADD ramblings were confusing and silly and boring and wore me out. The story itself was an okay concept but I missed the old James Patterson telling it. I was determined to read it but it was a chore.I fell in love with the Alex Cross novels and the Women's Murder Club. These were great books and I could rarely see the end coming. Not so anymore. Only when he writes by himself is there a good reason to buy works. My bookshelves and/or my Kindle have all his books with the exception of the ones for teens. The older books are worth reading more than once. Mistress and other new ones are not worth the time, trouble or money.
5	1378339200	This book was quite a surprise. At first I wasn't sure I would like it. But I did! What a fun ride this was! Definitely one I would recommend.
2	1378339200	&#34;The Mistress&#34; has too much side tracking in to unrelated history and other subjects. The side tracking broke the continuity of the story so much that I lost interest.
5	1378339200	As par for the course, Patterson has hit another hole in one.  The inclusion of a tough female and the hussle-bussel male cop melded for  &#34;I can't put this book down.&#34; once again.  Keep them coming Mr. Patterson---your better than anything on the telly.  How about a few &#34;james Paterson&#34; movies?Bill Leistnerbsalott@wildblue.net
3	1378339200	Still don't understand the formula for &#34;co-writers). Semms he put together an outline and the &#34;co-writer&#34; fills from there. Didn't like this writer's style, had some annoying ticks.
5	1378339200	Non stop intrigue, could not put it down. Have read dozens of his books this is the best so Far
5	1378339200	Great bookNever figured out the ending. I recommend it for anyone. Not his usual flare but still great to read
5	1378339200	This book kept my interest from beginning to end. The characters were relatable. The ending, common to this author's style was a twist but believable and satisfying.
3	1378339200	I am a die hard James Patterson fan and order his books when they come out.  However, I was a little disappointed in this book.  I really couldn't get interested in it and, thus. stopped reading it when I was about 1/4 through it.  The writing didn't seem to be the quality that James Patterson has done In his other novels.  I will still continue to order his books when they become available, and this is the first time I've felt that a book of his didn't deserve a minimum of 4 or 5 stars.
1	1378339200	Whats going on with James Patterson? This book was garbage. Dragged out, dull, and boring. He's starting to get like an assembly line, spitting out junk!
3	1378252800	I was disappointed in this book.  The title was misleading to me.  It took me longer to read then it usual does with James Patterson books.
4	1378252800	Have always liked novels by James Patterson. This book kept me interested the whole way to the end. Very surprising ending.
5	1378252800	I look forward to James Patterson's summer releases and this was one of his best.  Must read for any fan.
5	1378252800	Absolutely couldn't put this one down.  One of his best.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes to sit on the edge of their sear.
1	1378252800	This was the worse book James Patterson has written.  Get rid of helpers and do books yourself!  I will be careful getting any more of his books.
2	1378252800	I think I have read just about EVERY James Patterson book so obviously I am a BIG fan!  I can't say I've disliked any of his books... until now!  Mistress is a train wreck.  The storyline was good but the NON STOP trivia and rants about past Presidents, movies and TV shows got to be outright annoying!  I felt like I was watching Jeporady and not reading a Patteron book.  Don't waste your money on this one!
1	1378252800	I thought this was one of the worst books I ever read.  I love Mr. Patterson's work ordinarily, but I feel he just signed off on this book without really going over it
4	1378252800	When reading the other reviews, I was quite surprised to find so many that didn't like this book.  I found the main character's thought processes intriguing, and entertaining.  It is quite different from other Patterson books, and quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of Alex Cross, I find I can figure out the clues long before he does.  Anyway to get back to the Mistress, I thought the plot kept unfolding with new info all the way through.  Made it a page turner.  And as far as the chapters being longer?  Who Cares!  I read the whole book, and pause wherever I want, I don't have to stop at the end of a chapter, that's what bookmarks are for.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes plot twists and turns in a thriller, one that keeps you guessing, and that you have to keep reading to the end.
4	1378252800	But very interesting. Holds your attention with lots of wry humor. Another good Patterson read. Looking forward to more collaboration.
4	1378252800	I read all of James Patterson..this was one of the better ones...The new lead character was interestingThey are easy,fast reads..
4	1378252800	my first book by Patterson and I can say it is a god one to start with. Easy to follow, although his references to songs and lyrics can get annoying.
3	1378252800	It would have been a good book if the writer hadn't kept referring to movies and actors.  That took my interest away from the main story.
2	1378252800	Not even a mediocre effort from Patterson.  Surprised his name is on it!  Can't force myself to finish.  Wish I'd spent the money elsewhere.
1	1378252800	This is the worst book I've ever read by James Patterson.  He is my favorite author.  I couldn't even finish it.  I am stunned.
5	1378252800	I first got into Patterson's fiction as audio books because they're great for road trips. One book gets me to Chicago; it takes two for the round trip. I got this one on my Kindle and it's as good or better than most of the others I've &#34;read.&#34;
1	1378252800	Ben is obsessed with Diana, a woman he can never have, especially since Diana is found dead outside her apartment. Ben's obsession urges him to find out who killed Diana and why. He soon discovers she was leading a double life: a sweet Midwestern girl, and a manipulative mistress in the political world of Washington DC. Someone, presumably Diana's killer, is determined to stop Ben from finding out the truth. And so the chase and hunt begins.**throws hands up and closes eBook** Yes, that is correct. I didn't even finish reading Mistress. There are way too many books in my TBR pile to waste time reading this disappointment. "Scariest, sexiest standalone thriller" my ass. I made a bad decision reading this standalone book with the ASSumption it would be good. You can miss this read.Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
1	1378252800	Would have given it less then 1star if I could have.  Boring story line. James Patterson usually hooks you right off, not with this one.
3	1378252800	I didnt care for the reference he had to all the actors, movies, pres. Wasnt necessary.I usually like James Patterson, but this one was just so so.
2	1378252800	Not a typical Patterson novel.  Very slow moving.  Hard to keep my interest.  Here are your 7 more words that are required.
3	1378252800	Not his best work. The situation was improbable with a Russian and an American spy as the heavies. It just seemed improbable to me although the action was good.
3	1378252800	Don't think it is one of James Patterson's best.  The book did hold my interest and I managed to finish it.
5	1378252800	I liked the tool immensely. I have found that it sharpens everything from knives to scissors to hoes to axes including tools with serrated blades.  It is one of the handiest pieces of sharpening equipment I own. I own. I will be buying one as a gift for each of my two sons.
1	1378252800	How does this work? Does Mr. Patterson rent his name to various authors withoiut name recognition for a percentage of sales?
4	1378252800	The characters were well developed as was the plot. It kept the reader wondering why all the things were happening to the main character. I rather liked the references to historical trivia as he was pursuing the cause of his ills.
1	1378166400	After struggling through then first seven chapters, I tossed the book into my charity pile.  The story is dull and ridiculous and each page is filled with presidential facts and movie trivia, which is annoying. Once I read the first few awful chapters, I flipped to the cover to make sure I was reading a Patterson novel.  That's when I discovered it was co-written with another author.  I love Patterson, but do not plan to buy any more of his co-authored books.  I wish I would have downloaded the free mini version to my Kindle instead of wasting my money!
5	1378166400	Slow to engage me at first but once it did I hated to put it down.Interesting main character, hope we see him again in anotherbook.
5	1378166400	Five star because I was so into the book that  I read it in 2 days book this size wold normally take  week.Thought at first no go and by the 5th chapter you had meGreat thriller and suspense was faster to see at is coming.My sister would enjoy
2	1378166400	It took me half the book to really get into it.  It's not the usual J. Patterson read.  I was expecting a lot more and no way did I feel like I was reading a thriller.
2	1378166400	Not my favorite to slow I have read so many of his books in the passed and this one just didn't do it for. I wii continue to read his books still enjoy most of his works
5	1378166400	I loved this book Mistress... Could not put it down at the same time I didn't want it to finish.  I believe this is one of his Best books.
1	1378166400	I did not like it al all!The worst James Patterson book I have ever read.  I did not like the way it was written. The main character kept referring to various movies.
5	1378166400	I chose this rating because the book kept my attention until the last page. I t was a great who,s who,s mystery and it made you want to read so you could find out what was going on and what was going to happen next, and who was behind all the killings. I would recommend this book to my friends to read a very good job.
1	1378166400	I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this book, it is awful, very boring, a bunch of drivel. Patterson ought to stick to writing alone.
5	1378166400	This book went to a place in the mind that most authors don't go. The character was written from a place of mental confusion at times, and utter intelligence at others. Other customers should be aware that this is not like other books James Patterson has written. It does tend to keep you on the edge of your seat though. A very good read.Marlene Kittel
5	1378166400	I tend to buy James Patterson books because of the way they grab you from the beginning and do not let go. This one was no disappointment! If i had one complaint it would be that it was so good i couldn't put it down and read it too fast. You are given all the facts throughout the book but they do not come together until the very end. The short chapters are a great technic in keeping you interested and jumping from fact to fact quickly.I could not put this one down and enjoyed the character building and vivid descriptions tremendously.
5	1378166400	Fast paced, edge of your seat, scare you to death action from the beginning.  His best book so far and I've read them all.
5	1378166400	Never wanted to put it down. I haven't found any James Patterson books I haven't liked. Some that aggravate me the way they end but over all I love all of his books. I think I have read almost all of his books. I would recommend any of his books.
5	1378166400	James Patterson is the best. His books always keep me on the edge if my seat. I am sorry when I reach the end of each one. I always looked forward to the next one!!!  Superb is the only word to describe him and the other authors he collaborates with.
5	1378166400	I have read many of the Patterson books but &#34;Mistress&#34; was one of my most enjoyable. A very interesting, quirky main character. The ending was a big surprise.  I could not put it down. I read it on my Kindle and my finger was nonstop flipping pages. I highly recommend it. A little different and very enjoyable.
5	1378166400	best patterson book in a long time....it is begging to be a movie.....action and heart. lots of research went into all the trivia.  i loved it
3	1378166400	I was disappointed in this book, I wish it had been developed more. The idea was good but just not the depth that is usually found in the characters and plot. It was OK, just not the usual excellent that I have come to expect
3	1378166400	Sorry.  I  was really disappointed with this book.  I've read every Patterson book published and have liked all except this one and Zoo.  Don't know if he is letting the associate writer do most of the thought process or what, but it's just not Patterson as we know him to be.
4	1378166400	Wasn't sure if this book was for me. All new characters to learn BUT what a fast paced read. I didn't want to put it down. So many twists and turns left me wanting more. Definitely worth a look.
1	1378080000	I usually really enjoy his books. This one is really bad. I would not recommend it. It truly drags on.
4	1378080000	Loved this book; James Patterson really is an excellent writer. I have not read any of his books without loving it.
5	1378080000	I love it, absolutely great story, enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next new novel, Mistress was great!! What's next from author.
5	1378080000	The characters were unbelievably well developed and the situations Ben found himself embroiled in were pulse pounding and unexpected.  I couldn't put it down. The self talk Ben engaged in was informative and engaging, and my only complaint is that i ended before I was ready to have it end.  Excellent! Patterson & Ellis turn in a page turner, for sure!
3	1378080000	Another great James Patterson, I'm a huge fan, but the main characters thoughts that go back and forth are very distracting. Still a great read, just not one of the best.
1	1378080000	I put it in the trash can.....gave up last night! Have always enjoyed his novels but the movie/tv inserts are very distracting.
2	1378080000	Wasn't one of pattersons best books. Found I had to really push myself to finish it. Might just be because I'm not into politics
1	1378080000	I agree with every bad review written about this novel.Mr Patterson---there are just some people that you should not associate with when it comes to writing books.I hope that Mr Ellis's attorney skills are better than his writing skills.SJT
3	1378080000	This is different from other James Patterson books.  I haven't finished it yet but I find it hard to get into.  I am more than 50% through it and it is getting better but it is far from his best work!!  It's okay but not great!  I'm disappointed.
5	1378080000	A story of courage and valor clothed in blackmail, sex tapes and espionage. Ben Casper our very reluctant hero is set-up by his father, his lover, the head of the CIA, but not by his country. This amazing story, filled with underhanded secrecy, car chases and murder, is almost playing second fiddle to the enormity of the United States Government and it's enemies in the current world situation.
5	1378080000	James Patterson and co-writers us the same formula but always deliver the story that gets me involved.  The chapters are short and make for easy reading.
3	1378080000	I have always liked James Patterson's books.  However, this did not meet up to my expectations.  Just average in my opinion.
4	1378080000	I thought twice about reading this book because some bad reviews were given to it.  However, I found it a good mystery, thriller with a tad romance thrown it.  I never figured things out until nearly the ending.  There was also humor thrown in which I totally enjoyed.  Good book!!!
4	1378080000	Kept my interest, was engaged throughout.  Combined humor with intrigue and mystery right up to the end.  Great lead character.
5	1378080000	As always James Patterson came through with a hit. This book held my attention all the way through . I recommend
3	1378080000	it was forgetable so I WILL HAVE TO READ IT AGAIN Can't think of 6 more words to write about it.
5	1378080000	I cant believe all the varied reviews from 5* to 1* but I have to say I agree with the 4 & 5 however some peoples expectations are different so my 3 might be a 5 for someone else! Anyway it was a great book, quick events, page turner and couldn't put it down 400 pgs so for me that ranks at least 4.5 for anyone who can keep me not wanting to put the book down.  Ben is the main character and finds himself in a jam when the woman he works with and is in love with takes a dive off her balcony.  He flips out and then becomes on a mission to find out what happened and why! He is hunted, shot at, beaten up and on the run but he wont stop for money or anything or anyone till he finds that truth! And boy does he by the end and was quite a surprise for me! Great job Mr. Patterson and Mr. Ellis! Was not quite as good as Quickie but darn close :) 5* and I recommend this to Patterson fans!
4	1378080000	I enjoyed the book very much. Well written. The one criticism that I would have for the author is that the title is a bit misleading.
4	1378080000	never a failure with james Patterson. the characters are so alive, almost seems like reading about someone you met in your past.
5	1378080000	The whole book kept you wanting more!! I couldnt put it down, each chapter there was a new twist and turn!
2	1378080000	Very disappointed, to much ranting and presidential facts that did not relate to the story.  First time I am disjointed in one of his books.
5	1378080000	Written with a comical undertone...LOVE that the narrator thinks &#34;out loud&#34;...I laughed out loud, yet was completely hooked on the mystery...I think I read the entire book in record time.Can't wait for the next Patterson/Ellis book.
3	1378080000	I enjoyed this book. It was an easy read. It was not the best book I have ever read but it was entertaining. It was definitely different. I came into this novel thinking it would be a certain way, so it was a breath of fresh air to see such a known author spread his wings a bit, even if it's not a big hit.
1	1378080000	I did not care for the character in this book. I felt like he had ADHD the whole time I was reading. It was very difficult to follow his thought process and very distracting. I actually talked a co-worker out of buying. Most disappointing James Patterson book I have downloaded.
1	1378080000	First James Patterson book I've ever been disappointed in.Hated the main character's constant references to movies&actors..almost; didn't finish the book, but kept hoping it would get better'
5	1377993600	James Patterson is one of my favorite authors. This book was hard to put down. One of his better books.
5	1377993600	This was a great book. It was fast paced and full of action. I really enjoyed the character development. The story was enthralling and enjoyable. Another winner for Patterson!!
1	1377993600	I read James Patterson for enjoyable, entertaining, quick reads that I can pick up during commute and waiting on lines, such as at the post office. Fun without too much investment. This one was a total waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. There was a "twist" at the end that really want to made me throw the book across the floor, but since I read on my Kindle, I resisted the urge. If you feel you must read, go to the library.
3	1377993600	some of the reviews i read were way too harsh....is  this book award worthy? no..is it one that patterson would want to be defined by....probably not....but if you want a fast  paced mystery, with a quirky main character....this is the book for you.. it was a fun summer read
3	1377993600	Totally different for a James Patterson book. It was okay but not great like most of his books. Took awhile to really get into the book.
5	1377993600	I really liked this character, funny, smart and kind of kookie  all at the same time. Love Patterson and will keep reading!
1	1377993600	Difficult to read because of all the self talk by Ben.  Way too much of it!  Would not recommend this purchase.
5	1377993600	That is Patterson's best stand alone mystery that he has written. Could not put the book down with all the twist and final reveals over the last few chapters. An awesome read!!
1	1377993600	Could kick myself for not ordering the free chapters........would have known at the git-go an idiotic book. The main character is paranoid and OCD and incredibly weak and annoyingly irritating. I want my money back. James Patterson is so hit or miss these days. Just finished his honeymooners and loved it. Then this idiocy??!! Ewww. Main man is a irritating weenie. Incredibly well versed in historic D.C. trivia but a weenie.
5	1377993600	Awesome story! I will Be reading this one again. Thank you for the awesome book. I can hardly wait for the next one.
4	1377993600	Very different from most JP books. Great main character.  Lots of twists and turns. A recommended read .Wish there was a sequel with this character.
5	1377993600	True Patterson suspense every page of the way. Not quite done yet, but been up all night the past few nights.
5	1377993600	Wasn't cookie cutter predictable and was very funnyWould recommend to any James Patterson fan! I hope to see another book about Ben.
1	1377907200	THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  NO MORE PATTERSON BOOKS FOR ME.  EITHER HE SHOULD START WRITING HIS BOOKS OR FIND DECENT CO-AUTHORS!
2	1377907200	I think this is the weakest James Patterson book I have ever read!  I think all the chatter about movies by the main character took up way too much space and was unnecessary to the plot.
1	1377907200	James Patterson's THE MISTRESS should have never been written, and I'm going to tell you why now so you can skip the rest of my review, just like you should skip this book. Capitol Beat reporter Ben Casper has stumbled upon a secret. Everyone who knows about it has been killed. But for some reason, when the bad guys have every chance they possible to kill Ben, they don't. Why? So there can be a novel.Here's the plot. Ben is planting spying devices in Diane Hotchkiss's apartment at her request. As soon as he leaves, Diane returns home. Moments later, she plummets out a five story window. Why would she kill herself? That's the plot. Ben must unravel the secrets and lies. Major plot flaw: This novel is a political thriller, and Diane Hotchkiss, the Mistress, in the title, has nothing to do with the novel. Nor is there any sex or maritial type drama you might associate with a novel about a mistress.Ben Casper is actually an interesting lead character. He's a little crazy at times, and he has a bit of personality issues, constantly citing presidential and movie trivia. But the plot is flawed. The rest of the book is filled with characters that only show up for convenience. The plot then roles into foreign and international affairs and there is no reason at all.Bottom line is this book is bad because there is no Mistress, as the title implies. And the book should have never happened, because Ben Casper should have been killed after the first chapter.
5	1377907200	I really liked the new story line and characters...this will be a good continuing storyline and souce of new chapters.
3	1377907200	I at least like some possibility of belief. I have read all of Patterson's books, this may have been the most unbelievable.
1	1377907200	I do not like it.  I read 5 chapters and sent to Archives.  Boring, too slow, not typical of James Patterson's work.
5	1377907200	James Patterson never disappoints his readers. His chacteracters are believable, the story line is believable and thrilling--all together a good read
3	1377907200	I did not like the repeated reference to old movies and old movie lines. It interrupted the flow of the plot.
1	1377907200	After several hours of reading this book, I still held out for the hope that this would get better. How Ben could survive an airplane crash, getting shot at, swimming in the lake under water, little to no sleep, etc etc , is beyond a realistic read (not to mention all the jabber about presidents and movies). I ended up checking on Amazon to read the description again, just to see what even tempted me to buy it.  I then noticed all the reviews that reflected how I felt.  I decided to return my kindle addition, which THANKFULLY, I was still able to do. I feel so strongly about this novel, that I decided to write my first book review.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!
4	1377907200	Mistress was a good book and a great read. It was high action with plenty of plot twists and turns.
2	1377907200	completely unexpected and bizarre: Just confusing in every way. Not for me, Sorry. I'll wait for his next one and hope it willbe back to his usual good way of keeping me in awe.
5	1377907200	I am a Patterson fan .  I like action type books and this is one of his best .  Would recommend this to any who likes these
3	1377907200	This story outed have been 100 less pages.  I actually was rooting for the character to get killed. The reporter was an idiot and the CIA and the Chinese and Russians are way smarter than the writer portrays
3	1377907200	I don't like that the main character keeps referring to characters in movies and presidents.It gets a little confusing.
4	1377907200	The book keep `s you reading on and on until you get to the end and want more .Great book.
3	1377907200	I usually enjoy James Patterson books but was disappointed with this one. Most of the time the chapters grab your interest where you just have to continue reading, this one did not. Just weird character and plot. Nothing like I anticipated.
5	1377907200	One of Patterson's best! A wild rise from the first few pages to the unbelievable conclusion. Definitely rates a ten!
1	1377907200	Usually a big fan of James Patterson, but this book was non-sense.  I'm very disappointed and would like a refund!
3	1377907200	Main character not well defined and shallow given the length and depth of the situations as they develop. Story line is good although no real surprises. A lot of early hints set the later stage. However, a good read for entertainment but less for thinking.
3	1377907200	Definitely not one of his better ones. Hated the continuous referral to presidents and movie stars. I found that to be annoying.
3	1377907200	I am a James Patterson fan but I did not like the refereces to movies and characters in this book. I did not think the Mistress character was very well developed.s
5	1377907200	This is probably one of the best thrillers Patterson writtinIn some time.He really outdid himself with plenty of action.Looking forward to his next action thriller.
3	1377907200	IF YOU TOOK ALL THE REFERENCES OUT THAT REFERRED TO MOVIES, MOVIE ACTORS-ACTRESSES AND THE MOVIE SCRIPT, THE BOOK WOULD BE ABOUT 25 PAGES!  OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS JUST OK.
4	1377907200	Will have to review the book after finishing.  Twelve more words are required and I don't know what else to say since I haven't finished the book.
1	1377907200	Hard to follow - poorly first 2/3 of book as it goes between rambling of lead character and his thoughts.
5	1377907200	This is one you can't wait to get back to.  My jaw literally dropped several times.  The hero is just a guy. No super hero and continues to do the right thing.  Could not figure it out in advance.
3	1377907200	I liked the book once I got past all the mind wandering.  Not my favorite of James Patterson. I will hope next book is better.
2	1377907200	The basic plot was interesting but became somewhat bizarre. The very frequent comparison of events to presidents and movies was distracting and did not add to the quality of the writing at all.
3	1377820800	While the pace was brisk and had plenty of surprises as usual for James Paterson, the image of who was talking at different points was very foggy.  I thought it was one person, yet turned out to be another.  I personally do not like rereading whole sections while trying to follow..  Still a good escape read.
4	1377820800	Suspenseful,  well written,  enjoyed every minute spent reading this  gem.  Would  recommend it to all who  love intrigue and Mr. Patterson.
4	1377820800	Thoroughly enjoyed this novel although it is a bit hard to believe that a nation could be blackmailed over a sexual affair in this day and age.
4	1377820800	would have given a 4-1/2 if offered.  really liked the book - some twists that always make for a page turner.  would recommend!
2	1377820800	I felt like I wasted my time when I finished reading this book.  All of the movie and presidential trivia was nothing but a distraction, and took away from any storyline that might have been there.  I think he is losing his touch.
3	1377820800	I didn't like the narrative rambling without enough of the usual conversations in a story.  The main character too often went off on a tangent recalling historical facts.
3	1377820800	I expected a good Patterson read. It was very obviously written mainly by his collaborator which was ok, but not worthy of calling this novel as written by Patterson.
3	1377820800	Patterson is writing too many books to fast!  This book was an example of trite fiction. Lets get something with some substance instead of using a &#34;sex&#34; theme as a blackmail gist!
2	1377820800	I have read all James Patterson novels and I read this novel and just can not give the book a higher rating.  Disappointed.Mrs. Dolleen  GriffinPS I did Order &#34;Gone:&#34; and I am waiting to read the novel &#34;I Michael Bennet.&#34;  It was excellent.
5	1377820800	Love the narrator of this novel!  The references to history and movie trivia is an added bonus to this novel. I really enjoyed this book.
2	1377820800	Luckily I got this book from the library and did not waste any money on it. I have read 10 chapters and will probably not read anymore, it is not holding my interest at all.  I always look forward to his books being released, this one was truly disappointing.  What happened to the old James Patterson?
4	1377820800	This one was okay.  I have read dozens of his books that I enjoyed much more.  I always look forward to his new books
5	1377820800	I like most of James Patterson's books. This one is not an Alex Cross novel but good nonetheless. My first book I've read on my iPad!
4	1377820800	Kept my interest!  Love James Patterson's books. Found this one had a nice mix of suspense and humor. Sequel, maybe?
1	1377820800	I love James Patterson books but this one is terrible! I could not follow it and after the first 4 chapters or so gave up and will likely not ever go back to finish it. I have never done this with a book before. I will continue to buy James' books however due to his history but I would skip this one and save my money if I could go back again!
5	1377820800	I could not put this book down.  The character development  moved each character off the pages and allowed them to tell the story in a passionate and intertwining mannerDierdrec@msn
3	1377820800	I really didn't think this book was on par with my expectations of a James Patterson book. The jumble of thoughts did not appeal to me.
5	1377820800	This is another great Patterson mystery.  I'm almost finished; and, it keeps you glued to the book.  I would highly recommend it.
4	1377820800	I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  The characters were believable and easy to follow.  I recommend this book to anyone, even if you are not a routine James Patterson reader.
2	1377820800	Not his best works....could not keep up with the story.  Kept putting it down and I never put his books down until I finish.  I am woay through it but it is taking for ever.  Disappointed in this book
2	1377820800	I dislike the fact that it was not written by James Patterson.  The author rambled about TV shows and was not interesting.  I will not buy another James Patterson book that is listed with another author.  I really like James Pattrerson's style of writing but don't like the fact that he is using his name to sell books.
3	1377820800	This is one of the first books I've ever read of James Ptterson's that I really didn't care for. Predictable, over-used story line in several movies, books, and tv series.
4	1377820800	This story is like the bits of colored glass used in a kaleidoscope. The main character is just a so-so writer with his own newspaper, and it starts and stops with a lot of narrative on what he is thinking, or doing, and inadvertantly gets involved with the Russian mob, and of course, the good ol' CIA, and neither of them like him. With every turn, something new comes into view, some good, some bad, but all of it frightening. It is a good thriller, and the ending is, well----.
5	1377820800	Very much enjoyed it!, as I enjoy all James Pattterson books. A thrilling and exciting read!!! A thrill a chapter!
4	1377820800	Gripping could not stop reading, quirky and different twists a really interesting read, the main character has issues that reflect through the labyrinth  of the story. If you like a story that peels back lots of layers you will enjoy this book.
1	1377820800	I could not finsh this book.  What was James Patterson thinking when he added his name to this.  I hope he is more careful next time
5	1377820800	I could not stop reading the book.  I curled up on the couch and read until I finished.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!
3	1377820800	This wasn't on of his better books.  Didn't like the changing from the story to facts about presidents to movies.  It was hard to keep track of what was going on.  I don't care for switching back and forth stick to the story don't need all that other stuff
5	1377820800	I've read every one of his books.  He never ceases to amaze me with, every book is a thriller. Its very hard to put it down before finishing.
1	1377734400	Waste of time and money!  Very poor for James Patterson, but I guess everybody has a bad day sometimes. Just not up to his normal standards
4	1377734400	I have been a devoted fan for years now but his books, can at times , be somewhat predictable ---But not this book. This book had more twists and turns than a rollercoaster. I enjoyed the lead character , Ben,  and I enjoyed the ride with him.
4	1377734400	Confusing at first but once you get over what happens in his head it was a thrilling page turner....always enjoy Patterson's stories.
3	1377734400	Too many movie references and quotes ad nauseous.  It is an okay story with out all the name dropping and movie business.  Seems a bit below James Patterson usual.
1	1377734400	I just downloaded this book on my Kindle, and what a disappointment.  I can't believe James Patterson put his name on this book.  All the references to movie characters, etc. just bogged me down.  I stopped reading after the first chapter.  What a waste of time.
4	1377734400	It wasn't Patterson's best work, but it was a good read, and I enjoyed it. Would I recommend it to others, maybe.
5	1377734400	Found this to be one of the best James Patterson books for a long time..and I have read them all !  Twists and turns that were actually unexpected and a couple of story lines that kept your attention and interest throughout ...Found the main character different (let's say has some strange quirky habits ! )  and endearing..  David Ellis must be a good influence or did a lot of it because I found while still has the short chapters etc of a typical James Patterson book the storyline was a whole lot more solid than a few books of Patterson have read in the past.  I would recommend it highly ..
5	1377734400	Fantastic book!!!  I can't put it down!  Th drama and action are great.  Would make a great movie!  Love it!
2	1377734400	James has done much better work. Did not like this at all. Very slow reading took awhile to keep me interested.
4	1377734400	While I liked the story line, the constant referral to celebrities and movies was rather annoying.  I am not a movie buff so those referrals just got to be too much.  I gave it four stars because I really did like the story line and it was for this reason I kept on reading the book.  .
3	1377734400	When you finish this book you are still not sure where he was going with this disjointed story. The flash backs leave more questions than answers. Have read all Patterson's books and this was not up to his standard.
5	1377734400	I absolutely loved this book! Definitely couldn't put it down. Wasn't what I was expecting. I'd recommend this book to all reader's
4	1377734400	the book was very good enjoyed it told my friends about it . james patterson books are very good can't wait to the next one comes out
5	1377734400	Nothing can be sad bad about James Patterson.  I think i have read every novel he ever wrote.  He is  my favorite. But this book I couldn't put down. It was wonderful.
5	1377734400	Suspenseful to the end! James Patterson has a style of writing that I enjoy.  I Am never bored while reading his stories.
2	1377734400	Not my favorite and I have read each and every book! All of the side references don't seem necessary to the storyline
2	1377734400	This was one of the worst &#34;quickie&#34; books from JP and one of his &#34;sidekicks&#34;.  After a few of the &#34;cutsey&#34; movie references from the narrator, it just became annoying (basically, it was fill in for the very thin plot).  It was stupid and predictable and I pretty much skipped to the end just to get it over with, which was exactly how I thought it would end.  DO NOT RECOMMEND.
5	1377734400	Another great Patterson novel with the usual twists and turns, keeping you guessing until the end! Can't  wait for the next one!
1	1377734400	If I could rate it lower I would have. I was unable to complete this book, it makes me wonder if James Patterson has run out of ideas and / or finesse
5	1377734400	Another home run written by Patterson! I could not put this book down - every chapter held your attention wishing it would never end!
4	1377734400	took me a little to get into but once I got into it I was hooked. there were good twists and turns and it was an easy read.
5	1377734400	Always great book from James Paterson.  He write the best books and they keep me wanting more. I can not put the book down once I start reading.
3	1377734400	Not one of Patterson's best, but still a good summer light read.  I prefer his regular characters rather than these offshoot novels as a general rule.
4	1377734400	And hate it when I'm finished. They go by too fast! And then I'm left looking for the next one! Great read!!
4	1377734400	Not one of the best and I have read all of James books. But a nice read. I look forward to his next book
4	1377734400	I wasn't too pleased with Mistress.  Didn't seem to me that James Patterson was very involved in the writing.  Too wordy and not enough mystery.
4	1377734400	A little too much of the OCD trivia repetitions in the beginning but I'm glad I didn't bail on it. It's a good beach read, especially if you miss the old Cold War thrillers. Not that this is anywhere near Le Carre or Ludlum territory, but for a quick weekend read it kept me entertained.
1	1377734400	I have read most of James Patterson's books and love him.  This book was not written by James Patterson.  I am not sure he even proofed it.  It was silly and did not hold my interest. It was bizarre and off the subject to make so many references to movies. I will read samples of future James Patterson novels before I purchase them. I would hope if James allows a co-writer to help him he would at least make sure they write in the same style as he does.
5	1377734400	I'm always  fan of James Patterson, but really enjoyed this book!  I hope he'll make a series with this particular character.  Some of his crazy thoughts had me laughing out loud!  Enjoyed it very much!
2	1377734400	Being called mistress...I assumed it would take you into the life of the mistress rather than the aftermath of a mistress we hardly knew anything about
4	1377734400	Very much like all James Patterson's books, however, I like him for a very quick read in between heavier stuff.
4	1377734400	Kept me guessing until near the end. Different type of main character; almost unbelieble he could accomplish all he did to unravel the mystery. Good read.
4	1377734400	I enjoyed the fast pace of this novel.  It did not drag.  It took a turn I didn't expect, and I liked that quirkyness about it.
5	1377734400	Really fun read.  Great hero and loved how he figures things out.  Could have done with a few less murders but hey still lots of fun.
3	1377734400	A reasonable read but far from Patterson's best.  Maybe he's getting tired.  Or maybe he's coming out with too many books.  But, of course, I'll read his next one too.
3	1377734400	Its just not as good as his usual books. Just did not care for it. I would not recommend to a friend.
3	1377734400	Good story lots of twist, a little hard to follow.  It doesn't seem to be Patterson. Good story lots of twist, a little hard to follow.  It doesn't seem to be Patterson. Good story lots of twist, a little hard to follow.  It doesn't seem to be Patterson.
5	1377734400	Enjoyed reading on the beach.  Kept my interest, but sometime I didn't know which character was speaking.  All in all  a good book.
5	1377734400	James Patterson teaming up with David Ellis is a perfect pairing.  Lots of suspense which, in a very creative way, makes many turns and keeps you guessing.  I like it when I cannot guess the end.  A perfect read.
5	1377734400	This is another great book!! We are always kept guessing and surprised by who it actually is in the end.
3	1377734400	I am a huge fan of James Patterson and really enjoyed the never ending roller coaster ride. However, I was disappointed in the ending. I felt like it was rushed.
4	1377734400	A good James Patterson book. It started slow but as I got into it, it grabbed me and was hard to put down.
4	1377734400	It had an interesting style, which grew on me as I read. The story was good and characters interesting.  I recommend it.
5	1377734400	James Patterson strikes again another great read action packed as usual I would recommend any of James Pattersons novels as I have read most of his works
1	1377734400	Difficult to follow as the main character keeps flashing back to his childhood which interrupts the flow of the core story....I was hoping this would all make sense in the end but that did not seem to happen
5	1377734400	This is another in the line of great Patterson books, love this writer. It's an easy read and very enjoyable
5	1377734400	Love all of his books. They keep me up way too late at night! Highly recommend this book. Great thriller.
2	1377734400	big fan of JP. this book however was very hard to read. made my ADD worse. i read to get immersed in a book and let my brain relax... this book had me so aggitated i couldnt focus on it. looking forward to his next book.always a fan, just not on this one
5	1377734400	What else do you expect from James Patterson. All of his books are worth reading. However, I haven't read all of his books, but the ones I have read, are worth reading. He has so many books, it hard to get them all.  But as usual, James Patterson's books always keeps you thinking and wondering who is the bad guy(s) is/are.  This is a good read.
2	1377734400	Book jumps around way to much! This is NOT up to James Paterson's standards . The book keeps going back to other times and losses a flow needed to hold the readers attention.
5	1377734400	Great book!  Action packed and intriguing.  I luv all of his books but this kept you guessing.  I luv James Patterson :):)
5	1377734400	The book is good at first it started out very slow but it gets much better as you read on.
1	1377734400	could not get into this one did not finish kept reading next chapter hoping but not a good read. Usually love james patterson
5	1377734400	Must Read!!! I love anything by James Patterson. His writing is fantastic. I can't read all of his books! :)
3	1377734400	It was okay, I was a little disappointed considering it was James Patterson.  It took a while to take off, and I almost stopped reading it.
3	1377734400	I thought it would have been much better. The begining was good. The middle of the book was so-so and the end was barely passing. James Patterson books are usually much better and more exciting.
1	1377734400	I haven't finished it and am note sure I will as I don't consider it up to James Patterson's normal wonderful fiction.
3	1377734400	An easy read but lacks Patterson's punch and particular zest.  Does he ever plan to write a book as sole author again?  His intensity and enthusiasm seemed less and I find that often with the books written by two authors.  It could just be my own bias..  He has always been one of my favorite writers but the last few books seem less than the usual James Patterson.
2	1377648000	Totally disappointing, yet had to read on. Not the smooth read you usually get from this author. Story seemed disjointed at times. Not at all believable either.
1	1377648000	I usually find James Patterson books easy, pleasurable reading. Bought "Mistress" before boarding a plane and found it one of the worst books I've ever read.  I wish I had read the reviews befor buying it.  Is this going to be a trend?
3	1377648000	While the storyline was good it just wasn't as good as was expected from James Patterson.  But I still enjoyed reading it.
3	1377648000	I expected more perhaps and did not like the wacky rambling of the first person narrator/point-of-view.  Because of this, a lot was skimmed.  It was interesting, but I was able to put it down for periods, even days.
3	1377648000	I'm not much for mysteries but I found this book pretty good. The character is a character. He nearly drove me crazy with his triva flashbacks.
1	1377648000	I usually love James Patterson even though he co-authors most of his books.  I am an avid reader BUT this is the absolute worse book I have ever tried to read.  I made it through about 50 pages and put it down, wishing I could get my money back.  So please if you read this review, do not buy it. It is a waste of time and money.
1	1377648000	I forced myself to finished this book.  Ben must be the new Superman.  Escaping time and time again from every possible scenario.  Just complete nonsense.
5	1377648000	Lots of twists & turns, couldn't put it down.  Surprise ending, didn't see it coming.  The tangential references added to my enjoyment, would have thought they would be annoying, but, strangely, they added to the drama of it all.
5	1377561600	A fast moving action and spy thriller.  The story would make a good movie.  Hard to put down, well written, and easy to read.
1	1377561600	Horrible. Hard to get through.  Wanted to stop often.  Did not hold my attention.  Would not recommend to another person to read.
5	1377561600	Book was great.  Did't want to put it down!  I don't usually read during the day, but finished the book today!
5	1377561600	James has done it again!  Just when I thought I knew the full story, it took a 360 degree turn.
5	1377561600	Classic. The story started slow but then I could not put it down. Great read. I still like the series books better. Really anticipating Gone.
5	1377561600	James Patterson is a master architect building a carnival that will rival even the greatest thrill park . Each book is a new thrill ride. Mistress is a strap yourself in and hold your breath ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like the adrenalin junkie, your addiction will not let you put this book down.
1	1377561600	I am VERY disappointed in this book....  Totally boring, not written by James Patterson, I even doubt that he read it!  He had someone else write it and put his name to it...  SHAME ON YOU!  I will demand a refund, couldn't get further than the first few chapters...  DON'T BUY IT
4	1377475200	Mistress was a fast read. The book pace kept you on edge through out. It's one of Patterson's better books.
2	1377475200	The only reason I finished this boring book was because I bought it in hardcover and didn't keep the receiptI'm sure enough people have explained the plot so I'm not going to even bother.  I felt disconnected from the characters and they never were developed like his past ones are.  I will continue to read James Patterson but on the stand alone books I may wait until they come out in paperback or go to the library.
5	1377475200	It kept me gripped to my chair this entire afternoon. From start to finish, I did not want to stop....even for dinner.
4	1377475200	I have read everything James Patterson has published.  I thought this book was good, but not one of his best.
3	1377475200	I am a James Patterson fan.l believe he is writing too many books,almost like a conveyer belt. Some books he gives more time and thought to.this was not one of his best books.It was about a 3'
1	1377475200	U lost a good coustomer... Patterson will have written another book by the time I get it next time ill just go to a book store and buy it may pay more but at least when im reading a book with someone ill know what the heck is going on
5	1377475200	Very different book.  Excellent read!  Entertaining enjoyed the duo authors  Great endingYou will enjoy if you like government conspiracy novels
4	1377475200	Very different style taking us into the mind of the lead character, with all his quirks and foibles. Lots of excitement and plot twists right up to the last page. Couldn't put it down.
5	1377475200	This book is one of those that is hard to put down even to get sleep. One of the best I have read for a long time.
3	1377475200	A narrated book that captured the excitment that a patterson novel is expected automatically.I finished the story But it was a mistake to buy mistress.....misery was already taken or this is a title for my reading experience.
4	1377388800	Hard to get into -too much side bar information ...but great middle and ending ..enjoyed reading ...Love Patterson books such a pleasure to read and enjoy!
1	1377388800	I don't review often but this book is terrible! I can't even get through it. Don't bother! It's a shame Janes Patterson's books have gone downhill this much...
4	1377388800	I have always loved James Patterson's books and this one did not fail. I always pick up his books and I am unable to put them down. I always say ok one more chapter and before I know it it is 4 in the morning. I finished this book in two days it literally was a page turner. The plot was twisting and turning and I love that the twists are never predictable.
5	1377388800	Read the book in a day. Couldn't put it down. Kept me reading all day.  One twist after another loved it
1	1377388800	I wouldn't even give this book one star .  Hate the guy making us listen to his random president / movies bull. Would love to get my money back.  Save your money.  Disappointed in Patterson.  A man with so much money. Should be ashamed putting his name on this.
5	1377388800	What a twisting, turning set of events that shapes,this story.  A very personal twist haunts the champion of the truth. WONDEEFUL.
2	1377388800	It was an okay book but authors seem to be jumping on the band wagon of having a funny, self-deprecating lead character.  Dean Koontz has Odd Thomas and Harlan Coben has Myron Bolitar.  Now James Patterson has to come out with Ben Casper and his idiosyncrasies.  I think James Patterson is trying to put his name on too many books and he is losing his audience.
1	1377388800	Had I actually paid money for this book, maybe I would feel more compelled to read more, but this is awful. I love James Patterson and usually his books hook me right away. Picking this up felt like a chore. The main character's thought processes are erratic and difficult to follow. I glanced ahead to the middle and end to see if other chapters were written from someone else's point of view, and when I saw they weren't, I gave up. I can't take endless chapters of this guy's senseless drivel.
5	1377388800	Awesome book.  Had a hard time putting it down. Look forward to the next book.  James Patterson is an awesome author.
2	1377388800	Mr Patterson should not use David Ellis again.  Who needs all the drivel - eliminate that and the book would have been o.k. without that.I have all but three of Patterson books; glad Mistress was a library book.
5	1377302400	Patterson outdid himself with this book!  Fast pace with sudden turns. The ending was great.  Too bad we do not have reporters like this in our democratic Republic.
4	1377302400	I have recently read this book, and found it difficult to get started on it.  I normally read a James Patterson book in 2 days, but this one took me somewhat longer.  However, part of that was because I work with people who have mental health issues, and Ben Casper's thought derailing is just what I deal with on a daily basis.  If you understand the mind of the character, then the movie references and the presidential facts are not at all out of the ordinary.  I am a fan of James Patterson, and am always excited to see a new book on the shelf.  I am glad that all of his books are not "the same."  That would be dreadful.  He writes and cowrites so many books, that if they were all written the same with the same characters, no one would want to read them.
3	1377302400	I have read David Ellis and all of James Patterson. Not sure why Patterson but his name on this novel as it doesn't seem like his style of writing. Good book but not one of Pattersons best attempts.
3	1377302400	This book was too smart to be written by James Patterson. I have read too many of Patterson's books to recognize his type.  And I do like his books.  He writes short paragraphs and they are a quick read.But this book had some meat to it.  I believe David Ellis did a fine job in writing this book.  James Patterson job was only lending his name to it.Yes, the movie references got tired very quickly and also the presidential data.  But, you can see why he would be a little neurotic after the death of his mother.  And I loved the twist at the ending.I enjoyed the book.
3	1377302400	James Patterson did not write the majority of this book. The first 50% was Benjamin constantly comparing his life to every conceivable movie, good movies, but extremely aggravating! Then the book too off so to speak and became very interesting as the plots and conspiracy became clearer. The last half of the book was definitely good, just not what I am accustomed to when reading a Patterson novel. To everyone who stopped reading the book, please finish it. I promise you the last half was well worth the read.
5	1377302400	I am a huge Patterson fan and I am glad I did not listen to the majority of the other reviews. Yes, this is very unlike Patterson's other books, but I do think he had a huge help in writing this book. The dialogue is witty, quick and interesting. I do not think this book should based on Patterson's other style of writing. Obviously he co-wrote this book and this very different from his other books. I am a very intelligent person and found the facts about previous Presidents very interesting. This book was very enjoyable to read. I am looking forward to more from these two authors.
5	1377302400	Although I don't necessarily like EVERY book written by Patterson, I AM a fan and read them all.  That said, this was one of his best co-authored books, ever!  Funny, exciting, interesting, but best of all, I love Ben Casper!  I would dearly love to see him featured in MORE books! He's even more interesting than Alex Cross.  But Alex Cross IS getting dull and repetitive.This was one of those books I hated to put down but on the other hand, hated to have it be over because then my reading enjoyment would be gone.  Interesting, personal, gutsy, thrilling, moral.  I loved it all!  If only they could ALL be as interesting and fun to read!  As far as all the trivia, well, I just skipped to the next line or paragraph if I didn't want to read it (and I often did not want to read it but for me it did not take away from the storyline, it just was part of Ben's quirky personality)Loved Mistress!  Want MORE Ben Casper!
5	1377302400	Fantastic book kept you always wondering who the bad guys were and the ending will surprise you best book yet Enjoy
5	1377216000	At first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy the book The main character was different than any of Patterson's other books,and I actually didn't like him at first.As the story developed so did the character and as usual the read became  quite the page turner,as usual I wasn't disappointed
3	1377216000	Of course all James Patterson books are good. This one is ok. At times it drags a little. Ending is good
2	1377216000	I knew in the beginning of this book, it was not the usual James Patterson novel. I did not enjoy it and felt it did not come close to being his usual writing.
2	1377216000	While entertaining I found myself getting bored.  Not enough story line and too much banter about movies and movie lines.  I am a huge Patterson fan but can't recommend this book.
1	1377216000	The never ending James Patterson "book mill" has churned out another stinker. You'll love it only if you care that "Lincoln had the biggest Presidential shoe size", or that "Paul Newman didn't star in Thief, it was James Caan". The book is heavily padded with such non-germane trivia that helps to make it larger, but not better reading. It's time for Patterson to be more concerned with the quality of his books than the quantity of their publication. Save your money.
1	1377129600	I love James Patterson's books, but this was disappointing.  Too many quotes about movies and actors!!! Not thrilling or captivating at all!
5	1377129600	I read this book in a weekend. I felt I was in the prison with Abbie and had some tears by the time I finished. The horror of being wrongly accused must be one of the most horrifying moments in a persons life
5	1377129600	James Patterson ROCKS. I loved it from the beginning. Thanks for all the history lessons that were included.  I didn't see it coming, slap in the face with the big secret
1	1377129600	I was very disappointed in this one.  The movie references got old very quickly.  I didn't even finish the sample.Better luck next time.
5	1377129600	I am an avid reader because of authors like Mr. Patterson who have the gift  to write and keep giving it.  I am his biggest fan and have read every one of his books and hope to continue for a long time. Someday,as a former reading teacher, I would like to meet him in person to thank him for the hours of enjoyment he has given me.
2	1377129600	I'm sorry but author a bit lazy on this one. Seem to be riding on Patterson name but not a good Patterson book.  Not a page turner and I don't like the schtick of the protagonist.
2	1377129600	I was very disappointed with this one! It bored me nearly all the way through. Sad because I loved guilty wives with David Ellis & have read all of James Patterson"s books without being this dissatisfied.
5	1377129600	I BELIEVE I HAVE READ SO FAR EVERYTHING THAT MR.PATTERSON HAS WRITTEN .I STARTED READING HIM ABOUT 12YRS. AGO at 30yrs. old & I HAVE NOW TURNED MY DAD ON TO HIS WORK AND HE ALSO LIKE'S IT.Thank You James Patterson!!!  We Love your Work!!BethRhode Island
1	1377129600	Boring...this is the first James Patterson book I have ever quit reading halfway through.  There was no suspense to keep me interested. Jumping from the story to Ben's trivial knowledge of thoughts was confusing.
5	1377129600	This was one of his best!  It was exciting and witty!  Hope he will use this character again or write one with a very classy reporter in D.C., trying to clean up that cesspool!
5	1377129600	Patterson is one of my favorite authors, with this book Mistress he remains so. Loved this book can't wait to read Gone
3	1377129600	I was disappointed in this book as compared to the way James Patterson usually writes. It's a little hard to follow I think.
1	1377129600	I have read James Patterson in the past and have liked him.  I found this endeavor to be disjointed and uninteresting.. I seldom start a book that I do not finish.  This is one.
5	1377043200	Great twist an turns.  Patterson throws another curveball to mess with the mind.  One of the few books I rank with 5 stars
5	1377043200	As usual, Patterson is fascinating.  I couldn't put the Kindle down.  One of his very best.  Glad that I preordered it.
5	1377043200	This book is hard to put down..exciting page turner...the main character Benjamin's narrative is so interesting and random..Love the quick thoughts..turns and never a dull moment or emotion! I highly recommend this book!
4	1377043200	A whole new set of characters. A new approach to the use of self talk. The personality of Ben is revealed through his self talk which has been used. However the constant references to movie characters was used to reveal his interests, comes from an isolated childhood where he learned from movie characters rather than friends, plus his trivia knowledge of presidents. Does his obsession with the presidents  lives explain our national history, or reflect values needed for democracy to bloom. Some new (to me) techniques and a good plot with lots of action leads to a pleasurable read.
1	1377043200	I could not take this book 20 minutes into my Audible listening session. It got to a point where I was like what the heck is he going on about.  I've only read about 6 James Patterson books and this one is by far the worse. I did not pay attention to the reviews before I ordered the book although I should have because the ppl that gave this book 1 Star felt the same way I did.
5	1377043200	Patterson books are like old friends.......when you pick one up to read you know you'll enjoy it, and enjoy this one, I did!!  Really enjoyed the character of Ben, he was so interesting and funny...Thanx, James, for an enjoyable ride.
1	1377043200	As an avid reader I am determined to always finish a book. I just can't with this.  Makes no sense. Character Ben is all over the place and quotes movie lines way too often. Bought this book as my beach vacation read. what a mistake. Ended  up buying a few magazines  at the local grocery store to read, which much more entertaining and engaging.  I can only hope to never spend the $ and time on such an awful book again.
4	1377043200	Good Patterson book.  Although it was a little hard to follow with the third party language where he talks about different characters from different movies.
4	1377043200	I'm not normally a James Patterson fan honestly, but this story was different. I couldn't put it down! Lots of twists, discoveries and the occasional humor. This was a great read. I was sad when it was over!
1	1377043200	I buy all of James Patterson's book for my kindle and also for my collection..I have every one that he has written.  I look forward to his books coming out.  I can not wait to get them.  I was very disapointed in Mistress.  I am having a hard time getting back to it.  This is not a "Patterson Novel"  you can not put his books down once you start them.  They are fantastic.  Mistres was a very SORRY novel. It is not Patterson's style..
5	1377043200	This book is one of the most entertaining mysteries that I have ever read.  Laugh out loud funny and &#34;cliffhanging&#34; suspense .  I could not put it down!
1	1376956800	Great storyline.the climax was a complete surprise.BEn was a likeable character.I never would have guessed  the first lady.A good read.
5	1376956800	Great read fast paced and many twists. I have read many of Patterson books.  Looking forward to the next book
5	1376956800	I ordered the book for my wife tread and she has really liked it. She is a reading nut in a big way.
5	1376956800	Great storyline. I have bought several other DavidEllis books after reading this book.  Never figured out the plot until it unfolded.
4	1376956800	I enjoyed the plot of this book but did not understand all the references to movies and tv shows.  I ended up skipping over all of those references.  The flow of the story was confusing to me.
3	1376956800	Took a while to get into this book after a slow start, but it did get better.  Kept thinking of Mel Gibson in "Conspiracy Theory"?  There was no need for all the trivia, and thought if so much was included, the book should have ended with Ben watching a movie or doing something related to trivia!  I stayed with the book, and it did get more interesting, but I'm unsure whether to pass this on to a friend who is a big Patterson fan??
2	1376956800	Always look forward to PAtterson's books, but found this one dull, to much trivia, however won't stop me from purchasing others.  Looking forward to next book.
5	1376870400	I love the way this tale was told, great character traits in the main protagonist! Read this novel so quickly I had to slow down to savor the story.
5	1376870400	this book was very good you never could figure out what was going to happen and it kept you wanting to keep reading and was hard to put the book down. a good read recommend it
1	1376870400	This book is not up to James Patterson's standard.  The style was schizophrenic with the unnecessary references to dead presidents, music, and movies.  I don't know whether to quit reading or slog through to the end.
1	1376870400	This book was terrible.  I am surprised that James Patterson put his name on it. Save your money. I very seldom do not finish a book, but I just could not get through this one.  Mr. Patterson should refund our money.
1	1376870400	I am all ways on the edge of my seat waiting for the next book to come because I love James Pattersons work. I am truly let down by this book. It is slow, all over the place. I normally finish a book in less than 3 days or 4 will fall asleep reading and wake back up to keep going but this one I just keep putting it down. I am bound and determined to finish this book only because I paid for it.
1	1376870400	Another example of how the quality of Patterson's writing has declined since he started using co-writers. I suspect that very little of this book was actually written by James Parrweson. I'll stop buying co-written books now. I've learned my lesson&#34;,
2	1376784000	The book says James Patterson, but Patterson never wrote like this. The author is David Ellis and he has an obnoxious writing style. I this and I that. I would not buy this author again. Patterson fans need to start checking out the &#34;real&#34; author of Patterson's books. I for one will not be fooled again.
2	1376784000	Forced myself to finish this book! Main character Ben, was a little nuts. Too much movie  and general trivia for me. Save your time and money!!!
1	1376784000	I pre-ordered this look, but never gain.  I regret I didn't have the good sense to wait and read the reviews first.The presidential and movie trivia was kind of interesting the first few times but it didn't take me long to realize that the author was using it to increase the volume of the book.  The character was too unbelievable.  He got away not because he was smart, had a plan or skills, it was pure unexplained luck.If I had it to do over again, I get a library copy.  Don't worry about having to wait long; I had to fight like heck to plow through this book.  What use to take me one exiting sitting to turn exciting page after another, Reading the Mistress I felt like I was obliged to read it because it would have been a waste of money.  James Patterson has another book coming out soon, this time I'll wait.
5	1376784000	I thought it was brilliant, a psychologically complex protagonist, very subtle motivation, shifting realities, many contextual prisms and rapidly paced.  Fabulous!
1	1376784000	James Patterson should be shamed to print this. This book was more like a terrible action movie where anything goes than a novel. This is in my opinion the worst Patterson novel since Toys. I had great expectations for this book since David Ellis helped co-write this, who also helped Patterson on Guilty Wives which a lot of people seemed to enjoy.  I'm glad I had a gift card so I only paid 7 bucks for this. It's still not even worth the money I paid. Hope to expect a lot more from the new Michael Bennett novel coming up.
4	1376784000	As usual Patterson kept me reading. I read the book in one day. It took many turns. I have most of his books.
5	1376784000	Reading the first few chapters I wondered where is this going and how is this going to connect? well, no problem for James Patterson to bring this story together. Could not put this down and only problem is you wish it could keep going on and on.
5	1376784000	Loved it!  As usual the plot twists to the very end and has an eerie element of realism.  Could it happen?!
1	1376784000	James Patterson should be embarrassed. This was a total waste of my money and I want my money back! I am done with Patterson books. What was the publisher thinking?
1	1376784000	This books made me want to pull my hair out.  I love history, but his guy goes off on movie trivia He really lets him mind wonder until you have lost track of the plot.
2	1376784000	Most James Patterson's novels are well worth reading - this isn't one of them.  While the basic plot is intricate and reasonable, the way it plays out is far fetched at best. The episodes that occur to the main character are just not believable.  It's not worth he time or money. I'd much rather re-read an Alex Cross book.
3	1376784000	A beautiful woman nose dives from a building...was it suicide or homicide? This story was done earlier this year by none other than J.K. Rowling in 'A Cuckoo's Calling.'  While Rowling's version is much, much slower - it is written like a true classic novel.  'The Mistress' is really sloppily put together and not very well written.  So if you want to read any novel involving a "suicide or homicide?" storyline - pick up 'A Cuckoo's Calling.'  Sorry, James.
1	1376697600	I have never written a review before but I had to get this off my chest. I am a huge James Patterson fan. I buy his book on Release Day. Never again will I buy one without reading the free chapters and reading the reviews!  This was probably the worst book I have ever read.....make that attempted to read!  After 30 chapters I'm quitting!  All the random thoughts on Presidents and movies is horrible. My brain felt like a game of ping pong while reading this!  Did James Patterson even read this crap or just allow his name to be put on the cover?!?!?!?!?!,
1	1376697600	Wish I had read the free chapters before I purchased this book..WORST book ever..I am not even going to finish it that is how bad it is.. I have even cancelled all my pre orders on his other books..SHAME on you Mr. Patterson!!! Wish I could get a refund!!
1	1376697600	I have read most of the books that have James Patterson's name associated with them and I believe this might have been the poorest of them all.  The only reason I did not quit after the first five or six chapters is because I hate to quit anything.  If you are an extreme movie buff or presidential trivia buff then some of the plot asides might have been meaningful.  To me they were just words to fill up a page and distractions from the book story flow.  A REAL PIECE OF JUNK.  Some of the co authored books are good such as the Lindsey Boxer series and the Michael Bennett series.  I think Mr. Patterson needs to be more choosy about how his name is used or people will finally drop him from their reading list.  I personally find myself doing a little screening now of his partner books before deciding to spend my time with them.  I should have omitted this one but I was short on reading material at the time.
5	1376697600	I love James Patterson books and this one is right up there with the rest.  I recommend it to all readers.
1	1376697600	Worse book ever! Don't waste your time. James Patterson use to be one of my favorite authors, but now it's like he doesn't give the books he writes a single thought!Thank god  amazon allows you to return kindle books! I couldn't remove this from my kindle fast enough!!!
1	1376697600	I am a HUGE fan of James Patterson, so I was eager to start his newest release.  I read very little before starting another book....I just couldn't do it.  Too much trivia/going off on tangents from the main character, just could not get into the book. Just read Second Honeymoon and loved it...this was such a disappointment.  Maybe next time I will check out reviews before pre-ordering, or just check into the e-books from the library.  This was a waste of my money.
1	1376697600	I don't know whether I regret wasting my money or my time the most.Patterson should be ashamed.  I know he hires these hacks to write drivel under his name, but this is a new low.  Less than juvenile.
1	1376611200	This book was boring.  I had nothing else to read so I finished it.  It was drivel, as one reader put it. I cannot say that I won't buy another Patterson book but I'll be more careful about reading comments first.
3	1376611200	I love James Patterson but this is the second worse book he has written. Not sexy or scary as advertised.
4	1376611200	This book is a bit of a departure-the hero is kind of an anti hero-a quirky awkward type of man who recites presidential trivia and his opinions on movies and actors as his running inner monologue that the reader is privy to.  This distracts the reader until he or she gets used to this herky jerky style of story telling which is written in the first person.  Ben Casper is the name of the main character and he quickly is forced to go on the run from the Russians, the CIA, the police, and various sundry baddies.  The story is fast paced, quite convoluted and involved and in the process he also solves the mystery of his own childhood.  I did enjoy this story, if only due to it's quirkiness and outside of the norm story and style.  This author has become so formulaic that it's worth the price of admission to see him get creative.  Definitely not for everyone, but an interesting experiment.
1	1376611200	As a die-hard Patterson fan, I am shocked with the terrible quality of "Mistress". This a terribly written book which tempts the reader to simply give up and read something worthwhile instead. Co-authoring always has seemed an easy way to churn out books, but this one has backfired in Mr. Patterson's face. This is a reflection of his professionalism and has proven him to be, at best, second-class, particularly in choosing co-authors. What a disappointment!
2	1376524800	In the past, I have always enjoyed Patterson's books immensely.  However, lately, they seem to be lacking.  I found this to be true with this book. The plot for this book concerns whether the main character's friend Diana Hotchkiss committed suicide by jumping off the balcony of her apartment or whether she was pushed (murdered). If the crazy way the main character keeps relating everything to movie titles, actors and lines or to some totally esoteric trivia about one of the presidents doesn't almost immediately turn you off, the absurdity of the plot will. I am now more than firmly convinced that this author has "written himself out" and is using weirder than weird plots created by the co-authors of the books to produce more books or else Patterson has lost it completely. In this case, Ben sets out to find answers to how and why Diana died. The search for answers involves Ben being shot at, chased and beaten by Federal agents and Russian assassins. I guess the reader is expected to believe all this and find the story another exciting thriller.  I did not.  I found it rather unbelievable and not as well written as Patterson's previous novels.  I am really sorry the author, who has penned so many great books and who rightly deserves his place among the leading best-selling authors today, has stooped to this level. It is a real shame to read this terrible book, knowing that a once upon a time great, creative author is the co-author.
3	1376524800	Did not like the constant reference to old movies and television lines.When I saw that the book had James Patterson on it, I expected more.
1	1376524800	I dislike NOT finishing a book, but I made an exception for "mistress". After 51 chapters there was absolutely no way I was going to endure 61 more!  The movies, the presidents, the flashbacks, and near-misses were simply  too much!!!Ive been a long-time james patterson fan but Im sorry to say, this is one of the worse books I've read in a long time.. Save your money.
4	1376524800	Liked how the story kept you guessing & the movie quotes were interesting and funny to follow. Will read again
1	1376524800	I have always been a big Patterson fan and was eager to read another. After about 50 pages I gave up. So I decided to come here and see if it was just me. Glad to see it wasn't.
4	1376438400	If you read a lot of the other reviews about "Mistress", you'll see that "Everybody" is upset that this is not a James Patterson book.  The chapters are longer.  Not nearly as much dialogue.  The protagonist rambles about presidential and movie trivia.  "Everybody" is right so far.  But "Everybody" knows now how Patterson writes (or doesn't write) his books, so if you're looking for the old Patterson, reread his old books.But if you're looking for a really good read, with a VERY interesting, yet somewhat disturbed hero, with plot twists, humor, and some raw emotions, this fits the bill really well!  Our hero has issues with his father for seemingly having pinned the murder of his mother on him, then getting him off.  Our hero is extremely wealthy, and owns and reports for an online newspaper.  He's well-respected by everybody in DC, up to and including the President.  He gets involved in a convoluted set of circumstances involving the CIA, the Russians, a gay First Lady (spoiler alert), and his one true love.  He shows himself to be physically agile and morally pure, trying to solve the mystery despite seeing people he loves and respects killed around him.I say give this book a chance, not as a Patterson novel, but on its own merits.  Enjoy it!
5	1376438400	Another great James Patterson book!  We have come to expect this from  him and we certainly get it. The events in this book unfortunately could really happen  and  it keeps the reader in suspense until the very end.  I would surely recommend  all JP fans to read this one.
2	1376438400	Many of my concerns about Mistress have already been stated.  The movie references are tedious.  I couldn't understand the reason behind the main character's consistent ramblings about trivia, movies, and Presidents.  The plot is confusing, and I really have had difficulty in understanding what is going on and why I should really care.  James Patterson's novels have always been an escape for me--fun, quick plots and actions, and twists in action.  This book goes nowhere.  I am having a hard time even finishing the book.  I really don't care what happens.  Patterson needs to stick with Alex Cross, the Women's Murder Club, and Michael Bennett.  The Private series is pretty good.  This book is disappointing.  Step up, James, and don't take your fans for granted with books like Mistress.
5	1376352000	As usual Patterson has done it again. Keeps you guessing and just when I think I have it all figured out he proves me wrong.
5	1376352000	Mistress [Kindle Edition]James Patterson (Author), David Ellis (Author)This book had me sitting on the edge of my chair .It was one of those that you couldn't put down once you started it.An excellent read.
5	1376352000	Not one of his usual story lines. absolutly loved it! i could not put it down. loved all the movie quotes and the way the charachters mind works is insane.
4	1376352000	Quirky underdog protagonist, but one you come to root for.  Lots of D.C. political intrigue and international spying.  A good read and satisfying climactic ending.
2	1376352000	This book reads nothing like any James Patterson book I have ever read.  David Ellis must have written it. I am about half way thru and forcing myself to keep on reading.  Too many references to sayings, movies, etc.  It is just like a filler of things to write to complete the book.
3	1376352000	Not one of his best of all that I have read. It was OK, but he has written better ones.
1	1376265600	I have read most of JP's books and enjoyed all of them . I was very disappointed in Mistress and quit after Chapter 10. Don't bother it really is a waste of time...big disappointment!
1	1376265600	In a word-----------horrible.  The worst Patterson book I've ever purchased.  I'm forcing myself to continue, after reading about 14/th of it, but I'm ready to stop wasting my time on it.
1	1376265600	I have read all of James Patterson books except for the books written for teens and enjoyed most of them.  I had really hard time reading thru all the references to music, presidents and tv shows. I read thru 10 chapters and decided to stop wasting my time.  I am glad I got this book thru the library instead of purchasing it.  I usually read 4 to 5 books a week and this book took me 3 days to read 10 chapters and as you know James Patterson books have very short chapters.
2	1376265600	Didn't like the monologue. It was hard to get into the story. I love Patterson.. He's better when he writes alone. The book did have an interesting ending.
3	1376265600	I've read many of James Pattersons books. His &#34;new&#34; style of writing is not as good. I think that since he started writing Childrens Books, the dialogue has changed to a simpler level. Too simple! The real intrique is just not there!
5	1376265600	MISTRESS is a somewhat different stand-alone work, not only for James Patterson but also for co-author David Ellis (whose fine courtroom thriller, THE LAST ALIBI, was published earlier this month). It begins as a mystery but soon enough transforms into a political thriller, which reads as if the authors had prescient knowledge of tomorrow's headlines.The book is told through the first-person, present-tense voice of Ben, the editor and financial support of an online newspaper that isn't exactly known for its number of hits but stubbornly attempts to cling to some semblance of old-school journalistic integrity. Ben is (how can I put this?) a little hard to take, his noble ethical aspirations notwithstanding. He has some difficulty staying on task, which makes his narration an occasional labor of love to follow while also making him somewhat, or maybe almost, endearing. He is also in the grips of love with a woman named Diana Hotchkiss, a goddess among mortals for whom he literally would do anything. That his love is unrequited does not deter him in the slightest; he is sure that Diana ultimately will come around.Therefore, Ben is emotionally shattered when he witnesses his beloved falling to her death from the balcony of her Washington, D.C. apartment. It is ruled a suicide, but he simply cannot accept this conclusion. Diana had a fabulous job that brought her into the offices of the highest levels of the Federal government, and had intelligence and beauty to boot, along with Ben's undying love. Ben believes there is no way that she could have killed herself. He begins investigating the circumstances leading up to her death and uncovers a number of startling things about her. Diana was apparently leading a double life that she kept hidden from her family and friends, and included a relationship with a Chinese lobbyist and, quite possibly, an extremely prominent politician.As Ben gets deeper into his investigation, more people start dying around him, and he soon finds himself accused of the deaths of Diana and one of his best friends. He soon realizes that he has almost nowhere left to turn. In a last-ditch effort to find out the truth --- and to save the United States government from itself --- Ben pulls out all the stops and discovers that he was right all along: Diana did not commit suicide. The truth, though, may be more than he can handle.MISTRESS is one of Patterson's more ambitious and complex co-written novels, full of surprises and unexpected twists. Trying to guess what is going to happen next is like walking confidently into a room and having the Persian rug in the center of it suddenly yanked out from under you; just when you think you have the answers, the questions change. And if an action-filled, suspenseful work is not enough for you, the book includes excerpts from two forthcoming Patterson novels. All of the above make MISTRESS a perfect book with which to close out your summer.Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
1	1376265600	This was the worst book ever. I feel like I want a refund if that's possible. I stared reading it on the 5th and it took me untill the 11 of Aug. to try and finish it. Did Patterson really write this book? Whats with all the movie and tv programs?
3	1376265600	Slow and dragging in places, but finally got betterIt was not my favorite book of his but, of course, I will continue to read all that he writes.
1	1376265600	I normally don't write reviews but had too with this book. I read the first 6 chapters before I got a refund.  This is James Pattersons worst book!!!!  Waste of $$$$.  Glad amazon gives us the chance for a refund.  The book is so annoying with all the movie and presidential trivia.  Just a horrible book.
1	1376179200	I usually can't put down a James Patterson book.  This one left me feeling like I wasted my money.  The main character's thought process was just confusing and annoying.  It got to the point where I didn't even want to pick up the book to finish it.  Thought that it was a bit predictable once you got past the constant sidelines for his thoughts.
1	1376179200	I usually love James Patterson's novels, even though some of his co-author books don't quite do him justice.  With this book however I just couldn't get past a few chapters.  All the random thoughts and references to movies and songs was just a little too much.  Like just fill up the pages to make the almighty buck.  If I had gone to a brick and mortar book store and read just a chapter or two I never would have purchased this book.  It is horrible.
4	1376179200	This story will keep you interested.  It's actualy a page turner.  The &#34;hero&#34; has an interesting backstory to match up with the book's main plot.
1	1376179200	I agree with all of the current reviews....don't waste your time trying to understand this one! I normally have a hard time putting down a James Patterson book, but laying this one aside was no problem. Its a big disappointment.
5	1376179200	Once again James Patterson has done it again. I always love reading his books. And this one was no exception. Fast paced and it had so many twists that  you have to keep reading to see how it ends. Once I start reading one of his books I can't stop.
5	1376179200	Definitely grabs your attention and keeps you reading, as with all Patterson books. You will not be disappointed in this one.
5	1376179200	Wow! Didn't see it coming!  Sometimes, these types of books are so predictable, but Mistress was a good read from the very beginning. You'll enjoy it. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
4	1376179200	Like HOUSE OF CARDS, SCANDAL and the current and ongoing Snowden/NSA battles between Putin and Obama, MISTRESS is an interesting, sometimes &#34;improbable&#34; tale,of a young woman attempting to play &#34;Russia against the USA&#34; with a young reporter caught in the midst of his feelings for her when he should have been more clever to see what she really is: a traitor. I have titled the reporter, &#34;Gentle  Ben&#34;, with past issues of his own to overcome, let alone be caught in the battle between the CIA and Russia where his life is at stake. The scenes in DC, Virginia and all over DC are very interesting as Ben dodges bullets here and there in his attempt to find the real truth about his &#34;mental mistress&#34;, Diana Hotchkiss. Yes, MISTRESS is an interesting read, but for real political thrillers, I will leave that up to Brad Thor and his Scot Harvath who really know how to create a politcal nightmare.
4	1376179200	I got this book from audible for a car ride to California and it helped pass the time. It started slow but held our interest. First Jp book I have &#34;read&#34; and will for sure look into more. This book has action, deceit, trivia, black mail, sex and politics all thrown together and keeps you guessing with many twists and turns.
3	1376179200	I almost quit reading this book before the 4th chapter. It was a slow start. But once I kept going it was truly a good James Patterson book. Well worth the effort to read.
1	1376092800	This book is simply drivel and James Patterson should be ashamed and embarrassed. I've read 25-30 of Patterson's novels over the years including his excellent Alex Cross series and I normally eagerly await the next installment. Therefore, I was looking forward to another great read when I ordered this "co-authored"  waste of time. Patterson is one of the great authors of his generation who writes tight compelling novels that are well researched and always full of suspense and believable characters. It is so sad to see him stoop to this level. I can't believe he even read this before allowing it to go to print never mind actually writing any of it. About halfway through the book I started to think it must be written tongue-in-cheek but sadly I was mistaken.Thankfully, Coben, Sanford, Child, Elsner, Parker and a few other authors continue to take pride in their craft and maintain their integrity. I'm going to chalk this up as a $12 learning experience and never again purchase a novel that is co-authored. Hopefully anyone who reads this review will save the expense.
1	1376092800	I was really wanting to like this book even after the first few chapters.  I'm a huge Patterson fan but this was a waste of money to me.  The trivia is annoying and makes no sense and made me want to skip ahead.  Was hoping this would be another winner but please wait for the paperback or borrow it, it's not worth the $'s
5	1376092800	As usual, an action packed suspense novel with unsuspected twists and turns . I was thoroughly engaged with Ben .Thanks for another great read. I am never disappointed.
5	1376092800	There are so many good things to say about this book, I don't even know where to begin!  The main character is fabulously written, with his little flukes and tragic past.  And although I did figure out one of the question marks before it was revealed, the other escaped me completely!  Not that any James Patterson book isn't a must read....but this one is a must must read!
1	1376092800	I love James Patterson books. I stopped reading this book at chapter 10. I didn't really understand what this book was about. The killer was getting on my nerves with the movie quotes. This book was a really disappointing.
5	1376092800	All of James Pattersons books are excellent--that is why he is a top seller. I always await his next book.
1	1376092800	With the exception of WItch and Wizard, Daniel X and Middle School, I have read all of Patterson's books, but had great difficulty pushing through this one. Was very surprised by the ending but wanted to stop reading before even getting through the first 25 pages. Ellis did well with Guilty Wives but I am astonished Patterson put his name on this one.
2	1376006400	I have read Patterson's books from the beginning, and this is not his writing.  I think he lends his name to new author's.
5	1376006400	Good Patterson.  If you like the action and style you will enjoy this read.  Good work and a good break from heavy reads.
1	1376006400	Ordinarily I am an avid fan of Mr. Patterson and will read one of his books in one afternoon.  Not this one.  I kept putting it up and down;  could not seem to get into it.
5	1376006400	i almost didnt buy this book due to some of the reviews but am glad i ignored them.  this book starts a bit slow but kicks into high gear and is a great book!
5	1376006400	This book was  Great! Lots of excitement! I lived every bit of it an  I couldn't put it down. Definitely on of Patterson's best. I will definitely recommend this book to everyone I know!
1	1375920000	This guy rambles way too much. This does not read like a James Patterson. I've read all of his. This one is not nearly as good. The plot gets waylaid by all the non-sensical references to movies. Maybe Benjamin should have taken his medicine for bi-polar and ADHD. I don't think I will purchase another written with this co-writer.  I've left it for my husband to read. Lets see how he rates it.Paula
1	1375920000	There was a time when Patterson actually wrote books. Now he farms them out to co-authors who create the most unbelievable plots and characters. The story is told in 1st person, which is somewhat interesting, except that the character - Ben - constantly makes reference to old movie actors and moving lines as he is shot at, beaten, and chased by Federal Agents and Russian assassins. The "plot" just skips along like many of todays " action movies" where anything goes.  It will be the last Patterson book, I ever buy.
1	1375920000	Very very disappointing. Sorry I bought it. I hung in there for six chapters until I just didn't see the point. I will be much more careful before buying another one of JP's books and that makes me sad.
1	1375920000	Few chapters in, throwing in the towel.  Stupid, annoying movie/presidential trivia nonsense keeps breaking into my train of thought and little else is happening.  Not worth my time.  Another instance where Patterson is laughing all the way to the bank.
3	1375833600	I bet I turned half of the books pages trying to get to the story and not read the rambling of Ben. The book would of been a great read without all that. Was disappointed.
1	1375833600	I'M NOT AT ALL PLEASED WITH JP's LENDING HIS NAME TO OTHER CRAPPY AUTHOR WANNABES.  HALF THIS BOOK FILLED WITH INANE AND STUPID MOVIE AND ACTOR REFERENCES.  IS THIS NOT PIRACY OR SIMPLY INFRINGEMENT?  AT BEST IT IS SIMPLY FILLER!HAS PATTERSON RETIRED?  DOES HE REALLY NEED STAND IN COAUTHORS?  I'M DONE UNTIL HIS NAME ONLY APPEARS ON "HIS" BOOKS.I INTEND TO ASK FOR A REFUND FROM AMAZON ON THIS KINDLE EDITION.SAVE YOUR MONEY.DON SHIPMAN, DALLAS
1	1375833600	Readers who say this is a fast-paced thriller must be reading a different book.  It took chapter after boring chapter before any semblance of a plot started to make sense. I am upset at myself for preordering this sleeper.
2	1375833600	this is the first time I have purchased a Patterson book that I wish I had not. I have always had a hard time putting a Patterson book down but now I have a hard time picking it up.  Just too many thoughts going on in the guys head about movie stars and the movies they were in and just really uninteresting.  Don't care about past movies and stars.  So sad I paid hardcover price or any price for that matter for this book.  It does have a nice cover.
1	1375833600	I have been reading and loving James Patterson books from the start; but this book seems to just have his name on it without his fast page turning style. I was very disappointed and returned it.
4	1375833600	I got quite fed up of the Alex Cross books....this one was different, it was refreshing that the main character was a reporter instead of a detective.
5	1375747200	This may be the best of the books written or co-written by James Patterson that I have read. David Ellis is the co-author here. It's a captivating story narrated by Ben Casper, publisher of an online newspaper based in Washington, D.C.The novel begins with Ben installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in his girlfriend's apartment. Very soon thereafter, she falls to her death from this apartment. But things may not be as they seem. The mystery begins...Ben presents a fantastic tale of espionage, blackmail, murder, betrayal, and sacrifice. It involves the U.S. President and his wife.  There's a Russian expansionist plot that I felt was quite believable. A ruthless Chinese lobbyist enters the mix.Ben uncovers closely guarded secrets and finds himself hunted by the CIA, the Washington police, and Russian agents. As bullets fly, he must flee for his life by car, on his motorcycle, on foot, and, in one instance, on a bicycle. These chases were always exciting and reflected a sound knowledge of the city.Through it all, Ben is given to flights of fancy. He knows a lot about movies, presidential  history, pop music, and just about everything else. For example, at one point Ben walks down a hall with purple carpet.  This triggers a response from Ben: "I'm not a big fan of purple, but I will admit that Purple Rain is one of the best albums of my generation." There are scores of these, as Ben puts it, "mind-scrolls," in this book. Some might find them distracting, but I thought they were very clever and kept the narrative flowing.Woven throughout is the memory of a tragic event, the death of Ben's mother when he was only eight. The circumstances of his mother's death haunt Ben to the very end of the book.It certainly kept me engaged. I hope the Ben Casper character is further developed in future works.
1	1375747200	To many movie and tv references.to much stills things.Good story but the movie star references were to many if you did,t know the movies.
5	1375660800	This book is fact paces and keeps you involved from the beginning to the end.  There is quite a twist at the end that I did not see coming. Highly recommend this book
5	1375660800	As always, James Patterson book MISTRESS is excellent reading. I highly recommend it to those who love to &#34;Investigate and try to figure out who the villian is.
3	1375660800	James Patterson "Mistress" is next book in the author's series of thrillers that most of them I've read. Patterson is productive author who published more than 20 books, some of them more likeable than others of course and due to that I was curious to read his new book right after it came out.The book main character is Ben Casper who is a political journalist with some common interests like movies and riding motorcycles and some less common such as loving the trivia about presidents probably due to his father. Although a beautiful woman named Diana Hotchkiss is his best friend, it could be said that he is also a bit in love with her. When suddenly Diana fell from her balcony looking like she committed suicide, Ben is determined to find the truth what really happened. She is been working for CIA but didn't had reason to kill herself, so he is sure someone kill her. Because of her agent career investigation is carried out with utmost secrecy but as result of his own investigation he realizes that she led double life full of deception that was successfully concealed. Some more people who were involved would also die in strange circumstances and Ben is now sure that someone is preventing the truth to be found. But he would not stop until he would achieve exactly that..."Mistress" is a good page turner with few usual and expected Patterson twists known from his earlier works. Due to main characters involvement in politics, story is full of action and intrigue that is always connected to the politics and these are areas in which Patterson excels. The main character Ben is somehow untypical guy, pictured not in the usual way the main characters are, he is awkward and doesn't like or doesn't know how to make relations with people. Maybe the reason could some be his childhood, some trauma from the past that can be explained with his unusual characteristic to speak about presidential trivia whenever he is upset probably due to his father being presidential scholar. But due to these peculiarities it's somehow refreshing to have such a main character.I would recommend this new Patterson book mostly to his loyal fans who are already accustomed to his style. For all others reading it could also be way to spend summer days and evenings, although Patterson had better thrillers.
