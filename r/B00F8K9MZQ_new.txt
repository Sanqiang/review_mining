5	1405987200	The only way to do your taxes
5	1405900800	Definitely the best tax program.
5	1405900800	10% refund bonus when tax refund went for gift card.......nice touch.  I hope this continues next year.
5	1405900800	Have used this product for years. Easy to use and makes taxes a pleasure, not a burden.
5	1405814400	Will only use the bought version. So much cheaper and the same as online! Love it
3	1405814400	ok
5	1405814400	USE IT EVERY YEAR JUST WISH PRICE DIDN;\'T KEEP INCREASING
5	1405728000	Turbo Tax software does the job well. I have been using Turbo Tax software since 2002 and it has done its job in filing my taxes
5	1405728000	I have been using Turbo Tax for years. It is so simple and easy to use, my kid can do it. Easy to follow forms with step by step instruction. Plus helpful side notes.
5	1405641600	always a good choice.
3	1405555200	I thought it included the State return and thought I paid extra for that, but when it came to filing for my state return, I had to pay again.  I wasn't too happy as that was not clearly stated.
5	1405555200	Wouldn't use anything else.
5	1405468800	Best tax software. Best price.
4	1405468800	Did the job....
4	1405382400	Been using Turbotax for years now and have become familiar and comfortable with the software. Pretty easy to use as it takes you step by step. If you have data saved from the previous year - it automatically uploads much of the redundant information and saves time and work of having to input that information all over again. File everything electronically - which makes it that much simpler and easier. Just not happy with the price of the product increasing every year - but it works, so I'll probably keep forking over the cash.....
2	1405382400	Not as simple as advertised.
5	1405382400	always a good product
3	1405382400	SEVERAL PROBLEMS UNDERSTANDING, AND CORRECTING.
5	1405296000	Always good and gets the job done!  This or the H&R Block always save me money..
5	1405296000	being using them for years.  Great product.
3	1405296000	I've had some issues with the IRS concerning the payment plans for tax payments reached via Turbotax.I think the price for the software could be reduced.
5	1405209600	Easy peasy, love this software.
5	1405209600	Used for years great product.
5	1405209600	very good price.
5	1405209600	This is good software.  I have tried some of the &#34;other&#34; Tax Software available and will not use them again.  TurboTax is the easiest and and gets the right results without the &#34;bugs&#34; I've found in the others.
4	1405209600	i will not pay to have state taxes filed any more using the software - got stuck and penalized as they were not paid as i expected...i was later told that i only paid the $25 for the previledige to have them paid electronically...next year i will use the indiana free tax website to make my payments using the information generated from turbo tax....i love the software and will continue to use it - i only buy the version with free state [calculations] included....i never give 5 stars as i feel that there is always room for improvement....
5	1405123200	Worked well.
1	1405123200	May work well for simple tax cases but do not use it if you have foreign income. There is an error in the way the forms are linked and when the county has double taxation treaty the software will not reflect it
5	1405123200	Easy way to do taxes yourself. Keeps track from year to year to help prevent errors.
5	1405123200	it was a good program!  It did what it needed to do and got me a refund so cant complain.
5	1405123200	Don't pay to get your taxes done do them yourself turbo tax makes it simple if you used turbo tax the previous year you can just import your information. It also finds more deductions than the tax places do and you can do it on your schedule. Just buy the one that meets your situation.
4	1405036800	once you understand it, it worked great for me and save money by doing it myself.  Used to use it years ago and now am back.
5	1405036800	I love turbotax deluxe... use it every year and it works well for me. I itemize my deductions and it's easy with this program.
5	1405036800	As advertised - prompt delivery -saving from other sources
5	1405036800	As advertised. Fast shipping.
5	1404950400	My taxes are easy and this program does all I ask and I can tell just by using it that people with much more complicated returns would do just fine with it.  Fast and accurate.
3	1404950400	Be careful, mistakes are made if you're filling K1 forms
4	1404950400	It is tax software.
5	1404950400	Switched back to this from H&R Block. I have used Turbo Tax for years, other than for 2012. I am a CPA and know how to do taxes, but I don't work so I needed some way to file my taxes. This is an easy program for me. I buy the disc, not the download so there will be no problem if I have to put it on more than one computer. I also do my parent's and my daughter's return on this. I will say my son bought the download, and he also knows how to do taxes. He did his own this year, and he had a problem with the PMI and real estate taxes doubling and he could not back back out to that when he noticed. He thought there would be a final review option so he could change it once he noticed the problem. He ended up having to file the return as it was, getting too much back. Then I had to amend the return, and have him send the overage back. He got very upset and will never use the product again, however, I honestly don't know how much of it was operator error. I guess these things could be a problem for those not as practiced with the program or those trusting what it is supposed to do. I had switched to H&R block program in 2012 because of the price, and the fact that I know what I am doing (and the info transferred over automatically). BIG MISTAKE. It was a much harder to use program and I couldn't find info I needed to complete my son's NC return. But when I did taxes full-time, we always cringed when people brought in returns done previously by Block. I should have known better. If you use a product like this, stick with Turbo Tax. Just know what you are doing, and be informed. Never blindly trust a piece of software.
5	1404864000	I use it every year and in 2012 they saved me $2100.00 in a mistake that was caught by State of Missouri.
5	1404777600	The best software over the years.Very thorough !
4	1404777600	Great for my taxes it helped me a lot and so easy to do!!
5	1404777600	As usual TT knocks it out of the park.  Go for the Refund Bonus Offer, such a deal!
5	1404691200	Always works well for me.  Buy this and split with a few people, can't go wrong for the price.
5	1404691200	EXCELLENT
5	1404691200	I have used turbo tax for 20 years.  Wish there help process was easier but I always get through it and the IRS seems happy.
5	1404604800	Use this every year for my taxes.  Hasn't failed me yet.
4	1404518400	Happy Happy Joy Joy! It was just as it was advertised, so it gets four stars, what else is there to say! They would get five stars if they went above and beyond what was advertised and expected.Imagine if your grocery store was like Amazon, and you had to rate every product you purchased! How annoying would that be?
5	1404518400	does what i hate doing but must be done..used product for a few years and its easy!
5	1404432000	Love it! More than enough detail to do my taxes even with many stocks and options trades.
5	1404345600	Worked the problem again.
1	1404345600	This was a big problem.  It never updated the 1040 form so I ended up having to buy the online version and I never got my money back for this useless item.
3	1404086400	I needed to do my taxes and the pricing for this product in the store was about $5.00 more so it was a decent buy.
5	1404086400	easy to use, quick and accurate.
5	1404086400	Been using turbo tax for almost 20 years.  Works better for those filing 1040, 1040EZ because it can get a little complicated as you gain more assets or own a business.
5	1404000000	The TT software is a yearly requirement. Take all the frills and jazz away, already!  When asked about tax consequences of my small investment (retirement) portfolio, the program bogs down and makes me interpret the tax page my broker sends. I thought all that was supposed to be standardized. Well, I guess it's better than paying some idiot 700 bucks.
5	1404000000	helps every year.
5	1403827200	I've always had good luck with Turbo Tax and will continue to use it. I've used the H&R Block program one year and was unable to submit my returns. I ended up having to do them over with Turbo Tax
5	1403827200	Taxes are a hell of a thing, but having the computer help with the math is a great thing. I get this program every year and from being able to import things from last years taxes to giving a hand with donations and doing the basic parts of a rental house this is a must buy for me every year. I have heard from friends that have others do taxes for them those other folks are using about the same program to do it for them, just charging them for the time to put in the numbers they already have. Do it yourself, it is easy and this is a very handy and useful tool.
5	1403827200	income tax happy
4	1403740800	I use Turbo Tax every year and this is great as it imports your prior years in (that is if you have been using Turbo Tax in prior years).  Our taxes are not too complicated so this does the trick for us as it is quite user friendly.
4	1403740800	Turbo tax is a great program to do your taxes, unfortunately they keep raising the price for the program.  Used to be $19, when it first came out.  I don't like the fact I only get 1 state return to file, with the program.  Have to pay a separate fee of $40 to file a second state return.
5	1403654400	I have been using Turbotax Deluxe to do my taxes every year since 1997 and really don't know how I could do it without them. It is fast, easy and very complete and it seems that they almost guarantee a refund every year. Hope they never let up!!!
5	1403568000	This is my 15th year (wow!!!!) using TurboTax. I guess you could say I like it. lol As always, easy to use, accurate, FAST. The deluxe version includes loans and retirement funds. It also managed foreign income and expenses and/or exclusions. I really can't give this program enough stars.If you are buying, be sure to compare the different versions - Basic, Deluxe, Home & Business, etc. - on the Intuit website.Also, when you buy on Amazon, make sure you are purchasing the correct YEAR as several years are available at all times. Also make sure you are buying the correct format - CD or Download.When you buy anywhere, make sure you are purchasing the COMBINATION you want. I buy the Deluxe Federal version with EFILE and STATE (one state only). This version included 5 free Federal Efiles. Be aware state Efile costs $20 (at this time). But there are also strictly Federal versions and separate state versions. I think the Federal all include Efile now but you need to read carefully.While you can now use TurboTax to create as many tax returns as you want and you can print out the forms and submit them by mail, you are limited to (this year) 5 FREE Federal Efiles and State Efiles cost (this year) $20. You can Efile as many State returns as you like but each will cost $20 (this year).Check out the software bonuses also. They aren't always worth it but if you were buying anyway then why not get $20 knocked off?
1	1403568000	Couldn't do my farm taxes even though everything is there. Took my CPA 10 minutes to do my return on paper. Using TurboTax would have necessitated an extension and a lot of unnecessary paperwork not even required by the IRS. Not happy at all. I'll just pay my CPA from now on. 3 times the price, no aggravation.
1	1403481600	I filed my 2013 tax return using Turbo Tax Deluxe, then a month later wanted to check something out on the return.  It started updating the program on my Mac and now states I owe the IRS $2300, I already received a refund from the original version of Turbo Tax Deluxe 2013.  After checking why this happened I found the bug,  it did not add up all my drop down menu deductions so the totals are all incorrect now.  I checked my hard copy to make sure thats what happened.  If you use this program to update your next years taxes it will import the wrong totals.  I sent the information to Inuit but never received an answer.  Its been over 2 months now and I just checked for updates but none.
3	1403481600	I've been using TurboTax for perhaps 10 years or more now.  So I buy the minimum package, and decline the built-in ads to upgrade to the more expensive version just to hand broker transactions, and usually try to take the quick path through the menus rather than the slower &#34;guided mode&#34;.  This year there were no problems, and multiple family member returns were created and submitted without any problems.
5	1403481600	I use Turbo Tax every year;  The only reasonably-priced version available!  I used to get a copy DIRECTLY from Intuit.
3	1403395200	I needed the Turbo tax so I can begin to teach my self to do my own taxes, but I do not remember getting a rebate slip. when is that?
5	1403308800	The only thing about tho product was that I had an older Mac computer that worked fine BUT...INTUIT decided to make this product UNUSABLE with my computer. I actually had to buy a new Mac Pro....just to use this tax software!
5	1402963200	I like the spectacular consistency of this software, and I decided this year to test it next to a tax professional. The results were the same and the Turbo Tax cost one tenth of what the accountant cost. No contest here.
5	1402876800	I have used this product since it first came on the market in the late 90's. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to do their own taxes.................it covers all the bases.............whether you are in the stock market......have rental property.............or just a  normal tax return.............this is the one.......
5	1402790400	I have been using TurboTax for years and years and have always satisfied. It keeps up to date and has handled a wide variety of situations as the family evolves. Well done!
5	1402790400	Turbo tax is easy to use. i like that they have help on line. I've been using it for years.
4	1402704000	I use this product every year to do my taxes. It works as advertised. I have used it for as long as I can remember. The question is where to purchase it each year. I purchase from amazon the past two years. Last years copy was package poorly and it must have been damaged. It didn't work.
5	1402704000	Always great. Takes the headache out of doing your taxes. If I can use it, you can too. You'll save a lot of money by doing your own taxes and you'll know where you're money is going!
3	1402444800	I've used TurboTax for years, and have to say that they're getting a bit sloppy.It does the job, but I often have to wrestle with its quirks and inadequacies.You will need patience and perseverance to use this program.
5	1402444800	This is the 4 year I have prepared my own taxes and Turbo tax makes it all possible.  Over the past 4 years, I have save hundreds of dollars in accountant fees! Bravo for making this program user friendly!
5	1402444800	First of all, I've been using TurboTax for about 10 years now, and love it.  Porting everything from last year just makes this so easy, especially if you have a pretty consistent yearly tax return!  Same job?  Check.  Same mortgages?  Check.  This software is only as complicated as your taxes, and even then it's easy.And the refund bonus was GREAT.  Easily paid for the software itself, but wish I had bought much more to keep saving with Amazon.  Hope they do it again next year!
4	1402358400	Best to use year after year. Brings forward year after year info for prior years. Gives good hints about what may be missing/needed.
5	1402099200	As always, Turbo Tax makes filing taxes extremely easy. Have used for several years now and would recommend and plan to use again in the future.
5	1402099200	The first time to use Turbo Tax and it was so easy to use.  It was also much cheaper than using an accountant.  I will use Turbo Tax again next year.
5	1402099200	works great. easy to use. i have used turbo tax for over a decade and had no problems. as to the bonus offer, didnt use it so cant comment
5	1402012800	I buy this every year to do my taxes.  Makes doing taxes easy and takes you right through everything.  I would recommend this product.
5	1402012800	I've purchased these in the past and have fully been satisfied. recommend it for anyone who loves to delve into doing there own taxes.
5	1401926400	Since I started doing my own taxes, this has been the no-brainer purchae for me.  My taxes aren't that involved, but I appreciate Turbotax's load of questions looking for additional savings/deductions that I would've never thought of on my own.
5	1401840000	I always use this program, very easy, walk you through every step. Would and have recommended to many friends and family.
5	1401840000	I have always used turbotax and I find it real easy to use.This is a time saving and reliable software.
5	1401753600	Circumstances changed greatly in our household last year, and I feared how difficult taxes might be this year.  Turbo tax made it easy; all the forms and questions easily addressed our changes.  In the end I was a little worried that it might have been too simple -- like maybe I missed something.  I highly recommend this software.
4	1401667200	We have used Turbo-tax for years and have always found it easy to use for easy returns.It appears to be the same programs offered on IRS.gov.It took care of business.
5	1401580800	Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal and Sate helped me with my taxes and I rely on this software annually.  This is a good vale for the money and Turbo Tax keeps making important improvements.
3	1401408000	The software worked just as expected, I've used TurboTax.com for a couple of years now, and have loved it.  But with the disc you can not import your info from Online and you can not export it to Online to keep all your records in one place for years to come.  Seems COMPLETELY flawed to have that incredible disconnect...I'll go back to Online next year and will always be missing 2013 I guess.Also bought a disc this year because I figured I could take advantage of the Refund Bonus and get a little Amazon cash. Just didn't work.  Gave me an error that I couldn't do the refund bonus because I was depositing into a checking account, so I went back and got rid of the checking account and it yelled at me that I couldn't get a refund bonus unless I put in my checking account number!
5	1401408000	This app is time tested and proven and really does not need any review. An essential app on any and every machine.
5	1401235200	Have been using TurboTax for ten years or more. It does everything I could ask for and more, highly recommended to everyone.
5	1401235200	I use Turbo Tax every year to do my taxes. The Tax chore is completed easily and quickly with a guarantee of no errors.
5	1401235200	I still get confused as to which section I'm supposed to put some of my numbers into (even after TT has been trying to make it easier and clearer, it hasn't cleared up for me) but it is getting better, takes far less time now to fill out these returns then it used to.  I don't know what all that &#34;Refund Bonus&#34; is about, no one offered me a refund (wish they would; government is sucking way too much of my money away and using it in ways I don't like).  I'll probably stay with TT and now am wondering if TT has a version for retirees (and the various things retirees tap their savings/SS).
5	1401148800	Been using Turbo Tax for years, transfers your info from filing to filing, very informative, friendly to the eyes and of course you like seeing the meter on top of the screen with the numbers green (money they owe you!).  They help you get the best return. As long as you cover all the bases they ask you to check (they make it easy) and plug in the real numbers you will know where you stand. They offer a free E-file with purchase too though I'd rather take the mail in option with the way things are going now days.
2	1401062400	The program did not allow me to complete it.  Tech person talked me through it, but it took a very long time, and the tech informed me that there was a problem with the disc.  In recompense, I was not charged for electronic filing, but frankly the amount (nor any amount, for that matter) would have made up for the frustration.
5	1401062400	I used this do my federal and state taxes. It was easy to use, just answering the simple questions and the software program put it together for me to file to the IRS and my state tax department.  The price was good and you cannot beat the two days Amazon Prime.
5	1400976000	This is the 2nd year I've used turbotax. I hate to admit that my brain doesn't function enough to do our taxes without it, but there have been so many recent changes I haven't been able to keep up!I like being able to download it as soon as I order it and have saved enough in taxes that it really does pay for itself - and more.
4	1400976000	I did not find this as easy as some of my family/friends but I was obviously very rusty after using a CPA for years.  I'm thankful for my previous tax experience and the double checks that are built into the software.  Will continue to use TurboTax unless I have to return to the CPA.  I would do this only if our tax affairs become more complicated and I want to pay the price for the guidance.  It's obvious that you can drill down into the IRS codes, etc. for any answer you need.  It is just time consuming.  Not for the faint of heart but great tool.
2	1400889600	Extremely disappointed in changes to TurboTax interface.  Nearly impossible to move around return outside of forms view.  I've used TT since its beginning, but will be parting ways next year. Boo.
5	1400889600	I get the Turbo Tax Deluxe every year. Our income tax is not complicated so I feel comfortable using Turbo Tax.
4	1400889600	This product does the trick for us; my husband is self-employed and I am a teacher. It takes us through all of the steps for deductions. I used the free State file for us as well, but found that our state also has a free state filing system this year, which I used for my son, since his taxes were not complicated.
5	1400803200	I have used both HRBlock and TurboTax products.  While both may have their issues, which seem to change from year to year, using TT consistently makes the year-to-year data transfer and comparison easier than switching back and forth. Some special features may not be transparent enough for the user who wants to know exactly what is happening (e.g., dealing with self-employment tax and clergy housing allowance), but my returns seem to be in order!
5	1400716800	I have used Turbo Tax for years.  Find it to be a great value for the work that it does.  So much less hassle than doing it manually and so much cheaper than hiring someone else to do it for me.
5	1400716800	I've been using this for years and it makes doing taxes easy.  I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
5	1400716800	This is an easy and fun way to do your own taxes if they are simple. I even had H & R Block do a second look on my taxes after I had done them, and everything was done correctly! Thanks TurboTax!
4	1400630400	The usual from Intuit.  No surprise here, this works as expected, at a reasonable price.  No surprises, no problems, works great on Windows 7.
5	1400630400	Never had an issue with TurboTax to get the maximum refund possible!I have used this software for the last 10 years with never an issue.
5	1400544000	Each year Turbo Tax gets easier to use. This was no exception. Keep the annual updates coming each tax season!
5	1400544000	I have been using Turbo Tax for a few years now to do my taxes. Saves money. Walks you through everything for income and deductions and then fills in the blanks. Love it.
1	1400544000	I have been using Turbo Tax for years. Now you really have to concentrate to get the version that includes business. I have a little home business that I need Turbo Tax for as well as personal. This one doesn't do it. I am starting to hate the money grubbing company. Had to order the other version after I opened this one and discovered it was wrong.
5	1400457600	I recived my turbotax sooner then I was told it would be here.  This is a great way to do your taxes.
5	1400457600	I have been a Turbo Tax user for several years now. In my opinion they make a great product which is pretty simple to use. I used to do my own taxes by hand - paper forms and calculator and a lot of reading and prep before doing them.  I started doing my own taxes because i was tired of paying what i felt were overly high fees to one of the well known tax services.  For a couple of years i had the tax service complete my taxes after i did a draft of them at home. I found they were not getting me any more money back than i could on my own so i stopped paying them and keep that fee in my pocket. It would take me the better part of the day to complete my taxes by hand. One year i decided to try Turbo Tax and my time to complete my returns went to about two hour. after a couple of years of using it it is a bit over an hour. Now everyone in the family is using it and is happy with the results. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of paying too much to the tax services to get their taxes done and file their return. With the E-file option you have you money back within days in most cases.
5	1400457600	Buy it every year and is easy to use and a great tool for double checking the tax accountants work.
3	1400371200	Seems to flow ok, not good. I still wonder if I miss any deductions may be something new next tax season
5	1400284800	I usually use Turbo Tax every year to do my taxes as well as taxes for family members.  I thought that the 10% bonus for putting all or part of the Federal refund onto an Amazon gift card was a great idea and I was excited about doing so.  Alas, I owed the Federal government money and didn't get a return.  Still an awesome deal!!
4	1400284800	I've been using Turbo Tax for over 10 years, and I don't think you can beat it.  $45-$50 to have your taxes done well?  Seems like a no brainer to me.  It imports all the information from last year so it really saves you time.  I think the program asks really thorough questions to make sure you get the maximum amount of legal tax breaks.
5	1400284800	Been using Turbo Tax for years and years... this year was just like all the others and not a hitch in the process.  Can't complain!
2	1400198400	Same information applied. 2 different results from the cd and from the internet. It was supposed to come with the State program but it did not I have to pay $ 19.99 extra for the State
5	1400198400	I have used TurboTax for 15 years now....It has definitely helped me receive a bigger return than when I did my taxes on my own. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to prepare their taxes but concerned that they may miss something, get a smaller return, or worse, get audited!!! TurboTax &#34;holds your hand&#34; and &#34;walks&#34; you through the process of filing your tax returns. And checks your return for accuracy and then assists you in efiling, or printing and mailing off your return! Don't be afraid that you have a &#34;situation&#34; too difficult; TurboTax has thought of EVERYTHING!!!!
5	1400112000	I really love this tax software because its very helpful in guiding me step by step for filling the tax return form. Even though I studied tax in school, I'm still nervous for the first time file my tax return and my family, this software is built to help people through the jungle of tax laws. I guarantee that every one can file their tax return easily even though they have never done it before or never gone to class for taxation. It saves a lot of money for going out and find a tax preparer, and this software still gives you the same money return as you get from any tax preparer. Highly recommended.
5	1400112000	This was my third year using TurboTax.Easy to use. Works great...The only complaint is that it's a bit tedious with a lot of repetition. But that is for a reason so it is ok...I wish it was a bit simpler to print out the returns...
5	1400112000	We reviewed this product in 2012 because we were so happy with how easy it made it to prepare and submit our tax return.  Nothing has changed, 2013 was another easy tax preparation season for us thanks to using TurboTax.  We'll use it again next year!
4	1400112000	Our government is pretty intimidating and especially with the personal income tax system. Rather than hours of trying to figure out government instructions with their tax forms, I use TurboTax, and their e-filing for both FED and State, and their audit insurance program. I once worked my way through an IRS audit just after I liquidated a small business at a great loss. The IRS agent came to my home and offered her my PC which had Quicken and QuickBooks and she worked on it for a few days. Then I moved to California and continued with the IRS through ten rounds of mail and response. The IRS found my books clear and well-supported, but the time spent was considerable, and the tummy acid on my side even more so. So I pay for Turbotax plus add-ons. What we really need  is a serious tax reform where filing is on one sheet of paper.
4	1400025600	The step throughs were somewhat wordy for me, but my returns were successfully submitted, federal and state, wth the appropiate paymant options. I did not use the import options because I was ignorant about that feature. Now that I am aware of how that feature works I will probably purchase the product for 2014.
5	1399939200	I have been using Turbo Tax for 7 years now and never had a problem that they would not help me fix.
5	1399939200	I have been using Turbo tax for many years.  It seems that it is getting a little more difficult to use each year.  But it arrived on time, I think I got the right refund, and would use it again.
3	1399939200	Midway through tax preparation, the program failed.  It would no longer go from forms mode to step-by-step mode.  I had to call the Turbotax  Help line, and the very helpful technician sent me a new version of the software.
5	1399939200	It is a lot cheaper than going to &#34;tax professionals&#34; that aren't all that smart to begin with.  I recommend it highly!
5	1399852800	They might be considered legacy software in the cloud era, but they get the job done.  I've tried others and when you can get great pricing there is no reason to switch.Best Price Anywhere - Products came on time and at the best price.  I typically get this bundle every few years (to upgrade Quicken), and could not find it anywhere except amazon.  As usual, best price, and delivered on schedule.  what more can you ask for.
4	1399766400	Liked what was the same as previous years.disliked unnecessary changes.disliked commercials in the middle of using turbo tax.Need to expand the donation section, go to any Salvation Army and find out what they are taking in for sale in their store.Don't advertise free e-file and then charge for state e-file.
5	1399680000	I use Turbo Tax every year and it makes things quick and easy. I will continue to purchase this product to do my taxes.
4	1399680000	How can I say I love it.  I hate figuring taxes.  Usually always run into a problem that is resolved when I download the latest updates in early April.
5	1399593600	Have been using TURBOTAX for the last several years and have compared it to my individual tax preparer. This does just a good a job as a tax person. I have been pleased with TURBO very much so.  THANK YOU............
1	1399593600	This would not load on my computer.  I spent over half an hour with their techs and still wouldn't work.  They gave me a file number and said I would get a call.  I never did and consider this terrible.
4	1399507200	It's TurboTax, it will let you send your money to government, and if you didn't mess up anything keep you out of jail. It's great!!! :)
5	1399507200	We use Turbotax every year, and haven't had any issues as the result of its fault. This year we elected to have a portion of our tax refund (inordinately large due to having a child, with associate tax credit, and moving cross country, with associated deductible expenses) sent to Amazon as a gift card, in order to get the 10% bonus.The bonus process and gift card redemption worked just as advertised. We diverted $1000 of our Federal tax refund to Amazon, and got a 10% ($100!) bonus, that more than paid for the cost of Turbotax itself.Win all around.
4	1399420800	It's very easy doing taxes w/TurboTax, but I wished it got here a day earlier than April 15th.  We had to pay a fee since we did our taxes on the 15th
3	1399420800	I think Turbotax gets worse every year.  It makes you do things over that you have done already and it keeps asking you the same darn questions about buying extras even after you have said no multiple times.
4	1399420800	I've used Turbo Tax for many years now.  This years' seemed to be a little less intuitive than last.  For instance, we have an RV.  Last year there was a specific listing for it under &#34;properity taxes&#34;.  This year they didn't mention or leave a specific space for them, so you have to guess where to list it.  Even though I'm sure the tax code is getting more complex, the more items or situations that are listed, the easier it is for us to fill in.  KEEP IT INTUITive gang!
5	1399420800	I've used TurboTax for over 20 years, have never been audited and wouldn't use any other tax software.  If you're wondering what to do, just buy it and you won't be sorry.  It's accurate and simple to use.
5	1399420800	I have been using Turbo Tax since about 1990.  My first versions ran under DOS.  I have never had a problem with it and it has never given me bad information or a wrong calculation.  Highly recommended.
4	1399334400	It was very helpful by going over various reductions I wasn't even aware of until I completed my taxes. It's best to have all of your forms and paperwork before starting because there was a few times I had to stop and dig up paperwork I had forgotten about. It was also very nice to be able to &#34;pause&#34; and step back before electronically sending it off. The best thing about it all was I received my refund 10 days after it was sent. Would definitely recommend using it.
2	1399334400	Been using TurboTax or H&R; Block back and forth as sales make one or the other lower in price. For the last few years, TurboTax was the best bargain... So I installed TT FS 2013 and imported my TT FS 2012 data. It imported my name, W-2 info and the such, but as I would learn later going through the &#34;interview,&#34; my NUMBERS from 2012 did not import properly. All through the interview, I did not have any 2012 comparison data, it was all &#34;$0.00&#34; in every field...As with many, I waited until the last week to do my taxes (as I love them so!), as no updates window was left, so I cannot with confidence say that my taxes this year are &#34;100% accurate.&#34; I have screenshots of TT 2013 telling my I am &#34;100% error free,&#34; but I don't believe it this year. I am not an accountant, so I do not have the skill to thread through all the forms MANUALLY, so I submitted them trusting all is well and I don't get an audit... I do know I will request the FEE & PENALTY refund if TT did make a mistake, as I have screenshots all the way along...Even had an Intuit tech online ask me some additional questions, but it ended with a &#34;maybe your 2012 data is corrupt&#34; and I should reload the TT 2012 program and check my data file for errors. Umm, no thanks! I have better things to do, like get a root canal... So I ended the thread with the stupidity of why TT 2013 would not open a TT 2012 data file for me to look at IN REVIEW? WTH is that stupidity? Anyways, 2013 tax year is gone and I will most likely go with H&R; Block next year...
5	1399334400	I am a long time user of Turbo Tax.The product has many features and is very easy and straight forward to use.I recommend this product to everyone who wants to do their own taxes!!
4	1399248000	I used this program for many years long ago.  Only stopped because my taxes became more complex and required a CPA.  Now I am back to using Turbo Tax deluxe again.  I am impressed with their new program and all the new features in it.
5	1399248000	File taxes the easy way.  I was easily guided through tax preparation and didn't have to stress about whether or not I was doing it right.
3	1399248000	I've used turbotax for years, satisfactorily.  This year, there was a bug in the software that many users (according to turbotax's web forums) had - where the tax return could not be saved and the error code blamed the drive where the return was being saved.  Turbotax's help desk had no insight other than just close and reopen and continue from wherever the last time the file was saved.  Luckily I did not lose much information but I am hesitant to recommend Turbotax again for their lack of recognition of this critical software bug.
5	1399248000	Been using this for years.  No complaints.  Filing was a breeze.  Lot's of automatioin and timesavers.  Clear instructions and explanations.  Logical development of a return.  Will use again next year.
5	1399161600	Turbo Tax is always the best system  for me to use when filing my Federal and State taxes and I will probably use it again and again for each yearly tax season..Thanks,
3	1399161600	TurboTax Deluxe Fed, Efile and State 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer  is a good tax program. I do feel it is a overprice and it gets the job done without an accountant. Recommended.
5	1399161600	I have used Turbo Tax for years.  It is consistently accurate and easy to use.  I found the 2013 version to be the same as those before it.
5	1399161600	Been using Turbo Tax for about ten years now and I love the ease and simplicity of the software.  I can usually get my taxes done in 2-3 hours if I've been keeping up on my filing and that includes double-checking a few times.  Two things:  This year they raised the separate filing fee you have to pay to e-file your state taxes (25 now instead of 20).  Also, you'll probably want to remove/uninstall the software after you're done with it and you've saved your return as a PDF.  The 2013 version was the largest yet and I had been wondering why my computer was so bogged down lately.  During a check-up of the computer I realized I hadn't uninstalled any of the previous versions going back to 2009 and never realized how large the programs were and how much memory they had been sucking up.
1	1399075200	Was thinking of switching to one of the less expensive products this year, but the 10% Refund Bonus was too good to pass up.  I received an emailing saying my gift card has been cancelled due to an &#34;IRS adjustment&#34; to my refund and this type of change is &#34;not entirely uncommon&#34;.I actually purchased the Deluxe Version instead of the Basic in order to increase that &#34;Bonus&#34; from 5% to 10%.  My refund amount changed by approx. $0.30 and there was more than enough to cover the cost of the Amazon Gift Card.  There is no recourse.  From my perspective the change was due to some inaccuracy of TurboTax and thus this seems like a bait and switch scam.There accuracy guarantee only covers &#34;penalty or interest because of a TurboTax Calculation error&#34; but has nothing to do with accuracy.
5	1398988800	As the header says, the product is great.  I had many new tax items this year and Turbo tax handled all of them with no problem.
4	1398988800	I really like TurboTax, have used it for the past 4 years and hope TurboTax will continue versions of the program that my computer continues to support.  This year, all was easily accomplished as far as entering all information needing to be reported.  It was only when it came to filing the completed returns that I ran into the inability to have the filing go through.  After spending nearly 2 hours with a tech rep at TurboTax (who was very pleasant and who tried to get the filing accomplished--unsuccessfully) I finally went back to the beginning once more and basically started over.  When this process was complete, I crossed my fingers and hit the send button and lo! it went through.  Mission accomplished.  If it hadn't been for the extra time and frustration of the filing issue, the program rating would have been a full five stars as it has been each prior year.
5	1398988800	a wonderful software, very user friendly.  It makes the tax return very easy.  I will recommend it to everyone and I will use it every year for mysefl.
5	1398988800	It's tough to write a &#34;positive&#34; review for something that, basically, helps the government rob you.  But since it's gonna happen anyway, and nothing's going to stop it, may as well have a useful tool to help get  you through the misery!  I've been using Turbo Tax for about 15 years or more, and really like it.
4	1398902400	I had problems this year when I needed to make some corrections on some of my entries. It was quite frustrating and I had to send it like it was.
5	1398816000	We've been using this product for our taxes for over 7 years.  We found that the program was very complete and the help that TurboTax  folks provide is accurate.  Thanks TurboTax!!!!!
4	1398816000	I gave this a less than 5 star rating because I made an error and trying to delete it and make the necessary changes was more difficult than I expected. It took me several times online to find a way to resolve my issues. I also did not expect the extra fee to file my State taxes.
4	1398816000	Does the job- I am not happy that they charge for e-file. if I find a product that does not they will lose my business.Also not all financial institutes are available 2 of the banks I deal with I had to manually enter the information.
5	1398816000	I had 1 problem that was my fault entered the wrong pin number they rejected it turbo taxtold me what i needed done that sent it back and all was ok then should save some moneyI'm not in Jail yet
5	1398729600	I hadn't done my own taxes in over 20 years. I got tired of paying an accountant plus the task of getting a convenient appointment. So I tried Turbotax. I am hooked. It was so easy to follow. . When I was finished I compared it to last years forms done by a CPA  just to ensure I hadn't made any mistakes.  All was good! I submitted my return electronically and got my refund in about 10 days.
4	1398729600	I've used the TurboTax software for about five years with no significant problems. I would give it five stars if the on-line help were better. I am sure that I will be using TurboTax again in for my next tax returns.
5	1398729600	I have used Turbo Tax for years to do my federal and state income taxes.  It is a good program and if you have problems, the customer service is good.  Once you start using a tax program, it better be good because all your data is on it and  it  isn't worth the trouble to change to another program.  The previous years data transfers automatically, saving time and effort.
5	1398729600	Turbotax makes tax preparation and filing so easy.  I've been using the Deluxe product for the past five years and find it covers all my financial bases.  I've looked at competitor's products and have been unimpressed in comparison to Quicken's Turbotax.
4	1398643200	This has to be the 15 year I've used TurboTax and it couldn't be easier.  It's everything I expected it to be
3	1398643200	What to say...been using Turbo Tax for over 25 years.  Good program, pricey but still cheaper than an accountant.  Hate taxes, not so much paying as the hassle of filing.
5	1398643200	Our taxes are done! We usually put off getting this each year, but every year we always buy it and are happy with the results.
5	1398643200	Installed easily, no problems using it.  Makes my husband's life easier getting the tax chore finished.  Will buy again next tax season.
3	1398643200	It's easy to install and use. But it could be a lot easier if Intuit paid a bit more attention to keyboard users. The program cannot be used strictly with the keyboard only because Intuit did not pay attention to basic UI standards (you cannot use the PgUp and PgDn keys to scroll up and down, nor can you use the Up and Down cursor keys). Also TTax still does not remember answers to a Yes/No question if you revisit a topic. It also does not remember the &#34;None of the above&#34; if that is the answer you used. Very annoying.The pricing for a second state is still highway robbery, and so is the e-filing for a second state (more than the product itself).
5	1398556800	Did what it was supposed to. No hassle with the CD version. The help was very helpful and replied quickly to my questions.
3	1398556800	I LOVE TurboTax for helping me do our own taxes (=5 stars) but I HATE TurboTax for making me think I understand doing our own taxes (=1 star)
5	1398556800	This was my 2nd time using it. I really like it, It does everything for you. I would recommend it to highly.
5	1398556800	Great product. Got more money back than I expected. Should have it bought last year since it was a great product.
5	1398470400	I've been using it for years with no problems at all. I feel secure with the results and will continue to use it.
5	1398470400	Good, comprehensive product.  Good support.  Best price.  Amazing Amazon refund deal: 10% bonus added to refund if taken by way of an Amazon gift card (up to $470 bonus on a max $4700 refund, potentially with some limitations depending upon nature of filing).  I've found that some manual adjustments/overrides are sometimes necessary with the product, particularly with respect to calculation interactions between state and federal data inputs, so be prepared to understand tax calculations to be able to make such corrections where necessary (e.g., getting credit on one's federal return for nonresident taxes withheld by a partnership, even in which one is also processing that state's tax return via TurboTax).  A great deal.
4	1398384000	Can't understand why this continues to 'go up' in cost.  Price gouging?  It almost is getting to be as cheap to go to S&R Block...
3	1398384000	I have always used turbo tax and liked it a lot.  This time, however,  there seem to be a glitch in the application and it took considerable time and a wonderful customer service person to resolve the problem.  I hope this never happens again.
5	1398384000	Turbo Tax 2013 worked really great this year, no problems whatsoever.  Easy to get around from forms to being guided through it.
5	1398384000	I was nervous about doing my own taxes.  This software made is easy to use. Great product.  Detailed answers to my questions on certain subjects was extremely helpful.  Software is not compatible with earlier version of Microsoft products.  I was upset at first, but it downloaded easily on my laptop that has the latest windows software.  Got my taxes done.
5	1398384000	Buy this every year and do my taxes. Beats waiting in line and ask the same questions as any tax preparer.  Connects online to explain any questions. Includes federal and state. Amazon also beat everyone elses price.
4	1398297600	It simplifies the whole process of doing your income tax and and have used this product for several years and expect to continue using it in the future.
5	1398297600	Turbotax has alway been a reliable product so I will purchase again, however, there were some internal issues with the software that I couldn't resolve with the directions provided and after reading the feedback from other users, neither could they. It was a nuisance item with an error code that repeatedly popped up making it more tedious to complete the taxes.
4	1398297600	It helped me do my taxes. Federal taxes are E-Filed and I sent my state taxes through the mail. A forever stamp is a much cheaper and easier option than paying for E-File.
5	1398297600	I have been using TurboTax for several years and find it to be a lifesaver.  Yes, I could pay a tax person but with a little effort and this product I find it is way less expensive.  One year I tried a different tax prep software offered by a famous tax prep company.  It was cheaper but not nearly as user friendly.  The questions, reviews and FAQ's with TurboTax are just great.  I will buy it again.
4	1398297600	I have been using TurboTax for many years without problems.My one dislike is that they charge you an excessive amount if you need to use a 2nd state product.
5	1398297600	As usual, this product is very easy to use, and thorough. Never get the audit defense because I really don't feel I will need it.
4	1398297600	Generally works to get moderately complicated tax done.  However it is still hard to figure how to get certain things in properly.  The method for putting in a large number of charatable deductions is hard.  It would be much better in a spread sheet form.  It is only possible to get the tax done by constantly looking at the pdf preview.
1	1398211200	TurboTax Deluxe Federal, Efile, & State 2013 was great -- as always.However, Intuit, Inc. perpetrated the biggest Rip-Off Scam we have ever seen, in both of our 68 Years!For years, we have been buying this tax software and paying the $10 extra for our State Efiling.  And, our Federal & State refunds were automatically direct deposited by the IRS & State to our checking account by them.This year, Intuit found a really disingenuous way to extort $59.98 out of us!  They enlisted Sunrise Banks N.A. & Santa Barbara Tax Products Group (SBTPG), as TurboTax partners, to process our refunds by deducting new TurboTax fees of $34.99 for &#34;Refund Processing&#34; and $24.99 for &#34;TurbotTax Fee&#34; from our Federal refund, before sending the remainder of our refund to our checking account!The way Intuit explained getting our tax refunds, it wasn't at all clear that we could receive them by electronic direct deposit -- as we always have -- if we didn't agree to their five-pages of intimidating fine print!So, we paid $49.99 for our TurboTax Deluxe Federal, Efile, and State 2013 software.  But, then, Intuit, Sunrise Banks N.A,. and Santa Barbara Tax Products Group (SBTPG) took us for an additional  $59.98 -- 120% more than the cost of our TurboTax software!It is unbelievable what these people will do to enrich themselves...............
1	1398211200	Program had problems with both Federal and State e-filing.  There was no confirmation that State had received and accepted my return. I can only wait until state sends a form letter saying it has not received my return.In addition - it did not correctly categorize investments imported from my brokerage firm.  Note - I used Turbo Tax in 2012 as well as prior years.  Unfortunately the incorrect categorization occurred in 2012 - I received a form letter from IRS telling me I had not paid enough taxes and I have to pay IRS by May 7 or face further penalties.Because of this I cannot recommend Turbo Tax to others.
4	1398211200	I've used it for years. This year it got a little confused with one of the K-1's I had. It said I had duplicate descriptions for box 16 when there were none. I managed to work around the problem. Other than that it's super easy to use. I just wish it would handle printing out forms a better when doing double sided printing. If a form has an odd number of pages, double sided printing should insure a blank page is used instead of printing some other form.
5	1398124800	Works great just like every other year I have used turbotax. This is a great product. Will use again next year too.
2	1398124800	I've used Turbo Tax for the last 4 years and have never had to pay anything additional.  This year I could complete my filing until I agreed to pay an additional $59 for using the software.  I thought when I purchased it that was the only price I was going to pay!!  Not pleased at all with this!
4	1398124800	Still one of the best programs around! Only problem was the Heart Bleed Issue which seemed to make getting the updates a lot harder.
5	1398124800	I've used Turbotax for over 10 years.  It walks you through your return step by step.  I find it very easy to use.
4	1398124800	TurboTax is still my preferred tax filing solution.  It pays to get the updates before use, however, between loading and obtaining the updates, it is a prolonged process.  I do like the process of importing data from the previous year if the same computer was used. Editing/changing info or data is also user-friendly. I do think that TurboTax could use a price cut and it will be challenged by H&R Block.
3	1398038400	Does a good job , fairly easy to use and makes filing easy.  The  bonus rebate had a limit that was not disclosed and I had to have it mailed to my not secure home address instead of my secure PO Box.  All I can hope is that I can get to my mail before the bad guys.
5	1398038400	TurboTax... love this program.  I could have bought locally for the same price, but with this bundle I got Quiken 2014 for just an additional $10.00!  Great deal.
3	1398038400	The ability to switch between Easy Step and Forms was very helpful.However, the instruction to &#34;leave blank&#34; to indicate a choice was not helpful. Beginning with the question about  the Presidential Election contribution and in several other places, the blank box is to be read as &#34;no&#34;. This is very confusing and was cleared only with a lengthy phone call.However, the phone support  was excellent!
5	1398038400	Use this program every year. Amazon was $10.00 less expensive than any place I found, including Walmart and Costco.  I would never consider doing my taxes without using TurboTax!
5	1398038400	Tax season is over, but again, Turbo Tax proved its worth. I will be buying it again in November for TY-2014.
5	1398038400	If you are looking to do straight taxes without a lot of deductions then this will save you money. Most people I know pay about 250.00 to have their taxes done. This cost 40. and came with efile return. My state actually came back first, them my fed. They went into my bank account. Turbo leads you by the hand and you don't really have to guess. I like both State and Fed together. I will buy this product again for future taxes.
3	1398038400	The software entered the wrong amount in the "taxes due" line 44, Form 1040.I took the return to the IRS office for conformation, to be sure I had not read the tax tables incorrectly.At present, I am still having trouble getting any contact with the proper people at TurboTax.
5	1398038400	no issues
1	1398038400	If things had run smoothly, I would have filed my taxes in early March.  Instead, when I got to the end to e-file, they told me my forms weren't available.  I thought that was strange and signed up for an email for when they would become available.  I never received anything and according to TT's customer service site, they were available.  I kept doing updates on TT in hopes that it would fix whatever glitch was going on, no luck.  I found a customer service number and called that.  Of course the wait times were astronomical, but they did have an option to where I could keep my place in line and get a call back from them.  The third time I called was when I chose this option because the wait time was only 20 minutes.  2 hours later was when I got a call back, and by that time I had moved on and decided to get my taxes done at H&R.  The program would have gotten 5 stars from me if they had better customer service and my program didn't have a glitch.  It's a shame because it was my first time using TurboTax, but now I'll never use it again.
1	1398038400	I have been using turbo tax for the past 6 years, this version would not communicate with its web site.  I kept getting a message &#34;imcompatible browser&#34;.  Of course there is no way to contact turbo-tax, only a user forum, on my I-Pad.  Could not do my taxes and ended up purchasing H&R Block Tax Program, which worked with absolutely no problems, and was less expensive.  Wasted $40.00 on this, would not recommend to anyone.
5	1398038400	THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR I USED TURBO, AND IT WAS A BREEZE.  I ROUGH THE FIGURES OUT BY HAND, AND THEN RUN THE NUMBERS THROUGH TURBO.  THEY MATCHED TO THE PENNY!  I HAVE MY RETURNS ALREADY!
4	1398038400	I finished my taxes with this product. I have been using Turbo Tax for many years, ant it always works out fine.
4	1397952000	In previous editions the program advised you when you would get your refund. This time I had to log into the IRS site to determine the status of the refund. Also and this really irked me, I signed on for an electronic deposit to my bank account giving both my routing number and account number. The state refund was deposited to my bank account electronically, The Fed refund was mailed by the IRS and not electronically deposited. Otherwise the program worked flawlessly as in previous years.
5	1397952000	The math is accurate and the program is thorough.  If an answer is not readily visible, there are many suggestions as to how to find the answer to what one is looking for.
4	1397952000	Pretty simple product, relatively speaking. It actually gets even more simple for return customers if you saved your prior year's Turbotax data files. It autofills a lot of fields from prior data. Tax professionals will likely just input the same numbers into very similar software but charge you a whole lot more. My biggest complaint is that the state edition doesn't actually cover state e-file fees, which was an extra $20. My state apparently has some requirement, enforced by Turbotax, that if you federal efile then you are required to also efile your state, but you can't efile one and not the other. Last year with Turbotax I was able to efile my federal and just print my state return without the upsell charge. So just be aware there may be extra charges.
5	1397952000	Have been using turbotax the last 10 years, never had a problem. won't stop using it either. The best one.
5	1397865600	I have used Turbo Tax for three years.  Turbo Tax is very easy to use and is accurate.  I usually end up having to pay the IRS and Turbo Tax will make sure that I have all the deductions I need to make the payment less painful. Also, you do not have to complete your taxes at one time, you can save your return and come back to it.  It really is like having a CPA do your taxes, but you can wear your pajamas if you want to.
4	1397865600	I have used TurboTax for 20 years and I love it. This year though, I did my taxes in late March. I went to check them (I always do them twice to make sure I get the same results) around April 8th and TurboTax downloaded an update correcting some forms. This is very late and I would think it would be a problem for the many people who filed already. Fortunately, whatever the changes were did not affect my taxes because when I did them again i got the same result. Overall it is a great product, but late updates are a bit troubling I think.
5	1397865600	i've been using TurboTax since 1999 and don't see any reason to change...it just keeps getting better. Plus, I like the way it can read last year's return, fill in all of the demographic information that's the same, do all tax-loss-carry-forward calculations, and even forward on-going expenses like depreciation. Good stuff...
4	1397865600	I had a rather irritating time with installing which may have been due to an interrupted installation or an incorrect .Net version but that wasn't the worst part. I interrupted the installation when I inadvertently bypassed a screen trying to install 3rd party browser add-ons. The Intuit uninstaller seems to take over when trying to uninstall from add remove programs in the control panel and it just kept locking things up and I've never had that happen with Windows 7 previously. I installed Turbo Tax in a WinXP virtual machine, that went smoothly and I completed my taxes. I finally had to restore a previous backup from prior to installing Turbo Tax to get Windows working properly. I've never had this much trouble with a software installation but I've tried other tax software and once it was installed Turbo Tax is still the best...
5	1397865600	I've been using TurboTax for almost 20 years now.  I absolutely love it.  I just wish the extra &#34;state&#34; forms didn't cost so much - I have to file in two or three states every year along with my fed - and it burns me to have to pay an extra $30 for a state, when the Fed and one state is $54!
5	1397865600	Taxes are so complex these days that professional help is required. TurboTax provided the help I needed to get the job done. Great product.
1	1397865600	Two problems on my Mac:* Save to PDF (crash)* Print (crash)And help and forums were junk when I typed in the error code for another issue.  I seriously got an &#34;our engineers are working on a fix&#34; on April 14th.  Wow.  Finally got it going thanks to a Windows Virtual Machine.Also won't be buying this again due to the lobbying work of Intuit (Google it) that I'm ideologically opposed to.
4	1397865600	Been using it for years and it's always been very easy to use. Some of the explanations are a little vague when I get stumped on a few questions but I was able to get to their site and message board to get the answers.
5	1397779200	I have utilized TurboTax for some years now. I would say my taxes are complex enough that I would normally be tempted to utilize a tax service. However, TurboTax walks me through all of my statements one step at a time and allows me to feel comfortable that I have received the maximum returns, etc. for my particular financial profile. I have not been audited nor been contacted by the IRS for any filing errors (which has happened prior when I did my taxes without TurboTax) since utilizing TurboTax.
1	1397779200	I've been using Turbo Tax since the early 90's.  Before that Tax Cut.  I've never had a problem, everything was clearly explained, almost easy, until now.First Problem:  I'm 62 & retired in 2012.  We filed a married joint return.  Our AGI was $126,000.  I worked several days in 2013 at the old job when they were busy.  They sent me a 1099-MISC, Box 7 for $6400.  I put $6400 in a Roth IRA.In TurboTax I took no business expenses.  TT took $906 as business tax.  TT never explained how it determined this amount.TT error message says I contributed $453 too much to Roth and have to pay a penalty and withdraw the excess contribution or pay a penalty every year forever.  TT says my Roth limit is $5961.  No other explanation.  I know my Roth limit is $6500.In their &#34;HELP&#34; community, several other TT customers have posted the same problem, months ago.  No answer.  I posted this problem, I got no response from the &#34;HELP&#34; community.  I did not find any phone number to call.Second Problem: After completing my ILL State tax I wanted to efile it.  After paying the $25 fee, Turbo Tax told me there was a problem, I cannot efile.  Why didn't TT check the tax return before they got the fee?  Several other people posted this problem in the &#34;HELP&#34; community.  No answer.  I posted this problem with their &#34;HELP&#34; community, no response.  Now I'll have to fight with MasterCard and Turbo Tax to get my state filing fee back.Don't use Turbo Tax, they don't make the product they use to.Goodbye Turbo Tax!  Hello H&R; Block!!!
4	1397779200	I have been using TurboTax for the past 3 years.  They are easy to use.  They tend to guide you over all the necessary questions and calculations with worksheets etc.  it is also nice to be able to file the tax return electronically.  Save me quite. Bit of time.
5	1397779200	Been using this for 20 yrs. Easy to use...but used to have a free State with it now it doesn't .
4	1397779200	I have used Turbo Tax to complete & file my income Taxes for several years. I software is easy to use and the question cover a multitude of issue I never have thought of.
5	1397779200	Used it for years, return not complex, works like a charm, never had an issue, submits returns like a charm, going to stick with it.
2	1397779200	I have been using Turbo-tax for a number of years...each year I find the program becomes more complicated and more difficult to use. This year's program for entering stock sales is so bad I chose to extend my return so I have more time to enter all of the information. This is the last time I will purchase Turbo-TaX
5	1397779200	I have been doing my own taxes with pencil and paper since 1988. After too many mistakes over the years especially lately. I finally poney-ed up the $30/$40 and bought turbo tax.Oh my god, so much easier with this package. It would be nice however to deduct the cost of this software as a tax credit. Really the IRS is the one that should be providing this as a service to tax payers.
5	1397779200	This item is great for doing taxes at home.  They walk you through each step and ask you the appropriate questions.
3	1397779200	I have used Turbo Tax for many years.  I had significant issues with the California State download.  I had to call the support center three nights in a row - I received bad information from the first two support reps.I was very frustrated by the time I was able to get to someone that forwarded the file to me.  I will definitely re-think my use of Turbo Tax next year.
5	1397779200	I've been using TurboTax since before 2000, never had a problem filing or a questioned return, fed or state.Best is, when I changed home computers, their help desk actually helped me to bring old returns and processors onboard my new PC.I'm very happy with this outfit.
3	1397692800	Turbo Tax will help you with your taxes..........However, it is not magic.  You need to have all your figures and related expenxesready in advance to enter into the required catagories.  If you do this, you will find this program very helpful.  I have been using it every year since 2007.  I did my taxes by hand for many, many years.  This program is not perfect, but it is pretty good.  But you have to know what you are doing.  And you should check your finished product several times before sending off to IRS.  The electronic filing to the IRS and your state is excellent and trouble free.  I  purchase it every year from Amazon, and find they have the best price.
5	1397692800	I use TurboTax every year and it works great for me.  I don't have any problems with it and I have never been audited using it.
5	1397692800	This product works well and always does.  The delivery was timely and I got my taxes done easily. Better than any other tax software that I have ever used.
4	1397692800	I have used TurboTax for 5 years now and have been very happy with it.  It's easy to use and generally fast, especially when importing from Quicken.  If you are wanting to efile, this is a excellent way to go, at least until you get to submitting your state taxes.  I understand the need to recover costs for providing services, but this year the price jumped to $25.  That seems way too high for this and so I will be looking for another way to efile going forward.
5	1397692800	Used turbo tax to do my taxes and the taxes of my mother.  Has some features not found in tax cut.  Allolwing for the PSO credit increased my tax refund considerably.
4	1397692800	The 2013 TurboTax deluxe had many improvements over 2012 in filing and editing my returns. it still needs help in the StateTax.  Thanks a lot. GM
5	1397692800	Turbo tax is reliable as always, quicken 2014 has some nice updates, the mobile app is a plus, happy with purchase
4	1397692800	As usual the software was very user friendly and talked me through all the deductions that were due to me.  The only glitch was that it wouldn't accept my e-file and had to contact Turbo support in order for it to go through.
5	1397692800	THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO DO TAXES. IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE MOST DEDUCTIONS THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED AND ANSWERS ALL YOUR QUESTIONS, TO GET THE MAXIMUM RETURN THAT YOU DESERVE.I WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE WHO DO THEIR OWN TAXES TO TRY TURBO TAX THEY WILL GLAD THEY DID.
2	1397692800	I have always prepared our return with pen and pencil and have done it very easily. Friends have recommended Turbo Tax and told me how easy it would be. I found it cumbersome. Re-entering addresses, numbers, etc when other 1099s from same place had already been entered could have been streamlined to make it more user friendly. I would have liked having a "familiar" address show up to be clicked on. Any changes required too many redundent entries.Our taxes took me 1 1/2 days (I could have done it with pen on forms in less time) to enter it all, recheck, etc.  Friends tell me that in future years this will be much easier, but this time I was very disappointed.My major disappointment was that TurboTax made a very serious error on our state return, which would have had me in trouble had I used their calculation. It would have cost an extra 24.99 to E-file and have made a difference of almost 200 in taxes due! I ended up getting forms at our library and doing it with a pen on those and mailing it in.I notified Turbo Tax of the state problem I encountered, and they did not respond. I would recommend that all users be very cautious about the state returns, as they are not very good at that.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because friends have told me that future years would be better, but I am still "unsold"
4	1397692800	I have used Turbo Tax software for a number of years.  This year's software didn't always start where I left off when I came back to doing my taxes at a later time.  Other than that it would be rated 5 stars as far as I'm concerned.  I have recommended Turbo Tax to others.
4	1397692800	I have used TurboTax for over 5 years now. We sold our house last year and the section where the information for the base cost of buying a house is entered was not of much help (Abstract of title, surveys, etc.) Not even the TurboTax community could accurately walk us through the proper way to answer the questions and where to get the information from. This section needs improvement.
5	1397692800	Bought this product for my mom and aunt.  They have simple taxes and this product helps to do theirs without problems.
5	1397606400	I have been using Turbo Tax for over 30 years now and would not switch.  It has saved me lots of money over the years.
4	1397606400	Easy to go through.  The only thing that would be nice if the City has it's own tab - really shouldn't be with the States.THANKS for making it easy to go through
1	1397606400	Tried many times and it even took my money for electronic deposit then wouldn't.  Claims that it needs a software update but wouldn't take the update so I ended up mailing it.  The problem is that the California docs were not qualified to mail so I had to download from the State of California the 540 forms and do it myself. Is there live customer service, NO.  Will I ever buy this again, NO!  I'm trying any other brand next year.
5	1397606400	Best  development since the microwave - makes doing one's taxes stress free and easy...has all the forms needed. Once I gathered all my paperwork ( W-2s etc) it was doing and E-filed in about 2 hours...s t r e s s s s freeeeee!!!
5	1397606400	This is the first year I did my own taxes and I found it very easy to use.  In the past I had my taxes prepared for me and I just got tired of spending all that money, so I decided to take the big step and do my own taxes this year.  Very easy product to use, everything is explained as you go along.  Recommend this product.
5	1397606400	This year decided not to use CPA and did it myself.  TurboTax was very easy to use.  Will use it from now on.
3	1397606400	Living in PA and working in NJ shouldn't be a problem but the software wanted me to file in NJ for too even though I only have to file in PA.  Would not under any circumstance allow me to e-file PA unless I paid an additional $24.99.  Called customer service and my cordless phone's battery went dead before I was helped.  (That's how long it took).  Just printed it out and mailed it.
5	1397606400	Have been using Turbo Tax for years.  Have no problems and walks me through all my tax situations.  Will use it again next year.
5	1397520000	I have been using this great software for 15 years and I highly reccomend it for it's ease of use.
1	1397520000	I've used turbotax for the last ten years but never again!!  I bought this product ad received the CD for installation.  I installed the first of March and a day later my computer began freezing and eventually became unusable.  I couldn't even run antivirus programs to fix the problem.  Finally wiped my hard drive and did a new, clean installation of windows.I had no idea Turbotax had caused the problem.  Silly me.My computer ran like a breeze for the last month and a half.  With the tax deadline looming, I reinstalled Turbotax on Sunday the 13th and today my computer was unusable again.  I realized what was causing the problem...too late.Called Turbotax/Intuit for help but there was NONE!  they asked if i had installed from a CD and where I purchased it.  You could tell they were well aware of the problem but made no attempt to resolve it.  Said they would give me a refund...who cares?  That doesn't solve the computer problems......and the headaches.  What really gets me is they just said 'so sorry, i apologize, sorry'.....  Yeah, well, that didn't help.  I'm going to have to wipe my hard drive clean and reinstall windows again.What really gets me is that they didn't have a solution...and ended up saying they would report it to their engineering department.  Big deal.Don't buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's a nightmare and customer support doesn't care or offer a solution.
4	1397520000	This program allowed me to do my tax return by myself in a very short time.  I am retired, so my return is quite simple, but the program makes provision for much more complex income streams.  I recommend this program.
3	1397520000	This product works quite well for filing Federal taxes, and I have no quibble with most of this part of the product. I also appreciate the fact that one can use TurboTax for up to five different returns. However, the State product leaves a lot to be desired. Several important forms are not available, form look-up is not available, and I had to visit our state's site to obtain some common forms (e.g., health savings account). There is a charge for electronically filing the state form, so we simply printed out the filing forms, including those we obtained from our state, and mailed the return. A company with TurboTax's experience should be able to do better with the state portion.
5	1397520000	And I always buy it during the week it's $10 off.  Now that I am disabled and it's hard to get out of the house, buying from Amazon is just what I need too.
5	1397520000	I love Turbo Tax.  I have tried other tax products but none work as well.  I have a farm and Turbo Tax  makes it easy for me to input sales & expenses.  The ability to have categories transfer from year to year is really a nice feature.
1	1397520000	I think TurboTax is the most expensive way to file your income tax.  At the very last second right before filing they hit you with a $25.99 electronic filing fee for your state tax return that you do not know about.  They have a misleading American corporate greed mentality and are taking your money to the bank.  We should all buy stock in the company because they are making hundreds of millions taking advantage of the American tax payer when they are under the most pressure to get their taxes completed.
5	1397520000	I use it every year and it is the program that works best for me.  I'd buy it again next year.
4	1397520000	As usual doing our taxes with Turbo Tax is a breeze. Love the way that it pulls the last years totals into the program and walks you right through it. Would not do my taxes any other way.
5	1397520000	This does what it is advertised to do.  No complaints and no returns.  A great item at a great price.
4	1397520000	Don't always like the answers it provided (I have to pay) but I will continue to use it every year.  As painless as dealing with the IRS can be, which ain't saying much.  Filed weeks ago and scheduled my payment for today (ain't paying them a day early)
2	1397433600	I've used this product for my two children's federal and state returns before, but this year it was costly.  Although my son printed his Missouri state return, his sister had to pay $40 to be able to file it via paper return.  Because she worked in two states, each state return had a built-in reduction to her refund of $25-$35 which the representative was not able to explain.  Thus, it cost me over $150 for a $50 product.
4	1397433600	Bought this together with the newest Quicken release and it was the most attractive price I had seen for the two items - by a considerable margin.  I am very familiar with TurboTax having used it for probably 12-15 years - and I like the program.  The package included filing of the Federal return and a copy of the State program.
5	1397433600	Turbotax was easy to install, use and prompted me to explore all possible deductions. I would highly recommend it as a user friendly efficient way to prepare your own taxes.
5	1397433600	Very easy process - asks the questions and fills in your taxes accordingly based on your answers - no problem!
4	1397433600	Software arrived on time.  I have used turbo tax for several years without any issues. I plan to continue using this software.
1	1397433600	I have been using the H&R; block product for many years, but my investment reporting is getting really complicated, so I thought there must be a good reason that TurboTax is a better seller even though it is more expensive.  I was wrong!First, both products pretty much work the same, but At Home has much better help.  TurboTax has very little contextual help and when you click on the help button all it does is take you to a bulletin board where you can only hope to get lucky by searching for someone with a similar question.Second, handling investments is no better.  All my extra money got me was a pitch to spend another $30 to upgrade to premier.  Would premier have been better for my specific problems?  I don't know because all I could find about it's extra capabilities were general marketing claims with no details.  When I entered some straddles into form 6781, the software incorrectly calculated the total long and short term capital gains.Finally, the gift card bonus offer is a complete joke.  The directions on the turbo tax website about when you will see this option are wrong.  You are not told that you can only do this in $100 increments until the very last step.  When I finally got to the point where I could choose this option, it wouldn't let me, for a laundry list of reasons, none of which are valid.  A quick search found many people complaining about the same problem or about not getting the gift card &#34;code&#34; when it was promised.In summary, the extra you pay apparently only goes for more marketing, not a better product.
1	1397433600	This program has broken down!  It is no longer easy to change anything in Turbotax.  The program will not always change entries on forms when you go back and make a change in the interview!  It also does not get rid of unnecessary forms due to a change and does not follow changes through to state returns.
2	1397347200	After loading and running the INTUIT TurboTax Deluxe Fed Efile & State on my home PC last night, I curiously couldn't load my ATT/Yahoo homepage as I had several times earlier in the day. All I can load is Google Chrome - which I hadn't used in over a year. Oh, I can link to it - and get my mail - eventually. I cannot physically change my home page back to ATT, either. And - access through Google Chrome is via MSN - and I get an ad for 'no cost' TurboTax emblazoned on my screen. Well, I did give them 'permission' to make changes to my hard drive to load their software.That cost thing is the main reason for the low score. They advertise no cost for some of their services - and sold me a product for $50 that included the state return. When I went to e-file the state return, I was hit with a bill for $25 that had to be paid by a CC before they would file the state with a bank listed for transfer of the refund. And - if you want them 'by your side' in an audit, you have to pre-pay that 'insurance' by submitting another $45.I usually claim the standard deductions, but I had some questions re some possible deductions. They used the standard deductions. I'll go back to my tried and proven manual way next year - it has worked well for me for half a century! Now I know... be forewarned! In it's defense - it did 'work' - we'll see when the e-refunds arrive!
4	1397347200	I've been using Turbo Tax for years now, I've always been happy with the results. I pay for it once and use it to file taxes for several people in my extended family which makes it very cost effective.
5	1397347200	Using TurboTax was very positive experience for me. 2014 is the first year I've had to file taxes as a single, head of household.  It was also the first time I completed my own taxes in 29 years and the first time using a software app.  I was impressed with the volume and variety of questions in TurboTax. They were extremely thorough and showed that I qualified for deductions I would not have otherwise known about, had I filed without it. Another plus was being able to submit up to five forms because I purchased the CD software. As a result, I was also able to help my young adult son and daughter with their taxes.  I was able to complete my taxes in a few hours and submit the federal return online for free. As it cost extra to submit the state tax returns via e-file, I chose to print the returns and mail them. I'm on a budget and don't care to spend anymore than is necessary.  The error check feature is one more thing that made me feel confident when I hit the submit button. It called out one error on my form, which I was able to correct before sending.  All-in-all a very positive experience for which I'm grateful.
5	1397347200	I did all my taxes and only owed $300 to the federal government because I worked the whole year as a self contractor
5	1397347200	I have been using this software for years and it works great!The greatest thing this year is Amazon's dlivery. The first shipment comes with an empty envelope. I dropped Amazon an email and within days they shipped me another one. Very reliable and reponsible retailer.
5	1397347200	As a former Enrolled Agent.who did an average of 350 tax returns a year, this is an ideal program to do my own personal tax return.
1	1397347200	TurboTax needs to be more transparent about the extra fees for states. As a software product I purchased, paying an extra $50 to enter another state which is already a part of the software is ridiculous and then another $25 to e-file each of them is such a scam. There were additional frustrations with having to enter the non-resident state first to get the software to work properly, this is a flaw I would expect TurboTax to address instead of my having to search the message boards for the reason why the information from my federal return wasn't ported over. Finally, if I'm using the physical software I shouldn't be given the troubleshooting for the online version since for some reason they are very different.
2	1397347200	I have been doing my taxes for a long time using this program. This year, the technical writing is vague at times, and the information squares (definitions are not clear). Will not use next year.
5	1397260800	I've used Turbo Tax for years.  Prior to Turbo Tax I used MacIn Tax, but they were acquired by Turbo Tax years ago.  I strayed one year to try H&R Block, but the nest year I went back to Turbo Tax.  I will never stray again.
5	1397260800	We've been using turbo tax for 15 plus years- or as long as they have made it and it works wonderfully. Takes the hassle out of taxes- just plug in the information and go.
5	1397260800	I have used Turbo since it started. I love it. Makes filing easy. wouldn't consider any other way. highly recommend it.
4	1397260800	I did not like the program inserting 2012 information because there was no 2013 information for this current year which was done in particular 'spots'. I had to delete and insert zero in these places. I was not able to be given online help because the links and urls given to me failed. After 20 minutes of trying to be connected to a tech I gave up! I sent my tax returns and used what was prepared for me, but I don't feel confident that everything is right. I wish Intuit had not made so many changes. I was preparing my own totals and expenses just go make sure these amounts were what I was finding.
5	1397260800	Works as advertised. Cost of state e-file gone up, not a good thing. Have been using Turbo Tax for many years and no regrets.
5	1397260800	Great product at a good price.  I use turbo tax every year and I am always confident my taxes are done correctly.  Even getting a nice refund this year!
3	1397260800	There is an error in the Colorado state income tax program regarding Line 8 of the state form. The program tells you to skip entering some info about your spouse's Pension subtraction and that the program will cover it later. If you don't answer the question when it's initially asked, you can't get the correct entriy on the state form. I had to call the Colorado department of Revenus to get the correct way to fill out the Turbo Tax form to get the right answer the state wanted.
4	1397260800	Amazon had best price on software. The deluxe is easy to use and has free e filing for Fed taxes. Did not use state efiling because of cost.
5	1397260800	No problems. Works flawless as any Intuit product should. Great alternative to box stores. Great price also. My second year ordering turbo tax on line. Both experiences were good.
1	1397174400	As always I do copy my PDF files on the thumb drive. In the middle of last year I had to reinstall my W7 so 12tax file was lost but I thought since I had PDF file I am OK. Wrong, a new 13 turbo tax didn't transfer no matter what I did. Help from intuit doesn't exist. So this is my last year I am using intuit.
4	1397174400	Numbers aren't my thing. Like many people, I procrastinate until I have no choice--then I sit down to do my taxes. And every year I feel stupid for procrastinating when TurboTax makes it so easy. It walks you through the process very clearly and uses friendly, accessible language so you don't feel intimidated. It's easy to find the answer to any question you might have and for anyone whose taxes aren't terribly complicated, this is an affordable and comfortable way to submit them.The reason only 4 stars?  I think they nickel and dime you a little with the extras.
4	1397174400	I've TurboTax'ed for at least ten years.  This year's product does not disappoint.  It had all the forms I needed, including capital gains for stocks and charitable donations, real estate taxes, and state tax deductions.At first the bonus sounded like a great deal.  Convert your refund plus 10% for Amazon gift cards.  Two problems.  First, the user forum has quite a few disgruntled customers having difficulty actually getting their gift cards.  Second, (and the one that stopped me) was the lawyer-ese terms for the deal.  You basically give you entire tax form information (all they need is the refund total) to a third party, with no restrictions on it use.So ... get the nice TurboTax product but think twice about the &#34;bonus&#34;.
5	1397174400	I've used TurboTax for years.  It's a great product that navigates the user through the tax return preparation process to completion. I recommend this product to anyone interested in preparing their own income taxes.
1	1397174400	After being almost done filing jointly we thought we could try to see what would be the difference if my wife and I filed separately.  TurboTax couldn't figure out how to allocate community property or community income even though *it* told *us* all the rules.  I had to type in my own calculations for community income and then when we tried to go back to filing jointly, it kept trying to use community property, kept the old kluged income resulting in a huge tax bill, wouldn't let us go back to the original income, and forgot my spouse's name, even though it had us as filing jointly.In addition, we had a bigger tax bill this time and requested a waiver of the penalty for owing more than last year.  TurboTax kept saying we were using too many words as a reason for requesting the waiver even though Form 2210 had lots of space and we only used one line.  It wouldn't let us continue past that point.I am going to try it one more time but I'll have to start from scratch which is no fun at all.  *IF* it works at all, which I am beginning to doubt.TurboTax was fine before when we weren't doing anything out of the ordinary.We'll try one of the other packages next year.
4	1397174400	Have been using this for years.  Sometimes the menu system becomes confusing, but otherwise, each year's version is a little better.
5	1397174400	I have used Turbotax for years and have never been disappointed by its performance. However, over the years its price has steadily grown making it one of the highest priced tax software packages. On top of which requires an additional $20 plus dollars to e-file state tax, Through Amazon I was able to purchase Turbotax and e-file state tax for less than its retail price tag.
5	1397088000	I found this while shopping on Amazon.  Waited to update Photoshop and needed TurboTax Deluxe for taxes so this was a double purchase that saved money and was practical. best deal found so far.
4	1397088000	Worked great like the last 3 years my only complaint is that it should also include 1 state automated mailing like the federal automated mailing.
3	1397088000	We had to repurchase the Turbo-Tax when we did our taxes although we told them we had already bought our T-T.  Not happy about that at all,
2	1397088000	also, whena term is used, red print says see explaination elsewhere.  Why not give us a click-on to take us to that site?  Couldn't find &#34;elsewhere.&#34;Last year  was easier.
4	1397088000	So far this program has met my expectations.  I had to mail in rather than e-mail but I had the 2012 version last year and it was smooth as silk.  I have not gotten my refund yet but e-file always makes it much faster and if you can possibly go that route it is well worth it.  It is often hard to keep up with the changes in tax code and this takes care of it for you in a simple to use format.
4	1397088000	Been using for 10 years now just price has inched up but manageable, do not trust on-line low/freebie with my data!
4	1397088000	Great product, use it every year.  But this year, only 1 state form available and no option to purchase additional state forms to complete other taxes.  Recommend users have option to purchase at minimal price additional state forms thru the product purchased.  Local taxes are up to the user---whenever I've used turbo tax local form, still owe additional $ later.
4	1397088000	You cannot beat the ease of use and accuracy of this product, but I have for years thought that it is overpriced.
5	1397088000	Been a turbo tax user for years.  Best way for me to get my income taxes done.  Easy access to its deductible.  Will purchase again because of price and shipping.
5	1397001600	Been using TurboTax for years and each year it's been easy to use and a very competent product maker.  In addition ther people at Intuit make sure that it gets better and better each year.  Wish they made cars as good as these people do coding.
5	1397001600	I have used turbo tax for 8 years now and the product is easier to use now more then ever
5	1397001600	We have used Turbo Tax for several years now (since they bought out Parsons Technology) and once again it's helped us finish taxes with relative ease.  Opted for having disc shipped vs download.  We changed to iMac this year and files imported no problem.  My sense from reading the negative reviews is that some people are disappointed due to unrealistic expectations and/or a lack of attention to detail (eFile for Fed is free-state eFile is not).
5	1397001600	GREAT I WOULD RATHER DO TAXES MYSELF AND THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET FOR THAT PROCESS. LOL
3	1397001600	I've used TurboTax for years with no problems, but with all their commercials this year they were emphasizing how easy and simple it was. Maybe they were advertising a different version, but this wasn't any different than last years. At times the screen is overly busy and it's hard to figure out where you should be clicking. The &#34;guided walkthrough&#34; really doesn't seem to be all that guided either. On top of that, they're always trying to find a way to charge you more, you need a higher version because of certain stocks you hold, add more money to prepare another state, add more money to efile. It's really deceptive. That being said, the software does a good job but I wouldn't say it was the best out there, and if this version didn't automatically import previous TurboTax filings, I would probably use a different software.
5	1397001600	The product meets my needs.  I like that it searches for updates to the laws.  I've used it for at least five years now.
4	1397001600	Tax filing was quick and easy, downloading updates and the state tax software was very smooth.  The software imported my old tax information without issue, and the ADT integration for W-2 downloading was a nice bonus.Downsides are the cost (still high) and having to pay extra for the state electronic filing (just make a true &#34;all in one&#34; package already please).Will buy again next year.
4	1396915200	Most of the program is really easy to follow although there were a few new changes and Turbo Tax kept pushing going for the more expensive version.
4	1396915200	a bit difficult to use  so I gave it my best shot, mostly issue with printing certain forms rather than the whole thing
5	1396915200	That's right buffalo bob, its tax time.for those of you that remember Howdy Doody, you know that taxes can be a three ring circus.Turbo tax helps to do a quick and speedy filing.don't be like Clarabell the clown and mess it up.after all, the IRS doesn't seem to have a sense of humor. (insert government/puppet joke of your choosing)happy filing!
1	1396915200	This is the first time I write a product review, because the product is really too bad. I have spent countless hours on Form 1116 and talked to four customer support reps, the problem is still not fixed! With that, I can not file my tax return which is due in a few days.
5	1396915200	I just finished completing my taxes and filing the federal form by e-file.  This is the 4th year I have used Turbo Tax.  I find that it is very easy to use and makes filing taxes as easy as possible.  I cannot imagine doing taxes without the software.  I have used other software but find that Turbo Tax is the easiest to use.  Will continue to use.
3	1396915200	when i did my hawaii taxex the state dept. of revenue  said it was all wrong and the numbers were in the incorrect places. this happened last year. not so sure  why this happens ,but it happened last year  to ? the federal return  no problem.
2	1396915200	Everything was going fine until i tried to e-file.  The software would not let me e-file.  When researching the solution, there was an advisory from Turbo-tax of the problem and the many multiple solutions to fix.  I just paper filed my return to avoid all the hassles of attempting to correct the problems encountered.
1	1396915200	TAX PAYER DISAPPOINTEDIt's too confusing this year - it's set up to create more mistakes by the user than in previous years. This version of Turbo Tax seems like it was set up to save the government money.I had to go back through too many times compared to previous versions of Turbo Tax.As a service member I'm allowed to claim certain miles, the first time I went through it showed me the deduction but it didn't increase my refund amount.I went back through the process and a new section opened that wasn't opened the first time through.  My refund did increase.It doesn't show your Standard Deduction until the very end - I didn't like that.The education credits seemed to not be on the up and up. Watch out there.I just don't believe the little logo that guarantees you the most money back - Not in this version.
5	1396915200	I've been using this software for years now and it's been an excellent investment.  It's easy to use and efiles for free so it's well worth the price.  I have a home, loans and investments so this handles all of it with ease.
4	1396915200	I've use this for years and always get my refund back in record time !Product seems to be getting better every year. Don't need to do any manual reviews like in the past.
5	1396915200	Love it! Bee using it for 3 years now. Would recommend to everybody. It is easy to use and very affordable.
5	1396828800	I have been using TurboTax to my taxes, as well as tax returns for several family members, for several years now.  TurboTax makes it extremely easy.  When you have used TurboTax the prior year, you also don't have to re-enter all that information.  I will continue using TurboTax in the years to come.
1	1396828800	I declined &#34;Audit Defense&#34; but was signed up anyway.  The result is that Audit Defense will remove their $39.99 fee from my federal refund, without my permission.  Called Turbo Tax and they could not fix.  Turbo Tax gave me an incorrect phone number to call at Audit Defense.  I then called another number at Audit Defense and was told to call back in 2 days to request refund.  I am looking for another tax preparation method for next year.
1	1396828800	I spent a month with my financial institution and TurboTax trying to resolve problems getting data (interest, dividends, stock sales) transferred into Turbo Tax.  My financial institution worked with me even though they never solved the problem. I called Turbo Tax and was escalated to a specialist who suggested that I enter the data manually.  The refused to look into the issue further.  That was no help at all.
5	1396828800	I have used Turbo Tax for many years now and it has always &#34;done the job for me&#34;.  It is easy to follow/use and yet, so accurate and detail-oriented.
5	1396828800	I have used TurboTax for many years. In my opinion it is the easiest to use tax software on the market. The guided step-by-step process makes it easy to enter all the information quickly and correctly. I hate doing taxes but I love TurboTax.
5	1396828800	Been using TurboTax for 3 or 4 years now.Simple enough and quick.Got my Federal Return in 9 days and my State in 11 days....We all use it at work as you can do multiple returns on it....Don't know of an easier way to do taxes.....
4	1396828800	This made doing my taxes easy this year and saved me some money on a CPA.  Single guy, bought a house, got a bunch of money back.
3	1396828800	note that while the product info states the Mac download is 74 MB, the actual download is 116 MB and there is also a 5MB downloader to bootstrap the main download; this may seem insignificant, but on my particular &#34;broadband&#34; connection (&#60; 512 kbps), that may be the difference between working on my taxes tonight or not; some might say i'm reviewing the &#34;delivery&#34;, but i would say it is about gross inaccuracy of the product descriptioni also note the downloader is miscalculating the time remaining; in 22 minutes it downloaded 51 MB, yet it states time remaining varying between 3 and 5 hours
5	1396828800	I have used TurboTax for several years and am very satisfied with it and it is easy to use.  I &#34;rough out&#34; my taxes and use TurboTax to complete the preparation.
5	1396828800	Been using TurboTax for years and each year it gets more user friendly.  This is first time I E-filed my return.  However, there is a filing fee of $19.00 for the state.  Didn't know if it's a TurboTax fee or state fee.  It was less expensive to print the state return and use a 44 cent stamp.
4	1396828800	The question and answer feature does find all the info well and seems to cover all the basis for me.  Alls me to do my taxes quickly without that sinking dread that something is missing feeling.
4	1396828800	Every year it seems that filing taxes has more complicated questions to answer and/or forms to fill.  It's hard to know whether it's the IRS or TurboTax that is making some things more complicated.  At least Turbotax remembers what to send to the IRS when I EFile.  I mean I hope it does...
5	1396828800	My wife and I have been using Turbo Tax for many years now and have yet to be disappointed with the results. Many years ago we went to one of the Large tax prep companies and I could not believe what they charged us. The software gets better every year and it is simple and straight forward. I am completely satisfied with this product. And oh yeah no Audit so far.
5	1396828800	I have been using TurboTax since the early 90's.  I still use it because it is easy, guiding you through each step, and accurate.  Since it brings personal information forward from the prior year, continued use only makes it easier.You can't go wrong with this tax software.
5	1396742400	I have been using Turbo Tax for over ten years now and have been very pleased with the step by step instuctions. This year it was even better  by offerring a bonus refund with Amazon. I deffinently took advantage of that. I hope they make the same offer every year.
1	1396742400	WATCH OUT world!  TurboTax apparently needs to hide additional fees instead of being straight with consumers.  They did not get me this year, but notice that at every step during the filing process.  There's a fee for State file.  There's a fee if you use credit card.  There's a fee if you use part of your refund to pay the State filing fee.  Over and over they ask if you want Audit defense, then reverse the No Thanks with the Purchase button.  I'm done with TurboTax folks.  Hello H&R Block of something else!
1	1396742400	I got this thinking it would make filing easier.  I put in the disk, loaded up the program, and did everything you would expect to do when filing taxes.  However, after it asked me about bunch of refund options that would apply to less than 1% of the population, it said it needed to download additional files.  I was a little  upset that everything I needed wasn't already on the disk, but tried to download them.  TurboTax refused to do it and kept on crashing.  Keep in mind that I am the one everyone in my family turns to for computer problems...  After trying various troubleshooting steps, I decided to try and download it manually and install it from the turbo tax website.  Now, 2 hours later, it looks like I may finally be able to continue the process...  We'll see.
5	1396742400	I have used Turbo Tax for the past several years and find it easy to use. Once it is installed on your PC it is able to find the information from the previous year and it is less time consuming to file for this year. I just needed to make a few adjustments and was able to submit both my federal and state online without any problems. LOVE IT!
5	1396742400	I have been using Turbo Tax for more years than I can remember.  Not only is the product extremely easy to use, if you become a repeat user and have the previous-year files on the same computer that you use for the current year taxes, it will refer back to information you keyed in last year.  This not only saves time in inputting, but saves time on researching old records.  I have been using this product for years, and will continue to do so, for two reasons.  1) It's fast.  2) It's accurate.  That's what you want in a tax program!
3	1396742400	I have some mutual funds that partially invest in US bonds/notes/etc.  These dividends are not taxable by my state.  Turbo Tax fails to find this deduction and I have to override the software in order to take advantage of this deduction.
5	1396742400	You just can't go wrong with TurboTax. It's like having a tax adviser at your side. I have always done our taxes for the past 45 years, but this makes it so much easier. I buy mine early so I usually get the $10 discount so if you plan ahead, you can save not only tax prep fees but $10!
1	1396742400	I have never had a problem in the many years I have used TurboTax.  This does not run under Windows 8.1 Enterprise edition.  Intuit support website was useless.  Many related postings go unanswered for weeks.  Many semi-related postings contain links that Intuit employees have provided, but those links are broken.  POOR SUPPORT FROM INTUIT!  I want my money back.
4	1396656000	Easy enough to do but I still wish the IRS would make it easier to file.  One pages is all we should need.  I've used TurboTax for the last several years.
2	1396656000	I've used Turbo Tax for a number of years.  It used to be not so flip.  Just down to business.  Wasn't happy.  Bought H&R; Block.  They are not flip.  Just down to filling in the blanks.Besides....H&R; saved me over $100.00 on my tax due.  Paid for itself and that flip 2013 Turbo Tax!  I am not going back to Turbo.  Let the flip wise guys have it
5	1396656000	We had gone to our local H&R; Block for many years. It was crazy expensive, but we had a tax preparer there that we liked. When he passed away a few years ago, the high cost of H&R; Block just wasn't worth it.This was our first year using Turbo Tax. The program talks you through every step, and the few times we did get confused, we called their help line. The wait time was short (even though we did our taxes in early April) and the customer service was superb!We couldn't believe how quick and easy this was to use and to e-file, and at $50 (plus an extra $25 that we were more than willing to pay to e-file our state return) versus the $350 we paid last year to H&R; Block, it was WELL worth it!!
5	1396656000	We found this answered all of the questions we had last year about certain deductions. Much more straightforward and quite an improvement since last year's taxes with this same software. We have used TurboTax for years and found it's accurate and so much cheaper than an accountant.
4	1396656000	I've used turbo tax for the last 7 years, before that I paid a former irs agent to do my taxes. I saved a lot of money doing it myself.
5	1396656000	I used to grind my taxes out manually. Now I do it & file it almost thoughtlessly with Turbo Tax. You save $5 to $10 buying it on Amazon
5	1396569600	Easy and affordable..why get a CPA?  Ok, so this isn't a one size fits all product.  But, for your basic husband and wife, homeowner, have W-2 income, etc. this is a no-brainer.  I have a financial background and try to stay on top of tax changes, etc.  So, I may be one step (albeit a small step) ahead of Joe Plumber when it comes to tax preparation.  But, I'm sure the tutorials (never used them) can walk almost anyone through the process.Would recommend this product to folks with basic tax profiles (again, married/single, W-2 income, etc.).
4	1396569600	I love TurboTax and purchase it from Amazon every year to file my taxes.  However, in the past years this software came with one free electronic filing of a state return and $19.99 for an additional state e-filed return.  It now costs $24.99 for each state return you file electronically.  I thought the idea was to encourage people to file electronically.  Since I have two state returns to file for our household, I am not about to electronically file the state returns.  I am not sure if these fees go to TurboTax or the state you are filing in but it's absurd.
5	1396569600	I always use Turbo Tax. I would commend it over paying someone to do your taxes for you especially good if you don't have a lot of complicated deductions or a complex return.
4	1396569600	very easy to use tax software...I have been using this for years and it auto copies my data over so no more stress
4	1396569600	I wish turbo tax allowed multiple states to be done.I wish I could share files more easily between the desk top and notebook computers.
4	1396569600	As with most, I hate doing taxes. But if you have to do them, TurboTax makes it much easier. I still don't understand why we have to pay for a program to do our taxes and the IRS can't just put a program like this up for free to allow us to file online.
1	1396569600	This was a waste of money. I couldn't get any response to my emails about a question I had. In their advertisement saying free help, it is not true. I had used Turbo Tax for the past 2 years. My taxes are very similar every year. Except this year I couldn't enter my tax exempt income as I had in the past. I had to file it and leave it off. Since there was no way to include it. It kept being put into the taxable income box 8 A, instead of the tax exempt income 8 B. I had to go to all the trouble of filing an amended tax form to the IRS. Now I have to be stressed out that I didn't do this correctly.  The local IRS office suggested I go to H & R Block to file the amended. Why should I have to pay for this, when I wasted $50. on Turbo Tax.I am completely disappointed in Turbo Tax, and will need to file my taxes a different way next year.
5	1396569600	It is hard to imagine how simple taxes preparation can be with this product..Can' do with out it GD.
5	1396569600	It's so easy to use I don't know why anyone would pay a tax preparer unless they had a VERY complicated return.  Have been using it for several years with no problems whatsoever.
4	1396569600	I was very nervous doing my taxes for the first time. This is a very simple tool and I feel super confident after completing. I would recommend this to a friend.
4	1396483200	Hubby is doing income tax...a few things don't make sense (missing lines)..but he will work it out!  First time using Turbo Tax(present from me)
5	1396483200	I would not touch a tax return were it not for TurboTax!  It walks me through every phase, enters everything properly, instructs me clearly, and saves my sanity for April!  Highly recommended!
5	1396483200	Easy to use.  I have used  this product for several years.  Data that remains the same each year is transfer from previous year tax return.  Instructions are clear and when you finish, it does an automatic check for errors.  By filing on line results in getting refunds quickly.
3	1396483200	Every time you start the application they prompt you for your personal information. This information, they say, is to ensure you receive updates. However, you will receive updates without giving Intuit your personal information.All the IRS forms are within every version of TurboTax. However, they restrict the prompts and try to upsell you, making it more difficult to complete your return without purchasing an upgrade.
5	1396483200	Turbo Tax is a life saver when it comes to doing your own taxes.  The step by step instructions make it very simple.  No reason to pay to have taxes done.
5	1396483200	Every year used TT for many years. Does the job and a few dollars more but with downloads from last year, the upgrades in functionality every year, accuracy, thoroughness and ease of use - hate paying any money for tax preparation but TT is great.
5	1396483200	Have used Turbo Tax for a number of years. I am very pleased with it, it is an easy program to use.
3	1396396800	We've always had good luck with TurboTax in the past, but this year's edition was a massive pain - installation required a download from the Intuit help site, and multiple issues with the state process resulted in having to prepare that return separately (as per the staff answer on the forums!)  Still streamlined the process, but it may not be an automatic purchase for next year...
4	1396396800	I've used Turbo Tax for several years (12+) and it seems to get better and better each year.  This year's version was the most user friendly version thus far.  I needed it for retirement income,Social Security, IRAs.  It handled all very well.  I particularly liked the electronic filing feature for both Fed. & State returns, easy to use with quick feedback. One recommendation: upgrade this version for next year, but keep with the same format or a very similar one as we old dogs don't adapt easily to grand changes.
5	1396396800	It came very quickly.  I have used TurboTax for 10 years now and have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend it for ease of use.
5	1396396800	Wish I went this route before!  This was my first year using this helpful product.  Next year will be even easier as it will remember all the info and import it from my personal info and two kids in college.  Was simple and efficient.
5	1396396800	As always this product is reliable and accurate and easy to work with. I have used this product for years.
5	1396396800	Walks you through the tax code step by step!  Easy to use and no worries about missing anything, Great program.
5	1396396800	....Turbo Tax is the way to go.  The software, at least for me, gets better and easier every year.  Although I would recommend upgrading to a higher version if you have had multiple and complicated financial transactions.
4	1396396800	I use Turbo Tax every year and Amazon always the best price.  The 2013 edition offered a bonus (1) free state efile but when I completed my return it asked for $19.99 to efile my state tax.  I paid to complete the process and then contacted Turbo Tax.  They apologized for the inconvenience and refunded my charges but never did admit a problem with the software program.  I hope this issue is addressed as I have recommended this product offer through Amazon to many of my friends.
1	1396396800	TueboTax was a dud.  While I could open it, I could not enter any information.  I had to pay for another copy from Intuit to be able to complete my taxes for 2013!
5	1396396800	A great product for doing your own taxes and getting them done without a hassle. Like the fact that the program looks at your previous year to gather information so that you don't have to do it again. Easy to follow instructions and guidelines.
5	1396396800	Use this, it'll make you as rich as possible, the step-by-step format is wonderfully easy to use as well. This is forever the only way i'm doing my taxes.
5	1396396800	Great software.Easy to use and very comprehensive.It found things I did not even think to ask about or know they were eligible deductions.
5	1396396800	I have used turbo tax for years.  It's so easy and Amazon is where I purchase the software.  I prefer to keep the software as opposed to downloading it in case I ever need to reload on another computer.
5	1396310400	I have used turbo tax now for five years. I have had to pay for two years in a row but this year I am getting back now. Itwas not the problem, this made too much money.
5	1396310400	Using TT for many years.  Each year it gets better.  I would not want to do some of the calculations that TT does with the push of a button.  BEST thing is is you forget one item, and you think you are done, all is not lost.  Acouple of clicks al all calculations are revised to suit the new data.  TT is a pleassure to use.
5	1396310400	Have used this software for many years.  Easy to follow.  Puts information on correct forms.  Would recommend Turbo Tax to all.
4	1396310400	TurboTax has proven to be a good program, and you offered it at a great price. Thanks once again Amazon.
5	1396310400	Very easy to use quick and efficient. Have been using it for many years and it lets you transfer information from one year to the next.
3	1396310400	This version of turbo tax was hard to understand in the investment section.Review of the questions others had submitted solved my problems.This was the not the best version of turbo tax I have used.Suggesting that it was required to EFILE Federal and State at thesame time was not true.
5	1396310400	Have been using Turbo Tax since 1994.  All versions performed well and accurately.  This version is the same.  Some report problems getting the free state, but I had not problem in this area.  Updates were timely and accurate.  Thanks again Intuit,
5	1396224000	TurboTax works very well and I have used it for about 12 years now.  It has a Step-by-step too help you get your Tax Returns completed without missing anything by mistake.  I like the way it prompts for information and lets you stop and Save your progress at any time.  it also has many links to get answers if you don't understand a subject or question very well.  It does take a long time to complete your Returns if you use the Question and answer process but also gives you the option to skip many or most of the questions if you are comfortable just filling in individual sections.  Shows a Refund Status through every step and the does the Efile for your Federal and STATE returns at NO EXTRA COST for most States.Overall, a very great way to do your Taxes without having to use an Expensive Tax Preparation business.  I have never had any serious problems using it.  I like the Audits that it does to make sure you have No Mistakes or Omissions.  It also checks to see the likely hood of triggering an IRS Audit compared to others and certain aspects of your returns.  The only thing I don't like is that it takes me a long time to complete everything and some questions are a little too vague for a novice.  Also, I have to research the Linked answers to try and understand some subjects better before answering the questions.  Not a real problem, but delays me.  I like that it picks the Best type of return for you and lets you experiment by changing answers to see the effects on bottom line.  It gives you useful suggestions and good Instructions and guidance.  I like it and it is always Accurate and helpful.
4	1396224000	It leads you simply step by step to compute taxes.  It is helpful if you have a little bit of knowledge when it come to figuring out you capital gains and stock dividends. It has help but you can become confused if your not familiar with the terminology.  If you don't have to deal with stocks it as good as going to an accountant who will charge you 200 to 300 dollars to do the same thing.  You can sent the Federal form by email but to send the state it will cost $19.00.  However turbo tax will print out your state form so you can mail it for $2.00 using the postal service.  I've used this product for several years so I have had a good chance to find it's faults and it has few.. worth the price!
4	1396224000	I would love it if it were not for sleazy offers of discount cards for tying up your refund in other banks so they earn interest and get your info. Otherwise a stable and easy to use product only slightly overpriced.
5	1396224000	Can count on Turbo Tax each year to do it's thing.  Will keep purchasing each year to meet the tax needs
2	1396224000	I have been using TurboTax for several years, but I think that I'm done with it.  Here's why.  My taxes are fairly straightforward.  Using TurboTax saves me two or three hours.  I called Intuit with questions on this year's form and especially on my 2014 1040ES (I can't figure out what numbers TT is using), and all their answers begin with &#34;Look at your forms.&#34;  Well, if I'm going to study the IRS forms to see what TurboTax is doing, why do I need TurboTax to begin with?I want to add a note about Intuit's abysmal phone support.  I was cut off in the middle of talking with an agent after a 15-minute wait on hold.  She sent an e-mail explaining how sorry she was, but she did not attempt to call me back although she had my phone number.  I then spent 35 minutes on hold waiting for another agent and gave up.  Then I downloaded the instructions and forms from the IRS, filled them out, printed them, and sent them in.  Bye, TurboTax.
4	1396224000	Though a long time user of Intuit  products, I am routinely very happy with the quality of the products, and equally irritated by the pricing they feel entitled to.
4	1396224000	Easy to work with & fast.  Electronic filing allows for quick refunds & direct deposit. The overall process is very thorough.
4	1396224000	It's scary that Turbo Tax updates still coming after March 19.The rest is fine.Except that one should pay additional $25 for State e-filing
1	1396224000	I will be returning this.  I've gotten free tax prep in recent years, and although I wasn't always sure I got my full refund, at least I paid zero for processing.  This year, I didn't have the same opportunity so I decided to try out TurboTax.  I'm going to H&R; Block tomorrow and pissed that I need to pay $400-500 for something that should be easy enough to do myself.  This was an exercise in frustration and disappointment.Con's:-- Can't use the Windows clipboard to copy text into the program.  Forget ease of use if you have a complex Intuit/TurboTax/DeductIt password or a W-2 "Import Code"... there's no copying and pasting permitted into TurboTax security fields.  Really dumb limitation.-- If you have to fill out multiple states and if you need to file married jointly in one state and married separately in another state, this program does not handle that situation.  You have to create a whole other return messing up your original data entry... basically it's really frustrating, and annoying.  Forget if you have to change something, then you need to recreate two tax returns.  Waste of time.  For as many years as this product has been on the market, Intuit should have figured out all the possible scenarios.  I only figured this limitation out after I had purchased the upgrade to a second state return, too.  I better get all my money back.-- Tests your (and thus your wife's) patience.-- I don't like the workflow of this software.  Ask a bunch of questions, many of which are confusing, then you get sent to a big list of items that give little information.-- There is not enough built-in help to explain questions.  I just get encouraged to upgrade for more help... but you really won't get that help if you do upgrade.-- No apparent way to flag items that you want to revisit later.  I don't have all the answers or data when I get to questions the first time.-- Not enough information that lets me know how I could have gotten a bigger refund.  This would help me in future years returns.Pro's:-- If you have a SIMPLE life tax scenario, then this may not be bad.Other Thoughts:--  I can't stand Intuit.  All their products are half baked, confusing for anything but the most basic scenarios.  Customer service is unresponsive and they don't fix stuff.
4	1396137600	A good tax program, but needs to be non legal and non accountant in its explanation of different deductions or income sections.
5	1396137600	Helpful as always for getting my taxes done quickly and easily!  Thanks, Turbotax for making tax season pretty stress free!
5	1396137600	Use it every year and amazon had the best price for the Turbo Tax and Quicken.  Our taxes are very straight forward and this software works great for us.  We also use Quicken to track investment so I get the combo pack for the combo price!  Highly recommend for the DIY'r, especially someone just beginning to do their own taxes and tracking their investments!  A good learning tool!
5	1396137600	I have used Turbo Tax for the last four years and have had no problems. I do not like the fact that they charge an extra $19.99 to E-file your state tax form, they should be more up front and include it in the price. This year they offered 10% more on your tax return if you bought Amazon gift cards. I did this and it worked out great! It was like getting Turbo tax and all sales taxes on all my purchases from Amazon for free!
5	1396137600	I use TurboTax every year. Usually I buy it at Costco.  This year I bought from Amazon instead (it came out a few pennies more than Costco) because if the refund bonus.  The way it works is that my refund will go to an intermediate bank which will send me an Amazon card for the amount I specified (plus 10%!) then forward the balance to the bank account I specified.  Where else can you get a 10% return on your money these days?
4	1396137600	I had used turbo tax many years ago and was surprised at how much it has improved.  I was anticipating having to answer many more questions than I actually had to.  I was kind of disappointed though, as questions I asked were never answered.  Maybe I did it wrong?  Anyway, the last test is that I actually get my promised refunds.  I would recommend the product to anyone who is adept at using a computer.
1	1396137600	I've been a user for many years. This year was bad. There  was over a month delay before I could file. They first blamed the government for the form delay. I checked the IRS site and the form was In fact ready. Then the blamed the instructions not being ready. The fact is the form was ready and the Regulations were final.I will probably switch next year. I'm a CPA. I don't do taxes Proffessonally now is why I use TT.Because TT didn't get its act together, next year I will use Tax Act.
1	1396137600	First, if you have filed online at turbotax.com in previous years, then DON'T even think about purchasing this product since you can not transfer information between online and desktop (PC) platforms. Secondly, the Amazon gift certificate program was a complete scam. My federal refund was over $300, so you would think that I could get $300 in gift certificates, right? Wrong! It said "the maximum amount of your federal refund that you can apply to Amazon gift cards is $100. So a benefit of only $10, which doesn't come close to offsetting the money that I spent on this piece of crap software which isn't any better than the online version anyways. To make matters worse, if you file from the PC desktop version of Turbotax, the fee for filing a state return is $24.99, whereas it is only $17.99 for the same service from within the online Turbotax.com platform. Never, ever again will I purchase Turbotax software on a disk. Stick to the online version and don't be tempted by these Amazon gift card perks...
3	1396137600	Helpful if your return is not very complicated.  Helps eliminate math errors?  Anything out of the ordinary requires you purchase Upgrade.
4	1396137600	I use this every year and like it.  What is this refund bonus offer?  I don't know anything about it.  Enlighten me.
4	1396137600	This was my 19th year of using TurboTax. Over the years, as you might expect, it has steadily improved. It covers all of the usual tax situations well, but does need a little improvement in some of the unusual situations such as natural gas royalties. Some manual entry is required in this area. But overall, I love using the product, and I'm sure I will continue using it.
5	1396137600	I use this program every year to do my families taxes and it always meets all of my needs. I recommend this program highly
5	1396137600	Have used this software for many, many years and it continues to be the best. Saves time year to year.
5	1396137600	This is a great way to do taxes.  It is very informative and super easy to use. I have recommend it to others.
5	1396137600	I have been doing my taxes with TurboTax for several years.  TurboTax has performed without fail every time I have used it.  I expect this year to be the same.I buy it because it has worked in the past, I am familiar with the software, it is reasonably priced, and it does the job.  It is not like I'm going to buy other tax return software and do a comparison.  I am trying to SAVE money, not buy several tax return applications to see what works best.  So rating something I have been using for years is difficult, particularly for the latest release.  If the installation had failed I would have done what anyone else would have done and exchanged it for another copy.  No big deal.
5	1396137600	Turbo Tax came through again. We got a big refund quickly. It's new user friendly interface made it a breeze.
3	1396051200	It does the job (mostly), but every year it's missing something, so I have to go to their forums and try to get an answer. This usually works out, but is time consuming. Thus three stars, as it's always lacking something for me.
5	1396051200	This is an excellent way to do taxes.  Several years we took our taxes for a tax person to do and also used Turbo Tax to compare We caught mistakes they made both years because of Turbo Tax.  After that we just did our own using Turbo Tax.
2	1396051200	I have used this for years two parts I paid a CPA last fall to review my last three years I used turbo tax and I had missed about 3k over three years, this year. GA. Was not sending me my money when we fixed it the state said you used Turbo tax? Yes I said she said I needed to pay 1500.00 more as a box was not suptracting it added. Long story the state even knows about the error. Cost my hours of time working with the state, not happy
2	1396051200	I ordered a CD version of this product.  Did not open CD case until almost 1 month later when I really needed to do taxes.  After cutting thru security seal, much to my surprise there was no CD in the case!.  Never had anything like this happen before.  How does this occur?  Sending empty case back to Amazon and going to Sam's to buy a disc as I cannot wait for replacement product.  Not a pleasant surprise!!
2	1396051200	It did not import my 2012 returns data needed for my 2013 tax return (capital loss carry-overs),was less user friendly and no better than other other tax programs. I was very disappointed.
5	1396051200	We have purchased Turbo Tax  to prepare our taxes for about 15 years. It is easy to install and walks you through the tax preparations and won't allow you to make mistakes ..
5	1396051200	Always easy, each year gets even easier to use. Always a pleasure to use. Will buy again for years to come.
5	1396051200	I have been using TurboTax for years.  The step-by-step guide is great.  It makes it so easy to do my taxes and to file electronically.
1	1396051200	too much marketing, keeps complaining the certificate of the turboxax  server is invalid.  Waited on the phone for 40 minutes and nobody answered. Online chat is not responsive. It took the other side 5 minutes to respond to your question. you have to pay extra $25 for the state e-filing. use taxact, it only costs $10.
3	1396051200	Doesn't tell you that you have to pay extra to efile for the state.  Box says includes federal and one state.
3	1396051200	I am a longtime user of TurboTax.  The Federal module is very good.  The state modules leave a lot to be desired.  I have to file two states (live in one, work in another) and this year I moved into the state where I work so I had to file three returns to cover the resident and non-resident requirements.  What is disappointing about the state returns compare to the Federal, is that TT in the state returns just asks you for the information requested for each line of the form without any helpful guidance.  I'm making this one up, but, for example, it doesn't help me much for TT to list a series of tax situations like &#34;Certain NY state extra tax credits&#34; then just ask if this applies to me (Yes / No).  I always have to do a lot of side research to use the state forms.  Also, this year, TT refused to e-file one of my state returns, citing tax rules of that state.  I checked the state website and found the TT was wrong, but I had to file-by-mail anyway.  I tried to use TT help to get an answer to this but never got a response from Quicken.Bottom line:  Use it for federal, skip it for state.
1	1396051200	I've used Turbotax for years because moving information from one year to the next is easy.  But -- sorry for the low vocab -- it sucks!After having to update my OS just to run the thing (OS 10.5.8 won't run it), all seemed well until I downloaded the state software.  It crashed upon opening every time.  A quick support search shows this is a known problem.  I have tried all the &#34;fixits&#34; including reinstalling, and it still crashes.GRRRRRRRRRRR!  Really, Intuit, we deserve better after years of loyalty.
2	1396051200	I keep using turbo tax because it's easy to carryover tax losses etc. But this year's was particularly frustrating. Simple things like making it unnecessarily confusing to download the W-2. ( you have to add soc sec no and income from your w-2 before it downloads- they could have made that clearer). Really annoying things like insisting that I have a farm when I don't and making no easy way to avoid that. Dumb things like not letting me skip itemizing deductions which is way more trouble than it is worth. And the big screw up with filing for tax credit  on foreign taxes . It gets hung up on foreign income for  sched K-1 when there is no income. and as soon as I go into that step it increases my taxes by ~400-500 dollars. When you go back it won't go back to the older value ( this is really strange).  I went all the way back to the start and it wiped out all the downloads I'd done and I had to start over. ( evidently hitting ctrl-s does not save files here anymore) I am still not convinced that turbo knows how to properly handle Sched K-1's when there are multiple entries for  boxes 13, 16 and 20. This seems to mess up the foreign tax credit section. (Still researching how to work around this but I think it going to cost me about $400 in tax credits.) Bug? Probably not,  Just  not clear how to get where one needs to go. Still have two weeks to dig through this till it makes sense. But I cannot figure out how actually gong through the foreign tax credit section increases  my taxes. All in all a frustrating tax experience. Are the other tax programs better? Maybe I'll test that out next year.
4	1396051200	Not too bad of a program-it still has some areas where it is &#34;weak&#34; especially on the state return.  Not sure why they can't take the correct data from the information entered and complete the state form for me.
3	1396051200	I have used this product since 1996. I like it because it remembers my information from year to year, like depreciation, losses, IRAs, investment accounts, Schedule C, auto & other expenses, etc. Data entry can be very annoying. It is always trying to sell you a better version. That means it's also stupid on top of annoying! If I wanted a better one, I would have bought that.There are also inefficiencies like: to jump back into a section, like "Income" or "Deductions" you have to revisit a bunch of questions you already answered in that section. You should be able to "drill down" to where you want to continue.I continue to use it because there's nothing that adequately competes with it on the market. It gets the job done. It's reasonably priced; although, I always try to buy this program on sale. I also know that it's only a limited amount of time that I have to devote to using it.The great thing about this year's software is that there were no hidden fees. I paid for the Fed & State and got them. The eFile for Federal was free! It can also be used for several returns. Money talks!
5	1396051200	Very good tax program.  I've been using Turbotax for many years.  I like the ease of doing my own taxes in the comfort of my home, whenever I feel like it!!!
5	1396051200	TurboTax always helped well to make my taxes accurately and easily.This is very good product and I highly recommend it.
1	1396051200	$49.95 for Federal and State returns does not state ONE state return.  So, first, the &#34;Amazon and TurboTax&#34; description is misleading.  Second, $49.95 for a second State return, and $49.95 for each added State means this package could cost me $149.85 to finish my taxes.The offer of sale needs to be fixed.  The pricing is extortion, as you only are told after you have filled out all your tax information in the Federal form, even though you are asked how many up front.  Deliberate?Rip-off.
5	1395964800	I've  been using turbo tax ever since I had to pay taxes. Makes everything easier and quick. Only wish I didn't have to pay extra for efiling for the state since I often forget to print it out and mail it in.
5	1395964800	This is my second year using Turbo Tax and I am still impressed, very easy to use.  I actually owed money to my state & Turbo Tax walked me through this process step by step.  I did not E-File my state and I knew what forms to print and where to mail them.It does take time to use Turbo Tax, you are asked simple questions and you answer each question accordingly.  During these questions it also let's you know what your estimated tax refund is.  Would recommend this product.My disclaimer to my review is I have never been audited using Turbo Tax.  I don't purchase any special protection in the event I am audited but their is an audit risk assessment which shows I am an extremely low audit risk.  Hopefully this is true and I won't be audited in the future!
4	1395964800	I filed my taxes by myself for the very first time.  I thought that this product made it possible to do it.
1	1395964800	I did not realize that this product would come under Kindle items.  I wanted the product, not a download.Thanks
1	1395964800	Before reading my experience set forth below, please note that I received a refund of the amount paid from Intuit.1) bought Turbotax Deluxe on a disk through Amazon; 2)  installed it and began my Federal tax preparation; 3) it was going slow and taking long to go to varsious menus; 4) entered personal data, etc.  4)  after almost a hour later my computer crashed and got a blue screen; 5)  somehow got it running again and went back to TT; 6) same thing happened 2 times; other apps were running ok.7) blue screen scared me enough to buy, install and run Advanced Systemcare Ultimate 7; 8) ASC 7 cleaned and indicated "Red Cliff" and a couple of other virus were removed; 9) then tried to run TT again; 10) no blue screen or crash, but TT ran slowly like turtle instead of turbo.11) without more, bought H&R; block and almost finished the returns; 12) contacted support and spoke to a TT rep in Chennai - Mr. Chetan Nambiar (Madras, India); said I can get a refund since I bought it from Amazon and sent a link; 13) used the link and requested a refund by email; 14) next day got an unsigned email from Intuit/Turbotax with the subject line stating "Case Closed".15) I have preserved the disk as evidence.  Perhaps mine is an isolated case.
5	1395964800	TurboTax Deluxe is the best tax software out there. It is easy to use, most through and reliable. Price is also reasonable.
5	1395964800	Turbo Tax came extremely fast! I always use Turbo Tax because it is so incredibly easy!! I will continure to use Turbo Tax every year and more than likely I will purchase from Amazon!
5	1395964800	I've used turbotax for years, and had very good luck with it. Being related to taxes, I can't say it is headache free, but I have been able to resolve all my questions with minimal searching.
1	1395964800	Bought it assuming I would save some cash by not taking my taxes to a professional. So yea I saved $100 doing it myself. But when it was all said and done I took my W2s to a professional just for comparison purposes and he got me almost a grand more than what Turbo tax calculated. And he's 100% legit. Good ol fashioned know how can never replace software.
1	1395878400	I was grossly overcharged, amazon, 39.00, extra state 47 dollars, 49 dollars for I don't know what, 44 more dollars for again I don't know what and finally 30 dollars for a routing fee. you got me this time but never again
5	1395878400	For 12 years we have used Turbo Tax for State and Federal taxes and it has found deductions and guided us to areas of the tax code we did not know even existed.  I would spend the $49.00 every year for this service and it comes with a 100% accuracy guarantee for their math and calculations.
5	1395878400	Highly recommend turbo tax for the do it yourself type of person.  Purchase turbo tax each year and will continue to.
4	1395878400	Fast shipping.  Let's face it... this is something we must buy every year to do our taxes.  We try to find the best price... and this year it was Amazon.
4	1395878400	Have used this product for many years.  Have seen how it has evolved for the better.  However, this edition seems a bit stilted and less friendly.  Probably just me.
5	1395878400	As in the past -- I have used turbotax for quite a while -- the software greatly simplified my tax filing this year. Its handling of my state tax filings yielded much larger refunds than I had expected.
4	1395878400	I am still in the process of completing my return,but ease of used and available resource info. is very good in the turbo tax.
5	1395878400	Very Professional...Makes me look like a Tax Expert...Asks question to make sure all areas are covered...Even the Paid Tax Preparers probably use a variation of this,.Hard to estimate the time saved, but be assured it is a lot....Just have your records organized before you start...Also, the feature that downloads financial data really works smoothly...don't be afraid to use this..
4	1395878400	Pretty easy to use. Some forms, particularly K-1's are not easy to review.  In order to proof these entries to  have to re-enter the dataand not leave the page without double checking the entries.
5	1395878400	Purchased several versions of turbo tax.  Great product and tax tool.  Very user friendly and great online help and resources.
5	1395878400	Loaded more efficiently than ever and found old return user data and 2013 upgrades right off the bat.  Streamlined and efficient.
5	1395878400	Been using it for years.  Easy to use with the question & answer format. Best in class in my option.
5	1395878400	Its a great program. I have used Turbo tax for years . It does everything I need in a Tax program.
5	1395878400	My wife has been doing our taxes with this program for 8 years, she had our taxes done in 35 mins
5	1395878400	I've used TurboTax to file my taxes since 2000 and have never had a problem or issue.  The software works well for me and makes the process much more straightforward.  I particularly appreciate the close integration with other Intuit applications that I use.
5	1395878400	Very good product. I use same a lot and recommend same to a lot of people. had a lot of good tips.
5	1395878400	Great way to maximize your refund without spending a bunch of money or having to go back to school for your CPA. It walks you through step by step just don't be surprised you have to pay a bit more to file your state electronically even if you buy the one that includes state.
3	1395878400	It was a bit too pricey,we could have got it cheaper elsewhere! Ca.didn't approve my taxes, so I'd say it wasn't as good as they make it up to be! I had to pay for e file to the State also!
4	1395792000	It's a little &#34;light&#34; on instructions such as how to stop, save, and continue at a later time but, it worked just fine.  Very thorough.
5	1395792000	i had never done taxes before, because i've never had taxes.  i was lucky in that it was pretty easy for me because i didn't have a lot of great expenses or anything like that.  i just worked at a simple job for most of the year and that made it a lot easier for me to just use turbo tax and only pay 50 dollars for it and i do regret not changing more of my tax return into an amazon giftcard because it was great.
4	1395792000	I am an annual Turbo Tax user and I always find the software very easy to use and I have no issues doing my taxes.The software is easy to install and the step by step instructions are great.  I have been pleased with this product and will use it again in the future!
4	1395792000	This TurboTax Deluxe edition for Tax Year 2013 offers the Federal and one state tax return, along with free Federal e-file. For a small fee, it will also e-file the state return. TurboTax seems to get a little easier to use each year, although there is definitely a learning curve with the program. You can upload or download the basics and updates; the questions are designed to walk you through your taxes in hours instead of days. Provided your taxes aren't especially complicated, this might be the way to get them done. Recommended.
4	1395792000	amazons price last year was cheaper than retail.  this year it was the same as retail.  I will definitely shop around next year.
3	1395792000	There were some glitches this year, like not being able to return to the original &#34;transfer from previous returns&#34; screen once you left it... ever.
1	1395792000	Program was not working, even after I uninstalled it and re-installed. It charged me for e-filing but the paperwork never was filed... Took me a whole week to get them to send me a link to download the software again -for free- but it charged me again for e-filing! Now I need to call and see if they will refund that money... I worry it will take even longer to straighten that out.
5	1395792000	I have been using Turbo Tax for several years now and it never dissapoints.  It is easy to use and a good buy as well.  I love that it even tells you what your risk is of being audited.  This is a must if you are going to do your own taxes!
4	1395792000	Never had an tax problem issue with this software and have been using it for years.  Not sure I would use it if I had a very complicated tax situation but it's easy as can be for basic taxes and you get your refund within days or a couple weeks at most depending on the IRS and State.  My only issue with this software is the way it handles State taxes.  Even if you buy the version that covers both Fed and State and promises E-file, you will still get socked for 20 bucks to E-file your state taxes.  And if you don't supply a credit card to charge it to at the time you try to E-file your taxes, they charge even more (I think it's 30 bucks) to take it out of your refund.So overall if you prefer to have your taxes done at home and feel pretty confident doing them yourself, go for it. But understand unless you want to print and send your State taxes in, the price you paid upfront for the software is going to increase by at least 20 bucks if you e-file both Fed and State.
5	1395705600	turbotax makes filling your income taxes very easy - they are improving this program every year to make it better and easier to understand.  going from your 1040 page to a specific area was a bit confusing to do in the beginning but gets easier as you use it.
2	1395705600	I have used TurboTax for six years, with no major problems.  This year, for some reason, it would not download on my Windows XP system.  I spent several hours on the phone with Turbo Tax, and finally was able to download directly from the WEB.  In the interim, I purchased a new desktop with Windows 7, and the TurboTax CD works just fine.
1	1395705600	Got the DeLuxe to get the state, but was never able to file due to some ridiculous rule about a &#34;maximum of 4 items in Box 12&#34; - I had 5 items.  Really?  Tell me that up front then, and I won't buy it.  Spent hours on their help sites, on the phone, downloaded updates constantly, before someone finally figured out the problem.  This was after I e-filed it (paid $19.99 for this).  Once it was &#34;rejected&#34; I had to call again (finding a number to call is a project in itself) so I could get a refund for the filing fee.  That is it - after 10+ years I am taking another route next year.  Ended up filing by mail, so now I have to wait 6-8 weeks for my refund - what a disappointment :(
4	1395705600	Been using this for years, always had good luck, this year a weirdness occurred for Iowa tele-commute home-office in that the depreciation came up wrong (negative number) so had to wait on the fix for that.That said, they Did fix it, reported to my email when the fix was available and I was able to print and mail my return in good time.SHURE wish they could get over this money-for-state-efile SHi..tuff.. oh well.. 10 bux I'd mutter, but I would do it, 20-30 bux? pass.But thank you to all that do spend that money for state efile, I'm sure you're holding my annual software cost down to the $40 Plus 10% refund bonus that I paid. Hope the company handling the bonus doesn't sell my name to too many shady characters cuz the 10% Amazon bonus Money was Very nice (and half spent, lol).
2	1395705600	Have used Turbo Tax the last 4 years, And they changed something cause I had a hard time using it this year, Found they refused cause of an error I made, reran a couple of times and they would not tell me what the error was, When I finally figured I had entered $130 dollars in the wrong place, It would not let me remove the $130 dollars and would not let delete it either. AFTER 4.5 hours on the phone with a TurboTax person she had the help of another supervisor to go about a very weird way of removing the mistake, So my deduction is they have a BIG flaw in their software, If I had known it would have taken that long I could have redone the whole form in less time.
4	1395705600	My son has used this program in the past. Was I ever glad he was available! Most of the problems were identifying the categories of the received 1099's..Some of the issuing companies seem to use a different instruction book than the IRS. However, he tax refunds were promptly received, I saved $200.00 of the $300.00 annual tax preparation costs and next year will be much easier because TurboTax retains much of the input information.for use the following year.turbo
5	1395705600	I use TurboTax every year and the 10% extra for the Amazon gift card was a deal too good to pass up.
4	1395705600	It does what it says.  The unfortunate problems is that the IRS has become so complicated that doing one's own taxes on line may become a myth.
5	1395705600	I have been using TurboTax for several years now and it makes taxes easier to do.  I have never tried the others.
5	1395705600	I was nervous, but they made this very user friendly! I got back virtually the same as last year, without the CPA fees!
1	1395619200	I have been a very satisfied repeat user of TT since TurboTax 2007. Unfortunately, this year's version (TT2013, which has the same problems as TT2012), took me an extra hour for my State taxes (which I had to re-do), and it almost caused me to lose part of my state refund. ================ ATTENTION USERS: Watch out for the "automatic" state option. Just because your residence state pops up and you have no other states to add does NOT mean that TT is going to calculate everything for you. You have to hit the EDIT YOUR STATE button in order to get TT to guide you thorough how to pay all of your state taxes AND get all of the applicable state Tax Credits for each state, EVEN IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE STATE !!! ================== HELLO INTUIT: I emailed your corporate website 14 MONTHS AGO and did not receive a reply or see any action taken to correct this problem. My email mentioned a good faith offer that if you fixed it right away I would not make my feedback public. Bad strategy to ignore a helpful customer who gives you important and valuable feedback!!! So, now that this feedback is here at Amazon, at the exact time when last-minute tax preparers would be buying from Amazon for immediate download and use, this will hopefully get your attention by sending some of your Amazon customers into the arms of your competitor, H&R Block's TaxCut. ========= Here's the issue... your programmers made a mistake when they tried to 'clean up' the screens. They should have left this very important button labeled as it was in TT2011, something like "Calculate Your State Taxes." Instead they changed it to a totally meaningless button label "Edit State" which exists on the same screen with "Add Another State." Any reasonably intelligent user would interpret this as "If I don't have another state to add, and the one next to the Edit button is already the correct state, then I should hit the Continue button."  Unfortunately, this year's program, like last year's, is not as smart as the average user. Please fix this, and put out an immediate update, if you want me to consider editing this review.
4	1395619200	First, let me state that the stars are for the product *once you can get it to install.* I ended up having to run some fixes and then download it from the TurboTax website before I could install.  (At least they didn't charge me extra!)  If you're supporting WinXP, TurboTax, darn it, actually support that operating system.  Thankfully someone put out a &#34;fix&#34; on the TurboTax website blogs that worked.Installation issues aside, though, I'd absolutely recommend TurboTax to anyone.  We've been using it since 2002 (for tax year 2001) when we had to do all the weird accounting that comes with a new home purchase. This year we moved and the software walked us through everything correctly. My only complaint this year is that they don't exactly make the text real big for those numbers you don't always get additional mailings for and will need to hunt down on the HUD-1 - and they probably could use to make it a little more obvious.In all these years we've never felt a need to change tax service software, so if you're running late on getting your taxes done (and maybe you also don't want to be running Windows XP), just get it.
1	1395619200	The basics were good, but when I wanted to go back in and change information in investment income, from one rental house, it would not let me back in.  Had to close and reopen, and that worked one time, then after that, it would not let me change any information on that investment.  I had to delete the forms from &#34;Forms&#34; and start over, and not really sure it was correct as far as depreciation, etc.  Could have paid much more $$ for the Investment Deluxe, but when I only had one rental investment, that did not seem like it was cost effective.  Also could not correct the information on a home we sold - I had left out the closing costs, was trying to find it, but it was lumped in with the selling price.  Then when I realized where it was, would not let me back in to correct it.  Had to start over after deleting those forms.  Very aggravating!
3	1395619200	I usually buy this at Costco but went through Amazon this time to save me the trip and it was worth it.
5	1395619200	I have used TurboTax for many years.  It has always been easy to use, and provides all the info I need for proper tax preparation.
5	1395619200	I used to have my taxes prepared by someone else. I thought that I would try TurboTax this year and I am happy that I did. I completed three sets of returns for my family in about an hour. We used the free federal e-file option and got our returns in less than 3 weeks ( I e-filed on Feb. 1st). This easy to use software guides you through the process of completing your tax returns, and thoroughly analyzes your progress along the way. I am very happy with this product and I will use it every year.
5	1395619200	Much better than H&R BLock. I switched to H&R block for the last couple of years to save a few bucks in the cost of my tax program, but this year I went back to TurboTax. I am glad I did. It is much easier to use and I did not run into all of the glitches that I had with H&R Block. The program worked flawlessly and was well worth a few dollars more minus the headaches.
5	1395619200	We have used Turbo Tax for over a decade. it gets user friendly and idiot proof each year. It carries over and or can find previous data making filing a breeze. We actually purchased a combo pack of norton virus/PC protecto with TurboTax great deal and idea keep up the good work Amazon.
4	1395619200	This program is the one I have been using for about 7 years - I used to do taxes by hand before that.  This year in particular it has many more identifying questions regarding your retirement deposits, etc. and when I have contacted Turbo, I received my answer in a timely fashion.I cannot compare this to any other tax programs because this is all I use - but I use it to file my son, daughter and husband and mine taxes.  I like that each year, you can trasnfer the information and just check it to make sure it is correct.  What I do not like and after much searching found the answer on their help discussions is that in order to get a free Pennsylvania return (they only offer one), that I could have received when I first installed the program, you have to register each year instead of importing your previous year's information.  I cannot imagine why it is that way, but I was quite disappointed.Still, the program goes through all of the tax forms and you have a choice of what you want to print at the end.
5	1395619200	Have used TurboTax for close to twenty years and no problems.  Easy to use, complete system, with all the options we need to get good returns without any problems from the IRS or State.We found that most tax preparers charge too much and often ask if you want to bend the rules or go out on a limb to get a bigger return.  No Thanks!
3	1395619200	I like that I can complete both my parents and my federal taxes with one piece of software.  Taxes and Tax prep are a means to an end.  Not sure why it costs an extra $20 to e-file the state taxes.
4	1395619200	I've been using for 10+ years and it is efficient. Only thing that irks me is having  to pay the $19.99 for filing the state portion.
4	1395619200	I&#8217;ve been using H&R; Block&#8217;s for several years in the past, but I decided to try turbotax this year. I purchased a physical cd version from a retail store and this cd did not require any key codes. I&#8217;ve bought a download version of H&R; Block from Amazon in the past and it needed a key code so I expected a similar system, but this one did not require the key code.Installing and updating the software was really quick and easy (on my Mac). Everything worked well immediately and intuitively. The overall interface is better than H&R; Block&#8217;s in my opinion, and the application worked fine with the Mac OS Mavericks. The whole process of filing took less than an hour for both federal and state, and it was really easy and simple to go through all the necessary steps.Overall, I&#8217;m really satisfied with this one. It was easier, quicker, and simpler than other brand I have tried. I am glad I decided to try this out this year and for the future, I will probably stick with this one for a while.
5	1395532800	This software makes a difficult job very easy. Have been using it for years and never a problem. with my tax filing.
5	1395532800	Always been a great product.  I have used turbo tax for years without fail.  Turbo tax has been used in my family for generations
5	1395532800	I have always been pleased with TurboTax and will continue with them in the future for fast easy to  use product
3	1395532800	I have used TurboTax for years and have been very pleased with it.  However, after moving to Hawaii this year I paid for two state returns and after filing the one for Hawaii found out that retirements aren't taxed.  I feel TurboTax should have picked this us initially.  I ended up filing an amended return as I didn't owe them anything.,
5	1395532800	I use it every year. It's simple and fast!! Got my money in 7 days. No other way to do your taxes!!
5	1395532800	I have come to really like Turbotax.  It's great if you don't have a lot of complicated taxes to file.  I don't like that they file the federal for free but charge to file the state at a nominal fee.  That's outrageous since I am already paying taxes to my state!  Any way to write off Turbo tax in my taxes next year?!!!!
5	1395532800	It was very easy to use. There were explanations for anything that was not understood.  I received my refund within 10 days.
5	1395532800	Turbo tax is an easy way to prepare  taxes correctly.  No need to try and figure out the tax code when Turbo Tax fills in the information in the proper place for you.  The import directly from your financial institutions is a great feature.  Prior to purchasing turbo tax, I was attempting to understand the IRS instructions for completing a particular schedule.  Just wasn't working.  Turbo Tax imported all the information so I didn't have to figure out what line items I needed to use.  It is also a great way to value donations & list your deductions so you get the maximum return available.  You can go line by line or skip over parts that aren't pertinent to your situation.  The option of electronic filing is great - my return came more quickly than had I snail mailed.  It also completed my state return at the same time.  Buy it, use.  It comes with limited electronic filings but you can use the program as many times as you need (great for family members) but you would need to print out and file those by mail.
5	1395532800	Correct product was delivered on time.  It would have been better if I hadn't borrowed it to a friend whose dog chewed it up.
3	1395532800	We have used this product in the past and liked it better. There were issues  this year with having to install updates after working the forms instead of before beginning and also having to go back to add specifics at the end instead of in the past - as you go.
5	1395532800	TurboTax is a great way to do your income taxes.  It covers all possible places for deductions.  It's easy for everyone.
3	1395446400	Does the job but noticed it has the same problems as the previous two versions. 1) It does not import the previous returns information properly. 2) If you need to file multiple state returns you should purchase all the states you need before you start because if you complete the federal and one state and then purchase the second state later, the information you have already entered in will not transfer to the new state. The only way around this is to redo the entire return from the beginning with the federal return, non-resident state and then resident state. 3) Get it right the first time. Every time I tried to make a change after I had already completed the return, the chance the change will actually take affect is 50/50.It does the job especially if you have a very easy return. It's cheaper than going to an accountant who will charge you double the price but after a few years of using this product and dealing with it's problems, I think it's time to give the other products a try.
1	1395446400	I have been using Turbo Tax for 8 years now, and the last 3 years I had purchased a digital download. This year, though, I went with the actual CD as Amazon was running a promotion that simply couldn't be beat. Long story short, I was able to easily complete my taxes with the software, but when it came time to file... I was out of luck. Something was wrong with the CD and the install, so I was unable to file either via e-file(one federal was included) or print and file by mail. I had to contact Turbo Tax 4 times to have the issue fixed (the finally gave me a digital download) and that process was the nightmare, as their support is TERRIBLE. In the future, I'd suggest ignoring the deal, spend the 10 bucks and get the download. It's a joke that the CD was cheaper anyway, especially when you consider that it has to be manufactured, then delivered(free thanks to prime.) In today's world, the digital downloads should come with the deals...
2	1395446400	I gave two stars because I still like Turbo Tax overall.  But the installation of this product leaves a LOT to be desired.  The CD wouldn't install on my Win 8.1 system (less than 5 months old and all updates installed).  I spent about an hour on-line with the customer service rep (who was very helpful) and he ended up crediting a download version to my account, (which worked) after he had me update a European font pack from Windows.  A Lot of time wasted and hoops to jump through when the name (&#34;Turbo&#34; tax) suggests this is supposed to be fast.I've used Turbo Tax for over 10 years now and this is the first time I've encountered a problem like this.  Sloppy quality control on the CD installer Intuit.  You can do better than this.Ironically, I bought the CD version because of the bad reviews I saw on the download version.  Don't waste your time waiting for the CD to ship, you'll just end up with the download version anyway.
5	1395446400	I gave it a 5 star because that is what I use for my taxes. I have always had good luck with Turbo Tax and it is so easy to order from Amazon by saving me gas and mileage on my car.
1	1395446400	Whoever sent this - it gets rejected from the computer - I need a replacement.............  This shouldn't happen from TurboTax
5	1395446400	I have been using Turbo Tax software for the last 8 years. The program is up-to-date with all the new tax law. If you have a question, you can chat live with customer service rep. The cost is very reasonable.
5	1395446400	Have used Turbo tax for years always easy to use and they keep providing new features.  Love the yearly summary
5	1395446400	As a user of Turbotax for many years, we find it much easier to use than any other tax software on the market and Amazon always delivers with the best price and the easiest delivery.
4	1395446400	I have used this software for my taxes for several years.  This makes the data transfer so easy not having to enter all the same info again.  The price was very competitive with stores in the area...but I did not have to leave the house.  Delivery was prompt.I will get this again.
4	1395446400	Every year TurboTax is &#34;improved&#34; and becomes more inflexible.I bought it because I have the habit. The &#34;refund bonus offer&#34; did notsuck  me in but that does not lessen resentment at failure to deliver.
4	1395446400	Very easy to use and reasonable price.  It is almost stupid proof by not letting you miss items that are required for filing.
5	1395446400	I've used TT since it was sold by the developers working from a nearby garage.Easy to use and enough source identification that issues can be resolved.The import prior year data feature makes tax prep much easier.
5	1395360000	I couldn`t file my taxes without this simple, easy to use program. I highly recommend it. I like how it checks itself for errors after I am done.
5	1395360000	excellent shape.  I buy one every year. Never received a bonus before, but where is my bonus?Do I receive a coupon for next year?
3	1395360000	Not as user friendly as previous years. And I had to wait 4 days for updated forms to be downloaded. This was supposed to be ready by the e/o 2013. Editing, as usual, is not simple. Also no state electronic filing, only Federal. I'll mail mine in.
5	1395360000	I have been using Turbo Tax for many years and it is consistently fast, accurate, and thorough. I love the way it seamlessly picks up your information from the prior year ( assuming you used it then) saving a lot of time and effort in terms of entering information. It can even download some things from participating partners. It makes what is otherwise a tedious and painful process tolerable. If you have significant deductions and can't file a simple form this is the way to go.
5	1395360000	Probably my fave part of TurboTax &#8212; in addition to the disc being mailed to my door &#8212; is that it compares my numbers, side-by-side, to those from the year before. When little has changed from that past year, it makes for a very easy check to see that I'm on track. And then e-file, and you're done!
4	1395360000	Every year, TurboTax makes filing taxes easier and easier. However after finishing this year's taxes, I noticed that it did NOT carry over everything from the previous year! (I haven seen others stating same.) So, even as we become so reliant on a software application to handle our taxes, you simply must check your submission carefully. Excuse me while I chew on the 5th star rating, and get back to amending my tax return...
5	1395360000	No more digging around in the tax instructions, I also like the carryover features from previous year return and filing instructions ........
4	1395360000	In the past, I always paid an accountant a good sum of money to do my taxes.  Just through curiosity, I wanted to try Turbo Tax.  Since my purchase, I've been doing my taxes and have saved quite a bit  of money not having to pay an accountant to prepare it for me. Thanks to Turbo Tax!
5	1395360000	As in previous years, TT gets the job done.  Some annoying repetition, but worthwhile to make sure nothing missing.Overall, excellent job, as expected.
5	1395360000	I've been using TurboTax for many, many years.  Has never failed me yet.  Makes tax time (almost) fun.  Highly recommended.
5	1395360000	I ORDERED ONE COPY.  TWO COPIES WERE SENT TO ME AND CHARGED TO MY CREDIT CARD. HOW DO I FIX.
5	1395360000	I've used TurboTax for years and I love it.  This package that combines E-file and State works well for us.
3	1395360000	Pros:  Excellent updates, assists with organizing all of your tax documents electronically.Cons:  The PRINT IS WAY TO SMALL, AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ENLARGE IT.  You could very well go blind trying to use it.Long hold for support.  Gliches are hard to figure out, and time stealer when this is supposed to help you save time.Would still recommend to others with the warnings above.Will probably still use again next year.
4	1395360000	the program is good in asking questions and getting your proper credits, etc. its main issues are slow loading on occasions and difficulty in saving return in multiple places
4	1395360000	Still haven't any idea how to show sales tax for new car. Help area was no help on this subject.
5	1395273600	No complaints about this product.  It's easy to use and allows you to do as much or as little as you want.
5	1395273600	I've used Turbo Tax for many years now.  It makes it so easy to do and submit my taxes.  It guides me along the way... making the tax event almost painless.
2	1395273600	Did not updat state data correctly. Got back way less then it calculated. Don't know if I will get this next year
3	1395273600	I am still working with the help desk to fix a problem, I will let you know the result.xx x x x
5	1395273600	I use it over and over every year and it works great every time. A must have for all to get taxes done.
3	1395273600	As I said, great tax software, however, the price begins to get up there.  All said and done, it still cast me $79 to file one fed and one state.
5	1395273600	Preparing and filing my income taxes could not have been any easier.Program setup is hassle free and any updates needed are done automaticaly before the program is used.
5	1395273600	I have used this software for filing tax returns for many years.  It's easy,fast, and accurate.  My one complaint is that Intuit charges $19.95 to e-file the state returns.
4	1395273600	Seems to do the job it was designed for. Based on past experience with tax professionals, I don't see a difference between have a 'pro' type my info in a computer while I sit there vs me typing my info in a computer to get the same results.I did, however, feel that navigation to revisit past topics was a bit more confusing versus last year's version.
5	1395273600	After all, why should I keep my money when I can send it to some war lord in Afghanistan or a goat herder somewhere in Africa?  And if you need help filling out the forms so that you don't send any more than you have to, Turbo Tax makes the whole process a little less taxing.
5	1395273600	Turbo Tax was excellent for us. It simplified and enabled us to do our taxes quickly and made e-filing out taxes a no brainer.I would recommend this edition for anyone who has just straight forward taxes to file.
5	1395187200	I was quite afraid to approach my taxes this year:  this was the first year that my husband and I could file jointly and my husband died in January of 2014.  I used Turbo Tax to figure our taxes first as individuals.  Then I followed Turbo Tax as it showed me how to file jointly.  By filing jointly as a married couple I was able to get back almost $2000 more than as filing individually.  Read directions carefully and cue in on the areas marked for additional information.
4	1395187200	I've been using turbo tax for far over 5 years and before it, I did my taxes for 30+ years with homebrew or professional software, and at times with the help of a tax accountant.  I've been buying the CD version and find it has none of the rare quirky behavior of the downloaded license version in terms of installation issues or bugs, of great benefit if you make multiple installs on various PCs so you can work on your taxes on various sites.Having some experience with manual tax filing, TT's recommendations for deductions are good, and the math impeccable.  TT easily pays for itself on the math part alone, and together with Quicken, allow me to do taxes in about 3 hours, but spend added 1 hour sessions refining results.  Refinement is only possible for DIY tax filing.I have never found a bug worth complaining about, but I avoid buying TT until Feb or Mar, where most bugs have been fixed, and most tax forms finalized and available.  The forms TT prints are all essentially perfect copies of all Federal and State forms.  The reasons for deducting a star are: it doesn't support tax forms for many large US cities so I do that by hand, some advertising injected in critical portions of the forms filing and at times terse explanation for purpose of forms or deductions [ almost verbatim from the IRS instruction pages].
5	1395187200	Though my refund shrunk quite a bit this year, it had nothing to do with the workings of this software. I have been using TurboTax for about a dozen years, now, and I still love how simple it makes things. Since I began using this software to do our family's taxes, the whole process has no longer been a chore. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is wary of public tax accountants and wants a more hands-on experience.
5	1395187200	Great product great price. Worthy product. I would recommend this every time. Would buy again and again. Buy yourself one.
4	1395187200	Easy to install, easy to use, and much less expensive than the accountant I have used in the past.  I will use TurboTax next year.  I'm glad I made the purchase.
2	1395187200	I purchased the Deluxe version for $59.97 as I do every year.  This year I had one thing different, a 1099S form from the sale of a second house in another state.  The directions for a 1099S indicated to put the amount in with investments.  When I went there it only had entry form for a 1099E.  Then the program tells me that if I purchase the Premier version they can help for $32.27 more.  Now I have $92.24 invested. So I purchased the Premier version and found the instructions and the forms are exactly the same as the Deluxe version.  I went on line for help from TurboTax as to where to put a 1099S from the sale of a &#8220;second home.&#8221; The instructions I received were to go to a tutorial for a 1099S from the sale of the primary home, not the second home.  I was mad before now I am really mad.  I messed around with the program for a few days and just stuck it somewhere; I don&#8217;t think I could do it again.The 1099S was from another state and TurboTax wanted $43.01 for a state tax program; now I am up to $135.25. Then they wanted $15.00 to file the state tax bringing the total to $165.25, I could have hired a tax professional for that amount and saved my self a lot of days, time and grief.The final challenge was I changed my email address in TurboTax but all emails that were sent to me were sent to the email address I used last year.  I checked with TurboTax and they said I could not change the email address. I never received an email indicating the status of any of the three tax forms that I filed.
4	1395187200	TurboTax is always a fine product. We have never had any problems. This year when you're installing the program, you are greeted with pictures of people and their testimonials, which is annoying. However, once you move on to the actual business at hand, they don't pop up any more.
5	1395187200	We buy TurboTax every year. This year was a great deal with amazon that you could turn part of your refund into an amazon gift card and get an additional 10%. I hope they do that again next year since we buy so much at amazon.com it was really worth it for us.
5	1395187200	I have used Turbo-Tax for many years and this edition IS A DISASTER FOR iMAC USERS!!!!  Will not allow &#34;updates&#34;, charged me for an upgraded version I DID NOT NEED!!  Asked if I wanted a gift card, I said &#34;yes&#34;, then it told me I couldn't qualify, THEN CHARGED MY REFUND FOR $200.00!!!  Also, though I refused all offers of &#34;audit protection&#34; charged me for that.  I then printed my return, and am still waiting for my refund, 6 weeks later??  Stay away from this product....
2	1395187200	I have been using Turbo Tax since they were owned by Parsons Technology many years ago and always loved it, but this product has been going downhill for some time. I volunteer as a tax preparer for the elderly and low income. The program we use there puts Turbo Tax to shame. Opening forms with links to supporting documents or forms is very helpful, and the dropdown menu or tree clearly indicates when information is missing from a form. The tax program from H&R was not that great shakes either.
4	1395187200	It was easy to follow and I was able to help to family members get their tax returns done quickly.
3	1395187200	There are some mistakes in the program.  It is simple to use. For the most part it is easy to follow. I would buy it again. I just want it to get better every year.
4	1395100800	I have used TurboTax for many years now and love the ease of use.  Only thing I would like to add is free State filing...
4	1395100800	As in past years TurboTax was pretty easy to use and included the forms and information I needed. One of the best features is being able to get information from earlier years returns.
2	1395100800	I agree with the other reviewers that this is the worst edition of Turbo Tax ever.  I went with HR Block last year and found it satisfactory.  This is also satisfactory in that it works, but the product development people at Intuit just don't get it.  Very few people want all the complex bells and whistles.  It just makes it harder to use.  It also doesn't seem adaptable to different situations.  I use it because it is easier than having to use a blank 1040, but it is over priced.  I want it to work without being &#34;deluxe&#34; to add to the cost.
5	1395100800	I have used Turbo Tax for over 5 years now and aware by it.  It walks you through every step.
5	1395100800	Still one of the best personal tax programs around. Lots of help available as well as the online support. Easy to use with lots of coverage for normal, ready form taxpayers as well as those bedding the king form.
1	1395100800	Did the entire tax return and ready to send when advised they did not have all the right forms to submit the taxes.  Very angry.  Now hopefully the correct forms will arrive in time to send them in.
1	1395100800	I did my taxes on March 8, 2014. Upon nearing completion of the form, suddenly there's information on the screen that says THEY DON'T HAVE THE CORRECT FORMS FOR ME TO FILE MY FEDERAL TAX. Tax deadline is April 15, folks, and TurboTax still doesn't have the correct forms???? Of course I signed up for the email notification for when the &#34;correct forms&#34; pop up, thinking it would be within a couple of days - NOTHING. This is my second and LAST year for TurboTax. It's overhyped, over-advertised, overpriced, and promises a lot more than it actually delivers.How is everyone else filing if the correct forms &#34;aren't available&#34; yet????? How do these people get away with this? I am not one to write angry reviews under normal conditions, but this is inexcusable. I bet enough people will have been burned enough by these shysters this year that it will substantially cut into their sales next year. I hope so, anyway. I know I won't be buying it - and I shouldn't have &#34;bought it&#34; before. Never again.
4	1395100800	I can't give it 5 stars (I keep those in my back pocket for only special purchases), but I have used TurboTax for 6 years now (for Mac OS X) and more recently have bought the download-only version, as no one needs the disc or box these days. It's worthless after this tax year anyway.This app just gets better and better. I never experienced a crash, and calculations were accurate. I could never get it to remember where I left off, but it was obvious from what hadn't been completed, so I can't deduct much for that. I'm not crazy about all the &#34;offers&#34; towards the end&#8230;especially when the software knows you're getting a refund. I want my refund, not an amazon.com gift card. I also still dislike the filing costs for Federal and state. Why can't the price I pay cover both?Still, this is the best of the bunch in my opinion, and I've been using tax software for a long time.
4	1395100800	I have used Turbo Tax for a number of years.  For the typical middle income person this version is most appropriate.  In addition, the price is comparable to most stores selling this product but without the need to pay sales tax (see, Turbo Tax already saved me money on taxes).  Postage is free and I purchased as a bundle with Norton 360 which provided an additional discount.
5	1395100800	have used TurboTax for the last 5 years and find it to be a very reliable product.  It is very easy to use.
2	1395100800	What a rip-off, $39.99 and it doesn't even include the 1099 schedule B form.  Buyer be warned, it's an ADDITIONAL $30 to upgrade to premier
3	1395100800	We've used TurboTax for years, but the last few years have seen our tax situation grow a tad more complicated, so we &#34;upgraded&#34; to the Deluxe version. This year we had a significant issue (which we thankfully caught before filing). One of our state forms wasn't not included in the final print out, an issue that the rep we spoke with was unable to resolve, even with the help of other techs on duty. We eventually found and printed the form ourselves and had to file by mail. Not exactly a comfort when you're relying on the program to be error-free!
4	1395100800	I have used turbo tax for many years. Works good for us. We don't have a very complicated return. Didn't like the amazon gift card side of it though. I felt I had to give them too much access to my personal information to use it. Bought it thinking that was a good deal and in the end decided not to use it.
5	1395014400	I have used turbo tax for the past 10 years and it has never failed me.  It walks you through everything. Taxes made simple.
5	1395014400	I have been using this product to do my taxes for at least seven (7) years it is extremely easy to use, accurate, and most important it is less costly than going to a tax preparing service...
5	1395014400	Made tax preparing go very smoothly.  Turbo tax works well for us because my husband always does our tax preparation and it helps him organize things easily.
5	1395014400	I use this every year and am happy to buy it when on sale on Amazon.  Easy way to pick it up!  I have done my own taxes since the beginning of time and was delighted years ago to find TurboTax.  Easy to use and I like the record keeping too.
4	1395014400	This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.
5	1395014400	I have been using Turbo Tax for almost 10 years and It is great.Very easy walks you right through everything.  Will buy it againnext year.
5	1395014400	The program is so fast and easy. We received it fast, got our state refund in 5 days and our federal in 11. Very happy and confident with doing our own taxes this year. Will use it again next year.
5	1395014400	Always easy and efficient! Love Turbo Tax. Saves money and time. Why waste money letting someone else do the same program?
5	1395014400	Have been using the Turbo Tax for some time and have never had an issue with any of this family's returns.This year new information as required by Federal and State returns was presented.Presented in an understandable and neat format, our returns were e filed with no difficulty.The cost of the program is affordable and the ability to do one's own returns is satisfying.
5	1395014400	I recommend this software to any body that needs to make their own taxes it is very easy, step by step directions.
5	1394928000	Have used this product for years, know what to expect and have never had any problems.  Arrived on time, would recommend to anyone who does their own taxes.
1	1394928000	This software could not process my taxes.  When it was stuck, I tried to call support service but no one answers the phone during their advertised hours.  Support states 5 minute wait but try two hours with no pick up!! I've transferred my tax info to TaxAct waiting for a call back from Turbo.  Don't waste your time.  Start with another service to begin with.
5	1394928000	If you have many investments then this is what you need.  You can download right from the investment firm into TurboTax and it does all the calculations.  Prints everything out for mailing or you can file electronically for free on the Fed.(charges for state so I just mail that one in).  Works on Both Windows and Mac
1	1394928000	this was a horrible choice as after paying for the software they wanted us to pay additionally for each part of the filing.  you had to know to call customer service (which was over half hour wait on the phone) in order to get the credit for the filing fee.  HUGELY DISAPPOINTED.
5	1394928000	easy to use, quick federal tax refund, don't need to worry mistake for your filing. will recommend my friends to select turbotax software.
2	1394928000	While the program is easy to use there are just too many steps designed only to profit Intuit.  In the end when I tried to use the free federal filing the program got into an endless loop, telling me that I had to update, then telling me that all updates were installed, then telling me that I had to update first then....In the end all it could tell me was that I should file by mail!And of course the state filing costs an arm and a leg (20% of my refund!) so I won't be doing that.  Virginia once upon a time had free efiling until the legislature canceled the program, reportedly under pressure from guess who.
4	1394928000	I have been religiously using Turbo Tax software for eight years and it's never failed me.  Couldn't be simpler to use.
5	1394928000	I have been using this software since the early 90s. It only get better each year. Saved me thousands by finding a loop hole I did not know about.
1	1394928000	This software expects a user to buy their Audit Defense for $44.99 before it would let the user e-file a return. Outrageous tactic to sell services.
4	1394928000	PRODUCT WORKED GREAT JUST READ THE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. FAIRLY EASY WELL THOUGHT OUT AND WORKS SMOOTHLY
5	1394928000	Again I am please with the ease of filing my taxes with TurboTax and keeping track of my deductibles throughout the year.
5	1394928000	Received the same good old TurboTax as I would have from the store.  It arrived on time.  But what can you say about a product that helps you do taxes - it does the job and it isn't fun - but Turbo tax as per usual walks you through the process.
2	1394928000	TurboTax has been good to me for over a decade, but it's increasingly frustrating to use with slightly more complex tax situations. This year, TurboTax couldn't deal with college savings plan distributions. Data I entered from form 1098-T did not carry over, and TurboTax insisted that I owed taxes for excess withdrawals. I spent over an hour with a friendly support tech, who agreed there was a problem, but could not resolve it. She bumped it to a supervisor who (immediately) said it was an error that would be fixed shortly. 6 wks later, error is not fixed.I finally threw in the towel and went to an accountant. He saved me far more than he cost, and didn't waste hours of my time.Too bad; I had been pretty satisfied with the product, but now realize this is not a cost-effective use of time for anything but simple tax situations.
5	1394928000	Sucked in last year's info, used the online retrieval of 1099 info from a few accounts, and with no fuss or muss was done with mine and two of my neighbors in minimal time.
3	1394841600	Every year I hope they will simplify the questions, and every year it gets longer.  The software will ask a yes or no question and then query 3-4 more questions, even if the first answer was negative.  VERY ANNOYING!  I am sure they want to get &#34;every possible deduction&#34;, but I am pretty sure if I have foreign investments or own additional homes, just trust me and lets go on!  I hope that the results of the &#34;audit&#34; in the software are accurate, as by the time I get through, it has managed to ask questions that make no sense and help is non existent or dumber than the question as to what they are even talking about.  I miss Parsons.  Just let me fill out the forms and help if needed, thank you.  Please make it easier for the 99% of us that have a simple income from one state.
2	1394841600	I have used turbo tax since it came out back when, but this year I couldn't get the job done. I figured my taxes three times and came up with three answers, and ended up spending another $100 to go to a pro to have them done.I did retire this year and think that is what was messing me up, but I couldn't get turbo tax to give me the same answer twice, so I farmed it out...mo money... just what I needed
5	1394841600	I've used TurboTax software (physical disc) for many years and have never been disappointed. One year I tried another well-known product and didn't like it. I decided I had to go back to TurboTax! Another year it was recommended that I use a professional tax person...and he made a major error on my return that required an amended form plus Social Security consequences a few years later! Never again. TurboTax is so good about asking all the right questions and not leaving any stone unturned, but it's extremely flexible, allowing as much user intervention as is needed, and it's very intuitive.This year's version seems to be better than ever (I didn't think that was possible)!
3	1394841600	It wasn't very clear on reporting sale of stock. .I feel as is iI I repaid for capital gains that  I had reported over the last six years.
3	1394841600	The software will interact with the previous years tax software output data on your computer to provide necessary data to simplify tax preparation.  It also obtains information from the &#34;Quicken 2013 Program&#34; software and from your financial institutions to put financial data in you tax submittal for the previous tax year (i.e. 2013 in 2014).  The state tax data, as well as the Federal tax data, are generated with capability to submit tax forms and resolve $ transfer through the internet system to the tax authorities.For IRA bearing 701/2 year olds, there is yet to be program inputs that do the estimated tax $ payments required in 2014 for the  distributions from an IRA ( for tax year 2014).  This gets to be a problem since Uncle Sam will fine you if you don't get within the 10% accuracy requirement for the estimated tax!  The same  goes for IRA/Roth rollover $ etc. The program should be accommodating the old folks to do the four estimates correctly so the program printed out estimate forms are correct! As they are doing this, the program should also arrange for internet transfer of the estimate payments directly per customer request!
5	1394841600	Got it on sale for $39.99.  Best price I found.  Started using this a couple years ago.  It is convienient, it will also keep you from missing deductions.
4	1394841600	This software is super easy. I always buy Turbo Tax and I usually find a great deal on Amazon for it.
5	1394841600	Worked as intended. Minor issue with updating, but I attribute this to my hardware and not the software. Turbo Tax provided a patch that fixed the problem effortlessly.Did not take advantage of the bonus offer, but it is a great added benefit. Maybe would do it at 15% and definatley at 20%
1	1394755200	First off, I want this review to serve as a 1-star review of Intuit/TurboTax the company and their ATROCIOUS customer service, as well as a strong warning to any customer that was considering purchasing this product to receive the Amazon gift card promo if the IRS ignores your request for a direct deposit, and disburses a check instead, despite the fact that there is no warning of this on the TurboTax website.After fulfilling all of the requirements to receive the 10% promotional Amazon gift card, Intuit has told me that since the IRS issued a check, instead of depositing the refund to my checking account, as I requested, that I will NOT receive the promised gift card. I spent 2 hours on the phone with a customer service person and a supervisor, as they simply went in circles explaining that there was nothing they could do and that since the IRS issued a check, that nullified the promo. They even went into my account and affirmed that I completed all of the requirements accurately, based on their own website, which are:1. Before filing, choose how much of your tax refund (in increments of $100) to apply towards an Amazon Gift Card.2. E-file your return. Your return will need to be accepted (received) by the IRS before the next step happens.3. One day before the IRS deposits your tax refund, you'll get an email from Intuit TurboTax to let you know you'll be receiving your Amazon gift card code soon.4. The IRS then deposits your tax refund to your bank account.5. 1-2 business days after your tax refund is deposited, Amazon will email your Amazon.com Gift Code to you.Note: Saturdays and Sundays do not count as "business days."6. Click the Redeem Now button in the email (or copy/paste the Claim Code) to load the amount to your Amazon account.The amount that I requested to be applied to my Amazon gift card was $2,200. I purchased my software from Amazon.com, my entire refund was well above the requested amount to be applied to the gift card, and I requested that the IRS Direct Deposit into my account.What TurboTax DOES NOT tell you is that if the IRS decides to disburse the funds via check despite your request for Direct Deposit, you will not receive your promo card. Let me repeat, TurboTax was able to see that I requested Direct Deposit, and confirmed that I, as a customer did everything correctly, but that this is a loophole for which they have no recourse. I asked them where it states this for customers like myself, and they pointed me to their FAQ page which contains the following:Why am I not eligible for this offer?Here are the reasons why you may not be eligible:* You purchased your CD or download software from an outlet other than TurboTax.com or Amazon.com;* You didn't e-file;* You chose to receive all or part of your refund via check, NetSpend Premier Visa Prepaid Card, or you split your refund;* You're filing with a foreign address (excluding APO/FPO/DPO, which are considered domestic); or* You (or your spouse, if filing jointly) are under the age of 18; or* Your federal tax refund was below the minimum amount.They cited the 3rd bullet-point as the reason why I did not receive my Amazon promo. This is EXTREMELY misleading, if not outright fraudulent, as I ABSOLUTELY elected to have my deposit directly deposited, and TurboTax even acknowledged that when they reviewed my account.  I also have my tax documents printed to prove that I requested direct deposit. Then they told me that it is "IMPLIED" that you must receive a direct deposit. So, just because you request a direct deposit, you have to hope that the IRS doesn't ignore your request or else Intuit is going to wash their hands of fulfilling their end of the promotion. Simple as that.Because there is no mention or warning of this loophole in the process where the customer gets screwed over, I told them that they should update their policy and that they need to be reported to the BBB. I have already filed my complaint with the BBB, and hope that it, at least, serves as a means to warn others in advance before they take the naive belief that Intuit will back up their claims and promises.I told them that I was willing to do anything necessary to resolve this issue that the IRS caused. I acknowledged early, and frequently, that I recognize that it was not their direct fault for the predicament I am in, but that there is no way for a customer to know in advance that this could happen, and their website gives no warning to customers that this can happen to them. I told them I am willing to do anything to get this resolved, including writing a check to Intuit's third-party bank, providing all the documentation that I fulfilled all of the requirements and waiting as long as it takes to get the promo gift card, but they said they could not do anything. In this 21st Century environment, I am simply shocked that Intuit was unwilling to provide out-of-the-box solutions for scenarios that they don't warn their customers about. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.Keep in mind, this is not a 1-star "hate it" review for the quality of the product, as I still believe the product is outstanding. As a customer who has used TurboTax for 8 consecutive years, I regrettably must say that I will ABSOLUTELY NEVER USE THEIR PRODUCT AGAIN.  It would have been better for them to never have offered this promotion, because I was a very satisfied customer of their product. In fact, I just talked my manager at work into purchasing and using it for the first time this year. I have convinced many people to quit using accountants and switch to TurboTax, to save money and find way more credit/deduction opportunities than second-rate accountants will do. I simply cannot give any more of my business to a company who will not fulfill their end of a promotion after acknowledging that the customer has done everything correctly. If they had any sense to consider the big picture, and that I've spent at least $450 on their product over the past 8 years, and would have been a consistently loyal customer for years to come, and for $220 they are going to lose a loyal customer.It pains me to say I will now have to begin researching TurboTax competitors and hope that others have competitive software.
5	1394755200	Turbo Tax 2013 maintains the record of earlier versions of Turbo Tax with its thoroughness and ease of use. The &#34;help at any step&#34; is of particular use
5	1394755200	I have been using Turbo tax for many years and the new filing option of filing on line is awesome. The software was shipped on time and in perfect condition and at a good price.
5	1394755200	Made filing easy. Asked all the right questions and made what had been a tiresome chore into a pleasant experience.
5	1394755200	This software sets the standard in making it easy to do the miserable task of filing taxes.  You enter the numbers and it does the rest for you.  Can't imagine using any other software package at tax season.
4	1394755200	I have used this product in the past to do my own taxes, when I was filing jointly (as I am married), but now that I have horrendous amounts of student loans, I need to file separately for the purposes of income based repayment. There are NOT any form of instruction on how to go about diving up assets in a community property state, like the one where I live, and I spend about 4x longer figuring this out than the time if would normally have taken me to do my taxes (I have a very straight forward tax situation). So caveat emptor to those in this situation, but once you figure it out, the correction is simple arithmetic.
4	1394755200	It works okay but it is big. I cant carry items when I wear it on the left and I cant buckle my seat belt with it on the right. It works just fine. Secure and I like being able to turn it backwards so the screen doesn't show.
1	1394755200	I used turbotax last year and was happy with it.  This year I finished doing my fed. taxes and tried to proceed to to my state taxes.  The program informed me that I had to update some federal information before I could proceed.  When I tried to do that the program told me I was unable to download the newest information because I was not logged in as administrator.  When I logged in as administrator turbotax told me I had a 113 error and I was unable to proceed.  I tried to redo my federal and when that didn't work I erased all the information that I could, deleted turbotax from my harddrive, logged in as administrator and reloaded turbotax.  Same thing.  I would think that the program should look for new tax changes when you first open it, and not in the middle.  Tech help!! forget it.  There is no phone number to call, and I have logged tried to log into my account only to find myself staring at the little circle going round, and round, and round on my computer screen.  I can log into any website in a matter of seconds, but to log into turbotax??  Well I have stared at my computer for 1/2 an hour and could not get into it.  This little glitch in the program makes turbotax useless.  Unless you are computer savvy, I would advise you to open your computer as administrator if you want to accomplish anything.  If I could, I would give turbotax a minus five star.  Their tech service might be good, if you can get a hold of them, but good luck with that.Update:  I finally got a phone number for turbo tax, and their techs were extremely helpful, and courteous.  I will raise my review to three star just because of the techs.
2	1394755200	Each year TurboTax Deluxe contains fewer features and more &#34;opportunities&#34; to upgrade to a more expensive edition. I had to add a second state this year, a process that cost 80% of the original federal/state copy.
5	1394755200	Yes, we purchase this Turbo Tax each and every year.  Hubs does our taxes, his elderly father's taxes, and his stupid sister's taxes with this program, each and every year.  Totally worth it, we've been using it ever since it existed, and will continue to purchase and use this program as long as they exist.
5	1394755200	Have used the Deluxe for years and no problems.However, this year forms I use such as Schedule F and depreciation are not available in this version.No mention of this major change in any of the descriptions or capabilities.Called TurboTax and they setup a download to get the home & business version.So all is well on the farm.
3	1394668800	I have some problems with it but I think I didn't get the right information into it when I read in the taxes it did fine.
5	1394668800	I first was scared to do the amazon gift card. I contacted Intuit after about 4 business days as I thought I read that it said I'd receive the gift card 24-48 hours after submitting my taxes, but I think it's 24-48 hours after the IRS approves your return. In any case, Intuit was responsive to my first amazon review and contacted me directly, which was unexpected. I also had called the previous day and spoke with someone. It was painless and they explained the wording (I must have misread the 24-48 hours after submitting by e-file vs. after taxes have been accepted by the IRS).Anyway, I got the 10% extra added to my gift card. Thanks!
2	1394668800	I ordered this product to do both my state and federal income tax return.  Federal worked fine.State took my 2012 refund amount and incorrectly entered it in the &#34;Estimated Tax&#34; box, despite my correct input.  This caused Turbo Tax to indicate I had a refund coming.  Instead, I received notice from my state that I owed money.  When I called the state revenue office I was told that it was a known glitch with Turbo Tax.  Overall I liked how the product worked - but I am aggrivated that I paid full price for a product that should have worked properly and accurately represented whether a refund or payment was due.  I'm not mad about having to pay...just aggrivated that I paid for product that didn't work right and caused extra effort to investigate the issue.
4	1394668800	TurboTax is easy to use and Amazon sells it fir a great price.  The deluxe edition is well worth the cost because it makes doing your state taxes a breeze.
4	1394668800	It's a good program that is pretty easy to use.  Does not matter if you have never prepared taxes before as the program walks you through EVERYTHING, which is a good thing.  I've used this program for 5 years and have had no issues.  Refunds based on taxes prepared by this program come through as expected.  Keep in mind, your mileage will vary based on the complexity of your taxes.
5	1394668800	Arrived earlier than expected in excellent condition. I have been using this software for 7 years and it is easy to use. Definitely recommend this!
5	1394668800	Easy to use, accurate results, makes tax time a breeze!  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and will continue to choose it to make tax reporting simple.
3	1394668800	It worked fine on my Federal taxes but want to make my state tax go to Montana and I live in Nevada
5	1394668800	What's not to love? Long time user and satisfied return to a favorite piece of software. It gets the job done. If you have any understanding of taxes and a modicum of financial savvy you can do it!
4	1394582400	I have used this product for many years and have found it to be the best on the market.  It is simple to use and carrys forward information from year to yeae.
5	1394582400	Have used Turbo Tax for the last 5 years, love the ease in getting our taxes done and done right. After the first year I even went to HR Block to see if we had done everything correctly, and they assured us that Turbo Tax had done a great job for us!
4	1394582400	I use TurboTax every year to do my taxes and my family's taxes. The only thing that I wish would improve is the 39.99 fee for additional states on top of a $19.99 fee to efile.I think that's a bit much after purchasing CD for $50.
2	1394582400	I've used Turbotax for years and won't be switching any time soon because it does a sufficient job, but I struggled with the whole &#34;Amazon rebate&#34;.  The description says you can put up to $2,000 on a card and has a max of $10,000.  I wanted to put all $505 on the card and get the rebate, but it maxed me out at $300 and wouldn't let me add any more.  I'm sure I missed something in the fine print somewhere, but everything I tried didn't work so I took my $300 with my free $30 (which ALMOST paid for my purchase of the software, almost) and called it a day.  I'm still not sure what I did wrong.
5	1394582400	I have been using TurboTax for over 10 years.  Used others off and on but this is by far the most user friendly.  Would recommend downloaded or CD rather than doing it online because then you don't always have to have an internet connection to work on your taxes.  I also use the planners all year long to plan for my next year's taxes and to play with &#34;what if&#34; scenarios.
5	1394582400	As always, this item is exactly what we need to do our taxes properly and efficiently.  So easy to use.
5	1394582400	As usual, they take the pain out of doing taxes, finding forms and deductions. Ive used Turbotax for many years and this year I found a couple things missing, maybe my error.It did not load up my information from the previous year automatically. It did not compare my taxes with the rest of the population in my bracket.Otherwise, its excellent, got my return in approximately 1 week after electronic filing.
5	1394582400	i could handle tax return by myself. i was recommended by my friend. i would recommend to other friends someday.
1	1394582400	The most rude and unprofessional people from top to bottom. Took 3 weeks to get taxes done. Had to go all way up to VP Bob Meighan to let him know we were hung up on over 50 times and he was condensing and spiteful. Couldn't get more than 3 words in and he interrupts me. Free advice: NEVER use turbo tax!!!!!
5	1394582400	first year I've done my taxes on my own, my now X husband use to file the joint ones, I got back soo much money I don't know what to do with it, I'm a single mom of 2. I kept checking for software updates and every time I did, it would add more money after asking a few more questions. I will use this year after year.
4	1394582400	I use Turbo Tax every year.  Easy to use, intuitive questions, even has a graph to show how likely it would be that you would be audited.
2	1394582400	I may have spent more time trying to load this software than I do on my taxes. Turbotax claims it's not them but I'm running out of time. A real solution would help, otherwise I'll have to go elsewhere.-eleven year veteran
5	1394496000	Turbo Tax arrived quickly and I used it to complete my income tax early. Product worked very well and I thought it was easier to use than the 2012 version. Very satisfied.
5	1394496000	Saves considerable time and I don't need to be a tax expert to become informed on the possible deductions/credits available.
5	1394496000	A+++
5	1394496000	Glad I purchased it again. Made my taxes easy to prepare as always. Will always buy turbo tax good price cheaper that the stores .
4	1394496000	I did have a little bit of trouble loading it on my Mac but once there it worked as expected.
5	1394496000	This is by far my favorite tax software.  It is through and simple to use.  It really beats going to the post office to get all of the forms.
5	1394496000	This is my fourth year of ordering and using TurboTax products and this years produced the same satisfaction of the previous years. It is very easy to use as it takes you through completing your return step by step. For this very reason I will continue to order and use their products.
5	1394496000	This was a downloaded product that surpassed any sale prices I saw for the product in local stores.  I was very satisfied.
5	1394409600	I always use Turbo and know it has my best interest in mind.  Easy to use and was glad they had a discount and will use it again
5	1394409600	I have been using turbo tax for federal and state returns for over 6 years.It is easy to use and the directions are easy to follow.
4	1394409600	I BOUGHT THIS FOR SOMEONE ELSE.  IT WAS GREATLY  APPRECIATED.  I THINK THE RATING IS AN INDIVIDUAL OPINIONI DID NOT PERSONALY USE IT.
1	1394409600	I have used turbotax for about 5 years and this year their is something wrong. After many hours of doing my taxes (getting the info need) I had them done. I turn off turbotax as I have done every time for the last 5 years but this time when I open turbotax back up all my info is gone, I had saved it to my computer and thats gone to. I am with out a doubt very upset. SO I AM WARNING EVERYONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. When I went to turbotax to find out what could have happen, the gave me a lot of answers that had nothing to do with the question I had asked and that even more frustrating.
5	1394409600	Turbo Tax couldn't be much easier to use.  I've used them two years in a row now and won't go back to a tax person ever again.  I have complete confidence in the product.
5	1394409600	Worked very well, easy to complete taxes for all of my family members.  I would recommend it to any one in helping to calculate your taxes.
1	1394409600	My rating reflects my displeasure at having to purchase two turbos because the deluxe version had bee removed and replaced with the basic version.  Any future purchases will be. Made in store where the item can be checked.  What happened to the free state efile?
5	1394409600	I got this as part of a bundle with Quicken 2014 at a great price. My taxes were so easy to do. If this version is the first time ur buying Turbotax, it walks ya through everything. Even if u don't understand somethin u can click on the help button within Turbotax and it takes ya to the help center. All in all it's a great program for anyone. Even if their returns are a bit complex.
5	1394409600	Been using it for years, and it's an annual expenditure.  They seem to have everything covered for most users.  If they don't they will recommend upgrading to another version.
1	1394409600	What a peice of junk. I have used Turbo Tax the last 5 years. This year it has been nothing but trouble. It say's you get get one freestate file for free,but it takes you to a pay site. Then it doese't let you finish your Federal tax unless you pay to e-file your { free}State tax..Do not buy or use this untill they fix this problem
5	1394409600	The wife has been doing taxes and using this program for several years and we have not had an audit.  For most years, we have had a refund to which we have received quickly due to e-filing.
4	1394409600	I have used TurboTax for years, because it works well with Quicken, which I have also used very long term. I give the product 4 stars because I can't bring myself to say I love a product used for preparing income tax reports. The product does not have any problems with installation (WIndows 7), is quite easy to use, gives you access to &#34;It's Deductible&#34;, so you can keep up with donations throughout the year, does my state income tax in less than 30 minutes, and includes free e-filing. I can highly recommend it, but I just can't love it.
3	1394409600	Have used this product for 6 years, and always had goodexperiences, specially when I needed tech support.This year had a problem, tech support said can notfix, because, that support in product is only in premierversion - which previously in deluxe version. I cannot believe this, so, I am still working on situation.Also, they want you to use email solutions fromtech support, as no phone numbers are on product,fortunately I had number.
3	1394409600	I have used H&R Block's tax software the last couple of years but this was on sale on Amazon so I bought it.  I have my own side business and this software did not have a breakout like the H&R block software does.
4	1394409600	The tax preparation software appears to work about the same as last year.If you are already familiar with Turbotax, you should be able to complete your returns quickly. My problem is the very large extra fees. I had to spend another $40 for a second State return due to a relocation last year, and then another $21 each to file the State returns electronically. These extra fees seem way too high. Combined they cost more than the package itself.And if you want to pay for a fee out of your refund, there is another fee.
5	1394409600	This year's version seems to have some improvements and I find TT easy to use. Great product. Try it once & you'll never go to H&R again!
2	1394323200	Beware if you have foreign accounts. Previous years completed all the forms needed including TD F90-22.1. Not this year. Now that the form has changed to the FBAR form 114, Turbotax does not complete the form. Worse yet, I does not notify you to complete the form on your own.
5	1394323200	I'm not an accountant and I don't really want to hire one, so using Turbo Tax is the best way to get a yucky job done.
5	1394323200	I wouldn't use anything else at this point; I find it easy to use and very thorough. It is a memory hog, but worth having patience to do the interview if you have a more than average number of topics to cover.
5	1394323200	I have used TurboTax for years and it is the easy way to do taxes and get them done easily and accurately. I am very happen with the program
2	1394323200	Turbotax does seem to do a better job than when I used to use it years ago. I switched back this year because my accountant was not calculating employee stock sales correctly.  Turbotax does the job but you need to be very careful, and don't rely on their support. I spent two hours on the phone making no progress. At the end of the call they suggested I talk to their "experts" for a fee, instead of getting support for the product they sold me.
5	1394323200	Have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for over 10 years.  It has never given me any problems.  The only tax program for me.
4	1394323200	This is my second year with this product and I'm wondering why the State filing fees are such a mystery and aren't included in any type of retail deal upfront. What's the mystery ... Don't they want to add the $19.99 to the price and make it an accurant E-Z File product???
5	1394323200	The Intuit products have made my control of my finances very simple and complete...I would recommend the products to all in need.
5	1394323200	I've used TurboTax yearly for almost as long as it's been around, and it's better now than ever. Easy to follow, step by step directions and a running tally of your tax balance as you work on the return.
4	1394323200	The TurboTax program is working well. However, Amazon did not provide any form or instructions on how to take advantage of its refund bonus offer. There was nothing in the shipping box other than the sealed TurboTax disc. I guess I will have to try to contact someone at Amazon about the issue before I file my taxes.
3	1394323200	This program is helpful and aggravating at the same time.  It forces you to laboriously plow thru these worksheets rather than just put in the number.  Error check is a nice feature.  Every time you start the program it takes a while to update forms.  Never sure where I really am in the process
5	1394323200	Very easy to use, cover all the aspects and questions related to a 1040EZ filing.Both federal and state returns were filled electronically without a hitch, the refunds were deposited into our accounts within two weeks.
5	1394236800	I have been using Turbo Tax for over 25 years and it has always provided me with the easiest meathods to complete my taxes gotten me the honest best returns. I have had accountant friends review what I have submitted in the past and they could not get me a better return.
5	1394236800	Awesome!  Downloads W2s and info from last year's return, so it saves time!  We've been using it for 7-8 years and have been pleased.  Have home interest but not a lot of other deductions or things to itemize.  Have never used an accountant so can't compare.
1	1394236800	we are older and simply did not understand how to use this software.. so."i returned your tax program for a refund.. not once but twice.. this is the address used Mailing Address (if using U.S. Postal Service) Intuit Consumer Group Inc. Returns Department PO Box 386 Greenville, SC 29334-0386... twice it was returned and before i go to amazon and complain.. i want a response from you."as you night see i got no place with that one.. $12 lost on two postal returns.. and another $40 for the software.. even the intuit web site is sabotaged.. click on the contact me button and your sent to a dead page.. if they deceived me on their 100% satisfaction guarantee then what will they deceive you or uncle sam about.. think about it..
5	1394236800	Turbo Tax Deluxe walks you through each step of your tax return.  It is easy and fast.  Have been using it for 20 years.
5	1394236800	I have been using Turbo Tax for years and still find it to fit my needs.  I do wish they hadn't started charging a fee to e-file the state return; so I prepare the state return with Turbo Tax and then mail it.  Every $20 matters in these trying times.
5	1394236800	I was led to believe that Turbo Tax would get me a larger refund. Product did not deliver. Just kidding!  Turbo Tax has been around for hundreds of years and works great!
5	1394236800	Previous versions had 'cute' little videos you could watch and spend more precious time doing this chore.  Been using this for years and was able to finish in less time than ever before.  Also took advantage of the Amazon 10% tie in which came in pretty handy with all the dough we spend as a family here.
5	1394236800	This is exactly what I paid for, easy to use and understand, and with some additional add-in help tabs and menus
2	1394236800	You might be better off using one of the free online tax preparation sites. Some states also provides it's own website to file online for no additional charge. I would rather have them give me the full price than have me go through filling out all the forms and then tell me the additional fees one screen before I complete filing my taxes.
1	1394236800	The TurboTax Deluxe does not work with my Mac OSX 10.5.6 operating system. That fact was buried in the side description; it should have been prominently displayed. So I'll figure my tax returns without TurboTax.
3	1394236800	It is very confusing trying to navigate through this product when you are doing your taxes. I think I will try a different product next year. I have used this product for many years, so it has taken me far to long to figure out that TurboTax  is never going to make this software easy to use. The problem may not be solely theirs because the whole tax system is a  complex joke
5	1394236800	Purchased for my husband who does our taxes.  He has used it since it first came out and loves the ease of using it.  Would recommend it for anyone who does their own or others' taxes.
5	1394236800	Been using turbo for years. Use to go to a cpa but no longer, simple fast. Love it ! Need I say more ?
4	1394236800	In the past the program automatically updated about every time I turned it on.  That doesn't seem to be happening this year, so apparently there are not as many tweaks required.
5	1394236800	Could not make HR Block program work for part time resident status. Moved during 2013. Tried TurboTax and had  absolutely no problems with part time residency and multilple W2s with different State addresses. Imported all the pertinent HR Block data from past years. Very polished program. Will never go back to HR Block. Efiled Fed and 2 states - no problems. Did not use Bonus refund offer from Amazon on gift card.  Turbo Tax cost a few dollars more but is well worth it!
3	1394150400	i am a long term user of Quicken and Turbo Tax and will admit that I am not a big fan but just have not found a good alternative.  My issue with Turbo Tax is in importing data correctly (even when coded properly in Quicken) and the software is not backwards compatible if you need to do an amended return.
5	1394150400	My family uses this every day. Turbo tax even saves your info so that the following year, your taxes can be done in 15 minutes if there are no changes. And they guarantee it.
4	1394150400	I have been using Turbo Tax now for many years. I really have no complaints. The user interface has gotten easier to use,  notably with its importing features and ability to carry forward previous return data.
5	1394150400	I purchase this every year to do my taxes.  The directions are easy to follow and I can do my taxes in the comfort of my own home from start to finish.
5	1394150400	used it for years, always quick and simple. I don't understand why I can't sell my used copy.  Nobody wants it, and ebay says it is against copyright to resell it.  ???
5	1394150400	I've used this product for the past 5 years. I use to save money and used TAXCUT but ended up paying everytime due to small problems or just difficulty in the app. TurboTax is FAR easier to use. It's worth paying the $10 extra for less problems.
5	1394150400	Easy to use and easy to understand. I love the product and will use it again nest year. Helped me get a bigger refund.
4	1394150400	Would have given 5 stars except it was difficult to choose e-file for federal and snail mail for state. The fees for state e-mail (NJ) are exorbitant. I couldn't see where I could choose separate methods. I had to go back after e-filing the federal and change to mail.It then instructed me that I couldn't file the fed via regular mail because I had already filed via e-mail, but it then allowed regular mail for the state..
4	1394150400	TurboTax works well for my needs.  It coulod be better at getting from input type to input type. The way I use it I have to go from grouping to grouping to get from start to finish.  There times when I only want to edit a grouping then finish.
5	1394150400	The Software is really easy to use, I had been using Turbo Tax for year and always deliver great user friendly experience, last year some forms get delayed and was a little pain in the neck track down those but beside that good software
5	1394150400	No problem with the product this time, as it did the job that was expected and required for Tax Year 2013.
5	1394150400	I have used turbo tax for the past 5 years and it has always gotten me the maximum refund. The program is very easy to use and the online support is there if you need it. I will continue to use turbo tax in the future.
5	1394150400	Very user friendly and I felt safe using it because the software review tax before you send to IRS satisfied
5	1394064000	I love Turbo Tax software.  I have been using it for over 15 years.  Step-by-step instructions make it easy to enter what's needed.  The forums help answer all your questions. I used a tax preparer once, after moving, selling our house & starting new job.... I thought it was too much for me.  As we sat in his office, we watched him input all our info into - Turbo Tax! The Delux version covers all our needs, plus some. Can't say enough about it - definitely 5 stars!!
5	1394064000	This is about the 6th or 7th year in a row that I've used TurboTax, and it continues to be an easy way to file your taxes.
5	1394064000	My 10th year of using the product.  Works great.  Easy to use.  Have confidence in its' ability to compute my tax liability accurately.
5	1394064000	It was easy to use and a great way to do my taxes cheaper than paying someone else to do them.  Walked me through every question and explained what I had questions on or didn't understand.  Would definitely use again
2	1394064000	The programmers at Intuit should review how to fill out Federal Form &#34;Schedule E&#34; for Royalties.  The current software really sucks, since it is almost impossible to include the descripton of more than one property.I most lickly will not purchase Tax Cut next year.
1	1394064000	I filed my taxes with TurboTax from the beginning - 2006. I was hoping for great things this year, again.TurboTax used to be great. Now it stinks. Does not handle a pretty basic return, I cannot enter data into the Deductions side of either the easy-step or forms based entries. As to customer service, they have always been terrible, now they are useless. The rep I spoke with had NO ABILITIES with my Operating System (Mac OS X 10.9.2) or machine at all. Her procedures were all about... &#34;Hold on while I research the problem... (20 minutes later)... Let's try this...&#34; We got nowhere. Now it's time for me to cut the cord between Intuit and my taxes. Tried for a positive experience, got bad karma from Intuit (a la Quicken in the distant past)Never again TT, I'm outta here. DO NOT BUY! I only gave it one star to file the rating, it doesn't deserve a  star.
3	1394064000	but still not as good as it should be.  Import from brokers and quicken does not work well.  What is up with that?  Quicken is another intuit product (which I give 0 stars...).  Export from brokers using their tools and import to TurboTax seems to work well.
4	1394064000	I have used Turbo-Tax for about 15 years.  It does a great job.  It makes filing taxes a breeze,  Why would you pay someone many dollars more to do what Turbo-Tax does?  E-file is also great.  You'll like Turbo-Tax!
4	1394064000	What can you really about Turbo Tax.  The program is made to make it easy to do your own taxes.
4	1394064000	After finding out that H&R; Block software erroneously counted my parents' Roth IRA distribution as taxable income, I decided to redo my and my parents' taxes with TurboTax as a comparison. Here is what I noticed.Pros:Correctly counted the Roth IRA distribution as non-taxable income.Gave my tax return the same tax refund amount as H&R; Block software with a caveat, see below.Didn't require a key to be entered, but I did not file my taxes with this so I can not speak to the filing process.Gives a nice summary towards the end of what is and isn't taxable income, H&R; does not.Reads H&R; Block and TaxAct files from the previous year.Comes in a nice DVD type case and sleeve instead of just an envelope with a registration code card in frustration free packaging. I prefer a case because I paid good money for the item.Cons:Even though I itemized last year, the software kept claiming that I did not and recommended that I select standard deduction for last year, which would have erroneously omitted my state tax refund last year as non-taxable income. And it said it was rare for someone to itemize, which is BS. I have mortgage interest, I itemize to get the maximum refund. So I wonder how compatible it really is with reading H&R; files.More expensive than H&R; Block.Took a lot longer to install.Takes a lot longer to launch.Repetitive questioning of 1099-R entries even though I've already entered zero for the fields just as in the 1099-R. This may be a safe guard but I found it to be very annoying.Have to scroll through income and deduction section to continue since I chose to go through every section of entry. H&R; Block goes from page to page without having to scroll to the bottom to hit the Continue button. They could put the button at the top of the page instead and reverse the list so the last completed section was at the top. Then it would be far superior to H&R; Block's design of having a GoTo button.Roll over IRA was counted as total income in the summary, which should not be, giving my parents an enormous amount of &#34;total income&#34; for the year, which is bogus.But the real deal is in the accuracy of calculating a tax refund. So this will be the software I will use next year. For my straight forward return (W-2, 1099-INT, mortgage, charity), H&R; Block would suffice, but with reservations. If my return becomes complicated, then I would definitely not use H&R; Block. As with any software package, you have to be aware of what you are doing and be aware of the result that it gives you in the end to ensure that it actually makes sense.Interestingly, both software packages claimed my parents qualified for the senior circuit breaker credit, if the Roth IRA distribution was correctly omitted as taxable income, while AARP did not.
5	1394064000	I have used TurboTax since 2008.  I have always been pleased with its ease of use and the comprehensiveness.  Just answer the questions, enter the figures, and TurboTax puts everything in the proper IRS form or worksheet.  Working with this software is the only pleasing part of doing my taxes!
5	1394064000	Turbo Tax has been my choice of tax prep software for many years now. I have tried others that were usually priced $10 to $20 less but found that software never really met my needs. Having been audited before I am a firm believer in doing tax prep right the first time.
4	1394064000	I received a refund but was double dipped on the processing fee. I'm OK with that but I don't like it. Intuit has never done that to me in the past.
2	1394064000	The software is great and does a nice job leading you all thru the return, but once you get to the Federal tax return portion, beware.I was shocked to learn that to get my refund electronically sent to my bank account, there is a $29.99 fee tacked on by TurboTax. The State e-file and return system is a rip-off (one free e-file per disk license?) $19.99, but to get charged $29.99 after paying $49.99 for the Deluxe version, now that is a rip-off.It looks like the snail-mail process is the way to go, along with the Feds mailing a paper check and the state (VA) mailing a gift card that has additional fees to redeem.I did not take advantage of the refund bonus offer; I was too upset over the refund fee. I felt like I was taking my paycheck to a check-cashing window and getting charged the fee for cashing it there.The only reason that I rated this review for two stars is because of the ease of use of the tax software and Intuit's &#34;It's Deductible&#34; online charity calculation software. Otherwise, this is very disappointing.
4	1394064000	I never seem to have a problem with Turbo Tax.  It always helps me get my taxes done quickly, but mine aren't incredibly complicated.  It does come with the free filings for federal, but you still have to pay $19.95 processing on top of that to file your state taxes electronically.  I think the cost of the product should cover all of that without additional charges.
1	1394064000	I spent hours trying to get a patch from Turbotax which would allow this s/w to load into my PC.Many had this problem.Not why I spend $50.
5	1394064000	I have used Turbotax for several years and think it is the best one available.  It transfers inform from,the previous year and provides reminders if a for if missed.  It also provides automatic downloads for income and investment products from the product's source.
1	1394064000	I returned this program which apparently had a software glitch that produced figures that were obviously wrong and easily proven so with a calculator. I have used TurboTax previously  but no longer trust it.
4	1394064000	Software worked great. Been using it for years. The bonus of an Amazon gift card blocked my ability to efile. I had to go back and refuse the offer - and then was able to efile successfully.
5	1394064000	I have used Turbo Tax for many years. It makes taxes simple and is very reliable.I would recommend to anyone.
5	1394064000	I have been using this version of TurboTax for many years.  I absolutely love it.  I tried using the free online forms from Intuit and other companies.  You don;t get all of the features and it just frustrated me.  I went back to this PC version and I'm totally satisfied.  Great price here on Amazon too.
5	1394064000	Fast, clear, felt like you were talking with a friendly, patient person.  So easy to install and to use.  Note that it does inform you that you may have state online filing fees, my husband was surprised by that since I bought the product.
3	1394064000	The "Amazon Refund Bonus Offer" did not show up in the software.  It seems like almost every year there is some sort of problem with this software.  It frequently seems to takes a couple of more hours than it should to get the job done.  I figured out that problem was due to a web browsers "popup blocker" even though I wasn't using a web browser (be aware). Evidently, they only wanted the special offer to "pop-up" for certain customers. Maybe this feature should have been implemented differently (do you hear me Intuit--this cost me several hours)?
5	1394064000	As a long-time user of TurboTax, I find that each year it becomes a little easier to use.  Although I know (or think I know) what I need to enter and where, I use the full guided walk-through so I don't overlook anything.This year was painless again.If you don't have any complicated tax issues, the Deluxe version gets you everything you need for Federal and one State filing, which meets our needs exactly.
4	1393977600	A great DYI approach to tax prep.  Most situations are covered.  In the unlikely event you need one-on-one consultation, don't bother trying to get it.  No expert or &#34;community&#34; consultant is likely to reply to your inquiry; there are several tel numbers listed but all of them entail significant fees to use.  TT is probably the best of its kind but that doesn't make it perfect.  And. initial purchase is steep and getting worse as the years pass.
5	1393977600	I've used this for years --it does the job every year -- easy to use, easy to understand.  And Its Deductible for charitable non-cash donations is terrific.
5	1393977600	I've been using it for years and will continue to do so. Cheaper the HR B???? or the other guys.
5	1393977600	Easy to use.From time to time I've tried other tax programs but keep coming back to Turbo tax.I think it's the easiest to use and understand and you don't have to put in the same information year to year. It will seek out the previous year's return on your hard drive and copy a lot of personal information to the current year form. Neat.
5	1393977600	For the person that likes to stay in control of their finances, this is a perfect tool to keep in your toolbox. Stays up to date on changes in the tax code, and makes error free tax filing a breeze!
5	1393977600	this product stands on its own always has always will I will continue to keep using every year as it is dependable and easy
5	1393977600	I always file my tax returns with Turbotax. Its very easy & in understandable language. it helps you maximize your deduction.I love it.
5	1393977600	I have used Turbo since 1984.  Never disappointed.  It is intuitive and easy to use.  Wouldn't consider another tax prep.
5	1393977600	Yet again done by feb 1st and cash in my pocket, thanks Turbo tax. You have never let me down and I will use you again next year!
5	1393977600	i'VE USED TURBO TAX FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW  AND FIND THAT IT COVERS EVERYTHING IN A VERY SIMPLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE WAY.  WHILE COVERING SUBJECTS THAT I WOULD HAVE CLEARLY MISSED WITHOUT THE PROGRAM. I DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
5	1393977600	Have used this product for a number of years and will continue to use.  Easy to use and guides you through the process.
5	1393891200	We have used this product for 10  yeRs.  Much cheaper than having someone else do it.  You won't regret it
2	1393891200	The product worked great.  I have a fairly complex return and Turbo Tax handled it great.  I bought this version because it said the efile was free.  What they don't tell you is that you have to pay extra to file your State efile and if you pay for it through Turbo Tax you also have to buy your Turbo Tax for next years taxes.  I was not happy with this!
5	1393891200	Loved using this....already have my tax money back plus the refund bonus that really was a nice surprise.  Thanks so much!  This was great!  Do this every year and I will always be your repeat customer!
4	1393891200	This is the 6th year I have used Turbo tax toprepare Federal taxes and the 3rd for state. I would lk an optionto take standard deduction rather than go through the questions to end up taking standard deduction.
4	1393891200	I've used Turbo tax for over a decade now and it is the software for me when preparing my taxes. I don't require a lot of attention when filling out and filing my taxes and it give me confidence that my taxes are complete to a point that I  won't have problems or a backlash from the IRS. It seems to be current on the tax laws regardless to when you use the software because it is updated every time you open the software to use it and I've recommended it to my siblings and practically everyone that I feel want help in filling out and filing their taxes. It not only saves money because you don't have to rely on a high price professional to help you with filing your taxes but it also saves time. I have to admit that the software doesn't have all the answers and isn't completely thorough so there is some knowledge required by the user as to what is allowed and what isn't. I've never used or required the use of the &#34;help&#34; feature of the software because my situation isn't that complicated. It is a pretty good software to use and I can't compare it to any of the other softwares because I haven't used any of the others out there.
5	1393891200	I have been using turbo tax for over ten years now and I love the speed and convenience.  It is actually fun to do my taxes because of the little windows that show a running tally of what I am getting back for both federal and state returns.
4	1393891200	I like turbo tax. always have.  Will probably continue to order it.  I don't like you have to write comments, I think the stars say it all.
5	1393891200	I like the software use it every year, has everything to do my taxes and free Efile and  very fast return
5	1393891200	Love how it retrieves prior year information resident on your computer and populates into current year return.  As a corporate tax attorney, I recommend to all my friends who want to use a software application and don't have complex issues that require professional guidance.
5	1393891200	This was first year for social security and was used to 1040ez.  This step by step program was terrific for new financials for state and federal.  I did not choose e-file but print filing is great
1	1393891200	I have dividend payments reported on the 1099-DIV issued by my broker. However, Turbo Tax doesn't handle it correctly. It expects a single country for the 1099-DIV form and in the &#34;Deductions & Credits&#34; section, it goes into a loop as I want to enter all the countries.I tried to talk to tech support but they can't do anything about it. What a waste.
4	1393891200	My federal and state taxes were difficult due to the fact that I retired in 2013 and had income from my employer, social security and my state pension. Turbo Tax asked me a few questions and as a result I had my federal and state taxes completed in a few hours.  Turbo Tax allowed me to file electronically and my refunds were deposited in my bank account within four weeks.
3	1393891200	I have been a fan for years with Turbo Tax.  However, it seems to be getting just like H&R with giving the feds the advantage over getting me my money.  Will more than likely go to a CPA next year to have a face to face with someone and find my avenues.
5	1393891200	The product is great. I finished my taxes in record time. The rebate offered stinks.  Intuit would not honor it.
2	1393804800	I love using turbo tax, it gets the job done in less time every year.  This year, I thought I'd take advantage of the 10% Amazon credit on my refund.  The taz filing process is easy, but at the end, a set of screens appears to ask how you'd like your refund.  One option is the Amazon credit with a 10% bonus.  The example displayed suggests adding $500 will get you a 10% bonus enabling Amazon credit of $550.  However, the next screen displays a slider graphic which allows you to select the dollars used for the Amazon offer vs. what will be directly refunded.  On my screen, the amount available amount of refund for the Amazon credit topped at only $200, less than half of my total refund.  The tool would not allow me to add any more.  Hence, for a offer that did not live up to the advertised level.  I say, buyer beware, and give it a 2 star rating
5	1393804800	I used it for over 15 years, I found it easy to use and I never had a problem with it.
5	1393804800	Has been valuable and trust worthy for many years.  No problems experienced by us.  Recommend it highly as a basic tax filing program.
5	1393804800	I've used TurboTax for many  years now. I feel Intuit is a very good company and produces good products. Recommend this program to anyone wishing to do their own taxes.
5	1393804800	I've used turbo tax for years.  I am a trained tax professional - so I switch to forms mode and just type in what I need.  Therefore, I can't comment on the questions and answer portion.  But it was fast and easy to download.  I didn't have to wait for a disk in the mail.  And I can just log into Amazon if I ever need to re-install - so searching for the disk I put away a year ago and can't find.  I'm happy.
4	1393804800	Tax preparation is not fun, but TurboTax makes it easy.  Being a user for many years, the process is very easy.  I simply import my tax return from last year, and then verify/change the new information.  This saves lots of time, and helps avoid forgetting accounts, income and deductions you had previously received.  I like the interview process as I simy have to answer yes/no questions in order to fill in or bypass a section.  The review at the end ensures I have not made a simple mistake.  I will recoomend this program year after year.
5	1393804800	Very helpful tool to be able to do my own taxes. Will purchase it again.next tax season. Reasonably priced. Thank you.
5	1393804800	Turbo Tax(TT) makes it easy.  I had moved 2013 , sold a house, moved into another.  TT took all that into consideration, so I can rest easy that my taxes are correct.  Also, had to do State income tax for 2013 for the first time.  There is no way I could have done it without TT .
5	1393804800	I have been using this program since when dinosaurs roomed the earth - It works!  I like not having to reenter data and its always fun to see enhancements - as a programmer I steal the good user interfaces.
5	1393804800	We do our own taxes and had them back in 1 1/2 weeks this year! Fast shipping from Amazon and TT is the way to go! I used to have my CPA brother-in-law do our taxes but I like keeping our personal business inside the home! I started doing our own taxes in 2005 (2003 & 2004 from him) and LOVE doing them!! Easy to use, step-by-step process and can not miss any details especially when doing itemized deductions! LOVE TurboTax (and Amazon) :)
1	1393804800	I worked four hours trying to complete everything step by step.  After this task, the product wanted me to do another form to compare the previous work.  My payments were twice the previous year's work from H&R Block, so I gave up and went back to H&R Block, which saved over $1,000 in payments.  TurboTax really did not work for me at all.  A complete waste of time and $54.
2	1393804800	The disk was difficult to load and when I finally got the program loaded it would not open.  It took several hours with Intuit support to download another program and get it working.  I have used TurboTax for years and this has never happened.  I hope it is just a &#34;one time thing&#34;.
4	1393804800	I have used TurboTax for many years and have allways found it very complete in walking through all the possibilities. I have not tried other S/W packages, so I can't rate TurboTax against them. However, like all S/W packages, they are only as good as what you &#34;feed&#34; them.For 2013, Intuit has added a &#34;come-on&#34; to get you to spend some of your refund on an Amazon card. My advise, don't do it. You end up supplying a lot of information to a third party bank. Intuit should stick  to doing taxes and stop trying to sell other &#34;stuff&#34;.
4	1393804800	I was able to get my taxes done quickly and accurately using Turbo Tax Deluxe. Deluxe is fine if you own a couple of investment properties. Price is very reasonable
5	1393804800	I've used Turbo Tax for many years and it's so easy to use I don't know why more people don't do their own tax returns.
1	1393804800	My copy did not work, contacted Turbo Tax instead of Amazon- a mistake
1	1393804800	you are forced to download other documents for $$&#8230; not worth it at all, check your local organizations USAA, AAA, for other options.
5	1393804800	Well, I've been using TT since 2007 and it's saved me many hundreds of dollars over the cost of having H&RB do them. It's very simple. Within 45 minutes I was done (it helps to have all your necessary docs organized). I used the Efile and I got my refund deposited into my bank account 8 days later (9 days earlier than the Fed site said it would take!) and my refund bonus offer was delivered via email the next day as well. Thanks Amazon and Turbo Tax! See you next year....
3	1393718400	I have been using TurboTax for many years.  This year's software was more difficult to understand and use than any of the past years.  I had to continually check for clarification of terms and what could or should be included in various area.
5	1393718400	As usual, this is again a great product.  Very easy to do your taxes.  Especially like the way it carries over details from the previous years
5	1393718400	I can't compare it to other tax software products, but I can say this is very simple to use, at least for me.  I do not use the step by step questions, I'm able to simply go to the lines I need to fill in the information.  I really like that you can download the 1099 information for investments instead of having to type it all in.  I only wish they would get rid of the &#34;smart worksheets&#34; when printing out the forms.  They used to have an option to turn them off, but not any more.  I especially like that it transfers all the information year to year so you don't waste a lot of time retyping names and addresses of w2's and 1099's.  Wish Intuit would give us at least one state electronic filing with the program...if you want to file your state on line through Turbo Tax it costs almost $20.  You can go to your states revenue website to file at no cost (just realize you'll have to retype all the information); or simply print out the state form from TurboTax for mailing (don't forget to sign it!).
5	1393718400	I have used Turbo Tax for years and feel its easy to use.  Very convenient knowing both Federal and State taxes can be done with the one product.
4	1393718400	Too bad it cant seem to get me a refund and even if it says free state filling , its not. Also be careful with the add on they tend to run up the cost of this filling process.
5	1393718400	This is a great product and I use it every year to file my taxes . I think it is even easier this year.
3	1393718400	Product description says it includes a free state, but when I try to download the state I am told I have to pay $39.99.UPDATE - I did get a free copy of the state.  There was a confusing link in the ONLINE menu of TurboTax; if you use that link, you get charged.  It seems the state is automatically downloaded as you do your taxes.
5	1393718400	Turbo Tax Deluxe....what more can I say other than I love it !  I've been using Turbo Tax Deluxe since 1999 and it's made doing my taxes much quicker and easier.  I've never had any sort of problem and filing electronically gets things done quickly and effeciently.Prior to 1999 I had a CPA do my taxes and she had me fill out this big long form with all sorts of details she needed to know.  One day I thought to myself, hey, by the time I fill out this big long form and organize all my recepits/records, I might as well just fill out my taxes myself using Turbo Tax.  Once I'd done it the first time using Turbo Tax, I found it probably took me the same amount of time as filling out the CPA's form and sorting all my receipts before giving them to her.....and I saved $180.00 after paying for Tubro Tax and the state filing fee.
1	1393718400	I purchased turbo tax deluxe fed & state but turbo tax wants to bill me an additional funds for the state.  I do not believe I will ever buy turbo tax or any intuit product again.  If this is how they treat their customers I believe Amazon should investigate their proactces as my experience with all other Amazon purchases has been on a scale of 1 to 10 - A big 10 plus.
5	1393718400	As usual, Turbo Tax is easy to install and walk you through all the tax info that's required.  Very happy with this product, just wish the IRS/Congress, etc. would make taxes easier to file.
4	1393718400	Although I hate paying for tax processing, this is a good method.  Especially liked the bonus that was given making the price very good.
4	1393718400	I have been using this product to do my own taxes for the last 8 years now.Pretty easy to use,just answer the questions with your tax info and follow the steps to a hopeful refund! I only wish the state tax filing was free like the federal tax filing.
4	1393718400	Finally found the price under $40.00. I have been using Turbo Tax for years and I like how they improve it most years.I gave it a 4 Stars due to the shipping case had a broken spindle and the CD was sliding around in the case and took longer to load. I haven't installed it yet. I might check what the return/replacement time limit is and have them ship me a different one.Haven't found anything on the Refund Bonus Offer yet.
5	1393718400	My husband does our taxes every year and would not attempt it without Turbo Tax. It is very helpful and accurate
4	1393718400	TurboTax is easy to use and maximizes deductions and refunds. I have used this software for at least 10 years and keep coming back.
5	1393718400	I've been using this software for over 10 years and have never been disappointed with the results.I will definitely buy again.
5	1393718400	What can you say.  It works.  I have used Turbo Tax now for over 10-years and love it.  It is very helpful with its &#34;wale-you-through-it&#34; process.  I am certain it saves me tax money with its questions about my situation.
5	1393718400	Turbo Tax makes doing taxes so simple.  I always enjoy reading what other folks have asked and the answers.  I would have been done in one day had I stuck to it.
1	1393718400	I have been a big fan of TurboTax for a long time, but the software is very disappointing for the tax year 2013. Personally, I have found three major glitches, and I am not sure I can depend on TurboTax to correctly e-file my return. I have read (and heard) of many more glitches. When I called TurboTax, to find out if there would be an update to fix the problems, I was on hold for over an hour, before I gave up. When I attempted to contact them via chat, there was no response for over 45-minutes, and I disconnected.  I will find another way to complete my taxes this year.
5	1393718400	I've been using TurboTax for years.  It is very intuitive and has a question / answer type interface.  The program will prompt you and will let you know if what you are answering is an uncommon entry.Once you use TurboTax, you can load last year's tax return and it will let you see what you did last year.  At the end, it analysis your return, points out mistakes and takes you to the mistake for correction.  It also gives you a risk assessment for an audit.I file a few additional forms for unreimbursed expenses.  In the past I was not able to file electronically because of these additional forms.  The program said it was the IRS's rule.  This year I was able to file electronically.I mailed the State in because they want $20 to file this electronically.It took me about an hour to do my taxes and submit them.  I had a direct deposit refund in about 8 days... not bad.Now if Intuit could just get Quicken to work this well they would have a winning combination!!
5	1393718400	For years I paid someone to do my taxes and spent a lot of money doing so. However, I have been using TurboTax for about 20 years now & couldn't imagine paying someone else to do it for me.  TurboTax walks you through every step of the way until you are done with both preparing & filing.  The ability to file on line is really a great time saver.  Definitely recommend to someone who is currently paying someone to prepare the tax return for you, as it is fast & easy the TurboTax way.
4	1393718400	Federal return was completed and filed without problems. Federal refund was received in four days. Wisconsin refund was received in five days. I also need to file Minnesota taxes. Turbo Tax insists I need to complete an additional form which involves redoing the federal. I've checked the MN IRS website and I do not have to file that form. Otherwise, I would rate the product with five stars.
5	1393632000	After using the Amazon 10% bonus promo, I actually made $200 by applying $2k of my refund to Amazon store credit.As for the software itself, this is my 5th year using it and I don't think I'll ever go back to using the H&R; Block TaxCut competitor. TurboTax is easier, less buggy, faster, more intuitive, guarantees the highest refund, has available audit protection, and is actually cheaper as well. The 5 free E-files even allow some friends and family to do theirs for free. There's really no reason to use anything else, especially an overpriced tax preparer, which are known to be crooks.
5	1393632000	I'm a long time user of Turbo Tax and have come to rely on Amazon as my sole source for it.  They always have either the best price or at least as good as anyone else.  I would not use another product and would not get it from another source.
1	1393632000	Supposed to be given a 10% bonus offer on an Amazon card for Federal refund.  Went to file and TurboTax said I didn't qualify for one of several reasons listed, none of which were true. This is a promotion from a third party, but Amazon has a huge graphic splashed all over this TurboTax product page promoting the promotion -- and it's also in the product title -- so it's disingenuous for them to not have a say in how this promotion is administered.  Talked via chat with an Amazon rep, chat was very slow, and then the rep told me to call another Amazon division after having already being on chat for several minutes.  Seemed like a lot of work for a possible $27 refund bonus -- yeah, that's right my federal refund was whopping $270.  I asked her via chat to escalate it and she finally said ok, and then I was passed off to no one.  Much better to spend my time telling others: maybe don't count on the bonus.  A rare misfire from Amazon -- I am disappointed in the lack of transparency in this promotion and also the chat response.
4	1393632000	Have used Turbo Tax for years.  Would be hard pressed to use anything else, now. Easy to use, up to date and accurate
5	1393632000	FAIRLY EASY AS LONG AS YOU KNOW YOUR TAX SITUATION AND HOW IT PERTAINS TO EACH TURBO TAX QUESTION. HAVE USED TURBO TAX FOR PAST 12 YRS. WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
3	1393632000	I've successfully and happily used TurboTax for the Mac since the 2004 tax year. Its strength and ease of use have been consistent during all of that time.This year, I happily went through the usual process. I appreciate the convenience of e-filing my federal return at no extra cost, but chose not to do so with my state return because of the cost. This has always been a simple process -- after e-filing the federal, it walked me through printing to file the state return.This year, after wrestling with a failed federal transmission and going to the help site to figure out what was missing (to no avail), I figured out on my own that the PIN selection process had hung things up. I successfully re-did the filing, and the program thanked me for filing the federal return.Then, no state filing walk-through was offered. I had to rifle through the help site to figure out how to do this using the printing drop-downs. The un-intuitive process was highly frustrating for me -- and I've been successfully using technical computer programs since learning FORTRAN-IV in college.This year I was disappointed with TurboTax, and will investigate alternatives for next year. Although I likely will stick with TurboTax, my opinion of the program is diminished.
4	1393632000	TurboTax is easy to understand, and I've been using the product successfully for many years and have never had any problems.
2	1393632000	I've used Turbo Tax a long time and the product is good.  However, I've grow more disenchanted overtime with the marketing and intrusive nature of the software (example: the Keep up to date with the law nagging screen every time you start the software with no way to stop it other than fill out the form). They seem to be less of a company to trust more and more. This year was pretty much the last straw for me though.  The 10% bonus gift card goes through a bank Sunrise Banks.  Search around the internet for this deal and Sunrise Banks.  It is enough that I have decided not to use this offer.  I question if I will come back to TurboTax anymore.  I've used Taxcut as well before and it is a good solution.  Perhaps that will make a better choice next year.Shame on you Intuit.  The things companies will do for that extra dollar.
5	1393632000	I always did my taxes myself and finally I decided to spend the money for Turbo Tax to make filing taxes a little easier.  It made it a lot easier!  Granted my return is not extremely complicated but it forced me to review all the possibilities and did all the calculations.  I had a little issue filing electronically until I figured out you needed a new IRS exiling PIN number each year.  I received the federal tax return within two weeks and the state two weeks after that.  Another year done just like that!
5	1393632000	I've been using an accountant to get my taxes done. This year - I bought this product and realized that my accountant perhaps uses the same program and instead of paying $300, I paid $40. Not discounting what professionals do, I thought this software was intuitive enough that if you understand the tutorials, you'll be able to do it yourself.
5	1393545600	It was and is a great product and it helped my wife and I file our taxes in the best way possible!
4	1393545600	It is an income tax program....not a fun item.  But it is clear and thorough and as good as this kind of thing gets.
5	1393545600	I purchased this. It is my first time using software doing tax return to e-file. Previously I did them all myself and send the tax return my mail. This year, I want to try something different. The process is easy. The installation is fast, with some extra update. Everything is easy and straight forward. The software will ask a lot of questions, you only have to answer those questions. I get my refund in a week, which is much better than mailing the tax return. The best part is that you can get 10% bonus Amazon gift card with your tax refund money. I purchase a lot with Amazon. If you use 500$ of your tax return for Amazon gift cards, you get 50$ bonus gift card, which basically means that the software is better than free.
3	1393545600	I use TurboTax almost every year. This year they are very misleading when it comes to the state filing. They do not tell you that you will have to fill out the state whether you want to or not. They increased the price of filing state and if you do not efile state right away, when you go back the price is higher. I chatted with their support and was told that the offer expired. No where was this indicated when filling out the state form. Needless to say, I will not recommend based on this situation.
4	1393545600	not perfect but they have to make it fit nearly every one.  appreciate their revue and cross check.  helpful to remind you of what you did last year
2	1393545600	Where to start?? It failed to import all of my data from my 2012 return. It could not import 2013 data from Paychex or my bank. It incorrectly said I used the standard deduction vice itemized which would have incorrectly made my state tax refund nontaxable. You can't cut and paste text from previous year tax forms - neither right click or control V works. How lame.So far not getting many of the advertised benefits of this software. I have used tax software for the last 10 years so it is not a rookie error situation. I jump between Block and Intuit depending on reviews and prices and am really not loving this version at all!
5	1393545600	I have been using TurboTax for many years.  One year I tried a different one and didn't like it.  TurboTax is easy to use. All I do is answer the questions and fill in the numbers.  The best part is by reading the questions, I learn more about what is and what is not taxable.
5	1393545600	Bonehead's in politicians and the leadership of this country can't figure out a budget and the IRS continues to take our hard earned money!!
4	1393545600	I buy this every year, and import my last years information to make completing this tax software easy.  Has detailed descriptions of all entries, data completeness verification, and on-line help if necessary.  For relatively simple tax filing it is all that you need, but if you have more complex tax situations such as owning rental property, or other complex items you may want to consider the premium.
5	1393545600	I have been using this software for years and it keeps getting easier each year.  Great saving with Amazon prime and the 10% as well.  Thank you Turbo Tax.
4	1393545600	Easy to use with an option to complete tax forms without need to follow the script. Comprehensive error checking.  Well worth it if you are comfortable filing your own taxes.
4	1393545600	This is the perfect software for doing my taxes, I just need to still actually sit down and do them!
5	1393545600	THIS IS A GREAT SOFTWARE PROGRAM. VERY EASY TO USE AND I LIKE THE CHARITY PRICE CHART THAT COMES IN THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE.
4	1393545600	The program was really easy to follow. I had a railroad question. Once submitting the question, I had an aswer within the hour.
2	1393545600	It said the state e-file was included but I had to pay $20.00 at the end to file the state return.
5	1393545600	Federal and State Taxes befuddle me. Too many rules, requirements and documents make filing my tax report a sitting duck for the IRS to take advantage of my lack of expertise in these financial booby traps. Turbo Tax guides me thru these financial mine fields and helps me to correctly resolve my government obligations.Without Turbo Tax, I would probably have to pay for professional tax preparation or pay the IRS due to my lack of knowledge about their reporting requirements.
5	1393545600	Easy steps plus able to import previous years tax info. This year there was an option for using the EIN to auto-populate the W2 info...awesome!
5	1393545600	Finished my taxes and filed in less than two hours. Best Prior time was 4 hours. Turbo Tax loaded quickly on my Mac Pro and updated in less than 8 minutes. Great tax software
4	1393545600	It's getting easier and easier to prepare taxes because it uses previous years returns as a guide.  Only problem is I have to pay, but that's not TurboTax's fault.
4	1393459200	This edition of Turbotax lacked several help screens. There was a message stating that help would be added at a later upgrade.Other than that, I think I did pretty well with my taxes. I filed them in late February.
5	1393459200	As long as I keep getting tax refunds, I will continue giving turbo tax 5 stars. Straight forward, fill in the blanks.
4	1393459200	Good Product, Been using it for Years. Very user friendly. I would recommend you buy it. You will like it.
2	1393459200	I have used Turbo Tax for years and never had any problems.  This year after computing taxes it would not print.  Tried every option possible.  Tried saving it different ways and even tried sending it to a different computer to print but still nothing worked.  Very frustrated.  Got on-line and noticed that many others are having the same problem.  Please fix it for next year!!!

5	1393459200	Easy and fast step by step threw the process of filing taxes use it every year.  Love e file returns
5	1393459200	Buy it and you'll never go back to your CPA. Easy to use and timely for tax season. Get it before April 15th.
5	1393459200	This is an annual expensive that saves me money in the long run.  TurboTax gets easier to use every year and keeps paces with all the state and federal changes.
5	1393459200	Been using Turbo Tax for yrs now, love it!  They break it down and make it so easy to use.
5	1393459200	I have been using Turbo Tax for well over 10 Years and it works well and is easy to use.
5	1393459200	I have used Turbo Tax for several years now and plan to keep using it.  Easy to follow instructions.  I love the fact I can do my taxes at home at my convenience.
5	1393459200	I use Turbo Tax every year, and get a refund the majority of the time. I will continue to use it.
5	1393459200	Turbo tax was first recommended to me by a CPA.  I have used turbo tax for many years.  I have learned how to run thru it quickly and efficiently.  Updates do go by the laws of the land and Hawaii laws change frequently.
3	1393459200	I've used Turbotax for the past 15 years.  The product does a good job of guiding you in their interview mode but you spend lots of time answering &#34;no&#34; to seldom used forms.What has been grating on me is how difficult they have made entering charitable deductions.  Here are my two examples:1. California allows you to make donations to specific charities when you file your taxes.  However, Turbotax does not recognize these when it grabs data from your prior year's forms. They grab other general and tax related data but not donations.This is not new but a &#34;feature&#34; they've had since I began using the product.2.  I receive Form 8283 for Noncash contributions (stock) and I have to enter by hand every single transaction that is covered on the IRS form PLUS additional information that is not needed by the IRS. You can not download the contents. You are forced into a cumbersome data entry process.  I spend more time on this section than any other.Why do they do this - simple: To encourage you to buy Its Deductible from them.  This self-interest will direct me to a competitor for next year.  Most competitors have as good reliability and are cheaper.
4	1393459200	Two evenings with the software and I saved $375 for a CPA. Now if TT would only also file my State tax as part of the package (and not charge an extra $20), it would be a five star package.
5	1393459200	Great rpoduct-very user friendly. Very thorough tax wise.  Have used this product for years and will continue to do so.
1	1393459200	I am very computer literate. I finished my taxes and was going to review the info later in the day before submission. When I clicked on the desktop icon it brought up the program as if I was using it for the first time ! I went back in to look for my return, I had saved it a few times before, and it was gone. This includes my state return. I sent 2 emails to Turbo Tax 4 days ago with no response. There was a question on the TurboTax website forum asking the same question as mine, what happened to my return ? but it was 17 days old, at that time, and unanswered. Next year I will go back to Tax Cut. I have to reenter all my info again.
4	1393459200	I have used it several years and as far as I know it gives me a accurate refund. What I don't like is the way they put it on sale after many  people have their tax's done. This year I feel I got ripped off for $20.00
5	1393459200	Delivered in two days with Prime. Turbo Tax works as it always has since I started using it 15 years ago. Easy interface & fast refunds.
5	1393459200	I was very pleased with my TurboTax software. The software is self-explanatory and is very easy to use. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to prepare their own income taxes.
5	1393459200	always has been the best, tried block one year, it wouldn't import previous tax year info. yada yada yada yada
5	1393372800	I have used this product for years and love it - very easy to use - guides you through the whole process.
5	1393372800	I have used turbo tax for years and it becomes easier to use..Highly recommend this product.  Priced right ready to use..
5	1393372800	Every year I use this for the last 18 yes or so. It's keeps getting better. The new apps help. Can't complain
4	1393372800	Turbo Tax is pretty good. Have used it several years. Received our refund in 8 days. A bit expensive but still a decent program.
1	1393372800	I purchased this product after reading the positive reviews. In past years, I have switched between TurboTax to H&R Block's software with no problems, easily importing my tax information from previous years. I used TurboTax to file my taxes in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010; I used H&R Block&#8217;s program in 2003, 2004, 2009, 2011 and 2012. When I installed TurboTax 2013 Deluxe on my computer this year, I was surprised to find that I was unable to import any information from last year&#8217;s taxes. I called and spoke with an Intuit representative, who informed me that imports from H&R Block&#8217;s software are no longer supported on Mac computers. The program is still usable on Mac computers, but all tax information must be entered manually. Because I have a complex tax situation with multiple schedules, retyping everything manually is simply not a good option. I mention this issue in the hope that it will keep someone else from having the same problem as I did. I am disappointed in TurboTax as a program and Intuit as a company.
5	1393372800	Use turbo tax every year and have never had a problem. It is very easy to use if you follow the directions.
1	1393372800	Would not use again.  Kept getting error messages and was told they were waiting to install a patch to correct the software.  Ended up not being able to file electronically and had to file paper.  Customer service was not helpful. took multiple phone calls and was cut off twice.  Ended up not getting being able to get the gift card deal as well.
5	1393372800	TurboTax is easy to use.  Just answer the questions and in about 30 minutes you're through.  The best thing is that next year your data from is automatically imported saving even more time.  I always buy my copy from Amazon.  They are very competitive with their price.
5	1393286400	To anyone that does their taxes old school way. Or for a person who is not organized! I loved it
3	1393286400	Almost $60 extra if you want to file your federal and state return electronically without giving credit card info. Will consider other options for next year.
2	1393286400	Good software but what a joke. It says in includes state but when you go to file it wants your credit card. Why wouldn't they just charge what they charge up front. Why try to weasel all this money out of you after you have paid for the software.
4	1393286400	I've been using TurboTax for many years now.  The interface has improved quite a bit.  In the past, I found myself 'searching' for a form separately, to complete it.  I didn't have to do that this time.
4	1393286400	After I calculated my taxes, I did not qualify for the Amazon gift card. Tax refund has to be $195 more than the amount of the requested Gift Card (which has to be in $100 increments).I would have read the fine print, but there wasn't any when I purchased Turbo Tax from Amazon.
5	1393286400	You can pay $200 to go to H&R block and will spend more time doing your taxes than if you pay $50 here and do your taxes on your own.  Plus you own the software, so it can be used by more than one person.  A total no-brainer.
5	1393286400	I have been using turbo tax for a long time now, and really like the format.  It makes doing your taxes easy.
5	1393286400	Well it is great  Already got my efile refund  Just keep on  using  it and help others to  file.  Hope everyone uses it.
1	1393286400	I ordered TurboTax Deluxe on CD from Amazon.  The CD was at my door in the two day shipping time since I'm a PRIME member.  No issues with receiving the CD.However, I completed my taxes and was ready to file.  No option came up as described in the FAQs.  I contacted Amazon, they sent me to Intuit.  I attempted a chat session.  Chat session told me to call.  I waited on hold for 15 minutes was finally talking to someone and they disconnected the call.  I called back, waited on hold for 30 minutes. I finally found out that the Amazon card offer is only available through the Intuit Website.  So, I have to do my taxes all over again ONLINE on the Intuit site to actually receive the bonus offer.I still don't know if this actually works.  Save yourself the hassle and use different tax software.
5	1393286400	I've been doing my own taxes with TurboTax for the past several years and this edition is just as user friendly and helpful as previous years. If you're looking to do your own taxes I highly recommend TurboTax.
4	1393286400	I love Turbo Tax and have been using it for 5 years.  It is a program that anyone can follow.  Turbo Tax works for me.
5	1393286400	This software arrived within one day.  The software is easy to follow. I did my tax return within a few hours. Great product!
4	1393286400	i have been using turbo tax for many years. almost every year things go smooth. very convenient way to do your taxes.
5	1393286400	I've use TurboTax for more than 10 years. It has been great (well as great as doing taxes can be). I really liked getting part of my refund back (with a 10% bonus) as an Amazon gift card.
5	1393286400	Use Turbo Tax every year and it works great and fast.  I would recommend this for all with mortgage interest to file, etc.
5	1393286400	It's so easy to use. And it's fast with the &#34; importing&#34; application.  I would recommend this tax preparation software to anyone preparing Federal and/or state returns!
5	1393286400	I used this for the first time this year and I have to say that I was impressed with how easy it was to use. I spent about 60 dollars total to file my taxes this year versus spending 350 dollars in previous years using a service. I love that everything is explained in details you can understand as a regular person. I will deffinately be using Turbo Tax from now on.
1	1393286400	This specific CD did not download on a MAC or HP.  It cannot be returned, so I paid $50 for a product that did not work.  Ended up going to Office Depot and getting the same thing for the same price.  Pretty much paid 100$ for one TruboTax.
5	1393286400	This is my 7th year using TurboTax for filing both my Federal and State tax returns.  I love the free e-filing that is included with federal filing, and also opt to e-file my state as well.  Only area I wish was different was to include free state e-filing along with federal (for same price) instead of charging additional funds for state e-filing.  Otherwise, I plan on using TurboTax every year for filing taxes!
5	1393286400	I have been using this tax software for several years. It is very easy to use in that it transfers previous years information. It actually asks a series of questions to get you to enter the needed information.
2	1393286400	capital gains doubleddoing download from Merrill, checked with their technical support, no errors on their end.file imported into TT with no errors. Capital gains are too high. Each capital gain is reported on 8949 AND 1099-B, making the figures too high and the total capital gains reported on the Schedule D, 2X the amount it should be.1099-b, technical19.99 state e-file has been done to death. We have to pay NY State to e-file, paying the tax SW firm for the right to make an e-File too is too much.I was looking forward to the 10%, federal refund part, sounds complicated, is there a webpage with complete directions for this ?
5	1393286400	Excellent product have already filed two returns which have been accepted have utilized it for 7 years with excellent results
5	1393200000	We like everything about it.  We are far from money experts,  but this is pretty cut and dry.  There are a few items that we have to read over a number of times before were sure of what we're doing.  It takes transfers things from fed to state for you and also anything pertinent from the previous year.
4	1393200000	Good product overall but some typos - real instead of real estate tax.  Nickel and dime you over multiple states and efilings.  Prompt response on efilings acceptance.
5	1393200000	Evan thou I hate tax time I have been using turbo tax for many years and it is the best and cheapest way to do your own taxes!
5	1393200000	Good software with all updates to tax code and easy to use for any tax preparer.  I would buy it again and have used it for past 5 years.
4	1393200000	I've used turbo tax for the last 6 years and found it easy to follow. However, this year some of the forms were not ready and had to wait for it to be downloaded. After receiving a e-mail that the forms were ready and committing to e-file I found out that the form I needed was not available yet. I would still recommend using turbo tax for maximum refund.
5	1393200000	No need to pay high prices for someone to do what you can easily do with Turbo Tax software. Easy to follow and e-file. The only tax program I use.
5	1393200000	Have used Turbo Tax for years and have always been pleased.  Has some areas this year that are not as easily navigated but overall is great.
3	1393200000	This is my fifth year of using this product and have always been satisfied. First I was unable to find last years tax return, had to type in all the information again.This year I finally completed my taxes but there were a  few glitches. First it kept telling me that the script was not right. That finally went away but do not know what caused it. Next when I was ready to file my Federal and State, I recieved a notice that they were rejected after doing a final check. I find out that two numbers in my social security were filed wrong but when I checked my printed form, they were correct. I don't know what caused this. It made me very upset. I will still continue using it but hope this doesn't happen again.
1	1393200000	TurboTax failed to pick up errors making it necessary to file an amended form.  I have use this product for years but they seem to be asking for information in a different way and it is harder to answer their format questions.I will no longer recommend this way to file taxes.
5	1393200000	This is the third year I've used Turbo Tax DeluxeIt is easy to use, has the latest revisionsTop refund amountI recommend it
4	1393200000	Very easy to use and the extra 10% for the Amazon.com gift card was sent as soon as my refund was processed by the IRS.
5	1393200000	We always use Turbotax to do our refunds .  We  filed  our taxes online and in 7 days we had our refund from the Federal government.  .The state was a 20.00 fee  so we mailed it in not being in any hurry  to get it back.
1	1393200000	The Amazon gift card bonus program is falsely advertised as, "Use some (or all) of your federal refund to purchase an Amazon.com Gift Card and Turbotax will tack on more."  The actual truth is, you can't use the first $195 of your refund for that purpose.Updated 3/13/14: TurboTax is STILL advertising "Use any increment of $100 from your Federal Tax Return to purchase an Amazon.com Gift Card." Again, that is not true.I called TurboTax phone support and escalated the issue one level to a supervisor, who was condescending but offered me a $10 coupon on next year's product as compensation for their false advertising. Whoopee. And she did apologize. In all, I wasted 55 minutes on the phone, almost entirely on hold while they looked up their own policy, then hemmed and hawed. I am sorry I experimented with TurboTax this year and I will go back to H&R; Block next year.
4	1393200000	Been using Turbo Tax for 5 years.  Seems liek this one isn't quite as user friendly as past years.  When I answer that I don't want to provide information on usage of the software I shouldn't have to tell it thtat every time  start it.
5	1393200000	Everything is very clear.  It is very easy to use.  I voluntered for VITA and TCE programs for over 15 years and their software was not as user friendly as Turbo Tax.
4	1393200000	I have tried other tax prep software and have found TurboTax significantly better. I think you'll find it a real help with filing your taxes.
5	1393200000	I have used turbo for many years and have always felt it was a good handrail for walking me through the outrageously complex world of paying taxes. We should be ashamed that as citizens we have allowed things to get this bad that a product like turbo tax is needed !!
4	1393113600	the program did its job. It was fast and easy to use. I would recommend it to any one that wants to do there own taxes.
5	1393113600	Turbo Tax is an excellent software that easily guides you through the task of preparing taxes. I have tried other tax preparation software, and I believe Turbo Tax is the most user friendly and thorough. It also provides me with the most tax deductions and for the money is one heck of a buy. I have now used Turbo Tax for the last 9 years and will continue to use it in future tax year preparations.
4	1393113600	THis is my fifth year using turbotax. No problems noted. I'll continue to use this product in coming years. Nothing more to say.
5	1393113600	I have used this product for years.  Have never had a problem.  Really like the electronic filing for federal return.  Received my refund within two weeks.  Will definitely continue to use my tax needs.
5	1393113600	I have been using Tjurbo Tax since 2001 and have always had excellent results. I expect that this version will be just as good.
2	1393113600	Was NOT as user friendly as in years past. Ended up having to go back and correct my forms before e-filing because Turbo Tax mislabeled items (Thank GOD I checked the forms before sending them). And it no longer automatically checks for updates - you have to do that yourself - I found this out after I printed our return and everything came out with &#34;DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT APPROVED&#34; across the front of everything.TurboTax used to be so simple to use. I consider myself pretty smart when it comes to doing taxes, but I still liked the &#34;Taxes for Dummies&#34; way TurboTax used to handle everything. This year, it tried to guess at things, and it guessed wrong. Not all TurboTax users are going to be smart enough to go back and check the forms before filing. Their audit response team might be busy this year!
5	1393113600	Have used TurboTax for several years now......great product!  Since I am on up in years, I have had lots of experience filing the old-fashioned way (form filled out by hand) and I can say for sure that I wouldn't want to go back to the old way!
4	1393113600	Great tax software.The State version could be improved (Alabama).You need to carefully go back and make sure everything is covered correctly in the State version (although other State software may work better, particularly in the states which pattern their tax code after the Federal.
5	1393113600	I have heard for years that I should use turbo tax. Well I finally did and I'm glad I did.  It was so easy.  If you can read and answer questions you are good to go.
5	1393113600	Easy to install on my PC. Makes doing taxes easy. I've been using Turbo Tax for over 12 years and have never had any issues.
4	1393113600	It was quick and easy to use. The thing I didn't like was that if you wanted to ask almost any kind of a question if you were stuck, Turbo Tax wanted to charge you an additional amount. I was also unaware that you had to pay for e-file with the state. Overlook on my part, perhaps, but for any of you considering this product, now you know. Otherwise it was great and got my taxes back very fast!!
4	1393113600	We have been using turbo Tax for many years and it is good but not great.  It seems to be the  the best of its class but it is not without errors that have nothing to do with the impossible complexity of the tax code.
4	1393113600	Works good for Federal and Federal E-File.. Works good for state but state E-File has to be paid for after one is done.
5	1393113600	Having done taxes the old fashioned way, by hand, this is much easier and allows you to stop and return at a later time and pickup exactly where you left off.  It is much less expensive than having it prepared by someone else (that is most likely using software of their own).  I have used TT since early 2000's and have never had any problems with anything.I file my federal electronically and mail my state (saving $$$).  My federal & state returns are sent back via USPS saving even more $$$ for the cost of a few days mail time.
5	1393027200	I used to go to an accountant to have my taxes done.  One year I decided to purchase TurboTax and "redo" the tax return.  The result was exactly the same.  The program is very easy to use and very thorough.  It covers every possible scenario.  I especially like the chart showing the value of charitable items.  E-file is great...the IRS accepts my return within a day or two and the refund is processed much quicker.  I have used TurboTax ever since.
5	1393027200	Very easy, user friendly and you process your taxes with confidence. I have been using this site 2010 my only regret is that I have not used sooner.
3	1393027200	I have used turbo deluxe for years, but was disappointed this year.  Mostly in the Arkansas state tax program.  It classified my wife's IRA as not qualified which meant it would not get the 6000 deduction.  It also did not divide equally the dividend in our trust account.  Talking to the Turbo tax person for  hour did not solve the problem.  I went to forms and made the changes myself.  The federal tax program this year in finding out how to download information from our financial services was more difficult. .
5	1393027200	Have been doing our taxes with TurboTax for several years. The first year we used the product, we also had our taxes professionally prepared. The difference was only few Dollars. We've been preparing our own returns since.
5	1393027200	You have to pay your taxes so you might as well make it as easy as possible.  Over the years I have used TurboTax and have no complaints about the program.  It has gotten me through many tax issues.  I recommend this to anyone that fills out a 1040.
2	1393027200	I had completed and "saved" my return, there was an update and I was told I had to save.  So I selected save again.  After I restarted all my data was lost.  ALL my data was lost and I had to start again.If you want to save, you must use "Save As" and save over the existing file, if it exists.I have used Turbo Tax for years, but am unlikely to use it again.
3	1393027200	Still working on it. Some things don't seem quite correct.  I want to see finished 1040 before I send it in.  I am trying to figure how to print now.  It was easy entering information.
5	1393027200	Turbo Tax is fast and easy to use and I continue to use it every year. It is a product that takes most of the pain out of filing taxes.
5	1393027200	I buy this program every year to do my taxes and it walks me through easily every time.  I will continue to use this program
5	1393027200	This is the second year I have used Turbo Tax.  It is thorough, if you follow the directions. I do taxes for my children and grandchildren, and have not had a problem with this program.
5	1393027200	I have used Turbotax for years. I've tried other products but have tossed them and completed taxes with Turbotax.  It's a slog  to go through all the steps and some things aren't as clear as they might be but I feel confident with my taxes after I finish.
5	1393027200	got my taxes back fast well worth the price would buy it again a great way  to d your taxes
5	1393027200	I love Turbo Tax and Amazon had the best price I've ever been able to get the Deluxe version.  It is an annual purchase for me and works like a charm.
5	1393027200	I am very satisfied with my TurboTax software.  I have used it several times successfully.  Thank you for providing the software to me and others..
1	1393027200	CD version doesn't install correctly on Win 7 - takes hours just to install the program.  Don't buy the CD version
5	1393027200	We've purchased this for about ten years now. The product keeps getting better each year. The step-by-step instructions are clear and helpful. I like the automatic previous year entry, audit check and last year comparison features. It seems like a rip-off to pay for state tax downloading (it's cheaper for the states than mailing).
1	1393027200	I did not receive the correct product.  Upon installing, which is not working properly at all, it appears that I have been sent a Turbotax Basic instead of Deluxe, with a Deluxe Label.  Now I find that I have missed the return window by one week so there I can do about this.  Very disappointing.
3	1393027200	I have used this software for years, but this year's version has lots of glitches. What I like about using TurboTax, though, is its knowledge of all the tax laws, even the state laws, and how it transfers a lot of your information from your prior year's taxes (if you used TurboTax then), so you don't have to re-enter the info or dig out your past year's return. It's very helpful if you have complicated taxes, like filing for income from two states.What I don't like is that TurboTax makes more work for people who don't need to itemize. If you let it guide you through your taxes, it will ask you to enter mortgage interest, property taxes, vehicle taxes, charitable contributions, medical expenses, etc., only to tell you at the end that you'd do better taking the standard deduction, and only then does it tell you the amount of that deduction. I've done this before, but this year, I Googled the standard deduction first. I could quickly estimate that my individual deductions wouldn't near that amount. It would be easy for TurboTax to tell you that amount up front and ask you whether you want to just take that or go through the itemization process. After all, when I used to file paper forms, I had to choose my form BEFORE I started filling it out. This app has you fill out the long form first before deciding what form to file. In fact, the IRS would just mail me the same form I'd used the year before. I've been using TurboTax since 2006, and it still hasn't figured out that I qualify for the EZ form. That's unnecessary work for people who do not itemize their taxes, and I buy tax software to simplify my taxes, not make them harder.Now for the problems. Intuit misleadingly claims you can trade your federal refund for an Amazon gift card, and they'll add in an extra 10%. Not true for many people. That's only if you have a federal tax refund of at least $295, of which you can only trade $100. You have to have a federal refund of $195 more than you want to trade for the gift card. Nowhere does their special offer give this minimum, yet it states that you can trade increments of $100 for the gift card, which kind of implies that $100 is the minimum. Not only is this info missing from the product page, but their customer service rep that I spoke to had to spend a lot of time looking through articles to find the information herself. So Intuit is not making it readily available to their own staff, let alone the buying public. Even the TurboTax page that tells you you're ineligible for the gift card gives you a list of possible reasons but doesn't specify which reason you fall under, nor does it tell you what the minimum amount required is. I have asked their customer service rep to request that the company update the product description to reflect the minimum amount required to get a gift card. After all, they show the maximum amount allowed, why not the minimum?Furthermore, I used my credit card to pay their $19.99 fee so that I could e-file my state return. Then it told me its site couldn't verify the transmission so I cannot e-file. It recommended updating my software, which I had done when I first opened it, but I went into its software update (under preferences) anyway, where I was told there is no update available. So it recommended that I mail my returns, but I'd already paid $19.99 to e-file them. I tried switching Wifi networks in case it was my internet connection. It still didn't work. I finally called customer service, and I will say that they have great service, which is why I upgraded this from one star to three. Rather than making me hold forever for a rep, I was able to dial 1 to have them call me back. And they called back about a minute later, not the 8 minutes promised. While I was on the phone with them, I quit out of TurboTax and reopened it, thinking it might update the software this way. It still said there were no available updates, but I went through the e-filing process again, and this time it worked. Because of the problems, they're refunding my e-filing fee, even though they know I finally got it to work.Finally, I live in Montana, where it's better to file "married-filing separately" than "married-filing jointly." Seriously, it saves about $500 this way. Every year in the past, Turbo Tax picked this up and recommended the change. This year's version wanted to file my state taxes without doing that. I had to manually go back into the state to change it (which wasn't easy because simply clicking on the State tab does not do this). Only then did it make the change. Had I been new to this state, I would have paid $483 more in taxes thanks to TurboTax.Their customer service phone # is (800) 4INTUIT.
5	1393027200	I have used Turbo Tax for 15 years to prepare my Tax Return. It's great. I get the maximum return.
4	1393027200	Ordered this b/c I was getting an additional $10 off b/c I had APrime.  Received it next day - during a snow storm, so I was pleased.  Overall satisfaction will be determined when I get my tax refund.
5	1393027200	I'm a CPA and I use TurboTax to keep me on track with the new tax codes every year and as a reminder to make sure I don't miss anything. It's a great resource!
5	1393027200	I use it every year. Covers everything I need including business expense, farm expense and education. Download and install updates before your submit.
4	1393027200	Good as usual and easy to use. But disappointing that it would not import data from last years return pdf file
2	1392940800	If you have multiple IRA distributions, Turbo Tax 2013 will only produce (1) 5329 form. The tax figure is correct at the end of the form but, since it does not create a 5329 for each IRA distribution, the IRA will not factor the refund or payment correctly. Once I received my refund, (10x what I should have received) I called the IRA and we went through the return and that is when we discovered the missing form. I went back and tried to make the software produce the second 5329 with no success. I then tried to complete the 1040x form and the same bug was evident. I have to print out what TT will provide and download the 5329 from the IRA and manually fill out the form and resubmit my taxes. Will not use the software next year.
5	1392940800	45 bucks and a couple hours is all it takes. we've been doing our own taxes since 2009 now and it's a breeze. Especially if you stay with the same program; it imports your previous info (As much as possible) and lessens the data entry portion of this non-trivial task. I know nobody enjoys doing taxes, but it's inexpensive and you see how much your refund should be right there. Plus, there's the satisfaction of a job well done, right? That's worth something.the turbo tax line has served us well and I love e-submission as I get my refund faster than snail mail. Save yourself a few bucks, pay attention to what they're asking you and use the forums/web if you have questions. If you're running your own business or require more complex tax stuff, then seek a professional. But for simple form types, go with this software.
5	1392940800	Use this every year. Very helpful with owning our own business, having renters, and many more complicated situations in our life. haha! Thankful for their step by step process.
3	1392940800	I use TurboTax every year to do my own taxes.  Though not always easy to navigate, I find it very helpful.
5	1392940800	Turbotax makes tax filing so easy for federal and state taxes! I highly recommend it! It is user friendly and definitely worth the money.
5	1392940800	Fast and easy to use. I have used for to years in a row now and would not even consider switching.
5	1392940800	I get the money back in no time and it is very easy to use.I use to go to a Tax office and I will get not more than $1000. A friend told me about Turbo Tax and since then I been getting about $3000. Try it, you won't get disappointed.
4	1392940800	I have used Turbo Tax software for many years.  I do the taxes for family as well and the five free e-files are a big draw.  The software is easy to use.  My only draw back is that printing returns is a not straight forward.  I will most likely continue to use this software and I recommend it to my friends.
5	1392940800	So far I used this product to get my daughter's income taxes done.  It took very little time, last year's information was transferred easily, and the outcome was great. It was shipped promptly, and it even had $10 off the price!  Great value and great product!
5	1392940800	Compared to doing taxes on my own its a no brainer Turbo -Tax makes it very simple. I don't have a real complicated tax situation but this software has cut my time doing taxes by 70%. I paid the extra 20 bucks and had them file the state tax electronically for me after my state lost my return for 2012. It also printed out my local tax forms and I filed them electronically myself which took about 5 minutes. I was a very early filer and received my federal and state refunds in about 9 days. I have not tried any other type of tax software but the way this has worked for me I don't see any need to. I recommend Turbo-Tax to anyone who wants to simplify the way to complicated tax system at a very reasonable cost.
5	1392940800	I&#8217;ve used TurboTax for the past few years to prepare my taxes. I find it always to be accurate for my basic return and have used it to help my family and friends prepare their return. TurboTax also has excellent customer service! I contacted them and they resolved an issue for me instantly!!
5	1392940800	We've been using Turbo Tax for many years and always find it easy to use and accurate.  E-file assures accurate submissions and speedy returns.
5	1392940800	My taxes are not overly involved, but they're not the most simplistic either.  This is my second year using TT and the price of it is well worth it.  It gives me peace of mind with the error checking and audit risk indicator.  Also, the ability to E-File both federal and state returns for free (I live in New York State...other states have to pay for E-File), was a surprise bonus.  I used to pay a tax person $200 to do our taxes every year.  Now I pay about $40 for TT and give up some of my time, which actually gives me the control I want over my tax reporting.  I was reluctant to get this program and a buddy of mine, for years, urged me to.  When I finally did, I regretted not listening to him sooner. The program really &#34;holds your hand&#34; and walks you through things if you choose to go that route. A direct &#34;Forms&#34; view is also available to traditionalists.
5	1392940800	I have used Turbotax for 8 years and have found it to be thorough, accurate, and relatively easy to use.  I'm feel confident that I'm not missing a single deduction when I use it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to fill out their own tax forms.
5	1392940800	I've been a TurboTax user for more than 10 years and so comfortable with this product I'm actually afraid of trying new/other tax products.  Wish they didn't keep raising the prices every year though.
5	1392940800	I have been using Turbo Tax for around 20 years now and have never had any problems. If you can read and follow instructions you can file your own taxes using Turbo Tax. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5	1392940800	Love turbo tax because it is easy to use and always works well.  It is a great price.  Much less than a tax preparer.
2	1392940800	This software still not up to date on state law regarding credits.  I had to do the state return by hand or it WOULD HAVE COST ME A FEW THOUSAND IN OVERPAID TAXES!! The federal also printed with incorrect numbers in one case, but, it did not affect the calculation.  The software still has too many add on services they want to charge for and it wastes my time with some of the ways it asks for data and information.  I've used turbotax for a few years and they are getting worse every year.  This was the year I was going to move to another cheaper software package like Tax Act.  The only reason I purchased turbo tax this year was the Amazon gift card deal they offered if you take part of your refund to an Amazon gift card.  That offer essentially made the software free!  That doesn't make this a good product.  It is however, better and cheaper and more reliable than going to your local accountant.  But for the price, go try tax act or the HR block product.  Turbo tax is not the best game in town and they are charging way too much without the results to back it up.
5	1392940800	Great product at a good price.  I've used Turbo Tax for several years.  Easy way to do accurate tax returns.  Will definitely use again next year!
5	1392940800	I've used Turbo Tax for years and have never had a problem with it and this year was no exception.  It went very smoothly and I received both of my refunds within a week.  I also did both my daughter's returns and they also went smoothly and their refund was also received very quickly.  The gift card is also working very nicely but I should have put more on it-I see it's going to be gone quickly!!!  I will do this again next year if they offer it.
5	1392940800	Love the ease of installation and review for errors feature. Very user friendly program. Can either print your return or efile.
5	1392940800	This was the third year that I filed our taxes with Turbo Tax instead of going to an accountant, and again I find it so much easier and especially cheaper to do the tax return myself. Turbo Tax leads you through every step and it is quite fool-proof.However, it was the first time that the software had a slight glitch. When I came to the end, it did not let me send the tax returns as e-files. It recommended to update the software (which I had done when I first installed it), and then to mail it, which I did not want to do. I ended up doing the old software trick: shut down the program and restart it, and then it went through fine. That was a bit annoying and should not happen, but overall, I still love TurboTax and will keep the 5-star rating.
5	1392940800	I have been using turbo tax for years it is a great product I would recommend it to anyone. awesome
4	1392854400	Best that I have used,IT ALLOWS THE TAXPAYER TO GO THROUGH CHECK LIST TO BE SURE ALL DEDUCTIONS ARE RECORDED.
5	1392854400	I have been using Turbo Tax for several of the past years. It is all very informative, easy to use, and very straight forward. Even if anything did not make sense to me, they have a place where you can ask questions, or search other user's questions.The deluxe version is perfect for me, as I do not have crazy amounts of things to claim or deduct. Even if you purchase this version, and find that you need a more in-depth version, there is an option to upgrade while you are in the middle of doing your filing. It will ask you questions, and if you answer them in a certain way, TurboTax will offer you to upgrade to the next version up, so you can maximize your tax return.Whats especially great, is if you use this product year after year, the information is stored locally on your computer, and can load last year's information for you and is quite the time-saver!I doubt I will ever go back to overpaying several hundred dollars to sit in front of someone, asking me the same exact questions as TurboTax does, for a huge difference less! Last time I had used another service, single filing, they charged me $300.00 to file Federal and State. Not to mention I spent close to four hours with the tax preparer, and they still messed it up and I had to take it somewhere else to have them fix it. It was a big hassle and a waste of time.tl;dr- TurboTax is the way to go. (And, if you choose to receive your refund as an amazon gift card, you get an extra 10%!)
4	1392854400	Makes filing your taxes simple and easy with just having to respond to questions.  Filing is quick easy and return is back in 10 days.
2	1392854400	I was very disappointed in Turbo Tax for the 2013 tax year.  When entering deductions, where you used to be able to just enter a figure from my Quicken Summary; you now have to break it down into multiple lines for the program to accept it.  Is this Intuit's idea of a positive Turbo Tax Update or is this the IRS cracking down and telling software companies to make it more difficult to take earned deductions???
5	1392854400	I have been using TurboTax Deluxe for years, even though, recently, I have only had to use Form 1040 A, which is simple. TurboTax assures me of the best way to pay the least money, gives me and opportunity to review the tax rules, and provides a structure for reviewing applicable expenditures for the year. The free E-File has worked out to be better, for me, than regular mail.
2	1392854400	My husband and I have always used TurboTax. This is the first timethat apparently due to a glitch with the software, we are unable to fileelectronically which is a big inconvenience, not to mention we now haveto wait 4-6 weeks to receive our return.
5	1392854400	I have used TurboTax for about 10 years now and it continues to be simple to use and gets me all the tax deductions I am entitled to. The only thing I had some difficulty with was charitable donations. When I imported from TurboTax Its Deductible online, the estimated value of donated items was not consistent from the time I recorded them several months earlier and the time I prepared my tax forms. The program automatically changed the values and I didn't understand why.That small thing aside, I will continue to use TurboTax.
5	1392854400	Yes, this met my need. I was able to get my taxes done. The only thing left is the city where I live since it wasn't part of the package this year. That would have been nice to have.
1	1392854400	Purchased the hard copy of TurboTax Deluxe. The software is very easy to use.  I would use it every year except for the the big bummer when It came time to efile  my federal return. It clearly states "there is no additional cost to efile your federal return." Not only does it charge $19.99 to file CA state return [which in the initial purchase is supposed to be free] but then charges $39.99 processing fee for the federal return. Next year I'll just do everything on the state and federal tax sites that are in fact free!
5	1392854400	I have used Turbo Tax for years and trust it completely. This time, using my Amazon Student discount, I saved a little money making an even greater value!
5	1392854400	I have used this in the past, felt very sure of myself, so thought I would try it again.My lawyer told me I would be able to do my taxes with this, he uses the same thing, only more for his business.
5	1392854400	Great because it saves you time by transferring most of your information from previous year. For the price, you can't beat it.
1	1392854400	I have $ 415 of the federal tax refund and Turbotax Desktop Deluxe I purchased here (desktop version, not a browser-based one) shows me I can use only between $ 0 and $ 200 for Amazon eGift card but no more. Meaning I would get only $ 20 bonus instead of $ 40.I called Turbotax support and a rep told me she found a document called "Eligibility Requirements" in an internal database that said "TurboTax Desktop Customers must have a Federal Refund at least $195 more than the amount they wish to apply to Amazon".We were through "About the Turbotax Refund Bonus Program" (on TurboTax site), "How to get an extra 10%" in Turbotax On Demand Tax Guidance (available if you click "How does this work" link right above the slider), fine print at the end of the screen where the slider is, and Refund Bonus Offer on Amazon and there is nothing in them about this limitation. They either clearly say "Use some (or all) of your federal refund to purchase an Amazon.com Gift Card" or does not mention any limitations of this kind implying the entire amount of a federal refund is available for this offer.The rep told me she had no way to open a bug report on this issue or escalate it. So I talked to Amazon and they gave me this email wecare@intuit.com to try to handle this with Intuit first. I sent an email a week ago no response so far. So I doubt they care as they pretend.Now I am trying to get a full refund from Amazon. Will keep it updated.UPDATE: Got the full refund plus $ 20 certificate from Amazon. Thank you, Amazon!
5	1392854400	I mean what I say; something that makes our horribly complex tax code so easy is really a great accomplishment.  Not just the best tax software I've ever used, but the best software.
5	1392854400	I am an accountant. I have used Turbo Tax for probably 15 years. This is the easiest and most economical way for ANYONE to prepare their taxes!
5	1392854400	I have used the program for about as long as it has been around.  It always does the best for my filing and gets the refund due me.I have occasionally used other programs just to check and Turbo tax always comes out ahead.
5	1392854400	This is great for filing your personal taxes.  I have use turbo tax for over 8 years and love it.
5	1392854400	I love this software. I use it every year because it's easy to use and looks for every deduction. Definitely worth the price.
3	1392854400	I am experiencing post purchase regret.  I realized too late that I didn't need to pay for tax software.  I could have gotten this much from the free versions that are out there.  That said, the program worked ok.  I partially entered some information in the deductions and expected the program to have an alert when I didn't enter anything in the sums, but it didn't.  It would have completed the process with 0 in the form.  Also they want $19.99 more to e-file state.  They are charging for something that is already offered for free in my state.For those of you who are tempted by the rebate... I was too.  You have to sign a form that releases ALL of the information on your tax forms (not just that you have a refund or how much it is)  to an unknown &#34;bank&#34; that issues the gift certificates.  Included in that agreement is a privacy contract which informs you that they are free to share your information with, pretty much whomever they want.  If you are comfortable handing over every detail of your financial life (and so much more) to an relatively unknown entity that has freedom to use that information anyway they would like to for a few hundred dollars, go ahead.  I decided it wasn't worth it to me.Also, one of the selling points of tax software is that it is tax deductible.  Yeah, it is.  But you have to spend a minimum amount of money first.  For me it was nearly $1400.  So, No gift card.  No tax software deduction.  Gaps in program.  Not really happy here.  I'm wishing I hadn't wasted $50.  I could have bought a really nice new toaster.
4	1392854400	Seems to fit the bill.  I have been using it for years.  Always try to wait for the best price and was successful.
4	1392768000	I received the TurboTax CD very quickly from Amazon and installed it with ease.  I used it this past weekend and thought the program was very easy to use.  The only problem, when I completed my Federal Tax and started to complete my State return, I was asked for my credit card number for the fee of $19.99.  I gave them the credit card info because I wanted to complete my taxes.  I called Amazon on Monday and explained  that I thought this program included the State return also and they agreed that it did.  Amazon (I think their customer service department and protocol is the best in the country) immediately credited my account for the $19.99.
2	1392768000	If you are expecting to take advantage of the offer of getting an Amazon GC with part of your refund and get a bonus of 10% added to the amt forget it. You will never get the GC..  been waiting over a year for mine!  After many calls I still have gotten no where
5	1392768000	Very easy and fast to use.  It goes step by step and rechecks.  Allows you to send in your returns when you want.  Used this the last 5 years.
1	1392768000	I've been using turbotax for years to submit tax, but for 2013 the software has been the most buggy, and support has been very useless.It is too bad that it has been more than 30 days after I purchased the product, or I will definitely return the product.A good example of the recent bug is if you have some charitable declared for 2013, then TurboTax 2013 will throws tons of errors, which is very concerning.Turbotax has been dragging their feet, and also if you call their support line they will put you for a long time, and then hang up your call.This bug is documented in TurboTax AnswerXchange with tons of other people voicing their concern too (search for: Blank Charitable Donation) , or go to [...]
4	1392768000	I have always liked Turbotax, but for some reason the disc broke in two pieces when I put it into my dvd.  I now have the issue of getting the second piece out of my computer.  I hope it has not damaged the computer.  If so, I may have to ask for repair monies.
1	1392768000	New this year the Sch C form is not in this edition.  Even if you just need the form and not heir help it is not available.
1	1392768000	I have been a long-time user of TurboTax, but no more. Many taxpayers this year have to file a new form (Form 8960) to report bank interest and other investment interest and potentially pay some additional tax on this income. Although the IRS released this form weeks ago and it is available for download on the IRS website, Intuit has not yet provided a final version of this form for use with TurboTax.  Until this form is made available,TurboTax users with investment income to report are unable to file their federal or state tax returns.  I was ready to file at the beginning of the season, but I have been held up because of Intuit's failure to make this form available.  Intuit has repeatedly postponed its anticipated release of this form for TuboTax, stringing users like me along.  The TurboTax AnswerXchange is full of angry comments from users like me who are unable to file because of the Form 8960 delay.  I made multiple attempts to get assistance through customer service, which proved to be a significant waste of my time.  I was not able to even get a refund for the federal filing version from Intuit. I was told that they couldn't help me, because I bought it from a third-party vendor and not directly from them. Now I have to start over with different software from a different vendor.  What a disappointment!
5	1392768000	This is the easiest tax product to use and I have been using it for years!No muss, no fuss just answer a few questions and BAM, you're done!
5	1392768000	We have used TurboTax for a number of years now, and we would not want to file our taxes without it each year!!!!
5	1392768000	I have been using Turbo Tax for years & have always thought it was a great product. I do wish that I could have e-filed my state return with this instead of mailing it, but I knew that when I bought it so no complaints. :)
3	1392681600	Faced with the idiocy of the new form 8949 for CGains, TTax complicated the issue by not allowing people to OVERRIDE this madness and put the values on the Sch. D. directly while attaching their data from their brokers. Lastly, the fact that these overrides don't transfer to the State return make it cumbersome. C'mon TTAX, you can do better! Give those of us who know what we're doing a break.
4	1392681600	Turbotax worked great; I've been using it for the past decade.  I do plan on buying the program again next year,  However the 10% bonus, disappointed,  I read through the &#34;agreement&#34; and could not accept. The extra 10% wasn't really an amazon product.  The card would have been issued by a bank in California, and my information would have been sold and shared for marketing.  I feel my privacy is worth more than 10%.
5	1392681600	turbo tax was easy to follow and understand.  I liked it very much and will use it again next year.
1	1392681600	NO THANKS WASTE OF MONEY IF YOU ASK ME WAS UNABLE TO IMPORT TAXES FROM LAST YEAR, WHICH IN TURN CAUSED A HOLD UP..
5	1392681600	Very nice tax program, as always. Easy to use, intuitive, excellent format.  I've used Turbotax for 20 years now and am never disappointed.
5	1392681600	I use Turbo Tax every year to do my taxes.  It takes me to all areas to check for deductions.
5	1392681600	After using this product, i filed our taxes & have already received our returns. I have used this product for years!
5	1392681600	Easy, convenient, quick, accurate.  Following all the rules; I have never been audited.I will always yo back to this software.
4	1392681600	I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe  for many years, a very good product in my opinion, and yes I would recommend it
4	1392681600	It is just like all the other Turbo Tax I have received in the pass, except this year you can only E-file 5 federal and state
5	1392681600	It works. What more can I say? We do it every year and save (we hope) a bundle! Good deal earlier than it went on sale locally.
5	1392681600	Best price around.  Beats all the big box stores.  I have used TurboTax for years now and feel I have always gotten a fair and accurate tax return based on my data.
5	1392681600	Easiest way to do your taxes. Inexpensive, covers everything,  thorough error checking, lots of help screens. State & e - file included.
5	1392681600	I have been using TurboTax for the past 6 years to complete our tax returns. I like how Turbo Tax walks you through each scenario (i.e. children, investments, income). The software prompts you to enter each piece of information and determines if you qualify for credits/deductions. Plus, with this version you can complete your state and school district taxes too. I don't pay the extra to have the state & school district filed, but can print it out and plug the numbers into my state's online tax system. Super easy, and does all of the calculations for you!
3	1392681600	The program worked well however it did not carry over our information from the previous year even though it said it would.
5	1392681600	The software was very easy to use because everything is in simple English. I'm 18 and just started doing taxes and even I knew what they were referring to. One thing worth noting is that I had to update it before using it and then again before actually filing my taxes. Works great though
1	1392681600	I purchased TurboTax from Amazon when it first came out.  Today I tried to efile and get the message:Turbo Tax was unable to send your return to the Intuit Electronic Filing Center for the following reason:Validation failed:  There is an update available for your program.  Before you can e-file you'll need to get this update.If this problem persists, you should print your return and file by mail instead.My turbotax is up to date, there are no updates available. I checked the TurboTax website and this is a known problem.  I followed their instructions, it still did not work,  I contacted there technical support and after an hour and half a dozen re-installs it still does not work.  Too me the solution is not to file by mail, the solution is for Intuit to fix the problem.I am returning the product to Intuit even though it was purchased through Amazon.  This can be done at:[...]
4	1392681600	Did not like having to put in a password to save the information on the tax return, it was a big pain!!!!!!!!!!!
4	1392681600	i have used turbo tax for years it lives up to expectations and works fine for my taxes. I like the ability to download info from my brokers websites and available w2's.
1	1392681600	I still do not have all the forms required to file my taxes, and it is the 18th of February?????  Didn't Turbo Tax realize we buy the program to ....well....file our taxes.  At this point, the 18th of February, I should not have to wait to file my taxes because they have not provided all the necessary forms.
4	1392681600	In the past we have used a tax preparation company. It always appeared to me that they were asking a series of questions right off of their computer screen. After seeing a sample of TurboTax it dawned on me that they were just using a computerized software that did the same thing. Soooooo, I decided to try TurboTax.Can't say enough good things about the TurboTax software. The system walks you through step by step, question by question, and line by line. When I finished with TurboTax I used a printed copy to compare previous returns with the TurboTax version and they were the same. I am not using a professional tax preparation company again.In the past we paid quite a bit of money to have our taxes done; not this year.Why the 4 Star rating you ask? The software e-Filed the federal return, but you had to pay an additional $20 to e-File the state return. For $20 I will print it out and send it in, however, I felt that should have been included in the version that I bought.
4	1392681600	It works pretty well if you have standard tax situations.  It does what it needs to do.  Worked for me.
3	1392681600	I've used TurboTax before and everything went as expected, but this time when asked if I wanted to use my free state e-file I ended up being charged an additional $19.99 to do that.  What happened to the one free State filing????
4	1392681600	Turbo Tax is not free, but it is cheaper than a CPA. It pulls in most of the data (not 100%) from last year's file, and it is pretty good at walking you through the process. It's still not quite as easy to go back and review what you've entered without it trying to walk you through again--I did end up in a loop one time.
1	1392681600	I've used Turbotax for years and ths year they just have it wrong. They have eliminated all support so I can't even report ther mistakes. They have wrong information, missing options and missed deductions. Ex. job seeking expenses are deductable but turbotax lists them as employee expenses subject to a percentage of the AGI. The only help is posting your tax information on a public web ste and hope someone answers you. Avoid turbotax at all costs.  This years version does not give the deductions that the IRS says I'm allowed
5	1392681600	Turbo Tax Deluxe was so easy to work with, I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and family, we will definitely purchase it every year from now on....
5	1392595200	Have used this product for years, and it is much easier to use than others I've tried.  Very accurate, and makes it possible to verify calculations.
3	1392595200	I have used Turbo tax for a decade and have been happy with results. However this year (2013) it would not import my data from the previous year's return, nor would it import data from my Merrill Lynch account. this required me to fill in dozens of fields by hand and set my progress back a full weekend.I am done, finally, but I am still disappointed in this year's impediments to easy importing.  The instructions and workarounds did no good and finally I threw up my hands in despair and re-entered everything. I am thinking about next year but if I try some other product I will probably have to enter everything by hand again. Feeling screwed.
5	1392595200	I've been using Turbo Tax for many years and feel it's the best tax software available today. Very easy to use, covers everything I need for both Federal and State Returns. They have a great customer support and it's very easy to e-file.
5	1392595200	I like to use this, it is well worth buying, you have to enter your information into it and it works for you.
2	1392595200	This product is OK for completing your taxes. It does what it is supposed to do. However, do not select the Amazon Gift Card option for part of your return. I am still waiting for my gift card email. If you search the Turbotax site, you will see there are many other customers like me. If you want your money right away, steer clear of this promotion.
5	1392595200	I loved it so easy to use and got my taxes back early.  Able to do up to 5 different taxes electronically which allowed me to submit my children's as well
5	1392595200	Does what you expect.  Simple and easy way to do taxes quickly and accurately.  I love the rollover from year to year feature
4	1392595200	Use it couple years. It's a good tax software. It helps you by asking questions and making selections. Try it!
5	1392595200	Installed program on my Windows 7 laptop.At first install attempt, it gave me an error message.  I then turned off my Malwarebytes antivirus program, and this allowed me to complete the install.Created return - imported my backup file from last year.Updated the software.So far - so good.UPDATE:  I have now filed return.  No problems.  Life is good!
5	1392595200	Makes 1040 easy.  Imports last year to update.  E File also convenient.  Have used it multiple years will continue using as long as performs as well.
1	1392595200	I bought Deluxe version and it suppose to include Feferal and State Returns. My first installation went well on my external drive but it crashed so I re-installed on my D driver. Since then, I can't install the State return no matter how many times I tried. I had tried their on-line chat but they can't help on this and need to transfer to 'Working On My Returns' department. I called in 4 times tonight but never be able to speak to real person but kept waiting over 10 mins.I have been using TurboTax but this is the first time I need to re-install and it's so frustrated!I had tried to remove the program, even delete all the registration also delete the whole installed folder then re-installed but no good luck.
3	1392595200	I prefer filling out the various forms without all the questions you ask, 90% of which don't apply to a given individual. But in accessing the forms, would you believe the list  does not include the most  basic forms, Schedule A or Schedule B or the input sheet 8949 for Schedule D.  Not good.
5	1392595200	This my 10 year for using this product. very easy to use and this is a good price. . . .
5	1392595200	It works easily and accurately at a reasonable price. Turbo Tax is the most user- friendly software I have ever used.
4	1392595200	I use this product every year and find it to be one of the most user friendly tax preparation products on the market.
5	1392595200	Excellent source for preparing and filing my annual taxes.  My tax preparation is fairly simple and TurboTax fit my need.  I have used them for several years and have always been satisfied with the results.
3	1392595200	Multiple year turbo tax user. Good product.  Some flaws: Note that in my state the default is a debit card refund. There is no way to change this in turbo tax and default to direct deposit. If there is a way it's only with e-file state version for which you will pay $20. Also beware of the 10% bonus. You have to fill out a zillion page form and mail it in to obtain it. Would be nice if the PDF print out were numbered in case you drop it like I did.
5	1392508800	I have been using Turbo Tax for around 20 years, never had a complaint or problem. This is an outstanding product. I started using Amazon to buy this product several years ago and as usual, Amazon came through for me.
4	1392508800	This is the first time using TurboTax that I have had a problem. Prepared return and when I was ready to e-file I got a message that it was rejected due to an update I needed to download. Went to the update section and it said that there were no new updates. I tried it several other times, nothing. Finally closed TurboTax and then reopened and tried again. This time it went thru. Otherwise it is easy to use. Filing free, but had to pay for state. Also got the bonus to purchase an Amazon gift card and receive 10% to every $100. Shop Amazon alot so it was a great option. Will continue using TurboTax in the future and hope that I do not have any other issues like this time.
1	1392508800	I bought this through Costco for tax year 2012 and now for tax year 2013.  Both years this software proved unreliable.  Haven't been able to e-file either year and last year it would not allow me to take legitimate deductions.  Don't spend your money on this useless software.  I'm sorry I bought it again after having so many issues with it.
5	1392508800	I've been using this tax program for years.  It makes the process super easy, just answer questions and plug in numbers.  This year's version seems even easier.
4	1392508800	best feature is to pull data from investment broker 401k web site(s) and fill out many forms. also import  info from prior tax years is helpful and a time saver. free fed e-file; got my refund deposited in my bank 6 days after filing. only catch is: 1 state tax form is included, but must pay $19.95 for state e-file.
4	1392508800	I use it every year gets better every year shorter and to the pointIt should be cheaper its the only reason i gave it 4 stars
5	1392508800	I've been using tax prep software for years and it's the thing that makes doing taxes manageable. I don't have a complicated return, but I've had some recent changes and TurboTax just takes me through the paces with ease. I may not be getting my billion back, but I am getting my refund and I like the added bonus of having the state return as part of the package. I've tried them all and I like TurboTax for its consistency. I can transfer last year's return easily and painlessly. That's really the beauty of using a program-- it's painless. Just gather all the forms from hither and thither and have at it. If you need to pick it up later-- a primal scream break, perhaps-- the software keeps your place and reminds you what needs to be done.Given the fact that most tax preparers are using software these days, why not do it yourself and save a few dollars?
4	1392508800	As a first time user of TurboTax I had some difficulties with technical support.  More of a case of operator error. The guidance provided, within the program, was concise. I'd estimate that using TurboTax reduced the time spent on completing my specific forms by 50% .
5	1392508800	The turbo tax is a great tax preparer for me. Easy to use . I would recommend it to everyone. I have use this product for over 6 years now and still pleased with it .
5	1392508800	Gets easier every year! Will buy again next year, tried another tax program once but it was not the same,
1	1392508800	Before entering my Form 1099-R from US MILITARY RETIREMENT PAY, my Federal refund was $1,765. After entering that Form 1099-R, 2013 version TurboTax calculated I owed Federal taxes of -$347. Why does this version calculate Military Retirement as a cash distribution from an IRA? TurboTax online help/telephone support can not answer this. Can you? I use Windows 7.
1	1392508800	When efiling DO NOT SELECT THE AMAZON GIFT CARD FOR REFUNDS...  I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE CARD AND I HAVE HAD MY FEDERAL REFUND FOR OVER TWO WEEKS.Also don't expect to actually be able to contact anyone at Intuit about it, you can't get anyone to take ownership of this issue.  I expected to get about 15% of my refund in an Amazon Gift card but not only haven't I received the gift card but my state return was filed without selecting, nor paying for the state efiling.Intuit finally found a way to screw up a rock fight.
2	1392508800	Before I ever got a chance to use this CD, my 380# wife decided she needed a snack and we were all out of Ho Ho's. So she chomped down on this because she liked the colors. I'm giving it 2 stars; 1 for cutting her tongue and one because she said it tasted pretty good.
5	1392508800	I have been using Turbo Tax since the days of floppy discs.  Over the years I have tried some of the competition, but, always keep coming back to Turbo Tax.Great Product!
3	1392508800	The program seems to run well, but it is not so easy to maneuver around the program as it was in earlier versions. And there is no 2014 tax year planner. The old versions had a feature that I could use to project my next year's income and plan my taxes ahead of time. Since I am going on SS this year, I had counted on that, and it was not there. So I am not totally happy with this version, and may look for something else next year. And I have used TT for over 10 years.
5	1392422400	I have used TurboTax for years and enjoy the product.  This product is for any one who is afraid to do your own taxes but afraid you are going to make a mistakes. Guess what, computers make mistakes by individual not checking themselves.I would recommend this product to everyone!
5	1392422400	I have been using TurboTax for years.  Product works well and I am confident program makes the right calculations and helps to minimize my taxes.
1	1392422400	I have used this tax program for several years and this year I happened to spot check some calculations and found ERRORS!  For example, it rounded my total income up when it should have rounded down (took xxxxx.19 and made it the next HIGHER dollar amount xxxx1.00 in stead of xxxxx.00) and then reduced my total tax payments to a lower amount! for a double whammy!  Errors would have resulted in me paying MORE taxes!  If you want to give UNCLE SAM more money than you are suppose to then use this program!  If Not, pass on it NOT RECOMMENDED!  Tried to contact Turbo tax to no avail!  Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this defective program!
5	1392422400	I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for more than 10 years and have never experienced any difficulties during these years. I would highly recommend Turbo Tax to anyone. At least for me it is easier and less expensive than taking it to someone else and paying them for what I can do with Turbo Tax.
4	1392422400	Works good I have used it many time with good luck. Their customer service is great if you have a tax question you can talk to a real tax person who will try to help.
4	1392422400	I had no problems with the software itself installing, updating and doing my taxes. But when it came time to select part of my refund as an Amazon gift card with the 10% bonus, I am a little concerned with all of the fine print of the offer. Part of that fine print is that the bank that is handling the bonus offer can use your contact info pretty much any way they want to including &#34;offers from third parties&#34;. I went ahead and did the offer anyway grabbing enough bonus to actually have the software more than pay for itself, but it will be interesting to see how many &#34;offers&#34; I get flooded with as this year goes on. Anyway, just be aware that the bonus offer comes with strings attached.
2	1392422400	Turbo Tax is misleading, first off I am not a crack pot who complains about everything. In the past I have just downloaded turbo tax and done it that way for about $69. This year I bought the disc at costco because I thought it would only cost me $50 out the door... Well when you get done they try to charge an additional to file your state. The $50 you pay upfront is for the DOWNLOAD of the state and thats pretty much it! If you can just download the software on your tablet or do it all through there website. I was ended up just printing and sending the state return via snail mail for free and saving myself $30.
3	1392422400	Easy to use especially if you have used turbotax the previous year since it will import data for you.  It also links to your bank and brokerage accounts to download information to make the process easier.
1	1392422400	I've used H&R; Block for my taxes for the last 20 years and generally been OK but people kept telling me I was leaving a lot of money on the table I could reclaim using Turbo Tax.If you are happy to just feed in data (and be willing to even make some up) then I'm sure this will be fine.  If you want to understand what it's doing and why then there is no transparency.  Why did my short sell &#34;income&#34; from a home in another state, which was forgiven on the federal taxes show up and explode my tax bill for the state of residence?I suppose if all I needed was a 1040EZ or I didn't care about anything more then pushing the buttons the program asked me to it makes sense to go with this package.  But I felt so uncomfortable about the lack of guidance I had no faith in the figures I was being given.  If I can't explain to myself how/why I answered a question how can I expect to be able to explain to the IRS if I really screwed something up?
5	1392422400	I have used Turbo Tax software for years to do taxes for my family.  It is very user friendly with good explanations of what items you need to complete your individual return easily. There are many basic questions in the interview section, and it can take a while to complete especially if you go through the whole questionnaire. But if it is your first time doing taxes I would recommend it. I have used this Deluxe software version to do my self-employed business income and expenses, and it comes up with ideas of items I often forget that helps return my tax liability.
1	1392422400	I used Turbo Tax and the state form did not calculate my taxes accurately. I tried several things to rectify it to no avail. There has to be a NC glitz.
5	1392422400	I had to upgrade to Quicken 2014 this year anyway - as Quicken routinely drops the on-line update function for earlier versions in order to force revenue streams !!  What can you do ??  At least I got a very good deal by purchasing this combo pack and got Turbo Tax at a very reduced cost !!
5	1392422400	bought the disc not the download and had no problem installing it or getting updates. win 7 64 bit os even tried it on my vista laptop again no problems installing or getting updates.  easy to use
5	1392422400	I love the Turbo Tax software.  It's easy to use and I have used it for years. It makes tax time simple.
3	1392422400	Turbotax Deluxe 2013 was fine for federal return, but made an error on my state return causing it to be rejected after efiling. Several hours of talk with a TT associate could not correct the state error? A problem is that with cd/download version, you cannot separately print fed and state returns. Also, you cannot edit a return once it has been efiled.
5	1392422400	Been using Turbo tax for several years now, very easy to use ,I will always use this program for all my tax returns
1	1392422400	I ordered this in December so I could finish tax planning for the year and begin to do my taxes. I was shocked to find that whole sections were unfinished and documented, and as of now, mid-February, critical pieces have either been dropped or not completed. For capital gains, the speed entry sheet has been dropped and you are now apparently required to enter each transaction on a multi-page worksheet that takes about 20 times as long to make sure you've completed it correctly. The state return is still a disaster with forms still missing and help documentation neither complete or useful (in multiple places I found place marks where comments should be. Turbotax should be ashamed to put out this kind of crap. Buy something else if you have the choice. For a complex return with investments this has gotten worse each year and is barely usable now. Beware!
5	1392422400	I have been using for quite a few years and like the way it handles all the tax issues. I pass it on to my family and it works great for them.
5	1392422400	I have used this product for the past 10 years and I love it!  I have never had a problem with my taxes when I've used  Turbo Tax
4	1392422400	I have used this software for over 13 years and it is very good for personal use. Live support would be a huge improvement.
3	1392422400	been using TT since 97.  glad for the sale price. price of state filing is outrageous and hasn't matched filing on the state's website in three years. Click through interface on income and deductions skips.  For as much as it costs, AI would expect better. Still, it's better than other major filing program. There should be financial reward for purchasers of TT year after year.
5	1392422400	All on 1/31/2014. I've been using TurboTax for some years now and with the automatic pre-fill capability from previous filings it is a real snap. I strongly recommend this product.
5	1392422400	Great product easy to use have used for years would never not use awesome price helped with my whole families taxes
5	1392336000	I have never used a computer based tax software before and was stuck with tax preparing services and had to pay hundreds of dollars every year. But I thought of trying Turbotax this year and my taxes were done easily, correctly, with maximum deductions and got my refund very quick. I also took advantage of the 10% Amazon gift card offer.After paying $400 for filing my taxes last year, this year's cost to me was around $50.I am definitely using turbo tax next year.
5	1392336000	Turbo Tax is an easy to follow, very comprehensive tax program that is probably the next best thing to having a tax accountant, and a lot cheaper.  If you have the time, to get organized and follow the directions, it isn't difficult to get that annual chore out of the way. The key ingredient is to be organized prior to sitting down!
3	1392336000	I find their interview style way out of my desired effectiveness, even when you check you want to choose directly you end up in an interview, apparently they know best.  That is not so bad when you enter the first data but as things show up and you want to enter one additional thing you have to go through the interview, again and again.  They also found a reason that because of  a stock transaction that I needed to upgrade to &#34;premier&#34; for $20, I did but I don't see one bit of difference in that area.  I also do my daughters taxes and the additional state that I need is priced in a predatory fee. This year they allow multiple federal electronic filings included in the price but apparently you have to pay extra for each state filing in years past the package had one fed and one state included which is what most folks need but they found a way to get an extra fee from everybody.  I don't like the final cost of the software after all the upgrades.  For the past two years there has been some table error on my daughters taxes that caused the IRS to change the refund to be adjusted down around a hundred dollars.  That said, I love the references to last years filing, it saves me from missing some data entries from year to year.  I also like the way it calculates after each entry and shows the amount of your refund/amount owed. I think if they didn't nickel a and dime me to death I would rate them higher.
5	1392336000	Very helpful in preparing tax returns. Simple to use, accurate results. I used to pay a lot of money to have my returns prepared by a professional. With This program, I can easily prepare them on my own. I even prepare a Schedule &#34;C&#34; with this program. No problem!!  The included e-file is simple to use.
5	1392336000	Always use this program I would recommend to anyone that wants to do their own taxes.  It gives you all the guidance you need and even has the new rules.
5	1392336000	I've used TurboTax for many years, and usually buy it at Costco on the coupon offer they have every year.  I saved a trip to Costco, and got it shipped free on the Prime special deal, and saved $10.
5	1392336000	I have used TurboTax for about 15 years and have never been disappointed in it. I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1392336000	Takes care of all my concerns about filing taxes and always finds ways to save me money. Very easy to use and understand.
4	1392336000	I have been a TurboTax user for more than a dozen years and found this to be more than adequate for my use.  My wife and I are retired with normal income, IRA wihdrawals, rental income and depreciation.  Once the software updates were complete (a factor of waiting for Congress to detail the changes in laws which they passed for the preceding year), the sotware operated well and accurately.This year, TurboTax (Intuit) divided the former Deluxe software into two parts: the one reviewed here plus an &#34;upgraded&#34; version to better handle depreciation and other rental expenses.  All of the forms are contained in this edition and can be completed by a knowledgable user.  It is my understanding that the upgrade (more $) has step-by-step instructions to lead one thru these operations, but I chose to do this function manually.Taxes filed and accepted by both Federal & CA; awaiting refund.
5	1392336000	It still takes the better part of a day to do my taxes, but I like how turbo tax imports from last years tax file.  I can compare last years answers and results to this year.  This helps make sure I'm not off base with my entries.  There's a lot of questions that go with turbo tax but that's mostly my fault as I always opt to answer every single question.  My only desire is that turbo tax would keep all history with each new program.  My wife has been going to college off and on for years.  This year turbo tax ask me how many times we've taken some education credit.  Unknowingly I had to go back and open old turbo tax records to look and see.  Only to find out my answer didn't matter.  I also found it interesting it asked my about my health care insurance situation at the very end.  Didn't go further than the question b/c I have health insurance, but I wasn't for sure if that was an IRS thing or just turbo tax giving a heads up to users about the new laws in effect.
5	1392336000	i have been using this product for last two years and find it very useful it is simple to use would recommend it to all
4	1392336000	I have used the Deluxe version for several years now, it is simple to use especially after the first year.  Would recommend product.
5	1392336000	I use this software every year and it does what it said it will do and easy to work with .
5	1392336000	I have used Turbo Tax for five or more years now, and it works great for me each year. Turbo Tax takes you step by step through the process and does all the hard work for you. Highly recommended.
4	1392336000	They are getting better each year at keeping things simple to use and an easy flow to the process.  Wish it cost a bit less though since e-filing for state costs extra.
5	1392336000	8th year of using Turbo Tax. Easy to use and very accurate. Highly recommend this product. By using each year, makes uploading of information easy.
4	1392249600	I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years after they absorbed Parsons. I have been satisfied with the program all these years and am especially happy that they now provide free filing for federal tax (although mandated by law).The reason I did not give a four star rating is becaust they charge $19.95 to file state tax on line. You would think that for the price of the program Intuit could provide that service also.
5	1392249600	I haven't got my return yet but it was accepted by the IRS the next day after I submitted it as an e-file. I have been using TurboTax many years and it has never failed me. (knock on wood!) Great purchase for this price!
5	1392249600	Just what I wanted and works as intended. You just can't beat the price. I've used this software for years.
3	1392249600	The program works and is easy to use.  However, it certainly is over-price and contains additional perks that I would never use...  These perks are how they justify charging more & more every year
1	1392249600	My computer could not read the disc. I verified that my computer could read another disc. Called Intuit customer service and they allowed me to download the software over the internet. Intuit provided very good customer service.
5	1392249600	Millions of dollars are wasted by having others do your taxes.  I have done my taxes at home as a test, taken them to an accountant or H&R Block, and come back with the same results.  I have talked with folks who spend over $100 every year to do this April 15 headache.  Don't waste your money.  Start using Turbo Tax and you will never go back .
4	1392249600	I've used Turbo tax for several years now and like it very much.  Of course, the more you use a product, the more familiar one becomes with it.  I particularly like the ease of transfer, the ability to quickly go to forms if the need arises.  Technical support has been very useful.
5	1392249600	Exactly what you expect and get every year.  Easy to use and does a good job.  Will order again next year.
5	1392249600	TurboTax examines every situation most tax payers encounter in an easily understandable way.  I believe I cover all bases and get every tax break I'm entitled to.  All work sheets are clearly displayed for those who want to understand the taxing process.
3	1392249600	It has been very good until this year.  I had it sent to my daughter so she could use it first and she tells meshe was having a hard time getting updates and some other problems.  Maybe you should get her input bycontacting her on her email: kempceo@aol.com
1	1392249600	Non-stop, relentless spam! I have asked three times to end the spam. They just laugh with a &#34;what are you going to do about it&#34; attitude. Worse yet, we made the mistake of ordering it online two years ago. Since then, they have placed three charges on our card. They claim that we opted in for all future products and updates they deem necessary. I asked to see where that happened, on what page, what check box, where was my authorization. I am very aware of little scams like that and would have never opted into a &#34;charge me what ever you want, when ever&#34; attitude. They were never able to show me where I opted into this. (They call it a &#34;service&#34;, most people call is credit card fraud). We finally had to change our credit card number to stop the fraudulent charges. We filed complaints with the Attorney General and FTC last year but our tax payer supported consumer protections serviced don't seem to work.
5	1392249600	This product makes doing your taxes very easy. It is simple to use and yet gives you expert performance! Don't be caught at tax time without it!
5	1392249600	Easy to use, have been using it for years. wish they could work something out with Calif. for &#34;FREE&#34; E-FILE.
3	1392249600	It did its purpose and worked fine. It was the best price I could find too. It did ask if I wanted my refund or part of it used for a amazon gift card--10% added to it. I guess that was to be expected.It probably would have gotten more stars if it wasn't associated with taxes, but then that is why I bought it. I have used Turbo Tax for the last 5 years. It is a good product and makes a unpleasant chore faster and easier.
1	1392249600	When I try to download VA state tax I get the following message: 'This program is not intended to be run without arguments'. I&#8217;ve reloaded CD again, but still get the same msg. I&#8217;ve shut off my virus protection and still can&#8217;t get it downloaded.Spoke to several tech reps with no answers at all....very displeased with software and TT's inability to fix a simple problem. I see online that many individuals are having this problem.Come on MAN!
3	1392249600	TurboTax does not work smoothly and easily with WINDOWS 8.1. It did with WINDOWS 7. Have a great deal of patience.
5	1392249600	Turbo tax has helped me out for years now. It is so easy to use. Just follow the questions and fill in the answers.I always find the best deal on Amazon and get it there every year.
5	1392249600	I jumped ship some years  ago from TT to H&R; Block because their Kiplinger based software was able to allow a manual solution for my complex foreign tax credit  issues that TT could not.  However, I always appreciated the smooth, effective handling of most situations on TT, more so than the Block package, and noticed some definite bumps in the years since HRB took over that product.This year I tried TT again.  I am finding that every effort has been made to handle more complex foreign tax and reporting issues, including interactive menu inputs. The complex non-invesment foreign income input was difficult for me to locate,  However, once found, and after I opened some of the pop up information screens, it shows that every effort has been made to help you handle these more unusual tax situations and to set up the return in the right way to meet the super fussy requirements that the IRS has to accept an e-file.The conversion to TT did not work very well with my Mac based HRB return from 2012. Only personal info was picked up..  But I think the re-inputting was worth it because of the value added of this product.I will update this if needed after I finalize the return - still waiting for corrected reporting from my foreign source-- but for now, A for effort forTurboTax 2013 for making every effort to getting your return right and effectively filed.
4	1392249600	This years Turbo Tax was a downgrade. Before it handled doing Foreign accounts, but not they just say go to the irs site...I expect Turbo Tax to do a full job on taxes. If I wanted to go to the irs website I wouldn't have bought the software. I am thinking of switching next year.
5	1392249600	Buying Turbo Tax from Amazon is cheaper than going to Walmart!  I have been using Turbo Tax for over 15 yrs and never had any problems with the program or the IRS.  Easy peezy!
1	1392249600	Cannot finished tax because Form 1040A and  Schedule  A  not ready. Update function was also not working! Confidence in Turbotax badly shaken.
2	1392249600	I'm normally an avid turbotax user, bought my house in 2006 and have used it every year since.  This past year, I sold that house and bought a new one with back-to-back closings.  Spent about two hours homeless.  It was a risk, but it worked out.  Only problem now is that I can enter mortgage papers for the four mortgage companies I did business with in the last year (2 mortgages on the old place, a new mortgage on the new place, and then they sold the mortgage to someone else) but they don't seem to be interested in my change of address at all, nor the closing costs of selling or buying.  There HAS to be something here that will take those costs into consideration.  Nevermind the fact that I'm completely not confidant that I've done any of this BS correctly.  It asks you "did you sell a house" but it never asks you "did you buy a house."  It wants to know if you bought a car for the sales tax, but even with the import of last year's tax file, which clearly has a different home address, there is so far absolutely no mention of the fact that I had a rather major life change.  I'm going to do my best to figure this out, print it out, and head over to H&R; Block. Luckily for me, they'll do your taxes and if you're not satisfied, you can walk without filing or paying.  I STRONGLY suspect that a live person will be able to find something this year that the standardized turbotax software has missed this year in my specific situation.  In the worst case scenario, I'll have paid to have my taxes done twice-- update --Sure enough a visit to H&R; Block with a live tax professional paid off for me this time.  She spent about an hour and a half with me, pulled together over two thousand dollars more worth of refund than TurboTax was willing to let me have.  Well worth the +$200 fee.  Next year, I'll probably come back to TurboTax (or I'll consider H&R; Block's competing desktop software).  The moral of this story is: make informed purchases that meet your specific needs.  Nobody knows your tax picture like you do.  If you are like me, a working fellow who basically has very few interesting parts of life (from the tax perspective) this sort of bland cookie-cutter tax software will do the trick.  If you've made any large purchases, if you've made any income from anything other than a W2, if there is absolutely anything out of the ordinary in your tax picture for the year, go talk to someone who knows what they're doing.  Otherwise, you'll end up spending an extra $50 like I did just to be "assured" that using the live professional was a good idea.
5	1392249600	I've used this software for the last several years and find it a great help as the government seems to intentionally makes it impossible to do your own taxes. Very easy to use.
5	1392249600	Easy to work with. explanations are very understandable. Very easy to input data and the prompts help you to include all necessary information.
5	1392249600	I have been using Turbo Tax ever since it first came out years ago. It's easy to use. I don't see why anyone wouldn't do their own taxes with this wonderful tool. I highly recommend this product.
3	1392163200	TT is ok for your tax returns but the Amazon 10% promotion is a big headache. You may loose your money. Take  the complete refund and forget the gift card. I was greedy, put some money to the gift card and now TT and Amazon have no idea where my money is. You become a basketball between 2 companies that have no idea on how to resolve an issue they created.
5	1392163200	I have used TurboTax for several years. This edition is great just like the other ones that I have used.
5	1392163200	We have used Turbo Tax for years and if you don't have to itemize this is the way to  go!!
3	1392163200	The State part of the program (which cost extra) would not print without the overlay of showing this was not a final form so I could not print out the State portion to submit for taxes.
5	1392163200	I have used TurboTax for years and when I saw I could download it directly to my computer for a reduced cost I ordered it immediately.  TurboTax walks you through every step and will guide you through all available deductions.  The program is very easy to use.  I highly recommend!!
5	1392163200	I was using it for the last 3 years (enough with the accountant fees); and will cont'd to use it. it easy, interactive and seems to work right in terms of the federal and state taxes. the electronic filing and carry over details across the years saves time and provide a nice trail for comparison.
1	1392163200	In previous years I've used this to prepare our taxes and then prepare, (but not e-file through Turbotax), my kid's taxes and file theirs through the appropriate government website.  All I was saving was the minor headache of calculating.  it also wouldn't print out my state taxe form until I fled them through their (pay $20) service.Not it won't let me start and it does a poorer job of explaining some deductions.  I don't have a home office, but I've bought a few office supplies exclusively for work.  It showed me where to deduct these then kept saying I needed tax ID numbers for my employer and wouldn't let me remove the $30 or so I was trying to deduct.  I don't have foreign investments, I don't own a hybrid car or second home.  Next year I'll just run it through the free government websites and save $60 ($40 for the software and $20 to file my state taxes).
1	1392163200	I bought TurboTax Deluxe through Amazon, but I quickly discovered that somehow there are various Deluxe versions, and for some reason my didn't include a free state form.  I am used to paying $20 extra for filing the state, but Quicken wanted an extra $40 from me just to download the state form.  Outrageous.  So I bought another copy, had to uninstall my Deluxe version to get the state form and was then informed that I was only entitled to one state form.  Even more outrageous.  So far, then, I am out more than $70 for TurboTax Deluxe, and I still have one federal and state form to fill out but will apparently have to get another TurboTax Deluxe to get another state form. These are highly deceptive practices, to say the least.  I will never, ever use Quicken's products again.
5	1392163200	I have used Turbo tax for many years and it only gets better every year.  Tried a couple other tax programs on occasion only to be very disappointed.
5	1392163200	We have used Turbo tax for the last 5 years or so. My only wish is that I had ordered it a few days earlier when I could have gotten more of a discount. It was still a good deal at $45. It is easy to use and I am always confident sending in our returns with Turbo Tax.
5	1392163200	I have purchased this for the past two years and have had success each year! I'm 25 and a non home owner (renter) and have paid $60 to have mine done by a tax processor. I tried it the first year (Turbo Tax) and came up with the same refund as the tax processor. I have done my own taxes each year since. I have had no problems with program and it has found college school credits I was unaware of and produced a awesome refund.It has explanations for any question or scenarios you could think of and has a live chat box that you can speak with if you need help. I suggest this to all of my friends and family!
5	1392163200	I have been using TurboTtax for the last 9 years, and I have it easy to use. When I did have problems the support I received was great!
4	1392163200	I always buy TurboTax. It gets the job done. Its features are adaquate. It is sometimes hard to manueve around but overall it's a decent product.
1	1392163200	I purchased Turbo Tax because i used it last year.  I was happy with it.  However, this year after paying for it they charged extra fees just before you e-filed the returns.  A sizable fee.  If you use this be prepared to pay extra.
5	1392163200	I use turbo tax every year to do my taxes and have been doing so for about 15 years. So far it has been able to handle any tax situation I may have.  The money I save by doing my own taxes more than pays for the purchase of this software. Plus it has so many checks and reminders that I feel very comfortable that my taxes are correct and I'm not missing anything.
5	1392163200	There is not a lot you can say to add glamor to doing taxes. Turbotax is a great program to complete your taxes with. Easy to use, even for us half brain dead people. Walks you thru step by step, double checks you and makes sending IRS all your money easier. I've been using it for 14 years and never had any problem with their software.
5	1392076800	TurboTax is the absolutely best way to do your taxes.  There is no need to pay someone (who probably uses TurboTax) to do this for you.  Just answer the questions and you can do your federal taxes, your state taxes and you can electronically file the taxes, all for about $50.
1	1392076800	I purchased this software on DVD thinking I could easily re-install the software if there were problems.  Well, there are problems which a re-install won't fix.  I am retired and am not their typical taxpayer.  I have no W-2 forms, and sometimes move funds from one IRA to another.  This should not be a taxable transaction, but I have a hard time convincing Turbo Tax of that.The worst thing so far is that in the middle of entering financial data, the software stopped and asked for my &#34;confirmation number&#34;.  There is no explanation of what the confirmation number is.  Now I can't finish the filing.There was an 800 number to call, but after 30 minutes waiting for someone to answer I hung up. (Note this is 11 Feb 2014.  I pity anyone calling in April.)The on-line help is next to useless.  It depends on the &#34;User Community&#34; to support one another.  There are no TurboTax employees responding to questions.I'll be using a paid CPA this year.  The frustration level is way too high fighting this software.  I have better things to do in retirement.
5	1392076800	The functionality has improved and it is much faster. I tend to be a user that enters data in spurts. This year's software is very adaptable to my way of using TurboTax.
5	1392076800	I've used TurboTax for many years and haved foun it to be a user friendly way to file your taxes.
3	1392076800	It does its job, no problems, I got my refund in 9 days. Nothing much has changed since last year except the amounts of taxes
4	1392076800	First time I have done my own taxes in 30 years.  Turbo Tax made it reasonably painless.  I was disappointed with the $20.00 charge to e-file my state return.  Between that charge and the cost of the software it is nearly what the CPA has charged to do the tax figuring and filing for me.  I may rethink doing my own taxes next year.
4	1392076800	I have been using this tax-filing since 2009 and it always works fine for me! But I do believe it should include the state tax E-File?
5	1392076800	I've been a TurboTax user for many years now (since 1996) and last years 2013 product is no different. The simple to use interface as well as the ability to do your own taxes empowers you. Yes you could got to the popular tax places HR Block or Jackson Hewitt, however it's not really rocket science doing your own taxes. Along the way TurboTax walks you through the steps necessary and provides you the ability to save your work at any time. I've been using the same product each year on the same computer so I can simply import my data from each year and add the present year's info. I highly recommend using JK Lasser's Your Income Tax to give you ALL the details if you have any questions, but so far I've been extremely happy with TurboTax 2013 Deluxe!
5	1392076800	Year-in and year-out, T-T is a consistent and excellent tax preparation and filing software product. The Refund Bonus Offer made the difference in my purchasing it from Amazon this year.
5	1392076800	A couple of years again, I was given TurboTax by a friend.  I was quickly hooked on its easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide to taming what can sometimes be an intimidating chore every year.  This 2013 edition is no different.  I will never go back to the &#34;paper and pencil&#34; method again.There are two primary reasons why I continue to use TurboTax even though my taxes are simple enough (the &#34;joys&#34; of not making a ton of money!) that I could probably get by without:1. Even with my &#34;simple taxes&#34;, I always get tripped up in certain areas (tax code is not, shall we say, always crystal clear) and become uncertain.  With TurboTax, the simple questions it asks puts me at ease that I am not missing anything crucial.2. The &#34;stuff at the end&#34;, for example: Audit Risk check (it IS kind of nice to know what chance you have of getting THAT dreaded phone call), and E-File (free instant filing of federal return).  The last two years, I have even paid the $20 to file my state form and I didn't mind a bit, because I know they will be done in that one sitting.To conclude, here is the simple reason why I will continue to use TurboTax year after year: This year, I finished my taxes (literally finished, including filing and all) in just about an hour and a half.  I had no concerns as I went to file and I know that I will get my refund in the quickest way possible.  That is worth the money for me!
1	1391990400	I ordered Turbo Tax Deluxe which I've used for many years in a row now.  I had problems installing it (a first) and when it finally installed it was Turbo Tax Basic (which is free from TT web site).  The package and disc, of course, say Deluxe.  I'm sure this is a bootleg or a counterfeit product.  First time I've ever had a bad experience with Amazon and I am a prime member, too.  Don't order from this vendor.  Better yet order from Turbo Tax web site and download it because it is cheaper.  Very dissapointed as a bad taste is left in my mouth from being ripped off.
1	1391990400	I received my deposit from the IRS 4 days ago and have yet to receive my amazon gift card. I was told through an email that I would receive my gift card in 24-48 hours it has now been 72 hours. Still no idea where my amazon gift card is or when it is coming. I have been on the phone now with all 3 companies involved and they are all blaming each other. I will call amazon one more time tonight to request a refund of my turbo tax purchase. Again do NOT buy this product if you are expecting the 10% amazon gift card promotion.***Not 10 minutes after this was posted i received my gift card. My review still stand as not one of these companies knew what was going on. Google this issue it is a widespread problem. Intuit, SBTPG and Amazon all say you need to call one of the other 2 companies to get this issue sorted out. Terrible customer service in handling this promotion.
4	1391990400	A little confusing at times / no phone contact this year ,I  had questions that there were no appropriate answers to chose from...
5	1391990400	This is my 6th year with Turbo. A great product and a price well below the tax services. Take a deep breath, get your paper together and start answering question and let Turbo do the rest.
5	1391990400	I've been using TurboTax for years and haven't found anything better. I actually worked for H&R Block as a tax preparer one tax season and found TurboTax easier to use than their software.
5	1391990400	I've been using Turbo Tax for years and it always does as expected.  I'm not always sure why some of the questions are asked, but it is easy to follow. You can go back and edit entries and add information.I did find it for less at a club store in PA.
5	1391990400	Tried others, still consider this the best in the field.  So easy to do "what-ifs" and nearly always reminds me of something I might have forgotten.  Saves lots of time by importing last years return.  Then you can update and change as necessary without having to reenter stuff from year to year.  State return works almost seamlessly.  Updates and E-filing is painless.  Has every form I have ever needed.  Prints beautiful file records.  Navigation is easy but may take a few minutes to figure out - user friendly.  Don't worry, it won't accidently dump your stuff.  Can be used for yourself and your in-laws or kids.
3	1391990400	It worked as expected as far as filing the tax return for both fed and state, transferred old records just fine.BUTIf you choose to have them deposit your return in your bank account (required for Amazon offer) then you are giving some bank called &#34;Sunshine Bank&#34; access all the information on your tax return AND the right to share this info with their affiliates. You also authorize them to open an account with their bank in your name (it's temporary, before the transfer).This information is not in the TurboTax interface, it is on the &#34;preview your forms&#34; feature, buried deep and totally fishy, even after I took the offer out of the form authorizing this bank to share my information was STILL THERE, I had to manually zero it out to make it go away and accept a paper check directly from the IRS.Honestly, I am not cyber paranoid, I use Amazon and other online commerce sites and bank online, but the stuff that Intuit has buried in TurboTax in order to use this offer is over-the-top bad business. Amazon is not the one making this offer, and they really should get the heck out of it. Intuit is not your friend, they are in the business of selling your data.
5	1391990400	I've used TurboTax for the past 5 years, and love how the software breaks down the tax code into simple easy-to-answer questions.  I highly recommend to anyone that is willing to put in a couple of hours of work versus paying an accountant $200-300 to do the same thing.I only had one issue with the 2013 version of this software, which I've never experienced in the past.  After completing my tax return, and attempting to electronically submit to the IRS, the program gave me an error and would not send the return.  In the TurboTax help forums, I found that many Mac users had the same issue.  Luckily, it was a simple fix.  Just had to save the return, completely close out of TurboTax, and reopen the saved document.  It then allowed me to successfully transmit the tax return.
5	1391990400	It's Turbo tax. In a box.  What else is there to say?Well, if you have used turbo tax in the past, you know what I am saying so move on.  Same thing, same TT, same state filing, same &#34;free&#34; Federal filing.If you haven't used it in the past then here is my 4 cents (Yes, price is up). It is easy to use, well organized, and works for most people.  No need to pay for a tax accountant.  I have a friend that is a tax accountant but I'm sorry friend this is enough for the average worker.  If you only have a job (or 2) and clearly &#34;labeled&#34; dependents, no fancy investment accounts then this will work well. It will even handle modest investment accounts, multiple homes, basic rental property, and multiple incomes.  If you get too complicated then get a tax accountant.  Federal e-file is covered with turbo tax which is a $14.95 fee (last year) and you get 1 free state tax form (you pay for the e-file).
5	1391990400	I really like Turbo Tax.  I have been using it every since it came out.  Don't really remember, but I think about 20 years.  It is very easy, accurate and if you need help it is available.  I have recommended it to many friends and members of my family.  Once you enter the basic info, you don't have to ever input it again.  It just picks it up from last year.  A great time saver.
2	1391990400	A couple of points I need to make clear to anyone who is going to get this. I could have had this done online, but thanks to a line I received about a 1099-C I went with this product that went along with the online statement the software could handle the form.When a line comes up during your filling out the forms stating something like you may need a tax preparer instead of this software (gee, the description everywhere I looked on TurboTax said Deluxe handled it, thanks for letting me know this after the fact I spent $50 on this): Click on the Forms tab and see if there isn't something in the section you're working in that will give you the option to place an x or clear one.Line 6 on the product page states: TurboTax Deluxe only includes State product with purchase of TurboTax Deluxe Fed, E-File, and State 2013.Not what came up when I went to finish up. It was wanting $19.99 to e-File State. Very very very misleading. I found out later there's a link one could go to for a free efile from TurboTax. Not one word, hint, nothing from the software that this exists. I am not paying anything additional when I paid $50 just to file Fed for free. What a joke.
5	1391990400	If you have basic computer skills, can read and follow directions, you can do your own taxes with Turbo Tax.  Been using it since 2005 without a single hiccup and I'm not a finance or math wizard!  Even if you need to account for a variety of investment and rental property transactions, one of the various Turbo Tax Editions will simplify it for you and confidently walk you through the entire process.  Intuit is truly the 800 lb. gorilla of the do-it-yourself  tax filing industry.  Why do you think H & R Block decided to enter this tax software business?  That's right, Turbo Tax has been eating their lunch!  Every year, fewer customers are boxing up their W2s, 1099s and receipts and heading into their seasonal storefront offices for help?  Folks are staying away in droves, saving their money and doing it at home in an hour or two (longer for more complex returns).  Once you do it the first time, future years will be a breeze.  With Turbo Tax, I'd estimate that 80-90% of all taxpayers can handle their State and Federal filings themselves since nearly every contingency imaginable is covered in their non-intimidating, layman's terms, step-by-step format.
4	1391990400	I don't want to always provide a comment.  This requirement should go away, or I'll start ignoring requests to review your products.
2	1391904000	In the past I used H&R block.  I was very satisfied.  I downloaded Turbotax and tried the import feature.  Unfortunately it didn't work.  I lost my payment and ended up purchasing the H&R Block program.
1	1391904000	I have used Turbo Tax for years and, in spite of some of the annoyances of getting it to install or update, I have been reasonably happy. I mean IE is no party and neither are some upgrades to Microsoft. Problems are to be expected at sometime or another. However, when I tried to transfer my 2012 return, it was only partially completed. I thought it strange and looked at the date I had submitted my taxes.The taxes were submitted 4/4/13. I know this because I have my email telling me this. The folder for turbo tax 2012 forms shows last change as 4/4/13. the only form I could find was from 2/23/13. Consequently, I can redo my taxes from 2012 or I can pay $50 to get them from the IRS!!! Really Turbo Tax! I am done with this product after this year. Any suggestions on better programs would be appreciated.
4	1391904000	I installed this on a Mac (OS 10.9.x).  The software is easy to use, with step by step questions to walk you through getting the best refund.Be careful when upgrading though as I had to start over after an upgrade because the program would no longer load.
5	1391904000	Good soft wear and it saved me lots of dollars good if you put in correct information. Good good good
1	1391904000	Turbo tax will not import my previous years data from website, without purchase of turbotax. Which I did purchase but I did it from amazon instead of them.Now I have been on chat waiting for a person to join me going on two hours. Phone number is buried, did find it and no one ever answers.I am pissed I wasted my money on such a terrible program.
5	1391904000	Unless your taxes are very complicated, or other, this really does the job nicely, and transfers all the basic data from one year to the next, so saves a lot of repetitive leg work.
5	1391904000	Have used turbo tax for about 12+ years. Very good program. Have CTEC certification so I know what is needed.
2	1391904000	This is the first time I have used TurboTax and probably will be the last.  I have used H&R Tax Cut for years and felt like it did a very thorough job walking me through step by step  With TurboTax I had to search for items that I knew should be included.  The worksheet for charitable deductions takes too much time for what should be easy entries.  Also, I didn't like Rental property section and I'm still not sure I got all the deductions I normally take.  I do not feel confident with my final return created by TurboTax and now I have to go through it manually to make sure it's correct.  Next year, I'm using H & R's product.
5	1391817600	I have used several different tax softwares over the years, but have settled on this one since it seems to work well for all that I need to do with my taxes. The interface is easy to follow, allowing you to take things in order or jump around to where you want to work. It also allows manual overrides of data should that ever be needed.
5	1391817600	I used to do my taxes by hand. without TurboTax. that was about 7 years ago,  TurboTax year after year made it easy for me.
5	1391817600	HAVE USED TURBOTAX FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND AM IMPRESSED. EASY TO USE AND HAVE HAD NEVER HAD ANY  PROBLEMS.
2	1391817600	Works good for the forms but costs an extra $49 to file! The $49 price tag turned into $100. My parents pay $59 for their attorney to do their taxes and efile for them.
2	1391817600	It is very disappointing that as of Feb. 8 the Sales Tax deduction section of this software has still not been implemented so that the purchaser can complete and file Income Tax.  Notice on site states that IRS was delayed in completing information but that it would be available by 12/12/2013.  Six weeks later, the sales tax info which was promised for Dec 31 is still not part of the software nor is there any provision for keying in one's own choice for amount as per using the figure from the previous year.  There is also no update on timing provided to the taxpayer by Intuit.I am disappointed in this service.Mary L. Hallatt
4	1391817600	I have used Turbo Tax for many years and will probably use it in the future. I needed it early to make sure my estimated tax were falling in line because of extra ordinary transactions in 2013. Turbo Tax came through as expected.
4	1391817600	I have used Turbo Tax for some time and think it is the best way to go.  It is simple to use and makes tax return time almost enjoyable.
4	1391817600	I have used Turbo tax since 1999. This year for some reason their software has issues with locking up on Windows 7. I went on their website to find answers and did not find anything to resolve my issues with a 64bit system. I did the registry clean and manually edited my registry, uninstall the program, reinstalling the program, changed UAC settings, etc., really wasting a lot of time.I really do not know if intuit really knows or we can further and say care if the program is working correctly or not, but there is a way, the long way.If you have windows 7 64bit professional or ultimate, you can download Microsoft's program Virtual PC. Once you do that, then you can download the virtual PC Windows XP mode. This loads windows XP OS within your Windows 7 OS and it is like having another computer within a computer. The arduous problem is, you have to update the OS from windows update site like if the OS was a new install on a PC. Once you have ran the update several times and everything seems to be completely updated, ensure you do a custom update and install the Net Framework 4.0. Turbo tax needs it to run.Since the Virtual XP mode is like another PC, it connects to the internet and everything else like a PC, just a few minor differences on the desktop. So you need to have PC protection, really, you are doing taxes. You can install your latest antivirus software from your Windows 7 side of your desktop or you can download, like I did, windows security essentials, install it, update it.Once my Virtual XP was completely updated and windows security essentials updated and a quick scan ran, ensure your firewall is on, once everything is loaded, sometimes it takes a minute for Virtual XP to allow you internet access, program is trying run, so give it time,then I loaded Turbo Tax.One additional thing I did in the security essentials program was, I opened the program, went to the firewall settings and added Turbo Tax as an exclusion for the firewall. So there would not be any hic-cups with program updating and downloads.I still had my file from the turbo tax load on the windows 7 side, so I simply copy and paste to the Windows XP virtual side to my documents.When Turbo tax starts, it has "lets begin" for a new return, if you start new, then click on this, but in my case I already completed 3/4 of my tax return and the problem in windows 7 kept locking up, so you should select open file and go to the location you saved your turbo tax file in the virtual PC part.I completed my taxes and e-filed it already. No problems with the Turbo Tax program. You will have to open the virtual PC portion to check you e-file status or since you have an email, just look at your email on you regular desktop side without opening the VPC.To close the virtual PC, you will have to look at the top of the desktop and select shutdown, it shuts down like a PC, but only the virtual PC portion. Once taxes are completed, save and remove your information on VPC. You can keep the VPC for future use, it is handy.Hope this helps some people.Oh, one last thing, My PC is not a dud, it is a MSI Dragon Laptop.
5	1391817600	THIS IS THE BEST AND EASIEST WAY TO COMPLETE INCOME TAXES. I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT! ALE L YOU NEED TO DO IS GATHER THE NEEDED INFO AND PLUG IT INTO THE SOFTWARE AND YOUR DONE!
5	1391817600	Please see Bob's comment. He showed me where to find and enter the state  estimated tax. I really appreciate the help and now recommend TurboTax without reservation. (I had thought there was no place in the Massachusetts state return to enter state estimated taxes already paid over the course of 2013, for the tax year 2013.) Bob explained that the state estimated taxes are entered in the federal section since they can be considered a federal deduction. This now solves my problem. Many thanks,  Turbotax!
4	1391817600	I have used this for several years both Federal and State. It is easy to transfer everything from the previous year which saves time in preparing my taxes.
5	1391817600	Always is the best choice - happy to work with this software every year.Buy it, learn it and do your own taxes.
5	1391817600	I have been using this software for several years now and am happy with it getting me through the tax process.
5	1391817600	Been using for years.  It is a super must have must use.And they improve it every year.  Sounds like I work for them.  I surely do not.
5	1391817600	I have been a Quicken and TurboTax user for decades. It is hard for me to embrace other packages -- and I've tried only because I'm naturally curious about what else might be out there. The quality of their software, ease of use and comprehensive offering keeps me coming back year after year.
1	1391817600	TurboTax cost my family thousands of dollars, between two different tax years in which it did not calculate a tax credit correctly, and we had to go back and pay our state tax commission when the state's computer finally noticed the error.  Thousands of dollars.  For a credit that, when we discovered the problem, we learned could not possibly, under any circumstances, have been what TurboTax allowed to be submitted to the state.  Think about that before trusting this software very much.  That wasn't the only mistake it made, just the one that was extremely damaging.Subsequent edit: See comments for more info.
5	1391731200	Very complete and well-designed product to help one do a suberb job of preparing taxes.  First class, and helps one understand the components of a tax filing.
5	1391731200	This is my first time using TurboTax, and I was very impressed.  It led you through everything step-by-step and made it very clear what you need to do.  Everything was in lay-man's terms and extremely understandable.  It made e-filing very easy and always keeps you on top of the status of your return.  I was able to print out my return before filing to make sure everything was correct.  I don't have a very complicated tax return - just W-2s and itemized deductions - and this software worked extremely well.
5	1391731200	Turbo Tax is easy to use and I like it.  But in years past, I always bought it on Amazon because if I kept checking the price, there would always be a better deal on a different day.  This year, prices stayed the same, and it's the same as in B&M stores, so next time, I will buy it at the store so I don't have to wait for a delivery.  I do recommend the product, tho.
2	1391731200	I selected download my brokerage data and turbo tax pop-up indicated it was complete.  Only later did I find that no data had been downloaded.  I found this out when reviewing my forms there were no schedule related to purchasing and selling stock such as capital gains/loss info.I am very disappointed with turbotax as it did not highlight or indicate that the brokerage download did not work.  I found on Fidelity's website a statement by fidelity that it's tax forms/data would not be available until Feb 18th.  This explains what happened simply fidelity website did not have the data prepared yet.  Turbotax should indicate if brokerage download does not occur.
3	1391731200	Everything was going great.  I filled out all of the information for my Federal return and it was complete.  Then came time to download the state (Virginia) forms.  Once they downloaded, Turbo Tax quit immediately.  I tried to reopen the program, only to have it crash again.  After searching online, I found many people with this problem.  Turbo Tax has yet to fix the issue and update the software.  I have used Turbo Tax for may years and have never had a problem until now, which is why I gave a three star rating.  Had this been my first time using TT, I would give it a single star.  I am using TT on my Macbook.  I don't know if the same problem is happening for PC users.
5	1391731200	Again, product loads fast, pulls together last year's info, and off we go to our annual game of beating the system
5	1391731200	Turbo Tax does it again...I can do my taxes quickly and easily.  Year after year, I trust Turbo Tax...Thank you Turbo Tax!
5	1391731200	I have been using Turbo Tax for many years. I am self-employed and prefer to do my own taxes. Turbo Tax is easy to use.
5	1391731200	It walks you through the entire process step by step.  It asks questions so you don't forget to claim something even if you didn't know you were entitled.  One great thing is that you don't have to do the whole thing in one sitting.  You can enter some data and save, then shut down and come back later and continue where you left off.  .
4	1391731200	Does my taxes for just $39 after discount. Can't get much better than that! Even tells me what my chances of getting audited are.
4	1391731200	I've used Turbo Tax for years, it's still the best I've found after trying others along the way. Easy to use and it remembers your data from one year to the next if you don't remove the program from your computer. Good product.
5	1391731200	Great as usual.  Dont usually ever rate things but TurboTax deserves the rating.  Have been using it for a long time now and it never disappoints.
3	1391731200	Many early filers of 2013 returns who used Turbo Tax experienced a delay on refunds this year. For those who filed early and expect a refund, and were "Accepted," there has been slow progress. According to TT user Nikki Torscha (TT blog), there was a glitch "processing for returns accepted 1/26-1/28 ... This is what I have been seeing ... WMR [IRS Where's My Return] reset some of the Refund Statuses back to the beginning... as if it was just submitted. Spoke with IRS and IRS confirmed that DDD for those individuals would be 2/12 - Wednesday..." Our thanks to this TT user for the alert. It does look like things are moving along now, that all this will be resolved shortly; TT has performed well for us in the past. Good luck!
3	1391731200	I've used TurboTax (and it's predecessor) for over 20 years.  Mostly a great product.  This year I had considerable difficulty loading it.  It finally loaded when I downloaded the &#34;fix&#34; and took the program disc out of the computer when reloading.  Apparently I wasn't the only one with this problem.  It sounds like a programming problem to me.
5	1391731200	I have used this version for 6 or 7 years. It is simple to use, gets me my best legal return, easy to file both Federal & State.
5	1391731200	Have been using Turbo tax for years, have always been happy with the result. I would recommend to others. Good product.
1	1391644800	THERE WAS NO REFUND BONUS.ITS BOGUS CLAIM.THIS WAS A CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING.TURBO TAX SHOULD LIVE UP TO ADVERTISMENT OR YOU SHOULD REFUND PURCHASE PRICE.
2	1391644800	Well I always check Amazon first and I bought this over using Turbo Tax's website because of the 10% bonus and what I thought was a free state refund... Well I paid $39.99 for this and then the program charged me an additional $49.98. I love TurboTax and like how it works but next year I'll just use there website.
5	1391644800	I've used TurboTax Deluxe for many years and like it a lot.  I'm self-employed and have to file Schedule C. That's included in the Deluxe version, so no need to pay more for the Home & Business version. This version also includes a download of your state income tax software and forms.
5	1391644800	This is the first year I have used Turbo Tax and I can say it has been above and beyond easy. My sister talked me into using it, as she has used it for years. My tax preparer has retired so I wasn't quite sure where to turn to next. So flawless, the hardest thing was organizing all the forms or waiting to receive them in the mail or email. I am very organized so it was the waiting that was hard.So happy with the decision to use this.
5	1391644800	I HAVE BEEN USING TURBO TAX FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS TO DO MY TAXES, AND NEVER HAD ANYPROBLEMS, SO THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEED.  ARRIVED IN A SHORT TIME THANKS TO AMAZON.
1	1391644800	TT has made it more difficult to enter stock and mutual fund data unless you pat $30 more to get Premier version.
5	1391644800	I'm not a numbers person but using TurboTax is the best thing ever.  I have been using it for about five years now and it walks you through every situation possible. I love it!  I also do it for my mom and it saves us a lot of money. I definitely recommend it.
5	1391644800	TurboTax maintains a history of my taxes for 5 years running.  By preventing mistakes, it has allowed me to prepare many complex returns without errors, resulting in no IRS audits.  The seamless transfer of Federal data to my state tax return and the included e-File are great features.  TurboTax allows me to prepare my returns in my own time, bit by bit, rather than to have to gather all my data to take to a preparer.  Also I can examine how each entry impacts my total return and eliminates errors in arithmetic. I will use it for all future tax returns.
5	1391644800	I have used TurboTax since it first came out. One year I decided to switch to another brand (xxxxx) and that was a mistake.After getting frustrated and even after I paid $50 for the &#34;other&#34; tax program, I went out and purchased TurboTax for the same year.Ahhhh...........relief.Just get TurboTax and get your taxes done easily.  No, I do not work for, or were paid by Intuit. Just my opinion.
1	1391644800	Last year the program would run using the SP3 spoof and doing a manual update. This year it will install, it will take the manual update, but then the program will not run. There's no excuse for a tax program needing the latest hardware. This software is an overpriced scam. I will be returning it and looking for a new tax program.
4	1391644800	I love turbo tax, I really do.  What I strongly dislike is the amount of time it takes to have state forms available.  I know this is not necessarily turbo tax's fault, however, due to having to file by mail this year because of an unexpected rebate, I have to wait until tomorrow (Feb. 7th) to print my state forms, even though they are currently available to e-file.  If they're available for e-file, why couldn't I print them?  It doesn't make any sense to me.  Like I said, this is not completely turbo tax's fault.  It's a great product and I will continue to buy it each year despite my stupid state forms taking so long.
4	1391558400	In over 20 years, I've never done my own taxes. I've always paid a CPA. This year I decided to try to do them myself.  It was actually pretty easy!  I'll do it again next year for sure.  Turbo Tax really is user-friendly.
2	1391558400	Well....does everyone know that it does not support electronic filing for the state of Virginia?  I could have bought the cheaper version.  :(
5	1391558400	This is worth a lot more. Doing our taxes have never been easier. The program take you through all possible tax questions and helps you get the best return or payment. You can start your taxes as soon as you start getting your tax information. The program double check you enteries and helps you make corrections. The best part is I don't have to pay an accountant to do the work.
2	1391558400	I've used TurboTax since 2009 and never had any issues...until this year.  I bought the mac CD (desktop) version and once installed, the program would not work.  It simply would say that the application quit unexpectedly.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling with the same result.  Did a search in the TurboTax help forums and did turn off &#34;File Sharing&#34; (as recommended).  This did not help.On the help forum, it stated that I could wait 15 minutes to chat online with a customer service rep or 5 minutes via phone.  I selected phone, received my incident number, and called.  One hour later, I was speaking to a live person.Now, I will say the support rep was VERY helpful and friendly.  We tried the uninstall/reinstall route to no avail.  After setting up an online account, the support rep provided a download version of the Deluxe 2013.  After downloading and installing, the same error occurred as the CD version.  After placing me on hold to investigate further, the customer rep said that others have come across a similar issue (this was just the first time she has seen it).  Since there was no ETA on a fix, she provided a code that would enable me to file using the Deluxe online version.  I felt that this was a decent compromise.After spending 2+ hours on this (between attempting to install, on hold, and troubleshooting with Intuit), I called it a night with the plan to start again online today.  I start submitting my personal info and move onto income.  Even online, it's very easy to import W-2 information (if your employer provides this service).  My next step is for stock transfer through Employee Stock Purchase (Form 3922).  TurboTax Deluxe online stops me and says that if I want to enter Schedule D, I would need to upgrade to TurboTax Premier.Again, this is my 5th year using TurboTax and I've never needed Premier; Deluxe always fit my needs.  After a quick search, I find out that TurboTax Deluxe Online does not include Schedule D.  TurboTax Deluxe desktop does include Schedule D.  UGH!The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because the support rep was helpful and I will gladly adjust if any one could provide further assistance on the issue with the desktop version.  Otherwise, very disappointed with the 2013 version.
5	1391558400	I have being using TurboTax for a long time.  It is easy to use.  it carries over prior year information that save time to retype recurrent tax items.  E-files both my federal and state returns without much hassle.  And it is much cheaper than going to a payprepayer.
5	1391558400	I have brought this product for the last 5 years great value. Simple and easy to use. Always accurate. I would recommend.
5	1391558400	lets face it..its idiot proof. I buy every year  and get a nice tax return. its too expensive hence the 4 star review
5	1391558400	I have used Turbo Tax for years and it has always done well for me. I own my home (mortgaged still) both my wife and I work and both have Roth 401k's. It goes over all the areas we need and I do my taxs in a hour to two. Best part is no paying some 3rd person to do what I can do.
5	1391558400	I have been doing my taxes with TurboTax for years. It gets information from your year before to save filling out general information. I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1391558400	I've used TurboTax for several years, and wouldn't want to be without it!  It's quick and easy -- but of course you have to have the information readily available to feed the beast.
4	1391558400	This year the good folks at Intuit decided they wanted to force everyone to agree to buy the stupid Audit Defense product.  You cannot efile without agreeing to pay for it.  THEY MAKE YOU BUY IT THEN GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT TO CANCEL IT!  AND THIS IS NOT DISCLOSED ON THE PACKAGE.  VERY UNDERHANDED AND UNETHICAL COMPANY TO DEAL WITH. The software itself is fine, and acurate.  4 stars for the software.  The owners or whatever that decided that you MUST PAY  FOR THE AUDIT DEFENSE FIRST ARE MORONS.  (i'm posting about the &#34;hidden&#34; added cost of the software on every site I am a member of, since INTUIT decided to be underhanded cowards in their hiding the true cost of the software).  Truely pathetic business practices.  I'll go back to doing my taxes the old way before agreeing to pay them one dime more than I do for the software.
1	1391558400	I've used TurboTax for 30 years without any problems. I have spent hours trying to install 2013 Deluxe without any success.  The claim is that it will work with XP 3 and yet it keeps trying to repair something without leaving any tracks as to what it might be changing or what the exact problem might be. This version is a failure.
5	1391558400	I have been a faithful user of TurboTax.  The download is easily to follow.  Once the program is open, the questions walk you through the whole process of doing your taxes.
3	1391558400	I have been using TurboTax for about 6 or 7 years, and encountered some glitches. I could not manually enter a state deduction for my defined pension contribution. Then, when attempting to file my federal return, a message indicated the 1040 and Sch.A forms had not beenupdated, although the IRS website had the forms for some time. There appears to be no customer service phone number to receive TurboTax assistance. Inexplicably, I was able to file the following day. I will consider another tax prep/filing product next year.
4	1391472000	Great product -a standard software purchase every year to assist in completing one's annual taxes - easy installation and product updating.
5	1391472000	same as every yr i get it as i have been doing for over 20 yrs works just fine but buy it as cheap as u can
5	1391472000	Haven't finished my taxes yet but this program is most helpful.....Purchasing it throughout Amazon was easy,  the price was right and  ....
5	1391472000	Easy and fast.  Every year they improve it.  I have no idea how they can make it better, but I am sure next years will be better yet.
5	1391472000	UPDATE: I imported data from 2012 TurboTax to 2013 but the software has a GLITCH - it altered the birth date of the primary taxpayer to 01/01/year.  When I filed electronically, both federal & state were REJECTED due to the birth date not matching the Social Security database.  Users will receive an email with the message Your federal return has been rejected.  Here's the problem with your return:F1040-525-01 - You did not enter either a Date of Birth or Date of Death for the Primary Taxpayer.I was on hold for sixty minutes with TurboTax while I was searching its site for questions and found a bunch of other users with the same problem.  While you can check your filing status by bringing up TurboTax and selecting check status, and can change the birth date and then refile, it is a problem that users should be aware of since it is a simple matter to check the birth dates, or any other data that has been imported from last year.  I was just so used to not encountering any issues that I failed to even look at the data.  Just passing this issue along....I've used TurboTax for years without issue.  I tried Tax Cut (I think it was called that) many years ago and quickly returned to TurboTax.  The interview style is slightly tedious for me when there are no changes in my return except the amounts, but I truly appreciate it when I do have changes.  I like the old TurboTax better where I could just go to a page so easily and type my entry - it seems more difficult to do this now, or maybe my brain is just slower after all these years.  I also like the link with It's Deductible.  Highly recommended!
3	1391472000	For doing a Federal and state return, the product is great and I've been using it (starting with MacInTax) for more than 20 years. It is easy to use and gets easier with each year as it picks up the previous year's entries. Nothing but good things to say here as my taxes are very straightforward 1040A stuff.As long as one does not need to actually interact with Inuit all is well.My experience with Intuit's customer support is that it is virtually non-existent. An hour plus wait on hold, a nice but poorly trained support technician and then a disconnect. Their forums are filled with unanswered questions and their support pages are worse than useless due to the difficulty in navigating them.If you generally fare well with software and never seem to need help I do recommend this product. On the other hand, if you are one of those unfortunate tech support lightening rods, then you may want to see if any competing product has a better service reputation.
5	1391472000	I have used Turbo Tax for many years and the Deluxe version for the 2013 tax year is great. User friendly with some user friendly features not previously on other tax years. I am able to look at every area of my tax return with guided detail and with confidence in knowing the information is accurate.
5	1391472000	This is my fourth year in a row using TurboTax. It makes doing taxes for myself and kids a snap. It pulls in last years information to save some time. I love it and will continue getting in every year.
5	1391472000	Found it much easier and was able to complete the matter in a very short time. Will continue to use it  next year.
5	1391472000	i buy this every year  turbo tax is much better than going to a tax person.  it saves much money.
5	1391472000	Easiest way ever to do taxes; makes year to year tansitions so much easier. Fast and simple returns. Quickest way to get your tax return is to e-file with TurboTax.
5	1391472000	If you click for explanations of unusual things you don't normally need it is easy to understand.I like it.
5	1391472000	I've used TurboTax for years to file my return and those of several family members.  It is simple and easy to follow
4	1391472000	I haven't had any trouble with the program in the last few years, but I did experience difficulties some years ago when the state program did not produce one of the forms that my state requires - repeated contacts with their tech service produced a number of ineffective suggestions, and eventually a promise to look into the problem - but no results.I've never tried e-filing.
5	1391472000	What a Terrific product at a great price. I have been using Turbo Tax for over 10 years and love it. H & R Block has nothing on Turbo Tax.
5	1391472000	I have used this since year 2000. It works and it is simple to use. Make sure you have all your documents ready and you will get an accurate tax refund. AAA+++
5	1391472000	Well, I have been using TT for three years now and have been very satisfied.  It gets me a decent return every year.  For most tax situations, this software makes filing taxes a breeze.  It take you through the process step by step, and doesn't miss a thing when it comes to finding tax breaks.  Why pay someone to do my taxes when I can do it myself  for a lot less with TT.  Thanks, Amazon, for giving Prime members a price break on this great software.
5	1391385600	If you have never used TurboTax before, you are in for a treat!  I've used it for years and would not do my taxes without it.
4	1391385600	really good and covers most situations. Kind of confusing if you need to amend a return or have a special situation. I had some problems with the 1040x & 540x forms. Had to research on my own to find the answers needed then try to get the Turbo Tax software to help me fill out some information correctly. I've been using Turbo Tax for over 5 years now. I would recommended to most.
5	1391385600	Turbo Tax makes preparing my taxes much easier in some ways, although I feel that sometimes I don't understand exactly where/how I should be entering some things because I'm not as deep into the tax instructions as I used to get (before I used Turbo Tax).  I like the deluxe version because we usually give items to Goodwill, Disabled American Vets, and other similar charities each year and it has a good feature that gives items a value.  The value it gives is higher than what I would give them (I'm always very conservative about how I claim things for taxes), so I'm hoping it is ok.  I've been using it for 4 years now and plan to continue.  The only thing I dislike is that we have to pay extra to e-file the state return.  Also, since we have a business interest in another state, we have to pay pretty much the same price for that one additional state that we paid for the entire Deluxe+state package.  There should be a more cost-effective way of doing that.  Although it is still much cheaper than if we went to one of the tax preparation businesses.
3	1391385600	2013 Turbo Tax seems to work much like the previous TT that I have used(6).  I am still not happy to have to pay for (one) state filing but the product, at least for me, works. .
5	1391385600	I have been using turbo tax since it came out. this is the exact same thing as you would buy anywhere. the price was right with a $10 discount for being a prime user. also I think it will give me a bonus on the refund if I have one. Last year I purchased a new I mac and got the quicken essentials for it, but the turbotax was overpriced. this year I bought it from amazon and purchased the hard disk because I wanted to load it later. It can be downloaded from the site if you like. best tax software available. I do my taxes on it and forward to my accountant to verify.
5	1391385600	Easy, simple to use, no hassles.  Used it for decades and continues to cover all my tax-related needs and situations.
4	1391385600	I like using TurboTax b/c it is easy to use, but it is a bit expensive considering that I can do a federal tax (1040EZ) via the IRS website for free; the NJ State income tax is a pain so I did both using TurboTax.  Just load the disk and answer the questions - very easy.  If you have lots of deductions, children, medical expenses etc, TurboTax may actually be a great buy!!!
4	1391385600	Easier to use each year.  Updates easy to get, download and use.  Good help screens. Start to finish easy to use and fast efile.
1	1391385600	I bought the Deluxe addition because it included the state taxes. However, I found out after the fact that I had to pay an additional 19.99 just to file the state taxes. I was shocked that filing the state taxes was not included in the Deluxe edition, when it seemed clear on the package, at least to me, that it was. Our taxes are pretty simple (form 1040) and Turbo tax made a mess of our taxes. The program was NOT user friendly. We have now paid 19.99 additional plus the 60.00 for the turbo tax and now we have to go and get our taxes done by an actual person for an additional 500.00. I will NEVER buy anything from Turbo Tax again and will be sure to share the details of this experience with all my friends for years to come.
3	1391385600	I've used TT for years, and have been greatly annoyed with the increased efforts to upsell within the product I've purchased.  They are constantly focusing on the &#34;refund&#34; in their messages, as if TT is going to magically make one happen.  At one point, it was determined I would not receive credit for my student loan interest, $0 was displayed, and the message indicated I &#34;just saved a bundle&#34; off my tax bill.Just stick with the mechanics of processing my taxes.  Stop dumbing down in order to trick and mislead people!  This is likely the last year I'll be using TT, as rivals have created much simpler and cheaper programs.
5	1391385600	I love TurboTax. I have been using it for my taxes for years and it always walks me through every life change and every deduction to make sure I am getting back the most money.
3	1391385600	I like the ease of the interview questions and the links when you have more questions. It is less expensive than going to a tax advisor.
5	1391385600	Have used TurboTax for more than 10 years & I've never been disappointed!  I'd recommend it to anyone for it's ease of use & help available in every part of the software.  It's great!
1	1391385600	Will not update with windows 8. Support is not helpful. After years of use we will look to something else next time since you cannot file without the updates. You need Microsoft Framework 4.0 to use the product and Windows 8 comes with 4.5.
5	1391385600	I've used TurboTax to file both Fed and State taxes for more than thirty years.  It has always been the most accurate when computing your refund, and the easiest to use.  Never had a problem with it.
3	1391385600	Every few years I pick up this package, usually in conjunction with a Quicken rebate.  The tool meets the needs this year.  I stopped using it years ago due to amortization of points on a mortgage refinance problem, at least on the web version.This year, it works as expected by asking a lot of questions about what you have and what you need.  I wish that it would allow for collapsible steps.  After each question in the set, the results are logged and your tally towards completing this set of questions is displayed.  But, you now have to scroll down to get to the next page button.  After. Every. Question.  I would suggest that they either start thumbnailling the sets, instead of reprinting the entire set every time, or maybe just put a button at the top of the list.  Yes, it is intended to make you review the list.  But after the ninth time, it is a bit redundant.
5	1391385600	I recently purchased the Turbo Tax Deluxe Fed, Efile and State 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer.  On the last of January, 2014 I had recieved all of the required information to file my 2013 Taxes.  I filed on the 27th and on the 30th, I had received an email stating that the IRS had accepted my filing, but they did not start reviewing until the 31st.  I have usde TurboTax for 3 years now, and my Refunds each year have been higher than when I filed by long hand.  I personally have filed longhand, since 1968, but after I began using using Turbax, my Refund from Federal and State have increased.The first time that I used TurboTax, it was a little hard for me, but now, it is very easy to use and it takes you step by step through your Taxes.  I also give the Folks that sit down and put all the required information on the discs a Five Star rating, they are excellent in putting all the information together and is 100% correct. The first two years, there were four separate families that utilized the TurboTax and so far this year two families have used the 2013 version.I would highly recommend to anyone I am in contact with to use TurboTax to file their Taxes.  I only had one complaint or question and that was when I completed my information imput and filed the Federal Taxes, it wanted to know if I wanted to file my State Taxes.  However, when I started to file, it stated that I would be charged $19.99 to file the State Taxes, and I was the first to file.  The program states that one person can file their State Taxes free so I just mailed the State Taxes to the State.  Why would the program show that you had to pay the State the $19.99, if you was the first to file the State Taxes? Thanks..... Charles in WV.
5	1391299200	Thank you! Good product year after year, doing taxes at home or myself  is a convenience I really like, good software product.
5	1391299200	I have been doing my own taxes the last two years with this software and I have to say TurboTax takes the intimidation out of doing your taxes.  The program covers all kinds of different situations people are filing under.  For example:  Married filing separately or jointly, Purchased a home, moved for employment, have a home office, and much more.  Doing my taxes this year was a breeze, because Turbo Tax imported a lot of saved data from last year.  The help file is extremely informative and explains what things mean.  It even tells you if what you are looking at is not common for most situations.  Turbo Tax even offers audit protection like most tax preparation companies.  I used HnR Block for years and I'm seeing the same returns using TurboTax.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  Just try it one year.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  I had my taxes done as soon as I received all my 1099's and my W-2.  By February 1st the federal government had already approved my return.  You won't leave your money in the governments hands with this program, state or federal.
3	1391299200	The description is very ambiguous, I suspect on purpose so that one buys more than needed.I've purchased TT for several years. The Deluxe version has always included Schedule C (NOT talking about Schedule C-EZ).  But now I can't tell from the Amazon description.  I recall having this question every year but eventually figured it out...can't they just list what forms are in the download/PC versions instead of saying something like "enhanced Schedule C advice"?  I don't need more advice, but I don't qualify for the Schedule C-EZ either.The Intuit site isn't any help either.More confusing that it should be.[edit after tax season 2014 in case someone looks at this in 2015:  Yes, it includes Schedule C, just as it has for years.  If you don't need "enhanced schedule C advice" then it's fine.  It was for us.  We have a simple business .... money in, expenses out, and no home deductions or depreciation or employees.  If you have all of that, then "Home and Business" (or a professional) is probably for you. ]
5	1391299200	Turbo Tax is easy to use. It has the capability of importing W2 from places like ADP. Run a good test of any errors that it will find. Love it
4	1391299200	I retired this year and TurboTax reminded me to list my medical expenses.  Just missed but should be able to next year.
5	1391299200	I have been using TurboTax for the longest time. It has always gotten better each year. The one feature I wish they would do is to alphabetize the Charity Deductions that are imported from the previous year. I donate to about two dozen charities. It would be faster to update them.
1	1391299200	The only reason I use TT is that I've used it in the past, so there's no compatibility problems with another program.  It does the job, but just barely and it's certainly not worth the $50.00+ it sells for.Problems--1.  VERY slow to open; takes about a minute.  This problem is present every year.2.  VERY slow to update; updates take much longer than it says.  This problem is present every year.3.  VERY slow to move from page to page; this problem is new this year.4.  Prints out Cyrillic letters when I try to print out a return.  A page or 2 prints out find, the rest prints out in a language that I think is cyrillic.  No, I don't live in Russia and this problem has been present for several years.5.  Despite the fact that the 1040 worksheets show me as a 3rd party designee on the returns, my name & phone # do not appear.  When I put in this info. by overridding, TT won't allow the return to be electronically filed.  It tells me I &#34;should&#34; change the overriding, but it doesn't tell me I HAVE to.  No further explanation is given.6.  I try to rate the program from the link when I done a return and the web page won't load.  I guess Intuit doesn't want to know what the program's users really think.I think it's S---!!!
4	1391299200	We use this every year to file or taxes. This year was our first time itemizing. There were some questions that I felt uncertain of despite turbo tax's explanations. Overall, happy though, and did more research outside of the software.
1	1391299200	This software claims to be easy to use and so forth. But it was actually very confusing and it didn't provide clear directions in plain simple english. There were some items that it didn't even ask about in the way i thought it would. I actually had to go to another website to do my taxes there that was totally free and it was so much easier to use and figure up. But then i went back to turbotax and then for some reason it finally decided to ask me things in plain english. If best buy, who I bought the software from,would have given me a refund, i would have taken it back. But I ended up doing the final filing with turbotax since I couldn't get a refund. This was the last time I will touch this worthless software.
5	1391299200	Have used TurboTax for many years and have never had a problem with it.  I think it's the best one on the market.
1	1391299200	This was falsely advertised.  I ended up paying an additional $59.98 in fees in order to file electronically for both Federal and State filings.  So save yourself the extra cost and just use the web version.  I am so disgusted, because it says plus Federal E-File, but you still have to pay.  I had to pay more last year to file than this year and I made less money last year.  Disgusting.  Disappointing.
5	1391299200	This was the first time I've used TurboTax. I normally use a CPA. This was very easy to follow. The program walks you through every step and explains it as you go. I'm fairly computer savvy, but think this would be very simple for anyone to use. I highly recommend it and will be using this in the future.
2	1391299200	I've been using TurboTax since 1997, but this could well be my last year. The drill is pretty consistent year to year, so I can get through it quickly with some upfront organization - like reviewing credit card statements, checkbook register, and investment statements then consolidating my deductions and investment income in an Excel spreadsheet before starting TT. I'm usually ready to file after the first week of January, but end up waiting until February for everyone else to get their act together - whether it is the IRS  or Intuit updating their software or banking institutions that take too long printing out forms with numbers that were already well accrued for the year - everyone seems to have an excuse.I've successfully used the TT e-file to get my Federal taxes in this year. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to submit my Arizona taxes at the same time due to Intuit not having Form 140 completed. The software says I can't file, but gives no indication when this will be resolved - just check back for the update. You need to search for Inuit's web site where they list the details on form availability for both Federal and all State forms. It currently says I'll be waiting until Feb. 18, which is an extension beyond their previous forecast of Jan. 31. It's inexcusable to me that they can delay nearly half way into tax filing season before having a ready product.Another point to be wary of regarding the &#34;Refund Bonus Offer.&#34; I'm an avid Amazon shopper and I thought the idea of getting a 10% bonus for directing some of my Federal return to a gift card would be great. It helped push me over the edge on buying TT from Amazon. After reading the fine print, however, I'm not going to be taking them up on the offer. Once you're in the process of filing and you elect to take the gift card option, you are presented with a series of disclosure agreements that you must accept. It boils down to this. You agree to have a deposit account opened at Sunrise Bank. Your refund and personal information (it's not clear the extent of this, but it is at least your name, e-mail, refund amount, and direct deposit account numbers) is transferred to Sunrise Bank. They then handling the split between what goes into your direct deposit and gift card amounts. So, they transfer your direct deposit to your bank. Then they send the gift card amount to a gift card company in California, who then purchases the gift card from Amazon. All along your &#34;personal information&#34; is being sent and you agree to abide by their use of your information for marketing purposes. They state that they can use your information for up to a year, unless you call them to limit their usage. After walking through this process, I backed out. I couldn't justify the release of an unknown amount of personal data and 3rd party marketing, in return for a mere $50. ($500 + 10% gift card). Ultimately, it seems like you agree to them making money from marketing your information, in order to offset the additional 10% bonus - you pay for it in the end. Rightfully so, the Amazon fine print states that they are not affiliated with this gift card offer. Buyer beware.
5	1391212800	I can't compare Turbo-Tax against the other tax programs since I have never used the others. However, Turbo-tax makes taxes so easy if used every year. The program copies all of the information from the year before so all that needs to be done is to enter financial information from W-2's, 1099's etc... The only negative is the charge to e-file state taxes.
5	1391212800	I have been using Turbotax for 8 years and have never encountered a problem. It's fast and user friendly!I strongly urge people to use it!
4	1391212800	It has always been an excellent program...I've used turbo tax since the 90s and its saved my bacon more than once
5	1391212800	i use Turbo tax every year, very easy to use and checks for mistakes gives directions on filing, why pay someone to do your tax. great
1	1391212800	Be careful!I wasted a lot of time filling out the forms but the program wouldn't let me e-file one of my state returns.  I wasted 2 hours "chatting online" with a customer service representative who asked me one basic question every 5-10 minutes (Thanks username 10_Shannon!). When I asked to hurry up, I could tell he/she was annoyed at me, and said "I'm still here" 10 minutes later.  I could tell it didn't speed anything up at all.  I was given incorrect information at the end and told to send in the paper forms because the IRS would not accept my e-file status.I'm currently on the phone number provided by the company to see if I can fix this problem.  Been on hold for 20 minutes. Good thing I have 4 hours to spare.The company advertises $40 for the deluxe edition but I ended up paying $100 because the company makes you pay $40 to create one additional state form and $20 to e-file that state form too (I had to file in 2 states this year). I love giving away free money to this awesome company! Maybe next time I will upgrade to Premier and pay $30 more, and get that wonderful Audit Protection for another like $45.  Then it'll cost $175. May as well go to a real tax professional with those costs!...Resolution: I hung up the phone after I was on hold for about 45 minutes. I figured if they didn't respond by the time I went to the bathroom and took a shower, they probably would never pick up (Thanks customer service, I love the waiting music!).I decided to e-file the federal taxes and NY state returns which was fine, but then had to separately print out my NC state return and mail this in.  I wish there was a better way to do taxes.  And the costs are absurd.  It costs me $40 for the software; $20 to e-file my state return (why wouldn't I want to e-file it), and then I had to file an additional state return and pay an extra $40.  Not to mention they tried to make me upgrade to the premier version or home & business version, or to pay for audit support, or to pay for additional stuff.P.S.  The IRS did accept my federal e-file, contrary to what customer service representative 10_Shannon told me.
5	1391212800	I have used Turbo Tax for several years.  It has made my tax returns easy and I have never been audited
3	1391212800	The only reason that i bothered to buy the DVD is because 39 dollars for State and Fed (as a Prime subscriber) sounded like a better deal.  Well, it's not.  They do indeed include State, but if you want to e-file it, that's 20 extra dollars. So it was 60 total anyway.  I could have just used the web version if i wasn't going to save anything.
1	1391212800	If you have a Mac I would purchase other tax preparation software. Just like last year, once you have completed inputting your information and have essentially hit the very last button in the process, you receive a validation error which indicates you need to install an update. Unfortunately the update doesn't resolve this problem. I am not alone, there are tons of people who have posted this question in the Troubleshoot section, and don't receive the proper answer from Turbo Tax. Goodluck waiting for support, minimal wait time was an hour.
2	1391212800	Ok I want to start off by saying that last year I used Turbo Tax to file my taxes and it was very easy and smooth. No complaints but unfortunately this year it is a problem. I purchased TT from Amazon and I was about to wrap up my taxes until it tells me that I could not file yet because of Arizona Form 140 wasn't available yet. I contacted TT support and they assured me it will be available on the 30th. Then I go open my software and do the online update and still it tells me I cant file because the Form isn't ready. I contact TT support again and they assured me it be available to download on the 31st. I wake up this morning( the 1st ) and the update is still not available. So what I did is go to H&R Block and I SUCCESSFULLY filed my taxes. So if you are in Arizona and need to file right away do not get TT. Thank you.
4	1391212800	I have been using Turbo Tax for over 10 years.  Once again, my filing was made easy and updates were received in a timely fashion.
5	1391212800	I have use this product for years because it does what I need and it is easy to use.cons: none that I am awarepros: it does what it is supposed to without any issue
1	1391212800	Can not do a basic sch d with stock trades, they made me upgrade to premier. After 15 years of using Tt deluxe you think they would make it more know to people. They had me upgrade, gave me a 10$ Code for credit which I could Not enter, then spent 30 min, on chat explaining what happened, they finally credited me back the whole amount I paid for the upgrade.
5	1391126400	I Needed to upgrade my Quicken and this combo offer with refund bonus was the right thing at the right time.
5	1391126400	I might not be the best reviewer as my taxes are pretty straightforward but turbo tax takes my old returns processes my W2 and then leads me through the wizard step by step. In about 30 minutes my state and federal were filed and I get an email and sms next day to say they are accepted.
5	1391126400	I've used Turbo Tax for many years. It's the best software there is. I'll continue to use evry year from now on
2	1391126400	I have used this product for the last 8 years and just this year Intuit is forcing me to purchase the home and business version at almost double the price. My business carrys a small inventory which i need a to file a Schedule C with my return. This year Intuit only allows Turbo Tax Deluxe to include a Schedule C-EZ. If your a small business please look at your prior year returns and see which Schedule C was filed and make sure you buy the right software.
5	1391126400	Although I have not yet completed my filing, Turbo Tax is a great way to get your taxes done.  However, as is the case I believe are the few changes made each year to the program.  Nevertheless, it is intuitive and is fairly easy to do.  I've used it for consistently over the years.
5	1391126400	I truly believe in this tax preparation software, and I've used it for several years.  It arrived quickly, and I've already  completed my federal and state taxes.
5	1391126400	It only took about five minutes to install, and it works like a charm, just like the last 5+ years I have been using TurboTax.  THANK GOODNESS!!  I held my breath the whole time, scared to death it was going to flop. I am still wondering why so many other folks are having problems. So sorry for them ~ I wish I was more computer-literate and able to discuss that side of it.Upon reading all those other troubled reviews, I was just about convinced I needed a new computer, just to do my taxes! I guess come April/May I will 'for real' when the support for XP goes away, but for now, I am happy with my old fashioned XP and my smoothly operating TTS (trusty tax software!)I started not to get TurboTax this year, based on all those negative reviews, but thanks to 'gut instinct', all is good.Oh, for the Software itself, yeah the Important part of the review, I really can't say much ... I hate math and I hate doing taxes.  That's why I choose TurboTax ... They do it all for me :)  Even though our taxes are really pretty simple/straightforward, all I have to do is fill in the blanks. Easy-peasy overall, free e-file and the State form is what does it for me.  What more could a girl want ??;-)
5	1391126400	This is the 3rd year i ordered this version of T-Tax and i haven't had any issues with the software
5	1391126400	This is a great product, hope it will be as easy to use as it has been in the past.
5	1391126400	Been using TT for 20 years!!  No better product available on the market!  and always a Great price too!Thanks!
4	1391126400	I have used Turbo Tax for many years for as many as 10 returns in any particular year. It can be frustrating to deal with when you want to make a change and it makes you walk thru the entire section to do it.
3	1391126400	Last year you could do your stock trades on Turbotax deluxe.  This year they want you to upgrade to the premier Turbotax.  I think that next year I will go with some other tax program.
5	1391126400	I keep coming back to TurboTax each year. It's easy to use. You can usually find it on sale somewhere also. Intuit includes just about every form imagineable too. I've always been able to use TurboTax for any special form I've needed.
5	1391040000	I've used TurboTax for several years.  It makes tax preparation very simple.  Gives me guidance to get the best tax return.  Worth the price.
5	1391040000	I have been using Turbo Tax for a long time and recommend it to anyone who likes to do their own taxes. I like the step by step instructions and the fact that you can skip parts when they do not apply. One feature that appeals to me is seeing how IRA deposits of different amounts can effect my return just by going back and editing the dollar value.
5	1391040000	Have used this software for many years now with success. Relatively easy to follow step by step prompts make it easy to use.
2	1391040000	My friend, a TurboTax devotee has always raved about Turbo Tax.  As a new customer (moving in as a previous Taxwise preparer) I would love to be able to go somewhere to get answers to questions without throwing a question out into the world for possible answers.How many returns can we do?How many can we send on line and/or mail?How to delete practice returns.Not yet as pleased with TurboTax as your devotee.Mary
5	1391040000	I have used turbo tax for 5 years. I like how it prefills from the last year so alI have to do is make minor changes. It is easy to use and a great product.
5	1391040000	Not much to say except it works every year as expected. Very thorough and so far, no mistakes ever came back to bite me.
5	1391040000	We have used Turbo-tax for over fifteen years now.  There has never been even one problem with this program.  It is effortless and flawless.  Even people who have no experience with filing their own taxes can breeze through this.  Just take it one question at a time.  If you are missing a 1099 or other information, just save your work and go back to it later....the program will take you where you left off automatically.  File on-line and use auto-deposit and it really is painless.  We filed on January 16, and Turbotax held out filing until the IRS would accept it and then let us know exactly what was happening with it.  You won't be disappointed if you just go step by step!
4	1391040000	Once you use it for the first time, it greatly shortens the time it takes doing your taxes yearly.  Carries over much of the same from previous years returns.  Also makes recommendations and comparisons to assure that you aren't missing things.
1	1391040000	the software wanted 39.99 for the state software even though it was included in the deluxe version.  i contacted customer service, and it took over one hour to get a code to download the state software without an additional charge.  i'm going to have to reconsider purchasing this package going forward if it requires additional time every year to get a download code.
5	1391040000	I always purchase Turbo Tax annually, but this was the first time thru Amazon.  The ease of ordering, and not having to go look for it was excellent.  Also the price was comparable to what it is selling for now, and I got it much earlier.
4	1391040000	I have always used TurboTax online free edition but moved across country last year for a job. In order to claim my moving expenses as a deduction I was required to use a paid version of TurboTax this year. After price shopping I settled on this, mainly because of the $10 Prime member savings.The software is pretty easy to use. It walks you through everything you will need to get the best refund possible. The only drawback is that it doesn't include over-the-phone support. I didn't have a problem filing my taxes but my partner is a full-time student and ran into a problem because his parents may still be claiming him as a dependent. We had to search the community forums for answers without much luck.Overall, this is still a great software and I will definitely purchase it again next year.
5	1391040000	TurboTax has been my choice for many years. Every year it gets more thorough and provides improvements in explanations and guidelines. I especially appreciate the ease with which the software pulls data directly from my investments' web sites. Thanks to TurboTax, all of my tax records for more than 10 years fit on a CD-R with scads of room to spare.
5	1390953600	had no problem using the program.  loved the program will use it again! hate that I have to write more words for this review!
5	1390953600	It's easy to use.  Walks you thru many of the twists & turns and provides video instructions.  You also get one free state selection with this package.  The dvd comes with this package & installation is very easy.
5	1390953600	I have been using TurboTax for over five years now. I like how you can move back and forward, entering your data daily as you receive it. The price was also good.
5	1390953600	It works.  No matter how many football stadiums may be filled with money people didn't get back, I have used it for years and get what I consider a fair result and I like knowing my return is complete and correct.  Too bad I owed this year!
1	1390953600	I have used turbotax for many years. This year they have included a inconspicuous check box that comes pre checked to enroll in their mostly worthless audit defense. Even after going back to double check and make sure I did not select the add on, they charged me for it. Completely unacceptable. I can not recommend Turbotax. Do not use this product, only a scummy company uses such tactics as an Opt-Out only type of service.  Look elsewhere.
5	1390953600	I have used Turbo-Tax for years and have never had issues at tax time that I used to have paying a professional.  Easy to load and updates all the time to keep up with the ever changing tax laws.
5	1390953600	Arrived as promised, installed like dream, I am starting taxes now and walk through is very easy. I expected no less
5	1390867200	Easy to install, easy to follow. Like fact that filing with Fed and State made easy also.  Have used TurboTax for several years, plan to continue for many more,
1	1390867200	So I filed with turbotax and several problems I have is all the fees to do turbo tax keep adding up. I might as well have got to a local place for all the money i had to spend. On top of that something went wrong with my taxes and when I tried to contact turbotax by phone or by chat I had problems. The chat kept screwing up and even once logged me out because it took so long. When I went looking for a  phone number there was none to be found. Just kept taking me back to chat which just kept screwing up. I promise you I will never EVER buy this crap again. I would rather take the hit and go to H&R block or a place like that!!!
5	1390867200	I have used Turbo Tax for over 5 yrs and have never had a problem, or audit in all that time.Very easy to use
5	1390867200	I've used TurboTax for over 10 years and it just keeps getting better. I have no reason to stop now.
5	1390867200	I have used this product for several years. It has worked out very successfully And I have been very pleased with the product.
5	1390867200	My taxes took 10 minutes.  My old records are still on file so I didn't need to have a copy of last year's W2 on hand.  I stored my W2 from this year in the box it came in and put it on my software shelf.  If you don't want to pay a hundred bucks to file a simple form but need a little guideance, or just stink at math, this is the one for you.  If you can read, you can file your taxes.
4	1390867200	I have used this for years.  It is convenient to use, picks up info from previous years taxes.  Easy on-line filing.  The cost gets higher every year so I will probably try one that is less expensive next year.
3	1390867200	Some glitches - I had to change my computer from the recommended Std acct to an Administrator acct to load the updates as they come in - really annoying and puts your computer at risk. There's no mention on initial opening that this has the Amazon offer of an extra 10% of any refund you put toward an amazon gift card. It better be there when I'm done! (That's why I paid more to buy it from Amazon instead of Costco this year.)
4	1390867200	Have used for many years.  I keep getting a message regarding schedule A but have not received the updates as promised.
5	1390867200	We've already finished our taxes.  Turbo Tax makes it so easy.  I really enjoyed the discount from Amazon this year which made it way cheaper than anywhere else to purchase it.
5	1390867200	If you are buying Turbo Tax to do your taxes, it really pays to get it here instead of  other sources.  Amazon provides a truly great deal to go with the best tax product on the market.
5	1390780800	This is a good product which I have been using for several years...but it should include the state e-filing.  I think it would sell more copies if it did.
5	1390780800	The 12th year for me using turbo tax and it has never let me down. I am sure, god willing, I will be using for 12 more!!
1	1390780800	The Transfer Return button did not work, negating one of the primary advantages to TurboTax. Also, there is no tech support phone number, and no response to my request for help posted to the &#34;Community.&#34; I did not buy a membership to a community, I purchased a product. I have been using TT since about 1995. Last year e-filing failed to work correctly and I had to paper file. Now I can't even get past step one without a problem. It is time to find a new tax program.Amazon, however, is excellent. They have sent me a return label.
1	1390780800	I could not e-file without paying a fee.  You have to agree to pay $20 for state and $30 for federal to continue  and file.  Basically the company is very  misleading.
4	1390780800	Very much like years past except you have run the update, other years it checked for updates when you started the program.
1	1390694400	Problem With 2013 Edition!!! We have been using Turbo Tax for years with no problem. I am seeing that others, like us, are having problems opening the 2013 Edition after it has been successfully installed.
5	1390694400	TurboTax works very well on the Mac platform. It's well written, generally user-friendly software that makes the job of Federal and State income taxes a little less burdensome. I tried a competitor one year and ended up cursing and starting over when my data were lost. Worst $10 I ever saved. Get this product, the real thing.
4	1390694400	I have used Turbo tax for years (close to 15 years).  Our taxes are not excessively complicated nor are they very simple.  Some stocks, mutual funds, wages, etc.  We don't have our own business so I can not common on that.Overall the product is sold.  The interview process works well as long as you follow their lead.  That means having all the documents available when you start the process.  I, like many other I suspect, do our taxes piecemeal.  When a form or two arrives, I enter the data.  Forms do not arrive in the order that the Turbo Tax interview works.  Thus I need to jump around.  This is doable but is not as easy as the follow the interview process.Overall the program work okay, simple help is available, though at times I have found myself looking for additional information that is not included in the program.And the real nice bonus is the extra 10% back if I get an Amazon gift card.  Great deal.
5	1390694400	I HAVE BEEN USING TURBO TAX FOR SEVERAL YEARS , SO EASY AND IT CHECKS ALL YOU FIGURES FOR MISTAKES AND ALSO FILES FOR YOU.EXCELLENT IN SO MANY WAYS.
1	1390694400	I have used this for years. I installed per instructions for Mac and began using it. No state download was part of that process. I then clicked on my state from within TT, and it billed me $39 for the state download. Called TT support, on hold, then the rep essentially refused to answer the direct question of whether that is included and said TT could not vouch for Amazon's listing of features. This guy must have gone to the Kim Il Sung Institute of customer service in North Korea--just kept repeating propaganda about &#34;this fine company&#34; he worked for blah blah. He declined to refund and referred me to Amazon, from whom I am awaiting a reply. Nice to spend a couple of hours on this instead of my taxes, you bet.
5	1390608000	I have always been happy with Turbo Tax and have used it for many years.  No filling out paper tax forms that have become difficult to get. Electronic filing is a breeze.  Great product even though it's higher priced than the others
4	1390608000	I have been using TurboTax for 5 years now and it is way better that  HRBlock software programs.  Clear and easy to follow and has good tips for helping you.
3	1390608000	got this item early january and i did my taxes late January in preparing for filing, but the software says the forms not available and the forms were available.
5	1390608000	I have been using Turbo Tax since it was a DOS program.  It just gets better every year.  I highly recommend it.
4	1390608000	Just filed my state and federal taxes this year. Fed I did eFile, and state I just did the paper because my near-nothing state refund wasn't worth paying Turbotax for the eFiling.My city also requires a tax filing, and Turbotax can take care of it too. Problem is that my city forms are not available (per their website) until Feb 28. Turbotax created a complete city filing for me with the draft forms. Didn't alert me to this at all because it handles it as part of the state filing. I didn't know that the filing was a draft until I printed out the forms to mail and it had a DRAFT DO NOT SUBMIT watermark on it.It would be a big improvement if Turbotax alerted me to the draft forms. Someone at Intuit had to look at them to do the programming, so you'd think putting in a stop and alert telling me to come back after they're updated wouldn't be very difficult.
4	1390608000	Nice product. I've used it for many years now. Makes navigating the forms easier. It's getting a little Commerical with the upsale attempts and add-ons, but it's solid enough.
5	1390608000	We buy this every year, it works, it works well, it's makes taxes fast and easy, emails to the IRS.  Life is better with Turbo Tax.
5	1390608000	We always buy this TurboTax CD so Hubby can easily evaluate and process our annual income & state tax record. He claims it's easier than attempting to bake a cake. If needed he may even 'chat' w/ a person for more information &/or assistance.
5	1390608000	I have been using TurboTax for about 10 years now.  Simple to use.  Imports last years TurboTax information with a few clicks.  The Advisor videos are helpful.  I have a mortgage deduction with includes deductions for interest paid, home insurance, etc.  TurboTax processes these easily.  I also have a Form 1099R from Military retirement income.  Its simple to enter this data as well.Easy filing.  You get one free Federal eFile.  The State eFile is not free.  And you do have to pay to have your return processed electronically and deposited into one of your accounts.  Something around $30.  But otherwise a solid product.  The efiling process is smooth.  You get multiple notifications to your email address and through TurboTax about the status of your filing.  Typically my refund from my federal and state returns are deposited into my checking account in less than two weeks from the day I eFiled.  Very happy with that.
3	1390608000	Pro's -Can import from lots of financial institutions.Gets the job done.Phone help is from experts.ConsMuch more expensive than H&R; Block and interface a bit easier with H&R.;&#34;Easy&#34; way skips some details so you are advised to do each section manually if your return isn't simple. (ie sch K)Charges for efiling (even though it says free), audit protection (included with H&R;) which can almost double price of product.  You don't discover this until the end of the program.
4	1390521600	I have received it and have entered 4 items so far.I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe  at least 10 times before,always with success.I will Efile Fed as usual and print state for mailing.I don't want my name to made PublicYours Truly Arthur Moore
5	1390521600	I've been using Turbo Tax for a decade-plus and continue to find it to be the best of the bunch when it comes to preparing my personal and small business returns.  Simple to use (well, as simple as anything that is based on the US Tax Code can be), reliable and straightforward.Zero problem importing my past year return, which is a huge time saver.I like how I can opt to stay within a menu-driven interface or, when needed, jump right into the actual tax form. Their &#34;for your records&#34; printouts are also very helpful, although very lengthy (recommend saving it to a PDF unless you want to have your printer chew through a lot of paper).Wish my tax prep was easier, but Turbo Tax is the best tool I've found to help minimize the trouble and pain of filing tax returns.
2	1390521600	I had so much trouble trying to get the software to run on my Windows 7 64 bit desktop I finally gave up and installed it on my old Windows XP laptop.  I never could get any help from Turbo Tax Support which seems to be non existent.  They never answered any of my emails  I'm thinking of trying out the the other name brand software next year or maybe even this year to match results.
5	1390435200	have used this pruduct for a number of years I find it is easy to use and serves my purpose
2	1390435200	I initially loaded the software. I immediately looked for a drop down menu that had 'import' or something of that kind. NOT THERE!I had to search online (I found many people reporting the same problem) for a way to do an import from last year.The technique I used from doing some online research caused the file name (the part at the end) to have have .tax2012 just like last years file name. I can't change the file name to .tax 2013 which technically does not matter but I have two file names .tax2012.The time I spent to file taxes is the reason why I usually buy TurboTax. This year I spent extra time.I would go as far as to say if you're super techie you'll be fine. If your not techie you're going to have to input everything again (wastes time). I'm in-between techie and super techie so I'm fine but it was a hassle. TurboTax has never been a hassle in any way.
4	1390435200	Have used this program in the past, so will continue. Like the interview and available additional resources. Having one's own disk allows one to overwrite entries where the defaults don't work (I use my own spreadsheet for documenting depreciation, and not those provided within the program). You can't do that with a download.
1	1390435200	I filed with Turbo Tax Premier last year and was charged more, including penalty by the IRS for the rental income. When attempting to contact Turbo Tax, I found out that the only way they stood behind their guarantee was if I fought the assessment from the IRS and lost. Wasn't worth the effort.So, if you are expecting Turbo Tax to stand behind their calculations, be prepared.
5	1390435200	I have been using Turbo Tax for years. I have tried the H&R Block version once, but nothing compares to the user friendly Turbo Tax.
1	1390435200	disc would not load, did not work at all.  Probably a poc, but i am not sure.  The only thing i am sure about is that it will not load.
4	1390348800	Even if you are not happy about Intuit's aggressive marketing, this is the answer to all your personal tax needs. My use of it goes back to the early Macintax days and I've never had a serious problem.  One under appreciated benefit of this product is that the IRS and Turbotax collaborate on basic procedures and questions.  If you do things Turbotax's way - even if occasionally irritating - the odds that the IRS will give you grief are very low.
5	1390348800	Always great to have and use...wouldn't do taxes without it. I use turbo tax every year without incident or IRS concerns.
5	1390348800	I am very delighted about this software.  I kept on buying Turbo Tax since 2000.  It helps me a lot in knowing all the aspects of filing my Income Tax Return.
4	1390348800	TurboTax is very good for federal returns, but I have had problems with the state one (Louisiana). One year they completely missed a deduction that is commonly known. I wonder how much effort they put into state returns, considering there are more than forty versions. I still buy the state return software, but I double-check it myself.
5	1390348800	What can you say, been using it for years and it is a good product. Good support and updates. Will buy it next year too.
5	1390348800	I've already imported the data from my 2012 return and can note that the software is easy to use. Built-in options such as interview or let me choose on my own allow the user to get as little or as much help they need.
1	1390262400	I have used Turbo Tax since 1998 and never had any problem till the 2013 version.I bought the CD version as Sam's Club for $50.  I have to use the deluxe version for my state income tax.I have not been able to install it on my Windows XP system.  I get Error code 1603, then it runs a &#34;repair utility&#34;, then it justquits and sends an error report.You cannot take software back, so I am out $50.
5	1390262400	My spouse has used TurboTax for years and thinks it is great. Always in a hurry to buy the latest edition when it is released (does not want the downloaded version but must have the disc version). He has to file state returns in 2 states so he also will purchase an extra state edition in addition to the 1 free state which is included. He once worked in an office of H&R Block for several tax seasons but after leaving them he has relied solely on TurboTax and his own knowledge.
5	1390262400	I have been using Turbotax for over 10 years. Every year I do at least five family returns and te following year I just transfer personal data and any carry over deductions to the current year. Pretty easy
5	1390262400	I do my taxes with turbo tax, and honestly its easier than going to hr block, and sitting all day.easy, and simple.
5	1390262400	You cannot go wrong using the TurboTax Deluxe Fed Efile and State 2013 tax program. I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I have found that it is an excellent tax preparation program. The program takes you step by step in preparing your taxes and although it may not be painless, it is easy to follow the directions. I was really pleased with the Amazon special offer price.
5	1390262400	I have been using TurboTax since it came out. Each year it gets better. The guide is easy to use and thorough. The state return is well integrated into the program. My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey. But since I do my family's returns also, it is well worth it.
4	1390262400	I've used Turbo Tax  before  and I needed it for my taxes this year. I would recommend Turbo Tax to any one who asks me. I Think  is agood ratting.
4	1390262400	There isn't much to review here... The IRS wants me to pay them money. This is a good way to find out how much to pay them.
4	1390176000	DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.I will update this review as I continue to use the product.Pros:* Price includes federal E-File* Overall, probably the best tax program there is* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?)* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)Cons:* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier)* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)
3	1390176000	Thanks again TurboTax, for a practical, well designed product, year after year.  If your circumstances are simple respecting income sources, and taxable events, this product suffices.  Of course, those in the top 10% will still need an accountant and tax preparer.
5	1390089600	We have used the Turbotax program for many years.  We have also, used TurboTax online.  We currently have this program installed on a Mac.  In the past we have also used this on a PC.  Turbo Tax can guide you through every step of the process, or you can just complete the sections you need.
4	1390089600	I've used this and the business, s-corp, version for  many years.  The only thing is I wish they would quit changing it.  A couple of years ago it was so user friendly so I wasn't crazy about the changes.  I think they keep dumbing it down which in actuality doesn't get you your best refund.  I'm glad they still give you the choice of doing the income and expenses on your own otherwise I wouldn't use it.  Where it would let you down is for business expenses that are reported on the F1040, like amortization of startup costs when opening a business, and business interest, for money spent by shareholders for capital purchases.  for some of my younger family members I just use the online free version (go through the IRS site) or free OneSource for the military, like my son.
5	1390003200	We've been using Turbotax for many years, and are now well into preparing this year's return.  What can I say?  Same reliable, easy-to-use product I've come to expect.
5	1390003200	I used it on windows 7 64 bit. I already used it works great just like using turbo web site
5	1390003200	Usually you can get turbo tax on sale for $49, but this was $39, great price for same item and with prime it was at my house in 2 days
5	1389916800	This is very easy to use and walks you through the steps needs to complete and file your returns. As always, double and triple check every entry before you submit your taxes !!!!!
5	1389916800	I have used Turbo Tax for the last 20 years. It has improved each year, I used to go to H&R Block  and all they did is ask me questions and they would write my answers down. That is exactly what Turbo Tax does for a lot less money and I feel more accurately. I recommend Turbo Tax very highly
5	1389916800	The TurboTax software has always worked great for me and I've used it since the first edition.  It has never made a mistake for me and it has always found the most in deductions.  I don't have a real complex return but I had a rental property for several years and it was not a problem (now you would have to buy the premier version for a rental property).  I recommend it.
4	1389916800	Have been using TurboTax every year for many years - going back to DOS days.  Positive: brings previous year data into current year. -- For several years, one may save pdf file of entire set of finished forms - invaluable -- easy to deal with State formsNot so good: no longer uses cents -- need exists for one to be able to take a 1099 (or the like) off of the top of a pile and go directly to the place in TT where the form's information is entered -- 1099s with both taxable and non-taxable parts seem to require two separate entries - easy to make an error -- backup of forms into two places (HD and external memory) seems not to work -- expect to take time to learn how to move within the program - a flow chart would helpThree pieces of software I would not wish to be without: WordPerfect; Acrobat 9 (last version that works right); and TurboTax.The curse of an excessively complex tax system can only be dealt with by using such a computer program.
5	1389916800	Its my 4th year using TurboTax and I really love it.  It is easy to use, understand and finish my taxes
5	1389916800	This makes preparing taxes very easy. It is also easy to install and with a quick learning curve. Program will guide you through or you can make selections on your own.
5	1389916800	I've been using Turbo Tax and TaxCut for almost 20 years.  Turbo Tax easily takes the prize for simpleness, ease of use, and accuracy.  You can't go wrong with this one!
5	1389830400	Turbo Tax is the best!  I've used it for several years now and never a problem.  I recommend to all.
5	1389830400	Turbo Tax program deluxe Federal and state.I have used this product in the past and am very happy with the results.
4	1389830400	I tried others, but came back to Turbotax. I shop the price every year and usually buy it in December so I can estimate my taxes. Best prices are in early Spring but I can't wait that long.
3	1389830400	As always, installation was incredibly simple and easy and instantly imported my previous tax return and employer W2 electronically so I didn't have to enter the data myself.  After answering all of the interview questions, it determined which deduction was more beneficial (Itemized or the Standard deduction).  It then analyzed my return for errors and found none.However, I always double and triple check my returns myself.  I did the SAME return online at Intuit's website and it imported the same return information and W2 from my employer only there was a $100 difference in my Federal refund.  The software I installed on my PC had calculated my Federal refund exactly $100 less than it did on Intuit's website.I then switched to view my 1040 Individual Income Tax Return form to look for any errors in calculations or mis-entries.  I found none.  All of the numbers were entered correctly in the correct boxes on the form.  So then I downloaded the TurboTax mobile app from the Apple App Store to my iPad just to TRIPLE check since it lets you calculate returns for free before filing.  It came up with the exact same numbers as Intuit's online website did.So both Intuit's website and their TurboTax Mobile App are giving me the same figures, but my TurboTax Deluxe 2013 software I have installed on my PC is giving me a refund that adds up to exactly $100 less and cannot be accounted for.Surely I want the higher Federal refund that both the Mobile App and Intuit's website are telling me I should be getting versus what their PC software is telling me.  But what if it is correct and the other two are apps are wrong?  Which one should I trust?And yes, I have installed all updates to the program so the software is currently up-to-date.I then deleted my return and uninstalled the software and reinstalled so that I could start over from scratch with a "clean slate" so-to-speak and kept getting the same irreconcilable figure as before that still did not match up against either their online software or their mobile app.I have been using Intuit's TurboTax software for about 17 years now.  It's usually simple and pretty reliable.  I just hope they come out with an update to fix the bug in this year's software so that I can reconcile my return and get the exact same results on all three of their software filing solutions before I submit my returns otherwise I'll either have to A.) Amend my returns which is an inconvenience and hassle because you have to mail them to the IRS and/or B.) Get a letter from the IRS at a later date saying I owe them more money.  I don't know about you but I hate getting surprises like that.I generally prefer using TurboTax to do my taxes for piece-of-mind but this year, something just doesn't add up.  I encourage all of you doing your returns with the PC software to do the same and double-check your returns against their website and mobile apps and see if your calculations are the same.  It's YOUR money.
5	1389830400	TurboTax has been my tax software choice for 15 years running. During that time, Intuit has offered better and weake versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped take the pain out of, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Before software, tax time was a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had a rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Those days are happily in the pastThis version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?
5	1389830400	I have been using Turbo Tax for many many years. A couple years ago I bought a cheaper one because I didn't have the money. What a mistake...turbo tax is by far the most user friendly and easy to use. Will never switch again.
4	1389744000	Last year I used the H&R; Block tax software because I wanted to try something different and it was less expensive.  Well the old addage you get what you pay for applied.  While the software did what it was supposed to do, it would not scale correctly to fit on my 15.5&#34; laptop screen.  And after being used (spoiled by) to the interview process within TurboTax, the H&R; Block tax software was just not what I was expecting.The H&R; Block tax software is good software that does the job, it just was not a good fit for me.  The TurboTax software is a good fit for me.
5	1389744000	The package worked as expected and will be used to file my tax return again this year.  I have ysed TurboTax for many years. .
4	1389744000	I have used Turbo Tax for a number of years and am very satisfied with it.  The price was good.
1	1389744000	Good luck because TurboTax management has carefully hidden and buried the support phone number.  And the chat support people have a hard time comprehending your problem and then give you scripted answers.  These product support problems persist year after year.  Another major fustration is that TurboTax charges $59.00 to download the Deluxe + State version directly to your computer whereas the CD version available in retail stores is $49.00.  So TurboTax management punishes the customer whobuys the online version even though it saves the Company the cost of the CD, box, physical inventory, etc.
5	1389744000	I have used this product for many years and really enjoyed it.  The best features are the year-to-year carryover and the deductible deduction calculator.
5	1389744000	Stated using it without any hiccups.  Will file taxes electronically again this year for a reasonable price.  I won't use anything else.  I just love it!
5	1389657600	Product arrived in a timely manner, securely packaged. I have used this product for  approximately 14 years and am thoroughly satisfied with its operation. Easy to complete, transfers data from previous year, prompts for possible deductions and error checks the return, when completed. It highlights areas likely to be audited to be sure that you have the proper documentation.
5	1389657600	I have used &#34;the&#34; other tax softwares in the past...they do not hold a candle to turbo.  I have been using turbotax for over 10 years and have double checked the software's results manually.  Turbotax has always been correct for me and helped me find the deductions I deserve.
4	1389657600	It works as advertised and, for the most part, it is fairly intuitive so you only have to struggle occasionally to figure out how to do some function.
3	1389657600	I have been using TurboTax since about 1994, and have watched it evolve. In general, I like how it works, and am used to its overall approach. In the 2013 version, I noted a couple of things which I hope will be fixed in later versions:1) When starting the process to select and download the one included &#34;state&#34; package, the dialog box shows the state you have selected in an area entitled &#34;states not yet paid for.&#34;  Along the top, there is a progress indicator, showing that the next phase will collect billing information.  That was disconcerting and misleading enough for me to go back to the physical box and make sure I bought the correct product that includes one state for free. When I confirmed that I had the right product, I continued the process, and it turns out that it skips over the billing and goes right to the download phase - indicating that the one state was included for free. Whew. Good news, but the interface shouldn't imply that you will be billed unless you actually select more than one state.2) This issue has been around for awhile, and I was hoping it would be addressed. I prefer to work in Forms mode, rather than spend time in the step-by-step interview mode. But no matter what mode you're in when you save and close, opening the return later always puts you in the interview mode.  You can get back to Forms mode with one click of an icon (in the upper right corner), but when you get there, all the forms you had open before are closed. I would much prefer that it take me to whichever mode I was in when I last worked on the return, and if that was Forms mode, I would prefer seeing still open all the forms I had open when I last worked on the return.  This is more of a pet peeve and annoyance, based on the way I tend to work (wanting to pick up exactly where I left off in Forms mode).
5	1389657600	We've been using turbo tax for years.  Very good for us and accurate. Before Turbo tax we did our tax returns ourselves.  This is much quicker.
5	1389657600	I've used Turbo tax for at least 10 years. I work outside the home, own a house, and have a handful of investments. Nothing super complicated so the deluxe version is perfect for my needs. It's very user-friendly and it asks way more questions than the nice lady at H and R Block who I used to pay to prepare my tax return. Turbo tax in target and walmart runs $49-$54 but Amazon Prime reduced the cost to $39 at checkout. Sweet!
5	1389571200	Have used Turbo Tax for years. Very easy to use. Never been audited by IRS using this product. You can't go wrong!
5	1389571200	For over 50 years I have faced constipation and nervous breakdowns anticipating &#34;tax season&#34;. For the past 6 years I have used TurboTax Deluxe; my regularity has been restored and I no longer fear commitment to an institution. It installed easily on my PC and for the past 2 years it has installed easier on my MacBook Pro. My brain and my digestive system, (they are connected in my case), thank TurboTax.
4	1389571200	Have been using this product for about 17 years.  Through the years I have only had a problem one year with the product not coming out when they posted.  Love this product for keeping my taxes straight and if you can answer yes and no answers this product is right for you.  If you have used it the previous year it makes doing your taxes this year a lot easier by transfering all the information from the year before to your taxes this year.
4	1389571200	Looks very similar to previous year's versions.  It is still sometimes tough to find the details that are somewhat &#34;hidden&#34;.
5	1389571200	At this point I'd rather just an auto enroll except that this year Amazon Prime had it on sale for another $10.00 off!  $20 total discount, cant go wrong.
5	1389571200	Makes it easy to enter information, accurate, dependable. Retains previous information and saves time making entries for both federal and state.
5	1389484800	I use it every year. It sure saves me a lot of time and work. I would not do my taxes without it.
5	1389484800	Who could possibly do taxes without TurboTax? I get it every year, including this one, even though this year's new regs may mean an accountant is in our future ....
5	1389484800	Refund Bonus Offer? I did not see any refund bonus offer. I have used this software easily for the past 10 years. The cost is written off because it is used to pay income tax. It is easy to understand, loads easily, updates itself, and is in a non accountant language.
2	1389484800	I've used TB for the past couple years.  4 stars for execution.  2 stars for switch and bait.  It is easy to use and seems comprehensive.  I am single and have few investments and other complicated tax garbage but I can't just file the basic forms.  I still need to deduct.  However!It says eFile and state right on the box!  Cool!  Right?  But if your are dillegent and read down in the small text you will find the state file charge is $20.  Then - and this is the worst part that irks the hell out of me - when you start clicking on the I agree section near the end, if you scroll through the legal - foreign - language (and I use the term lightly), you will see that they charge a hefty fee for efile.  No mention of it anywhere else.  Right smack in the middle of many pages of thou whithest and there-to-fores.  I'm not sure if they charge a percentage or if it is a flat fee.  But $50 for an File (got a big refund so it may be different)?  Really?  In America?  I'm not sure I'll buy this year.  Maybe the 10 hours I spend trying to translate/maneuver the stupid US tax forms will be worth the $50 + $20 for state + eFile.  Don't be duped and see your long awaited tax return reduced.  Especially when it is not glaringly apparent.  Hope this helps.
5	1389484800	What can I say.  I've been using TurboTax for years and it has always proven itself to me.  It is very easy to use and it even does my state taxes too.
5	1389398400	Have used this before to do my taxes and it is outstanding. Saved some money on purchase also from the actual store price.
5	1389398400	I've been using Turbo Tax from it's inception.  If that's not an endorsement then I don't know what is.  And just let me say this, that anyone with half a brain should be able to do their own taxes using this software.  All you do is answer the questions, it's as simple as that.
5	1389398400	I've been using TurboTax for many years and always find it to be easy to use and reliable. If you plan to do you own taxes, this is the product to use.
4	1389398400	It is only Jan. 10, so I really haven't started. Had some difficulty loading it, but that was probably  the fault of my machine. I contacted T-T Support and the were responsive. I've used T-T for many yrs. It looks as good as ever.
4	1389398400	Every year I use turbo tax for my taxes because it is easy and simple. I was gonna buy this at Costco because it was $10 off but decided to check Amazon and to my surprise it was already price matched.
5	1389398400	The special offer for Prime members was well below the competition.  I've used TurboTax for many years and have never had a problem with our return.  I've never tried the H&R Block software so, I can't say if TurboTax is any better, but Intuit has set the bar pretty high.
5	1389312000	Always use it every year easy to use outstanding will use  again next year as well. No complaints try it
4	1389312000	I chose turbo tax 2013 because of the success I had with last years 2012 edition. The ease of use and results of returns.
4	1389312000	I'm pleased to upgrade my review from 1 star to 4 stars. After getting a response to my original review from a VP at TurboTax, I decided to try the desktop version instead of the online version. This software allows you to enter tax income or losses for items not officially supported by the product level, such as entering investment losses or small business income in the Deluxe version. This preserves the functionality previously offered in the online version of TurboTax, and is a great value if you know what you're doing.My only reason for not granting 5 stars was the suprise $29.99 fee for processing my e-file. When the product says that it includes e-file, I didn't expect to pay any extra fees. I'm not too worried about it, since this particular product includes a 10% "freebie" in the form of an Amazon gift card, so I just decided to put $300 onto the gift card so that the 10% bonus paid for the surprise fee.All in all, a good deal.
5	1389312000	I have been using TurboTax for years and I always find it extremely easy to use and very accurate. When I have had questions I have gotten prompt replies using their forum from tax preparation professionals. You get what you pay for when it comes to tax preparation software and even though this is a bit pricey it is the best out there in my view.  This product is what I call &#34;idiot proof&#34; It asks you very direct simple questions in preparing your tax returns so you don't have to be knowledgeable about tax codes .  I would highly recommend this product. By the way, I have never been audited using this software for over 10 years. Only downside wasn't  a product  issue but a shipping issue. My product arrived three days after expected delivery date. It turned out Amazon didn't ship it in a timely manner. Amazon offered me a promotional credit of $10 dollars which I could use on another purchase. Also, it seems FedEx Smartpost delayed it even more. Most likely due to weather issues. I feel Amazon made a reasonable solution to the shipping issue.
5	1389312000	Have used turbo tax for many years, find it is the easiest program for us to maximize our refunds. Great product.
5	1389225600	It is simple, it is the best tax package for my purpose. I would recommend for anyone to prepare their taxes.
1	1389139200	I love Turbotax, have used it for years.  But this years version is causing me huge installation issues.Installed and computer starting crashing (BSD).  Uninstalled, everything ran fine for a day.  Re installed, again BSD.  Uninstalled, no BSD.  During this time I changed nothing else on my computer other than dealing with Turbotax. Tried chat,  guy told me it was my machine and I should contact a tech.  I find it strange that my machine runs fine without TurboTax and keeps crashing with it.  Running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit.I looked on their website and found that others are having issues too.
4	1389139200	If you are a novice at preparing complicated income tax returns for individuals you may consider another product.  However, if you just need an organizer and quick check program, Turbo Tax is adequate considering the price.
4	1389139200	seems okay when loaded; have not completed taxes yet so am not sure if it will crash like quicken has this year
5	1389139200	I've used tax software to generate my federal and state income taxes since 1985.  Every few years, another company would buy the company whose tax software I was using.  Ultimately, Intuit purchased my previous tax company, and I've been using TurboTax since 2002.As more companies have begun to offer tax software, I have reviewed their products and been tempted to try them.  Since I use Quicken to keep my personal books, it still makes sense to flow my data into Turbo-Tax.  I will continue to use Turbo-Tax as long as their products are effective and cost-competitive...
5	1389139200	I have used this program since the first year it existed.  The first year I used it was because of the ease I thought it would bring, but that was not the case for me.  In truth, it would have been easier that year to just do it myself.  The reason for this was it was too hard to move around within the program, but every year they improved this aspect. Now there is no down side to using it and in fact if you use it year after year, it imports your last years information from your computer so there is even less to do!  Just shop around for the best price and you will love it.
5	1389052800	This is the only way to obtain TurboTax Federal and State version without any hassles. This will makes preparing taxes for the year a breeze.
5	1389052800	Always use turbo and amazon had the best price. It's the best tax software for me, will buy again next year
5	1389052800	I have used TurboTax for as many years as it has been available. Actually tried a different one a couple of years ago and was disappointed. I won't make that mistake again.
3	1389052800	After purchasing 2 of the Turbo Tax Deluxe programs and paying $49.99 each,about two weeks later "Sam's Club" had the exact software program with a $10 instant savings. $39.99. I could have saved $20. I still enjoy purchasing from Amazon but next year will wait a little longer. I have run into this issue before. Paul S
1	1389052800	TURBO TAX IS A GREAT HELP TO ME WITH MY TAXES.I WOULD RECOMEND IT.HOPEFULLY IT CAN UPDATE THE NEW TAX FORMS  SOON.
5	1389052800	I've used TurboTax for many years. I find it very easy to use. It picks up info from previous ears and saves time by filling in many blanks. It's a money saver and puts me in a position to know I have taken all the deductions which pertain to me.
4	1389052800	Have always used (10+ years) to file my taxes both Federal & State and I am very happy with their products.
2	1388966400	It will not work with your Linux systems so be alert to that.  I don't know about using Wine so you might could try that.
5	1388966400	I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.What I also like, is switching back and forth between the "hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. Or, if you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, maybe the cheapest basic one is all you need!If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.
4	1388966400	I find paying for this software each year to be entirely worth the money. I don't find working with taxes easy, and this makes the best out of a bad job. Being a Brit living in the States, I do find that the way it deals with assets in another country can be a bit clunky and not intuitive, but the support online usually gets me through it. I find this is an good tool to help me get through a necessary evil. Nobody is ever going to say 'Yay, time to do my taxes, I get to buy Turbotax', but this is worth it.
5	1388793600	Hard to get excited about the product, even if it works well (and for me it's perfect).  What made it a &#34;buy&#34; was that it helped me qualify for free shipping on some other small things in the same order.  Peachy!
5	1388793600	I have been using TurboTax since the early 1990's and have found it to be the best and most accurate way to complete my taxes.  I especially like the fact that the state return is automatically computed from data in the federal return.  I have on occasion over the past few years contacted the hotline for some information regarding deductions and they are excellent.
3	1388793600	Except for a few isolated years, I have used TurboTax since the very first version. There have been a few times over the years when software problems with a new version or poor support caused me to switch to the H&R; Block tax software.I fear the 2013 TurboTax may be another problem year. Several features that were basic, such as the ability to easily import financial data from Quicken 2012 are not working correctly and technical support is not replying to my appeal for help.I have a lurking suspicion that because TurboTax and Quicken are both owned by the same parent, and Quicken is pushing their new cloud version, which many users found so bad that they did not upgrade from 2012 in either 20123 or to Quicken 2014 now, TurboTax may have decided not to support interfacing with older versions of Quicken.I am going to give it a month to see if things can be worked out, otherwise I may have to go back to H&R; Block software.
5	1388793600	I love turbo Tax.  I have used it for many years.  It always meets my needs and asks the right questions to maximize my refund or minimize my tax owed.  I have never found an error in all the years I have used it.  I highly recommend Turbo Tax to everyone.
3	1388793600	As usual TTax works as it is suppose to.  I dont like paying the price charged now, and I may not next year after 8 or so years of using it.
5	1388707200	I've used Turbo Tax for many years.  This is the least I've paid for it for a long time.  I'm very happy.
5	1388707200	I have used turbo tax for years and it makes complicated entry's easy and you can  enter your return and expect a quick return f any money due to you.
5	1388620800	TTax2013 is solid and fast as were the prior tax-year versions.  Thankfully you can usually pick it up at a discounted price ($50 -vs- $60) at Amazon earlier than from other sellers (Intuit is usually the LAST one to offer a price-break),  I have only bought TTax on CD over the years (not digital download) so that I have the disc just in case I might need to re-install at some future (like IF the TaxMan were to come a'knockin', God forbid).  Point being I can't comment on the Download approach.My only gripe with Intuit (not this package, per se) is the $40 gouge price for an additional State.  At thathigh price, it's got to be a super-high margin item for Intuit's bottom line.Off-topic slightly, I *do* wish that Intuit would:- Make TTax available for Linux operating systems  (likely won't happen though, given that TTax & Quicken both rely on Microsoft Windows' .Net framework;- Make a TurboTax- style program for preparing and filing Federal Estate, Gift, and Trust returns.  (Maybe they will. should considering the aging Baby Boomer demographics).
5	1388620800	I have been using Turbo tax deluxe for around 10 years and like it very much.  I find it to be user friendly and for 49.99 that is a good price.
4	1388620800	tried many times, following misc help suggestionswound up installing on a newer computer, not as planned, help did not work
5	1388620800	I recommend this product to everyone. I really like its ability to import data from the previous year's return and maximize deductions.
5	1388534400	Have used this product since 2004. My personal opinion is this is the best one on the market for doing federal & state taxes. Over the years, I've only called intuit one time with a question. Again, dependable, easy and accurate. Great Product
5	1388448000	the BEST! Have used for many years and it gets better every year! Have had absolutely no problems so far this year.
4	1388448000	Pretty much the same as previous year's, that's good, no learning struggles.  As most know, there are revisions coming out over several weeks due to the taxing agencies slow release.  This year TurboTax does not ask if you want to incorporate a new revision, it just does it.  I liked the old way better.
5	1388361600	I have used TT for years. It allows an easy &#34;walk-through&#34; or you can pull up specific forms as needed. It extracts personal information from your previous year's report, so you only have to edit/update that if needed - this saves a lot of time. It allows you to save your 1040 and supporting documents as a pdf file. It's nice to have the last nine years of 1040's as pdf files in case I need to access any  information.  The e-file works great, and a refund often just takes 7-10 days.
1	1388361600	Do NOT buy this product!  You can go to the Turbotax site and look up &#34;1603 Errors&#34; to see what kind of problems people like me ar having!  This will NOT install, and a refund request has been totally ignored, as have help requests.  They ask you to sign up to be contacted IF a fix is found, but have heard nothing to date.  Many suggestions have been made, but none work.
4	1388275200	TurboTax has always been good and I have been using it for many years.If only, however, Intuit would provide an intelligent and printable error report. What I especially want to know is just the &#34;root cause&#34;  error(s) by Form and Line, and why (e.g. it is estimated for a 1099 -  I don't need to see the 'error' on Schedule B and 1040 etc). What I don't need is all the knock-on problems from the root cause unless I can turn that on/off with an option or have the root cause values clearly marked. .I'd also like an option with the current year version to create a &#34;planning&#34; version for the next year where I can copy/clear from the filed version just to get what-if scenarios for next year. I don't expect it to have any law modifications for the following year but it would be nice to automate a 'sandbox'.I always run my final cut by my CPA and we spend a couple of weeks reconciling differences.  I'm never sure whether TT or CPA is correct, but I have go with his numbers if I want him to support me if there are questions.
4	1388275200	Turbo tax has always been the best program.  It was less expensive at Walmart but the local state tax would mack it more.
5	1388188800	I have used turbotax for over 10 years. It is an excellent product. If you use Quicken also, it can upload all your data automatically. I love the ability to do multiple states and e-filing. Now that our daughter is married, I thought this would be an excellent gift for Christmas.
5	1388188800	I have used TurboTax for over ten years to prepare my tax returns. It has eased my work tremendously!It frees me up for other necessary things.
4	1388188800	I am a long time user of TurboTax since the years before it was purchased by Intuit from Chipsoft (delivery via 5 1/4" floppy disks in the 1980s!).  While it works great once you have it installed, during recent years I have had installation errors.This year it was "error code 65535" that forced me to spend an extra hour establishing administrator rights, disabling security software, downloading a fix from intuit's website and then right clicking on the Ttax setup icon to "run as administrator" before it finally installed after 5 attempts.  My OS is Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit.The link to Ituit's error code 65535 solution is[...]
3	1388188800	TurboTax clearly seems to be adopting a design philosophy of limiting the user's ability to OVERRIDE values on the return.  In the past, a user could override any calculated or transferred value anywhere on the return.  In the 2011, 2012, and 2013 versions, however, that ability has become restricted.  So far as I know, limitations on overrides only appear in Form 8582 (Passive Activities) AND its worksheets.  In 2011 and 2012, I had to prepare Form 8582 and its worksheets with a TYPEWRITER (!!!); I will have to do the same in 2013.  Fortunately, the calculated values from Form 8582 flow to other forms and schedules where I COULD override and compensate for what TurboTax has done.  But if this design philosophy of no overrides begins to affect (infect) other parts of the program, I will have to abandon it entirely.Sophisticated users be careful!  TurboTax is heading in a bad direction.
5	1388102400	Have used the  Deluxe version for years as it downloads my Broker's statements ,avoiding a lot of hand entry I've had to use with some of Turbo's competition. That said you should double check any data you import from previous returns or other sources.
5	1388102400	I have been using TurboTax for several years now.  Each year they make improvements which make data entry more convenient.Also like how it stores previous years detailed info for comparison and use each year.
3	1388102400	TurboTax is generally a reliable product, but there are too many confusing variations in the versions.  Does this version include state filing?  Apparently even Amazon is confused:The title: &#34;TurboTax Deluxe Fed, Efile and State 2013&#34;In the bullet list of features: &#34;Includes one TurboTax State product download&#34;Under Product Information: &#34;State preparation is NOT included in this version.&#34;
4	1388016000	This is all you need if you have a typical tax return. If you're a college student, or just got your first job, and have little or no investments, odd deductions, or &#34;well, what happened was&#8230;&#34; stories, this will do the job and save you the hassle and money of a professional tax preparer.All of the negative comments could have been prevented by considering the following:1. This is not a silver bullet. It will do 90% of the work for you, but you still need to be able to follow simple directions, have access to pertinent records, and be willing to put in the work to discover the tips and tricks the professionals already know.2. Time is money. You COULD complete your entire tax return with this program, but keep in mind that the more complicated your finances the more time you'll have to invest. In some cases, it's worth it to just pay someone to do it for you.
5	1387843200	I've been a user of many tax preparation software products over the years ever since my DOS days.  I settled on TurboTax some years ago and have been pleased with how it helps me cope with this annual chore.  I believe it's the best on the market.
5	1387843200	A good product that's getting increasingly expensive. Updates continue coming in all the way beyond the tax filing deadline. Unreasonable.
5	1387756800	I have use TurboTax for many years and the 2013 issue does not disappoint.  The program just keeps getting better and easier to use.
5	1387584000	The only tax software I trust.  have used TurboTax for several years and found it to be the best!  Fast delivery and customer service was great!Thank you!
2	1387497600	Thats a deal breaker for me after a dozen years + with Turbotax.....going HR block, its cheaper than TT anyway.
4	1387411200	I have been using TT for many years and find this years product to be as good as any of the years past.
5	1387238400	What can I say? It is TurboTax, which we have been using for several years. I usually pick it up for about $45 at Costco, but I didn't want to wait. The $49 is still a good price. So now I can get a jump on our taxes before the new year.
1	1387238400	As of 12/17 the digital download version of TurboTax 2013 cannot install on Windows 7 (I have 64 bit, all security turned off).Error is &#34;Sorry but your system doesn't meet the minimum requirements: Administrator rights&#34;.Tried running as administrator and troubleshoot compatibility, neither makes any difference.FWIW, TT 2012 installed with no problems on the same machine.
4	1387238400	I have use Turbotax for many years and find it to be intuitive and fairly easy to use..  It does need constant  updates which are provided by Turbotax.  This is probably necessary so that the product can be made available as early as possible.  It  is a good tool for plan for next years  taxes.
5	1387152000	Good software. This is the first time I am using software to prepare my tax returns. So far I am impressed but I have not completed the 2013 returns so my final opinion will be after I am done and submitted them.
5	1386892800	Just like all Turbo Tax.  Does the job at a reasonable price. I've used Turbo Tax for a dozen years and always a great product.
5	1386806400	It's a bit early to review the 2013 tax software when 2013 isn't over yet and the rules probably aren't finalised.  Still, I have used Turbo Tax successfully for many years, and this will probably be just as acceptable.
5	1386720000	Have used this for years.  Easy to use and have no trouble filing taxes.  Will continue to buy this product.
5	1386720000	I love Turbo Tax.  It makes filing you income tax a breeze.  I also love how it works so good with Quicken.  It has never failed me.
5	1386633600	I use this on my MacBook Pro.  We've used TurboTax since 2008 and I wouldn't use anything else.  It makes doing your taxes easy, if that's possible.  I've used the business version in the past when I had a small business, and I've found that both products cover just about every scenario you can think of.  We've never had a problem.  You can exile or print and file a hard copy. It will let you print out all the worksheets or just the pages you want.  You even get instructions on how to assemble the package for mail, where to send it - everything.  The great part I liked was that I could start a return, get as much done as I could, and then save it and come back later and pick up where I left off.  If you're unsure about an answer to a question, there are help features that explain the types of things that fall into that category.  For the do-it-yourselfer, you won't go wrong.  And it's a lot cheaper than hiring a CPA.
4	1386547200	Great product line,I have used it for years and never had an issue.My only wish is that it would include free state e-files.
4	1386460800	I have used Turbotax since the early 90s and have seen countless evidence for steady and continual improvement over the years.  As a few other posts have indicated, if I were to reload the 1995 or 2002 version (and I have recently loaded 2003 to save a copy of that year's returns in a PDF format) I might be disappointed comparing it side by side to the 2012 or 2013 version ... but that only indicates how superior the 2012 or 2013 version is and that Turbotax continues to stay dedicated to providing updated and relevant content.I have not yet purchased nor used the 2013 version yet, but fully intend to within the next few weeks.  I've been using Turbotax for over 20 years with increasingly difficult tax scenarios each year ... and have nothing but good things to say about the software.  Oh sure I sometimes think $50 is a bit high for a software package I'll use one time .... but .... compared to the hassle of spending 10-15 hours of time doing my taxes manually (yes my time is worth something) or thousands of dollars going to a CPA .... I continue to judge the $50 as a very good value for the money.
1	1386028800	Do not know for sure about the offline version, but the online version of Turbotax deluxe does not include Schedule D. This is as basic as it gets and it has been left out of deluxe. One has to go to Premier to be able to do any stock related stuff. See [...] for what is included.
5	1385942400	I've used Turbotax since it first came out and find it an excellent buy. Most people using an accountant would save a bunch of money using it. It has an easy step process that walks you through the entire process and your state tax is automatically prepared as you prepare your federal tax. A friend tried it recreating his tax that had been prepared by his accountant and found Turbotax lowered his tax.
1	1385942400	I was a devoted user of TurboTax up until 2002 when I had significant problems with installation of the software.  Coincidentally this was the year they instituted limited installations on your computers and eliminated free phone support.  Tried to resolve the issue through several &#34;chat&#34; sessions which proved futile.  The tech support was not only inadequate but rude.  When I indicated that I wasn't satisfied with the support and wished to &#34;chat&#34; with a supervisor the agent told me &#34;there is no supervisor available and he would just tell me the same thing anyway&#34;!Ultimately searched and found an alternative in TaxAct.  Less than half the price and whenever I called there was a person on the other end.  Even if I did not have the terrible experience years ago I wonder why anyone feels the need to pay 3x the price?
4	1385683200	I've used TurboTax for many years and found it to be a good product. There is, however, no reason to order it before, say, mid-January inasmuch as most of the forms are, at best, tentative awaiting IRS finalization. The 2013 version is pretty much the same as the versions for the last two or three years -- in fact, I can't detect any changes. The carry forward of &#34;stuff&#34; from 2012 (if you used TurboTax in 2012) is handy especially if your taxes are the same (except for amounts) from year to year. TurboTax has some minor shortcomings but it sure makes it MUCH easier to wade through the myriad of IRS forms and their embedded illogic..
5	1385424000	I do our taxes every year and it is a tedious job. If it wasn't for TurboTax I probably would have it done. This year's version is pretty much the same as past years and I am glad because I have used the software for as long as I can remember and I like following the same walk through routine that TurboTax makes you follow.  Using TurboTax is fast and easy and I like several features that I use every year:* The ability to import last year's data automatically into this year's preparation.* The ability to E-file your taxes with the federal government which speeds up your refund, if you are getting one.* The itemized deductions for gifts to charity is very helpful as we donate quite a bit every year and it makes it easier to compile a list, keep it for your records and come up with a reasonable value to claim on your taxes.* I actually pre-calculate my next year's taxes and print out the forms to mail in quarterly payments for the next year's taxes to avoid a penalty.* The ability to keep a PDF copy of your tax return forms for your records as well as print out the forms it you need them.* I always save my tax computer files and I buy the disk version of TurboTax in case I have to reinstall the software and make an update or file an amended tax return later on.The nice thing is that you can update the program and make sure that you have all of the latest updates to the tax laws and forms.  Having TurboTax walks me through the forms and helps me fill them out faster and easier than reading all of those tax pages written for lawyers.I just use the combined federal and state version of TurboTax and file electronically.  This version includes the ability to file up to 5 Federal tax reports electronically. You can download the state version of TurboTax for one state for free.  If you want to file your state return electronically then you have to pay for the privilege.  I like the fact that I can quickly do my state taxes after finishing the federal forms.  I also always estimate my next year's taxes and print out the prepayment forms that I customize to fit what additional income I am expecting.These are just a few of the main features that I like with TurboTax and I recommend the software to you as an easy tool to use. I do wait to find a good price on it as the price keeps going up and up every year.
