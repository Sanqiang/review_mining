5	1405641600	Love all of Liane Moriarty's books!
5	1405468800	Nice summer read - not too serious but very entertaining.
5	1405468800	What a great story!  Very interesting characters and plot development.
2	1405468800	Mediocre.
4	1405468800	I enjoyed reading the book more than the ending of the book.  I think I expected more from the ending.  However, I already recommended it to a friend, so I would say it is worth reading.
5	1405382400	This book made me stop and think about myself and how different of a person I was 10 years ago.  I couldn't put it down.
5	1405382400	I loved, loved, loved this book!  It took me a little while to figure out who the narrative pattern but once I did the story flowed so well.  I couldn't wait to finish each chapter and read the next to see what happened.
5	1405296000	Such a wonderful read.  Liane Moriarty's books are so well written: the prose is smart, brisk, funny, and touching - all at once.  This is the third one I've read and I have to say, each is unique and entertaining.  Perfect for a vacation or hectic daily commute by rail (that's me!).  She crafts a lovely story, too, that captures relationships of all sorts in a way that just feels really, well, real -- Just enough of the biting folly that we so often succumb to, balanced with our capacity for healing and kindness.  This particular novel is temporary amnesia, family, and self discovery... I know that sounds like a load of crap, but believe me - it's a delightful book.GREAT, great, great!! If you don't like the sound of this one, pick ANY one of her others up; you won't be disappointed!
4	1405296000	-
3	1405296000	Not breaking new ground here, very Moriarty. But always entertains nonetheless.
4	1405209600	an interesting take on relationships and how they can be broken and repaired
5	1405209600	I loved this book!  I found it interesting from the start and each page propelled me to the next.  I couldn't put it down.  It's one of those books that is very enjoyable to read but it makes you think afterward.We read it for Book Club.  We often read books that are emotionally draining.  This is not one of those books!  I would highly recommend it!
3	1405209600	Good character development but had a fairly predictable ending.  Enjoyed it a lot.
5	1405123200	Loved this book - love all of her books.  Moriarty is a terrific writer and this story is no exception.  I couldn't imagine forgetting 10 years of my life - forgetting my children and my best friend but Moriarty writes this in a truly believable and touching way.  Definitely recommend this book.
5	1405123200	I loved this book! Fresh idea, easy to read, no sluggish parts, interesting to see how one can look at their life from a different point and find it so lacking!
2	1405123200	Seemed like a life time TV show
5	1405123200	Very enjoyable read!
4	1405123200	I was hooked at the beginning. Great, easy read. Makes one think about what they would do if they had the opportunity for a do-over.
4	1405123200	Great read! Makes you think about what is important in life
5	1405036800	Fast read...makes you realize how thin the line of love and hate really is. Such a great perspective to look at how ones life can change in just ten years and how we become so busy with our lives we forget what is truly important.  Highly recommended!! Worth it!!
4	1405036800	Well written, fast paced modern novel about a today's woman whose life comes to a stop when she falls off her spinning bike. She encounters a lapse in memory that sets her back ten years to a time when her life had fewer problems. My book club enjoyed discussing this novel. Some of the side characters were not well developed and could have been edited from the book.
4	1405036800	This is a great Summer time read: it grabs the reader from the beginning and introduces a slew of interesting characters while taking them through an intriguing situation. It makes you ask yourself what you might do under similar circumstances. I gave it 4 versus 5 stars just because I wished the end hadn't been so neatly tied up - I prefer a more messy 'real life' ending perhaps. I did love the author's thorough character building: I felt I knew these people and understood their feelings, reactions and motivations.
5	1405036800	I am kind of picky about what books I really like. This one was really good. it caught my interest from beginning to end. What I like most about the author is that none of her books are the same or have the same outcome.
4	1404950400	Love this author, great read!
4	1404950400	Very good read
5	1404950400	Loved it!!!!  This is the second book by this author and I loved them both!  Can't wait to read her other books.
3	1404950400	good enough to finish, but not great. fizzled out near the end. never explained friendship with Gina. overall, ok story
4	1404950400	Loved the story and couldn't figure out the ending but was happy with it.
5	1404864000	I highly recomand this book. How she uses her accident to turn her life around is encouraging.
4	1404864000	Excellent book! Would definitely recommend to my friends. Would also be a good &#34;book club&#34; read, because it lends itself to some good discussion topics.
5	1404864000	Fantastic! Couldn't put it down !
3	1404864000	It was an easy summer read.
3	1404864000	Not bad for a summer read...
5	1404864000	I really enjoyed this book. It grabbed me from the beginning and I couldn't put it down.
5	1404864000	From the first page I was completely immersed in Alice's story. I loved her voice and discovering her life through her mind. Satisfying read from start to finish. Bought another one of author's books immediately to help with book withdrawal.
5	1404864000	Such an honest look at marriage and children. A must-read for those of us in the thick of child-rearing and those who want a family.
4	1404864000	If you liked &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, you will like this
3	1404777600	Overall, Good, but became a bit tedious and long winded in some spots.
5	1404777600	I downloaded this book for a recent trip and loved it.  I found myself emotionally invested in Alice as she tries to make sense of a life she cannot remember and lives with the consequences of choices that have led her down a path she is no longer sure that she wants.  There are a number of emotional layers to this book and I appreciated the complexity of each character.  A great beach read!(although be careful, you may get so into it that you forgo the beach altogether).
4	1404777600	Really enjoyed it!  At first, reading from multiple characters perspectives was not appealing to me, but in short time I got to know the characters and it was fine. It provided a cool perspective. Same issues and how do different people think. I recommend it!
5	1404777600	A nice story that makes you want to embrace all the memories you have. Also makes you think about how life changes you over time.
5	1404777600	This is an interesting read. Alice falls and hits her head and consequently has amnesia. She knows who she is but believes she is 10 years younger. Yes, she has lost only the last 10 years of her life. That would include, however, her children and separation from her husband. It appears that Alice had become not such a pleasant lady during the last 10 years, at least in comparison to how she used to be. She wants things to go back the way they were, but will she if/when she gets her memory back??? The mind is very complicated, as this brings out. What would you choose to forget, if given the opportunity?
5	1404777600	Yes, I'm a guy who occasionally reads &#34;Chick Lit&#34;, and I really liked this book.  I connected with the characters and the story, and I tore through the book in three sittings.  I liked this one a bit better than &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, and I am now reading &#34; The Hypnotist's Love Story&#34;.  Like all of the Liane Moriarty Books I have read, you have to reserve judgement until the end.
5	1404777600	I preferred The Husband's Secret, but this story is great too. Believable characters, unique plot. It becomes increasingly engaging as it develops.
5	1404691200	Great book!!! Really pleasant story.  Great read for a vacation!
2	1404691200	Fairly disappointing! I spent way too much time waiting... & waiting... Of course, she would get her memory back, & the experience would change her. A shame that I kicked off my summer with this book!
5	1404691200	Delightful page-turner.
5	1404691200	I really liked the fact that people forget ( besides me, that is).  A little confusing after memory returns as to whom her choice was...but clarified within moments.
5	1404691200	Loved it
5	1404691200	it was a quick and easy ready-I enjoyed it!
5	1404691200	I hated putting this book down in order to &#34;carry on with real life&#34;. Moriarity did an amazing job of viewing life through Young Alice's eyes, and I felt myself rooting for her and Nick throughout. I felt that all of the characters were really well developed and, despite the flaws of each one, they were all likable. I won't write any more because I would then have  to include spoilers. And that isn't really why you read reviews before purchasing a book.Highly recommend. Fantastic read. Relatable characters. Well done.
5	1404604800	Really loved this book.  Amazing how people change in such a short period of time.  I really couldn't put this book down.  Just couldn't imagine if this happened to me
4	1404604800	Great summer read!
4	1404604800	Listened as an audio book while driving. Very interesting story for me, touched on a few issues of life I have experienced. Would recommend.
4	1404604800	Very much enjoyed this book and have recommended it to friends.
4	1404518400	Incredibly fun read. Perfect for summer
4	1404518400	I enjoyed reading this book and thought it was a page turner, however not as good as The Husbands Secret.
4	1404518400	Started off a little slowly for me, but it turned out to be very good.
3	1404518400	It was very entertaining - light and easy reading.  Great book for a vacation.
5	1404518400	Great Beach Read.
5	1404518400	This book is like almost every woman I know, busy, moving forward, and focused on achieving the next goal on her hectic to do list.  Until, it slows you down, forcibly, by erasing the memories of the past ten years from Alices life. This book turned out, unexpectedly, to be a wonderful reminder of what the truly important things really are in a person's life, and it isn't finishing the to do list.
5	1404518400	Loved it!  I can really relate to the characters.  Great story line - different from every other book out there.  You had no idea how it was going to end.  Wonderful!
5	1404518400	Awesome story
4	1404432000	Very good book!
3	1404432000	This wasn't a bad book but I'm surprised by the reviews that thought it had any depth.  For the first half or so, I thought it might, and I was decently engaged.  By the mid-way point though, it was clear exactly how all three major storylines were going to turn out (for Alice, her sister, and her adoptive grandmother) and it became a matter of slogging through it all to get to the cloying, predictable ending.  This is a perfectly fine book if you need something vapid but catchy for the beach or a flight, but it's not exactly a book to get you thinking.
3	1404432000	It is okay
1	1404432000	I had problems following the story!!!
5	1404432000	I was h
5	1404432000	Once you start reading that you can't put it down.
3	1404345600	I don't remember. Please delete from my list
5	1404345600	I love this author and would recommend this book as well as The Husband's Secret.
5	1404345600	So coincidental that I downloaded this book to my Kindle...as my sister currently has short term memory loss !  I absolutely loved this book...and was sad when it was over !  You know when a book is good, when it lives in your head for a few days after you have read the last chapter ! What a wonderful writer Liane Moriarty is ...is she is ever in the San Diego are, I want to meet her !
2	1404345600	This is the third book I have read by this author. I think I am done with her. Liked The Husband's Secret. Did not like The Last Anniversary. I skimmed through the last hundred pages of What Alice Forgot.
4	1404345600	It's a love story with a happy ending.
3	1404345600	A great summer read.  The plot is simple and the emotions are hopeful and romantic
5	1404345600	Remarkable story telling.  It took me awhile to grasp the concept of the 3 different women's parts.  But it folded so beautifully together and kept me fully involved to the last page.
4	1404345600	Excellent. You really connect with the character!!
4	1404345600	After reading &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; and now this, I realize I like Liane Moriarty's writing style.  If I had known that the entire book was in a one-week span, I might not have continued--how could that much story be compressed into that time?  But weaving old memories, remembered and forgotten, throughout made it work.
5	1404345600	Not the type of book I usually read but really enjoyed it!
4	1404345600	Very entertaining book. I miss these characters.
5	1404259200	This was a very good book. It made me think a lot of what life would be like if you could only remember the good parts of the past ten years.
3	1404259200	Once I got into the book it became more interesting.
5	1404259200	Wonderful book!  Couldn't put it down!  Great author...loved this book as much as The Husbands Secret!
4	1404259200	Interesting and well written.
4	1404259200	Very easy to read. Keeps you interested by slowly revealing pieces of the life Alice has forgotten. Definitely written for women though, my husband's eyes glazed over when I tried to explain the plot after he asked what my book was about.
4	1404259200	Fun book. Very much a summer read. I thought it was engaging and enjoyable to read.  I like true crime books, suspense type books, and I needed a break from the dark side...this was perfect.
4	1404259200	This book is well-written. The author is great and once you get used to her style of switching between characters, it is really enjoyable. Unexpected plot twists and leaves you wanting more!
5	1404172800	This book held my attention and really made me wonder what I would do in similar circumstances. Characters came to life and there were mysteries that kept me wanting to know more.
4	1404172800	Good summer read.  Predictable ending. She remains one of my favorite authors
1	1404172800	I enjoyed 'The Husband's Secret' and was looking forward to reading this BUT it was one of the worst books I have ever read. I could not bring myself to waste time finishing it. I just wanted to forget it!
2	1404172800	I was kind of' blah'.  You could have figured out the end midway through the book.  Needed more surprises throughout
3	1404172800	I found this book an easy read and at times I couldn't put it down.  The author creates suspense that in the end doesn't give a big payoff, but &#34;getting there&#34; is the fun part.
5	1404172800	Really engaging - a good summer read.
5	1404172800	I thougt this book was great. The midde of the book made me think wow this ist  happening but just keep reading and you'll  just  fall in love.
5	1404172800	As an expat living in Seattle, WA reading this book was just like being home. I loved the language, the grammar, the voice of this book is so authentically Australian. I loved it. I loved the story. It made me think a lot about my own family and my parents, and things I might do differently if I could reinvent myself (which is essentially what Alices gets to do while she has amnesia) While she has amnesia and she is thinking about her friend Gina and how she has the idea that perhaps she is to blame for her own divorce, you kind of agree with her. But when she gets her memory back you think to yourself &#34;we all need a friend like that&#34;. From reading this book I am deffinitely adding Liane Moriarty's other books to my Kindle library!
5	1404086400	I read this book on the recommendation of a friend and loved it!  Fast moving, light hearted reading yet gives you lots to think about in the end. Once the story started evolving it was very hard to put down.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a different, but good book to read.
5	1404086400	She's one of my favorite authors and always tugs at my heartstrings in each of her books and makes me laugh, too.  I think the premise of this book is amazing and throughout the entire story I kept thinking, &#34;What is something like this happened to me?!&#34;It made me think of all that's happened over the last 10 years and sent me down Memory Lane so that was another plus.This was an overall great read!
5	1404086400	Great read. I really enjoyed it
5	1404086400	Review written by wife: Great book! I enjoyed every page and I am a very impatient reader and a page skipper. It is not a mystery nor a suspense but it kept my attention and interest, I wanted to know more and each page brought something unexpected but yet familiar to every woman. I am not sure that a man would enjoy this book the same ... By the way, it has nothing in common with typical &#34;female&#34; romance novels, thanks God.
3	1404000000	Okay reading if I am stuck waiting in a doctor's office.  Not my choice of genre, but read to satisfy book club requirements.
4	1404000000	Format on Kindle was a bit confusing but the further I read the better I liked and got acquainted with the characters.
4	1404000000	Fun summer read.  Good for discussion about 'what if you could go back, get a do over'.  Our book club was all over the map on that!
5	1404000000	I loved this story for how well the characters were very well developed and how the author made me care about them.  I read it twice in a month...and it wasn't for lack of books to read!  I had read &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; and loved that one, too.  I would have considered that book somewhat dark, but &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; not at all.  In fact, there was a good dose of humor in it.  Also, I loved the multiple story lines and how they were resolved.
5	1404000000	Loved this book. Great story & didn't want to put it down
2	1404000000	Light easy read, it moved along well but  build up was a let down and knew all along how it would end.  Given amnesia, you'd think Alice would have forget something nuts.  Nope.
3	1404000000	I liked the book!  I thought that  the author developed the characters nicely.  There was a good pace to the book.I would recommend What Alice Forget!
5	1404000000	I really like this author. I've read three books by her now and have enjoyed ask the of them. I hope she writes another book soon!
5	1404000000	This book is amazing. It's been a long, long time since I haven't been able to put a book down, but I literally thought about this book every minute I wasn't reading it. I love these characters and this story. Beautiful, lovely. Thank you so much for this book.
4	1404000000	At first I thought this book silly, until I got into the characters.  There are good lessons for us all about being in the present and enjoying life.
5	1403913600	This is another great book by Liane Moriarty.  I have been reading all her books from the very beginning and am almost ready for the newest one!  She is a great author who always provides a good twist at the end of the story.
5	1403913600	Liane Moriarity is fabulous. She knows how to capture different personalities to perfection. She really keeps you interested and the concept is fascinating! You will enjoy.
5	1403913600	This is the second book I've read by this author.  I like her style of writing and her character development.  They weren't exactly mysteries, but kept me anxious to find out what would happen next.
5	1403913600	This book is funny, realistic, romantic, and gripping. Neither sappy nor cynical, it explores the deep and complex issues of a long term marriage in a wise and winsome way. And all of this is delivered in an intriguing plot that is satisfying to the last page. Loved it!
5	1403913600	I read this book in one day because I could not put it down!  It's such an interesting story, and it really makes me think about how much life changes us....sometimes for the better, sometimes for worse.
5	1403827200	Great summer read!
4	1403827200	Light reading, but you don't want to put it down.  Entertaining story, and I couldn't help but think how my life might have been different if something like this had happened to me.
5	1403827200	Thought provoking yet fun read.  Couldn't put it down.  If you liked The Husband's Secret, you won't be disappointed with this book.
4	1403827200	This book kept me reading right on through. Definitely a page turner. Imagine what it would be like to wake up from a tumble and not remember the last 10 years of your life! A lot changes in 10 years.
5	1403827200	This is truly a case of you never know how good you have it until its gone! Liane Moriarty has become one of my favorite authors because of this novel. This was my first one of read of hers and I've read all of her others since. Alice suffers from a head trauma wakes up and sees this darling life but the people in it are miserable mostly because of pre-trauma Alice. It's a heartbreaking/heartwarming story that makes you want to appreciate life as it. I love it because usually it's so retrospective and final like death. But this allows Alice to live life and interact with the people whom she's ticked off and hate her, neighbors, peers and even her own children. All while still rooting for Alice! Read it! You'll love it!
4	1403827200	I enjoyed reading this book, it kept me entertained, I have to say this is not the type of book I normally read, I am more attracted to read science fiction, fantasy, mystery books or a good thriller but I grew more and more fond to the story and the characters, I was really stressed on behalf of Alice for all the things she did not remember and her broken marriage and was really hoping they would end up getting back together, it certainly makes you think about your own marriage/live. The only thing that I would change was the letters from Frannie to Phil, those were the most difficult parts to read because I couldn&#8217;t care less, I struggled a little with Elizabeth&#8217;s homework for her doctor, but at the end I can see how that was important to understand her situation and all her suffering and struggle to get pregnant and also her relationship with Alice, but Frannie&#8217;s letters had nothing to do with the original plot and seemed to be there just to make the book a little lengthier, I found myself skipping sentences and then paragraphs of her letters
3	1403827200	Book was ok. Somewhat hard to follow at times. Dragged on towards the end and predictable. Tries to portray a love story.
3	1403827200	Kind of interesting but seemed contrived.  The writing was formula and not good literature. I don't know what else to say.
5	1403827200	Completely enjoyed this book.  Ms. Moriarty has a fantastic ability to create unique storylines with plenty of twists and turns and original characters.
2	1403740800	this was disappointing.  could not identify with main character. disjointed writing, lots of lose ends.  plot seemed unrealistic.  main character was not sympathetic
4	1403740800	I almost didn't read this book.  I like light, happy books for the most part.  Slogging through reading about a divorce, a bitter custody battle, a broken relationship with a sister didn't sound like something I'd like.  But it kept coming up as recommended, so I finally downloaded a sample and was hooked.I laughed out loud at times.  This book is delightful.  Halfway through I was describing it to my sister and told her that it's almost a well-written romance, with the central characters having been married for 15 years or so.If I could, I would have given it 4.5 stars.  Not perfect, but definitely an enjoyable read.
4	1403740800	Even though somewhat lighthearted, this book was also thought provoking. Interesting characters with some plot twists. I truly enjoyed it and would recommend it.
5	1403740800	I loved how this book made me think of myself 10 years ago and how I would be proud of who I have become but also giving me insight into what my future self may look like.Recommend this to anyone in their 30s starting a family, with a young family or a growing family
4	1403654400	Very well written.  Alice passes out while at spin class and hits her head which causes her to forget the past ten years of her life.  She has no memory of having three children and believes it is 1998 and she is pregnant with her first child.  I found the book hard to put down.
4	1403654400	Entertaining and enjoyable. I found myself wondering about the characters when I wasn't reading. I found it engaging and interesting. I'm very glad a read the epilogue so I wasn't left wondering, but I wish I knew what was causing Alice to faint.
3	1403654400	I was captivated by the premise: a woman awaken's from a head injury and has lost all memory of the last 10 years--including her three children and failing marriage. I was thoroughly entertained until the end, which I thought was weak.
5	1403568000	This book is a delightful read.  It made me think about how I have changed in the past ten years!
4	1403568000	A quick read.  It's a very interesting premise.  Many things change over the course of a marriage, and although Alice has amnesia and forgets what has changed In her marriage,it remains that most couples are not the same people as they were when their marriage starts.
5	1403568000	Loved the book and couldn't put it down.  The premise was unique and made me step back and look at my own life.  I loved the topic and the growth of the characters.
3	1403568000	I thought it was mediocre not hard to put down.  It developed slow and some of the characters were shallow.
4	1403568000	As if life isn't complicated enough, amnesia enters the journey.  Our hopes and disappointments can sometimes blur our deep feelings.  Perhaps the ending was best and not too neat.  Range of emotion with parenting disappointment/victory as well. N.
4	1403481600	For some reason, I don't think this is as good as &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, but I couldn't put it down and kept thinking about it during the day... so it was pretty good.  I'm not sure what makes the other book &#34;better&#34;, but like me if you want to read another Liane Moriarty book, this is a great one.
5	1403481600	Great idea makes you appreciate the moment and look at things simply. I liked the husband secret by this author as well.
5	1403481600	Enjoyed the author's approach to the narrator (s)  giving their views of the situation or event as Alice tries to regain her memories. It was such a commentary on people and how we get into the middle of other peoples problems and all of a sudden we have the same ones.
3	1403308800	Pleasant enough; not as good as A Husbands Secret. 2-3 points for a rating.Very predictable but very cute ending.
5	1403308800	hard to put the book down, goes in a lot of directions but worth the trip. some days how I feel and I did't bump my head.
5	1403308800	I very much enjoyed reading this.  Had me thinking the whole time, &#34;What would I do?&#34; Great perspective and great discussion!
4	1403308800	I found myself relating easily to characters in real-life scenarios. A thought-proovoking read, you will wonder what aspects of your own life today would shock the &#34;you&#34; from 10 years ago...
5	1403308800	I have read six or seven books by her and loved every one of them.  Something about the way she develops her characters makes them so real and believable.  You need to start reading Liane Moriarty!
5	1403308800	Loved every minute of it .... Great vacation book! Have recommended it to many people .... I think I have become a big fan of her books
4	1403308800	After reading The Husband's Secret I was very interested in reading another Liane Moriarty book.  What Alice Fogot did not disappoint. Couldn't put it down! Great summer read.
4	1403222400	This is another one by this author which claims your attention all the way through. We wonder, along with Alice, what she forgot, and there's never a dull moment. My hope is that this writer will continue to write novels which are so original, enjoyable and intelligent. I will just say, &#34;How would you feel if you suddenly forgot the past 10 years of your life?&#34;
5	1403222400	Love Liane Moriaty!  This is one of my favorite books, different plot, great story, wonderfully detailed and funny characters.  Definitely recommend!
5	1403222400	The story pulls you in right away.  The author is great at telling multiple stories at the same time with a lot of humor.
5	1403222400	I enjoyed this light reading. It is a great book to read over the summer. It was fun and witty.
5	1403222400	I love the intrigue she incorporates into her stories. After reading The Husband's Secret I fell in love with her style. So have been reading everything she has written. This is my second most favorite so far...
4	1403136000	I was in suspense almost till the very end. This author made me go inside Alice's head, I felt as if I had memory loss and I gained memory as Alice gained her memory back. This was quite different and I enjoyed it all except the ending, it got too mushy in the end and too predictable, actually the end was boring and all the mystery evaporated. The ending is the only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating
4	1403136000	"What Alice Forget" is like having a lovable puppy under foot - it's endearing, charming, lively, and with you at every turn.  There's no ignoring the effect this novel has to make you wonder, along with its protagonist, "How did I EVER get from there to here?"Alice receives a blow to the head, and when she comes to, she believes she is 29 again with all her life before her.  She's young, in love with her husband, and expecting her first child.  What a shock for her to learn that she's actually almost 40, has three children, and an impending divorce.  Those closest to her are wary and distant, and the clues they give her to understand the woman she's become aren't very helpful.  Alice has to uncover who she really is, and why she became a woman she's reluctant to admit she really doesn't like.  Alice has to piece together a few mysteries (since no one is comfortable providing details) on the significant life events which occurred over the last 10 years.  What Alice comes to  realize is that the less significant daily choices that she made are equally important."What Alice Forgot" speaks to anyone who's lived, loved, made friends, mistakes and choices. ( In short, anyone who has truly lived).  Would any of our "former selves" recognize the women we've become?  Do we make memories - or do they make us who we are?  Ms Moriarty takes a light-hearted tale and subtly deepens its focus as the novel progresses.  She brings up key issues in women's lives, and readers find themselves, like Alice, wondering how much of themselves they've "lost" along the way.  Happily, Alice (and her audience) gain a great deal as well by the time the novel ends.  You'll be turning pages far into the night to see what Alice discovers, and if/how she resolves the choices she's made.
2	1403136000	Not as good as Husbands Secret.  I didn't care for the story line.  It was more of a soap opera.
4	1403136000	Fun story, light and great read.  Really enjoyed it.  Kept wondering how I would deal if it was me.  Great book for the beach!
5	1403049600	What a beautiful story of life, how you can lose your way, and then choices you can make to change that path.  I still think about this book and how it could impact lives!
5	1403049600	This was an absolute page-turned and I hated to see it end. I fell in love with Alice and her journey of trying to remember.
3	1403049600	Well written, fast-paced and fun, with likeable characters. I read it a little each evening out on the balcony to unwind. It would be a great book for the pool or a train ride.  It's not deep, but is engaging and keeps you guessing until the end--a perfect dose of literary junkfood.
5	1403049600	I couldn't put this book down.  I would even wake up in the middle of the night and go downstairs to read it.
4	1403049600	Couldn't put it down...about a woman who couldn't remember last 10 years of her life....Very well written.................... ......... .....
5	1403049600	I think I liked it even more than &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;!  Alice is such a relatable character, she made the book.  &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; is funny, heart-warming, sad, and emotional and at the same time.  Thanks for your work Liane Moriaty.
5	1402963200	I really enjoyed this book - it was both entertaining and thoughtful.  Her characters were well drawn and the children, ah the children,  I want to meet them.
4	1402876800	Really good story.flowed and ebbed, tearful then joyful.This author has a clear understanding of marriage and its ups and downs.
3	1402876800	Reading this story made you think about your own life and what if you lost 10 years of your life. OMG. Would you be able to survive? Make the same decisions after you get your memory back.
5	1402876800	This was a fun read.  Generally I would prefer a murder mystery, but this book completely held my interest.  A much better book then &#34;The Husbands Secret&#34; also by this author.
4	1402876800	Good read!  This was my first of laine moriarty and I am sold! I couldn't put it down.  Gonna read her other book.
3	1402876800	Loved the premise and the story line, but I will agree with other reviewers that it could've been shortened. We didn't have to get beaten over the head with &#34;yes, life sometimes sucks&#34; re: the sister's storyline, which became a bit annoying after a while. What was most interesting to me were the changes that occurred to Alice over the 10 years she forgot...it would have been more interesting to learn how she became the Alice prior to the head bump...imagine if all those who were having life problems could erase 10 years of &#34;drama&#34; and get back to enjoying the simple things.
4	1402790400	I enjoyed reading this book. Only one problem which was, it took too long to get to the point but other than that I liked it.
5	1402790400	I loved this book.  I recommend it to everyone!  Actually I recommend all of Liane Moriarty.  It was a truly great book.
5	1402790400	Kept me thinking the whole way through. Unique ending. It certainly makes me think about what would I be like if I lost my memory!
5	1402790400	I really enjoyed this book, the characters, and the novel plot.  What would you do if you forgot the last 10 years of your life, the reasons you are divorcing your husband, don't know your 3 children, or why you have become who you have become.  The author slowly unravelled the story and it was pitch perfect.
4	1402790400	This was an enjoyable read that makes you think about the choices you make and your behavior...and if you could do it over, how would you change?
5	1402704000	Loved this book.  I could not put this book down and recommend this to anyone looking for a good read.
5	1402704000	Good read and interesting thoughts about suburban mom life and how one gets to the &#34;busy, busy , busy&#34; life. Inspires readers to think about the last ten years of life.
5	1402704000	I would recommend this book to alot of women!  This book was a fast read or was it that I just couldn't put it down?  Loved and disliked Alice sometimes as well as other characters but in the end I had a change of heart!  This is an awesome read!!!
5	1402704000	A fascinating look at what might happen if you suddenly wake up from a knock on the head and have no memory of the last 10 years of your life.  Moriarty captures the changes in Alice that occurred over her life....and now lets Alice examine herself.  Does she like the person she has slowly become?  I loved this book....as I have loved others from Moriarty and I highly recommend it.
5	1402704000	Very funny easy to read.a little jumpy in the begining would look forward to reading more from this author in the future
5	1402704000	A very good read.  I enjoyed the story line & the characters.  Kind of a weak ending.  A letdown!  Couldn't  Alice have become an independent woman in the end?
5	1402617600	Great little gem! Really enjoy her writing and development of characters. One of my new favorite authors - you can be I'll be purchasing more of her works!!
5	1402617600	This book was a great read and I couldn't put the book down. Was sorry when I finished it! Will read more of her books.
5	1402617600	Just drop dead fun.  Excellent story.  Wonderful characters. I have read three of the books by this author.  Loved them all.  I read this one in a day and a half.  Read this woman's books.
1	1402617600	Contrived, juvenile & shallow--I kept reading & hoping for more.  None of the main characters were ones to really like.
5	1402617600	Alice suffers a serious concussion and forgets 10 years.  It gives her a chance to redo and reimagine the life she would rather lead.  The author wrote interesting supporting characters who also had a redirection in their lives.  The story pointed out that we are sometimes swept away with the demands of life, but when we are forced backward, we can remember what is important.
5	1402617600	This was probably one of the best books I have read in awhile..I don't like that I have to have a certain amount of words to write this review..that's annoying as hell!
5	1402531200	I spend my down time at work reading and this book is perfect.  It has an easy to follow story line making it easy to pick up right were you left off.  And if you have time to just sit and read it's a page turner to keep you attention.  Would recommend it!
4	1402531200	This is an entertaining, and at times, terribly sad story. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to reading more from this author.
5	1402531200	It got me from the first page.  I've read two books by Liane Moriarty now. I've found a new favorite author. I love stories that entwined a family or group of people. Getting to experience insites and details about the supporting cast makes the read very personal and engaging. I'll read more of her works.
5	1402531200	This author really knows how to write a story.  The characters come alive and the storyline flows effortlessly.  It took Alice a bump on the head to put her life back into perspective.  Loved it and definitely recommend.
4	1402444800	Our book club selected this book, and it served to provide a very good discussion.  Somewhat unrealistic in parts, but it was fun meeting all the characters and experiencing their interaction with each other.  How would you cope with finding that you have lost 10 years of your life, only to return to a life entirely different from the one you knew?
4	1402444800	I couldn't put this book down. There were so many parallels to real life. I would recommend it to anyone.
4	1402444800	I found myself completing the story in my head throughout. But I was never correct and that kept it intriguing! I loved it.
5	1402444800	Started out reading The Husband's Secret, my all time favorite.  What Alice Forgot was my second book by this author and I would recommend it.  Moriarty's books all have unusual themes that I have not seen repeated elsewhere.  These books are well written and keep your attention.
5	1402358400	I listened to this as a book on cd from my library and loved it.  This version my library had is the one by Bolinda Audio which is not the same version as the one on audible.  The narrator had a delightful Australian accent that made it even more enjoyable.
5	1402358400	Liane Moriarty is hands-down my favorite author. In this book as in her others I can't wait to see how each character develops. Each book she writes keeps me enthralled and up much too late at night reading, &#34;just one more chapter.&#34; I loved this book. Read it for yourself and see!
5	1402358400	I simply devoured this. The premise is in itself unusual enough to catch my eye, and then the entire plot was captivating. I enjoyed how real Alice's kids felt and how her memory loss reverberated across many lines. It was just really touching and enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
5	1402358400	Great Read! First I loved Alice then I despised her!  Eventually, I came to understand Alice and realized how she became the person she did. Quirky characters really magnified the story line.
4	1402358400	I enjoyed this story.  The author wanted the reader to to feel the frustration of Alice as she struggled to put together pieces of her amnesia past. I believe readers did not like that person and were as anxious for her to be her old self.A good read...entertaining and enjoyable.
4	1402358400	This book started out very slow but once it got going, it was pretty good.  I couldn't wait to find out more about what had happened.  It held my interest.
4	1402358400	I have loved every single Liane Moriarty novel I have read - and I've read nearly all of them. While she can get a bit &#34;chatty&#34; with her dialogue, it accurately depicts how many suburban housewives speak and think (being one myself).  While her genre is chick lit, don't miss out on the deep relational philosophies Ms. Moriarty is imparting through her work.  I know each and every one of her characters, and she writes them perfectly.  Cannot wait for her latest!
5	1402358400	Great story line and character development.  Thought provoking as the plot makes you think about your own 'character development' over a ten year period.  I will definitely be reading more Liane Moriarty novels.
4	1402358400	I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it for anybody wanting a nice beach or vacation read.  I laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is my third Liane Moriarty book and I'll probably order her new one.  I really enjoy how she puts feelings, thoughts, every day worries and life into words that are very relatable.  I would have given 5 starts but the last 30 pages drag just a bit, not bad, but I did find myself skimming some to get to the end.
4	1402272000	Fascinating look into what your life would be like if you lost 10 years of your memory. I am not sure that I liked how it all flooded back. I wonder if that happens in real life. I suspect it comes back gradually.  I enjoyed the book and the supporting cast of characters.
4	1402185600	This author has a way of writing a story that pulls you so that you are never bored and get several perspective from multiple character. I loved this story because you think to yourself what would I do if I lost 10 years of memory of my life? You have to keep reading because you want to know what's going to happen. I loved the way the story ended.
5	1402185600	From the start this book kept me wanting to keep reading. I just recently came across Liane Monarty's books and I love her writing! Can't wait to start my next book!
2	1402185600	Confusing at times. Author would change subject too quickly. I didn't feel emotion for any of the characters. Skip it.
4	1402185600	Pretty quick read.  I was looking for something to read while a way on a business trip.  This proved to be a good choice.  It wasn't a &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of read but was still enjoyable.
4	1402185600	&#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; is a great &#34;beach&#34; read.The story is entertaining and enjoyable.Perfect read for a holiday or just a lazy afternoon.
5	1402185600	As with another novel by Liane Moriarty, like The Husband's Secret, I found What Alice Forgot highly entertaining.  Imagine the chance to re-do aspects of your life that are coming off track because you've forgotten your part in the conflict.  That's the opportunity Alice receives from a bump on the head, which erased 10 years of memory. When she finally receives it back, everyone is much better off because of actions she has taken in the meantime.  Meanwhile, you will have enjoyed turning the pages and working your way through yet another complication you hadn't expected.
5	1402099200	This book was amazing, I really felt like I was in the characters shoes!  Every adventure every part I enjoyed!
4	1402099200	Interesting concept really great to read.  You care about Alice and what she is going through.  I really was evolved in Alice's life and how she had changed and would she change more.
4	1402099200	This story caused me to think about myself.  What would I do in the same situation?  The story reminded me to look at my relationship with others.  I read this story non-stop until I finished it.
5	1402099200	This was the perfect book for me.  Although I am no longer forty, I can relate to Alice and her situation of having led different lives and all of sudden being faced with seeing or hearing yourself for the first time and not being pleased.  I also could sympathize with Elizabeth and thought the author did an excellent job describing the angst of not being a mother until later in life while everyone else is busy raising their families.This is the second Liane Moriarty book I have read and loved.  She knows how to keep the reader interested and has several plots going that keep you going back for more.  Great read!
3	1402099200	I bought this book after reading another of Moriarty's books, &#34;The Husband's Secret.&#34;  That one was better, but &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; has its points.  The premise, if you've read any of the other reviews, is that a woman on the brink of a messy divorce hits her head and loses the preceding ten years of her life and the whole reason for the divorce--and the existence of her three children, the oldest of whom is 10.  In her mind, she is still pregnant with her first child and in the throes of early marriage love.  Whatever s*** happened in the ensuing ten years has not happened in her mind.  When she sees her husband she is filled with this love, not the mistrust and near-hate that has grown during the years she has lost.  The memories do not come back until near the end of the book, and she has to constantly ask other people what happened, thereby providing the exposition needed by the reader.I thought that the devise of having two other characters write letters--one to a former lover and one to her psychologist--to provide more exposition were a bit boring, especially the one by the sister who is having a great deal of trouble getting pregnant.  Whereas she captures a lot of the woman's feelings, which are pretty accurate (I had trouble getting pregnant so know) I found myself wishing either that they were shorter or that they were done as a dialogue.  They were too long and I got sick of reading pretty much the same thing over and over.  The old lady's letters were a bit better, since she provided other details that were more interesting.  The surprise about her letters was obvious from a mile away, however.Even though the subject of amnesia has been done to death, this was a slightly different take and held my interest, though not nearly as much as &#34;The Husband's Secret.&#34;  It's much lighter reading and way more a Chick Book.  (Do we really need that much information on a giant meringue pie being baked by the mothers in the school?)
5	1402099200	When Alice falls and hits her head she loses ten years of her life. This gradually emerges much as would this realization for Alice. She is puzzled by everyone and everything around her. What a fascinating story! How the people around her mostly try to get her to &#34;be fine&#34; and not display any of her overwhelming confusion and grief resonates tremendously as common family and community responses to grief and losses. As an American, the differences in Australian culture, behavior, and language are interesting, while the themes of loss, grief, family, and relationship are universal. The skillful portrayal of infertility grief and how friends and family behave with each other in that situation as well is compelling. The humor is sharp, but not biting, and this book feels realistic while being a page-turner. Will Alice remember? Will she be able to pull off appearing normal and/or reuniting with her husband? The secrets of one character and another emerge. Two characters write journals [under other names] giving an inside view of their perceptions that is different. It is a great pleasure to read a book with characters who cause us to care, even though they have often annoying faults , are flawed, and they fail a lot. Fascinating and engaging, this is my idea of a good book.
2	1402099200	The book seemed like a very interesting thought. However, it was slow, redundant, and often times too repetitive. I was waiting for more depth on how she changed after her memory loss. That never happened. Also I didn't like the way the author showed us to other characters' conflicts going on simultaneously as we try to figure out the confusion that is Alice's' life.
4	1402099200	Meandering tale about a life changing event and the unexpected ending.  Well told by Alice as she struggles to piece together the last decade.  It gives her the gift of seeing things from her younger self.  I liked the way the story did not shy away from dealing with the realities of a failing marriage and the ensuring ugliness that seeps into their everyday dealings with one another.  I enjoy the writing style of Liane Moriarty.  If you liked A Husband Secrets, you'll probably going to enjoy this book too.
4	1402012800	I found this book very interesting and learned alot about living life.  It is all too important to stop this fast cycle we are on and to live each day to its fullest.
4	1402012800	I gave it only four stars because the subject matter isn't deep or relevant.  However, it's a terrific read for women of any age, a real page-turner.  Lots of discussion issues for a book club.
5	1402012800	I enjoyed this story very much. I can understand how Alice got so caught up in herself that she forgot the most important thing about herself - she was a mother and a wife. I like the idea of this story because it makes you stop and think about your own life. The fact that Alice lost her memory was actually a blessing. As a result of her amnesia, she found herself and her family.
4	1402012800	Alice (sort of) has a chance to re-live her life as if the last ten years did not happen. What would you do with that opportunity?
5	1402012800	Absolutely love this book! I will probably read it again! It just captures your attention and keeps it! Love it!
4	1402012800	I gave it 4 stars because I did really enjoy the story. My only negative is that the author spent a good amount of time on the build up, but then rushed to end the story. I think that might be a somewhat common mistake, perhaps to keep the length of the total book to a certain level.  This is the 3rd book I have read by Liane Moriarty. I loved The Husband's Secret and did also enjoy this book, just not quite as much.  It did make me examine my own behavior through life and relationships, which is always a good lesson.
5	1402012800	I was throughly intriguied by the way the story was delivered with the different letters, emails, and thoughts.  The character development was complete and I felt like I was in their heads. The book was a page turner...I couldn't wait to read what memory or truth was exposed in the next page.  Great premise for a story that moved along revealing bits and pieces until a complete story appeared.  I loved the book, characters, and the method of delivery!
5	1402012800	I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Liane Moriarty  is a wonderful writer.  She holds your interest throughout the book.  This is the second book I have read by this author and look forward to others.
5	1402012800	Another crazy &#34;what in the world will happen next&#34; novel by Liane Moriarty.  Loving all of her books so far!
5	1401926400	I was trying to find a new book to read when I decided to review books by author's I had previously read and enjoyed.  Since I had read the Husband's Secret (great book) I decided to review the other books by Liane Moriarty. That is when I stumbled upon &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34;.  I totally enjoyed reading the book although very different from my normal style of reading.Moriarty had a way of keeping the reader engaged at all times. While reading the book I would think about my life and what if I forget the last 10 years.  Only then do we realize how we have changed, good or bad.  Sometimes as we change we forget what really is important to us and get consumed by day to day life.This is an awesome read and life lesson all at the same time.
5	1401926400	I was instantly a Liane Moriarty fan after reading The Husband's Secret.  What Alice Forgot did not disappoint me.  It was a fantastic read; I couldn't put it down.  The premise of the story was unique, and I felt the plot was intriguing.  I am currently reading another book by her entitled The Three Wishes.  I highly recommend her books and as the leader of a book club, I believe her books would be excellent recommendations.
5	1401926400	I loved this book - in fact, I have loved all of Liane Moriarty's books. Totally engaging, well written, interesting characters, amusing premise.
5	1401926400	So many sub stories in this book, keeps you interested the whole time you are reading it.  I would recommend this book.
5	1401926400	This is book has made me think and think and think about the context of our lives.  We are a compilation of experiences and not just a person or a personality.  It keeps making me think about how my life would be different with the people in it today if I could remove the experiences and the hurt.  Mind blowing for me.  Read this book!
5	1401926400	The story was well written. I kept hoping Alice would go back to Nick,and when she couldn't decide l got worried. I am definitely thinking of another book of hers. Thanks for the good read.
4	1401926400	Very thought provoking.  Has you wondering, all the time, what she'll do and why she has her attitude. Very enjoyable!
5	1401926400	I gave this a 4 star rating because the book was an easy read, however it still made you think about your own life and how it has changed over the past 10 years.
5	1401926400	This book's got a ridiculously likable main character, to which something extraordinary happens, requiring her to re-decide her entire life. And while that may sound like deep and contemplative subject matter, Moriarty's treatment of it is not. It's yummy and funny and poignant. I miss Alice already ...
5	1401840000	This is the third book that I have read by this author.  Her character development and style of writing are impeccable!
5	1401840000	Best book that I have read in along time!  Made me cry &#34;Happy Tears&#34;!!Can't wait to read more of her books!
4	1401840000	I really enjoyed this book, it gave you a perspective of a very self serving woman who gets amnesia and as she learns how she has acted, and how selfish she  has been. Good read.
4	1401840000	I usually don't read books that don't have a dead body in them, so getting this book was out of character for me. Liane Moriarty has crafted a delightful gem here. I really got involved in the story, and all the characters were realistic and interesting. The story kept me guessing what would come next, wanting to know how it all turned out. And, just like in a good mystery, the ending was a surprise!
5	1401840000	This author has risen to the top of my Favorites List so fast!! She has such a clever and extremely talented way of writing! I just can't put her books down.This book gave so much reflection on the importance of how we look at our memories and to sometimes change the filters to find happiness each day. The characters are so easy to relate to. You just can't help but want them to find happiness in the end.Moriarty has a way of layering and building her stories. It makes the it so interesting to see the surprises in each layer. I couldn't feel a stronger sense of happiness and content after reading a book!I would love to see these characters in a tv show.
4	1401753600	This one kept me up at night...and even now that I've finished it I wonder how strange it would be to lose 10 years of your life. (easy reading)
5	1401753600	I enjoyed how this book took a woman who had become pretty self-centered & through losing her memory she found out what she had become & changed herself. It was a pretty long journey but in the end she discovered that the life she had before she became self-centered was pretty good & was able to repair relationships with her (almost() ex husband, her sister and even her kids. She became a better person!
4	1401753600	A fast read and great for the warm weather! It also let's us know that in many aspects of life there is a &#34;do over&#34; option!
5	1401753600	I enjoyed the whole book and liked the ending too.  It was one of those books that makes you want to know what the ending will be and keeps you in the story all the way through.
5	1401753600	Original idea!  This book was one I looked forward to reading.  I will miss reading this book.  I recommend it.
5	1401667200	I loved this book! The story engrossed me and made me not want to put the book down. It also had me reflecting a lot on my own life.
5	1401667200	This is the second book I've read by Liane Moriarty. The first was the Husband's Secret which got me interested in reading all of her other novels. What Alice Forgot was a quick, engaging story that got me from the first few pages. I highly recommend this book for all readers who are looking for a great story and easy read.
4	1401667200	A busy single mom loses the last ten years of her life from a bump on the head.  And in bits and pieces it all comes back to her.
3	1401667200	Author has a nice style; easy to read and you really want to know what happens to the characters.  If anyone thinks that the memory loss part of the story is a stretch, I can tell you it's not as I know a woman who woke after a head injury having forgotten a large chunk of her life.  She not only did not know her two children, but didn't even know her husband.  My criticism of the book -  everything is too easily sewn up at the end.
5	1401667200	Liane Moriarty is a delight to read.  Well thought out story and characters.  I was pulled into the characters lives and hooked from the first page.  I love this author's wit and talent.
5	1401580800	Liane Moriarty's writing is wonderful.  So very real and down to earth.  The Australian base of it is so interesting and enjoyable, also!
5	1401580800	I found this story fascinating, funny and thought provoking. It makes one really think about &#34;what if&#34; and how little things can cause big problems. it's an easy, light-hearted read and you'll enjoy all the ups and downs. I highly recommend it.
5	1401580800	I don't cry often but this book definitely made me tear up a bit! I finished this book and immediately downloaded another novel by the same author and am so excited to start reading it.
5	1401580800	Didn't want to put it down. Kept me trying to put the pieces together.  Like the way the author writes.
4	1401580800	I enjoyed this book.  At first I was not sympathetic to Alice but she grew on me.  Stick with it through the beginning and I think you will enjoy it too.
3	1401494400	I chose this rating because, although it was engaging and fun, it was very light.  I like more substance for the most part.  I was pleased that Alice kept part of her personality that she had while she didn't remember her past.  A much nicer person.
3	1401494400	Fun to read, but predictable in the endMy second Liane Moriarty bookA good diversity of personalities to discover
5	1401494400	Liane Moriarty is now one of my new favorite authors.  This is a fantastic read from start to finish.  A great read.
4	1401408000	I enjoyed this story a great deal.  It really made me think about the person I have changed in 10 years and how my husband has changed.  It also does a wonderful job at demonstrating how point of view and past history with a person can influence one's perspective on everything from a gesture to a comment.  There were many times while I was reading that I could relate to Alice's sadness and bewilderment at the status of some of the most important relationships in her life.What Alice Forgot is filled with heartbreak and humor and subtle wisdom.  I definitely recommend this novel.
5	1401408000	This was our latest book club book, and I'm so glad it was chosen! It's the first book in a long time that I literally could not put down. I read it in two days and found myself staying up late after my kids went to bed just so I could read it. It was worth losing the sleep! Highly recommend if you are looking for a page turner.
5	1401408000	This book was so good I recommended our book club to read it.  Funny, yet thought provoking.  I have read several of this authors books and liked them all, but I liked this book the best
5	1401408000	Love this book, REALY makes you think how you would handle losing 10 years.Highly recommend this book, great summer read !
3	1401408000	This book kept my interest, but I kept expecting something to be revealed that we didn't know, like what really was the pull of Gina?  Why did we keep getting the backstory of the grandmother?  How did Elizabeth's story and conversations with the doctor tie in?  It seemed like it all didn't tie together with the memory loss of 10 years that Alice was dealing with.  I really wanted a big revelation of some kind rather than what we did get.
5	1401408000	Wow. What a great story that's well told with richly developed characters.  If you are married or in a long term relationship and this story fails to resonate with you, then you may need to check for a pulse.
5	1401321600	I just don't get it. How can anyone not be moved by this book? I feel as though they must be Martians who don't understand Earth and it's people and relationships and heartbreaks and happiness. I feel like sitting them down and saying, "Look. This is Earth. This is how us humans are. The only way you will understand it is to live it." But then I think, but these ARE humans. They HAVE lived it. And then I'm stymied all over again. How can you not just love this book? How?!This story is told from the point of view of three women. One has just fallen and hit her head so hard that she no longer remembers the last 10 years of her life. All of a sudden she's a young, optimistic 29-year-old again, deeply in love with her husband and about to have her first child. How shocking to find that, no, you are actually the mother of THREE children and you DESPISE your soon-to-be-ex husband!The other point of view is of her sister who can't get pregnant and who has suffered years of longing, sadness, and being let down over and over again because every single IVF procedure ends in another dead fetus. To be in the head of this depressed and lonely woman is tragic and yet inspiring. Her point of view is told through a type of journal that her doctor has given her to write to help her cope. She writes in her journal as though she's speaking to her doctor.The last point of view is of their adopted "grandmother" who is living in an elderly care facility and who continues to write every day to the man she lost many years ago, two weeks before their wedding. She's being taught how to live again by an energetic mustachioed man who not only irritates and infuriates her but also gives her joy and happiness as she learns that she's still got a lot of living left to do. Her point of view is told through her letters to Phil, her once-to-be husband.I saw where one person said that she (he?) was so bored by the book that she skimmed through the points of view of the grandmother and sister and pretty much just read the end to see how it turned out for Alice, the woman who hit her head. As I was reading this person's review I thought, "Well, you certainly denied yourself the point of the book." Reading what each of these three woman are going through and how they manage to cope with everything and come out on the other side of tragedy not only still intact but so much the better, IS THE POINT!  *Run-on sentence alert!*  Skipping ahead means you missed out on all the important stuff that makes you think about your own life and what you maybe can do to make it better, see the extraordinary in things you think are mundane, and perhaps live your life fully before it's too late because now you've gone and died or, if you're lucky and still have time to fix it, before you've gone off and done something stupid like forget about all the lovely things you used to find so wonderful in your spouse, children, life, and now you just feel angry, put out, overburdened, and irritated by all those dull (incredible!), horrific (delicious!) things you once found so enticing, sweet, exquisite, and now it's all gone, gone, gone because you were too busy feeling sorry for yourself and oh so WRONGED! phew!Anyway, MY point is, I'm taking a lot away with me after reading this book and if you want to find yourself with a whole new lease on life, you might want to read it too. I'm so happy I did and I think my husband is too. ;)
5	1401321600	Just could not put it down nor could I figure out what or why she forgot. Take this one to the beach.
5	1401321600	I felt like I always wanted to keep reading to see what happened next!!!  I truly liked the ending because  I wasn't sure how it would end!!!  The whole idea made me feel uneasy if this could really happen???
5	1401321600	Thought provoking but loaded with humor. Makes you think about where your own life would be if you were in Alice's situation.
3	1401321600	There was no end to this book so I was not satisfied with the book.  It would have been better if there was an ending!
5	1401235200	What Alice Forgot is a standalone novel from author Liane Moriarty. I have only read one other book written by Ms. Moriarty (The Husband's Secret) and I enjoyed it a great deal. So I was excited when this title became available at my local library. When I first starting reading it, I wasn't sure about this one because it got off to a pretty slow start. After looking at how many pages were in the novel and the pacing, I was a little worried. However, by the 50% mark I was fully engaged. Even though it took a while, it was worth the wait- I couldn't put it down actually. I was invested in the characters and I was dying to see if their lives would work out like I hoped. I ended up loving this book! FYI: If you choose to read this book, MAKE SURE to read the epilogue.There are three different perspectives going on in this book. Alice, her sister Elisabeth, and their honorary grandmother Frankie. Each perspective focused on varying issues and although all three stories didn't really thread together all the time, it worked! This setup created a novel that delved into a number of issues that reached out to me. Very common marital issues were spelled out and had me re-evaluating my own relationship. We can so easily drift apart from our partners due to allowing ourselves to get caught up in the unnecessary busy-ness of life. Our priorities shift- little things snowball into big things. Then one day we wake up and don't fully recognize the person sleeping next to us. Infertility is another issue that presented palpable emotions in this story. I wondered if Ms. Moriarty has experienced this struggle herself because those parts were so real! The stressors in this book are written very well. It doesn't matter if a reader has personally experienced these situations or not because the characters and their responses are so understandable and relatable. It's brilliant and emotional. This is one of the books that have caused me to examine my own life and by doing that I have a chance to consciously make it better. I would highly recommend this book to others for this reason alone. Enjoy!My favorite quote:&#8220;Early love is exciting and exhilarating. It's light and bubbly. Anyone can love like that. But after three children, after a separation and a near-divorce, after you've hurt each other and forgiven each other, bored each other and surprised each other, after you've seen the worst and the best-- well, that sort of love is ineffable. It deserves its own word.&#8221;
5	1401235200	This book caught my attention immediately and held it so well that I kind of ignored my family while I was reading it.  I cried and then I laughed and then I would find myself crying again while reading it.  I love that the author used letters and journal writings to give the reader insight on other characters in the book.
5	1401235200	I read this after finishing &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; and it did not disappoint! I couldn't put it down! Very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a funny & thought-provoking novel.
4	1401235200	Liane Moriarty is a master storyteller. I have now read three of her books and will go through them all. I was rootimg for this ending but felt vaguely let down by it.
5	1401235200	I loved this one as much or more as the rest. Moriarty writes to that you can put yourself in the place of the heroine, usually WISHING you WERE in the place of the heroine, even if it is a difficult place. This books lets you think about what you might do differently if you forgot what had happened over the last, I think it was 15 years ... a thoughtful but thoroughly enjoyable and funny, read.
5	1401148800	Witty and poignantly told about a woman who has the opportunity to do a bit of a 'do-over' by seeing her present through her younger self.  Really thought it was a great, fun and memorable book.
2	1401148800	I found the premise a little hard to swallow.  Hard to believe that no one around Alice cared enough to get her back to the hospital for some help, I mean really the woman has lost 10 years of her life.  Character development was weak.  I was more interested in the sub stories within the book, than what was going to happen to Alice at the end.
4	1401148800	Much better than I thought, easy trading and engaging, it makes you think about your life, what if I forget the last ten years of it, who would I be? What would i change?
5	1401148800	Perfect vacation read. Was a recommendation through my book club, but loved every minute. The pattern of thought from each character was delightful.
5	1401148800	I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It gave me pause to think about how much the mind and our thoughts influence our lives.  The characters were fun.
5	1401148800	Liane Moriarty should not be pigeon-holed as the queen of peri-menopausal chick lit...but darn, she writes with such a keen eye on the interactions of supposedly grown women with families and husband and wife interaction after years of marriage.  Her characters are believable.  Even if one wants to dislike one of her characters, they are so fully fleshed out that there is no good or bad to them, only their good and bad reactions to life and situations.  This book is very thought provoking and caused me to reevaluate some incidents in my own life that led me to judgement.  Nothing is one-sided.  Bravo to Liane for a lovely story!
4	1401062400	&#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; was so well-written and absorbing that I read it in a single day, and on that alone I highly recommend it. It's not study-it-in-a-college-class literature, but it's heftier than a beach read, and for me that really hits the fiction sweet spot.39 year old Alice wakes up from a fall and thinks she's 29 again, and the reader follows her through the confusing, anxiety-ridden process of learning about her own life. The most significant and jarring discovery for Alice is that the perfect marriage she had ten years before is falling apart in the present day. Liane Moriarty conveys Alice's confusion and sadness in a way that is authentic, warm, and frankly magical. I had tears all over my face for this part of the story. This alone might be worth the 4 stars, and really speaks to the horrors of what can happen to a marriage over the years.And her marriage isn't the only problem. Many of her formerly close relationships have fallen apart. Alice at 29 was apparently relaxed and fun and in love with life, while Alice at 39 is controlled and demanding and a perfectionist. Through a chunk of the story, we marvel with Alice at what a snot she has become over time; we like the 29 year old Alice quite a bit, but do not like the 39 year old version so much. It seems, at first, like a simplistic tale of &#34;look what a shrew she became in ten years! We should always try to be true to our younger, nicer selves!&#34;In time, however, Liane Moriarty reveals some very valid reasons why 39 year old Alice is so high-strung, and while she is clearly wrong about some things, we cannot blame her for everything. Some of the changes in her over the years were legitimate responses to serious circumstances, and the dissolution of her marriage was certainly not all her fault, either. Learning these things gives the book a delightful complexity.There are only two things that make the book not worth five stars. First of all, Moriarty spends a bit of time telling the stories of Alice's sister and a grandmother-like figure through letters that these characters have written. (Not to Alice.) These passages are not only unnecessary for the plot, they feel like a cheap gimmick. This book is written in the third person otherwise, and there's no reason an omniscient narrator can't just take a jaunt into another character's story for a while, if necessary - you don't need to have pretend letters to make that happen. And secondly, she writes very quickly past some events in the epilogue that I think would have been very enjoyable to see unfold.Still, all in all, most definitely worth reading.
1	1401062400	Entirely to long.  after a few chapters, i skipped the sister and grandmother chapters.  I only finished it because i wanted to see who she ended up with.  I did not get very involved with the characters.  Not a book i could loose myself in.
5	1401062400	Great bookI just couldn't put it down. Great idea and so well written.Can't wait to start another of her books.
4	1401062400	I read a lot of books so it was wonderful to read a different kind of book.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.
4	1401062400	I liked this book. It left me with anticipation about Aloce's life. I like how Liane Moriarty gives endings and completes the story.
4	1401062400	Very good book.  I thought the first few chapters were a little slow. But after a few chapters it really picked up. I enjoyed it.
3	1401062400	This starts slowly and builds to a lovely crescendo at the end, but I found myself wanting to skip to the last chapter.
5	1400976000	This book was excellent and a very quick read. The author really pulls you in and you experience Alice's misfortunes.
4	1400976000	Enjoyed this easy read. Author has a sense of humor, that I enjoy. Liked the ending.. Which is always important for me.
5	1400976000	Loved it! Easy read but very interesting. Didn't know to put it down. Recommended it to all my friends. Good.
4	1400976000	A story about an over caffeinated over scheduled soccer mom. Has an accident at the gym and makes her forget the last 10 years of her life; the birth of her children, the demise of her marriage, and the gain & loss of her best friend. A good & quick read. Plan on reading more from this author.
2	1400976000	This book is pretty boring. Very predictable. There are no surprises or twists. The Husband's Secret was a better read.
5	1400976000	Love Liane Moriarty!  I have read several of her books and absolutely love them.  This was no exception.  I would definitely recommend reading this book!
4	1400976000	Entertaining quick read.  Alice temporarily looses her memory and attempts to reconcile with her estranged husband and reunite her family.
4	1400976000	This novel definitely deserves a good solid &#34;B&#34; for both originality of plot and character development.  It would be a good book for discussion in a book group because of the moral dilemmas facing some of the characters.
5	1400889600	This is the fourth Liane Moriarty book I've read...in a row.  I've enjoyed all of them.  I just returned to the US from Australia and it was neat to read about several places there that I had just seen.  But, the story lines are excellent and the writing is excellent.  I'm waiting anxiously for her to write a new novel.Derek Bloomfield
5	1400889600	This is my favorite book by Liane, along with The Hypnotists Love Story. All her books are awesome and have got a bunch of others rolling through her books. These books are hard to put down!
5	1400803200	This is a great story that keeps you wanting to read more!  I would highly recommend.  The story line is different than your average book and held my attention the entire time.
5	1400803200	It was thoroughly enjoyable,  though it ended the way I thought I anticipated. It was a lovely story, with humor and suspense and lots of typical estrangedl family predicaments.  Too bad more divorcing couples can't &#34;relive&#34; what their marriages were like 10 years previously.
5	1400716800	What would your younger self think of the you of today?  What if you woke up from a head injury and couldn't remember the last decade of your life? In What Alice Forgot, the author explores this thought provoking idea. A very entertaining read that works backwards to see how Alice becomes her present-day self.
5	1400716800	Fascinating story! As always, Ms Moriarty creates wonderful characters. I miss them before I am done reading the last page.
5	1400716800	this book struck a nerve.  it reminds us to stop taking ourselves so seriously and stop getting so caught up in the rigamarole.
3	1400716800	I enjoyed the story, however it seemed to be making the same point over and over. I also didn't think it was needed to include the grandmother story.
4	1400716800	Interesting story with a plot and characters that makes you think and even evaluate your own life and relationships. Highly recommend.
5	1400716800	Sad, funny, tragic, silly and even a little bizarre.  This book was hard for me to put down.  Loved the suspense and always tried to predict where the author was going with things... even though I was often wrong in my assumptions.
5	1400716800	I just loved this story.  Icould totally relate to the characters.  The writing was so real.  Cant wait to read her next book.
4	1400716800	I was thinking this would be a good story for a movie.....I learned later that someone is working on that!  Good read!!
5	1400630400	I really enjoyed this book!  I thought it was very relevant to the world we live in today; busy, busy, busy.  It's interesting how people can get wrapped up in their own lives and how sometimes all it takes to solve your problems is to step outside of your shoes and look in through another set of eyes to gain a new perspective.
5	1400630400	Great book.Keeps your interest all the way.Could not put it down.I would definitely recommend it.When is her next book out?
5	1400630400	I loved this book. I couldn't put it down, especially during the first half. It slowed down a little in the second half, but it was still a real page turner. I like that the author told the story with the help of letters from two of the main characters, so you get the whole story from 3 different points of view. I've read The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty and really liked it, too. I'd recommend both of these books.
4	1400630400	This book really hit home for me as a (relatively) newly-wed. It was fun, engaging, emotional, and a very fast read. It had me both laughing and crying, and made me think a lot about how important it is to not take your partner -- no matter how sweet, how loving, how committed -- for granted. I didn't love the end (hence only 4 stars) but none-the-less, it was a fantastic book.
5	1400630400	This is a very interesting story of a young mom who lost her memory for the last 10 years, doesn't remember her children or any events in her life since she was 29 years old. Very easy to transfer this to your own life. I found this very thought provoking and how it would affect my life and my family.  Typical Liane Moriarty.  Loved it.
5	1400630400	Truly  one of the best fiction books I have ever read.  I was touched with the story of real life situations and the new outlook we all could learn from this book.  I love this writer!
5	1400544000	This story was such a page-turner!  I was just as curious as Alice was to find out why her life changed in the 10 years she forgot!  I love this author - she is not predictable and her characters are very human.
5	1400544000	Ms. Moriarty created an interesting situation in What Alice Forgot - the opportunity to wake up as you were 10 years ago;  That means 10 years younger and with the perspective and touch of naivete, and 10 years less 'baggage'.  For Alice, she was still deeply in love with her husband, expecting her first child and enjoying renovating and restoring an old home - she was happy and in total bliss.  She slowly discovers - as with an 'outsider's' perspective - who she became during the 'missing' 10 years; how she changed, how her marriage changed and how she treated and interacted with others - and isn't too pleased with what she saw/learned.  She feels awkward being 'thrust' into her current life, which is unfamiliar to her, and she navigates it as her 10 years younger-self would, much to the surprise of her family and friends, who are all very supportive.The book is engaging and thought-provoking as the reader tries to think back to how much we've changed in the last 10 years, how relationships have changed, how attitudes and perspectives and our joie de vivre has changed... and what can we do to re-capture some of the good parts?Thank you, Liane for helping me to remember!  I'd highly recommend this book.
5	1400544000	This book made you remember all kinds of little details to an earlier life. It made me remember things I never intended to forget - yet did.
5	1400544000	I loved this book. It was a &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of read. I'd highly recommend it to everyone.
4	1400544000	I enjoyed the whole book.  Was interesting right away and kept it up.  Fun, easy to read, with unique story.
5	1400457600	Fabulous read!!  Great look at life from an unseen point of view keeping you heading for the next page wanting to read more.
5	1400457600	Very true to life events.  Excellent reading.  Never bored.  Enjoyed every page!  Such a great ending; not expected....at all.  Little twisty.
4	1400457600	A bit too long.  I found all the letters from Elizabeth to her shrink unneccesary to the story.  I think this book could have been 75 pages shorter.
3	1400457600	I enjoyed the book, but it didn't compel me to keep reading it, and it wasn't nearly as thought provoking as Liane Moriarty's The Husband's Secret.  She does write with a humorous style though, which is apparent in both books, and I liked the story line of this book.  The main character has temporary amnesia, as a result of a fall, and doesn't remember a thing, but as her memory returns, she reevaluates her choices in life and it ends well.
5	1400457600	Love this author. Couldn't put the book down. Loved the storyline and the ending. Will continue to buy more of her books
5	1400371200	I loved how it made the reader feel like we were Alice and always wondering what was the truth and wasn't. It was a fun read, very enjoyable.
5	1400371200	If you love a good read, this is the one for you!  From the first chapter, I was caught up in Alice's life.  This book leaves you with the feeling &#34;What If?&#34;.  I highly recommend this book!!
5	1400284800	I really liked this book. It was a fun read. It kept me guessing all the time. I read it in 2 sittings. It was so well written. I recommend this book highly. It was humorous, suspenseful, it had it all. It described the characters very well. Great read!
5	1400198400	Liane mortiary is my new favorite author!!! This book kept my interest and I just had to know what happens next.
5	1400198400	This was my second book by this author. I enjoyed the book and it kept my interest. I do  that Liane Moriarty  writes the same kind of book, a book with a twist (either a secret or as in this book a woman that can not remember the last 10 years of her life) it keeps your attention and  at the ending the books,all the loose ends are tied up ..almost too much. After all life is not always a happy ending (in my opinion)
5	1400198400	I enjoyed reading this book so much.  I turned 40 this year and could really relate to this book.  It was so creatively written and I couldn't wait to find out was what going to happen next. Alice is a character that any wife, with school age children will enjoy spending time with.  I miss her already.  I also enjoyed reading the story from her sisters point of view and the struggles of infertility.
5	1400198400	Thought provoking...made me look at my marriage and my life and children with a clean slate.  I could not put this book down. More please.
4	1400198400	I read The Husband's Secret first and enjoyed it do much that I am going to read all that she has written. I like the way she winds three lives together in her novels. Would highly recommend this book, too.
5	1400112000	Liane Moriarty is one of my favorite artists.  This is a fantastic book! Really makes you think about what is important! Highly recommend it!
4	1400112000	I pulled a few all-nighters reading this book because I couldn't stop reading. This page-turner is a must for those who love a great story.
4	1400112000	A catchy, fun read for young mother's who,no doubt, will put themselves in the main character's shoes and try to imagine what would be the result of 10 years lost of their lives.  I even enjoyed the book at 71!Nbh
5	1400112000	It's been a while since I enjoyed reading a book this much. Not only it is funny and entertaining, but makes you think about the real reasons you are in a relationship and how important family is. No matter what life brings. I find myself wondering how would I feel if the same thing happened to me too.
5	1400112000	I love this author and all her books are so well written and funny with great insight. Also love the Australian point of view!
4	1400112000	A really good read!!  Definitely held my interest and was difficult to put down until you learned &#34;what Alice forgot&#34; . . .
5	1400112000	This book started a little off the grid for me, but as teh story unfolded, the more I realized there is a lot I can relate to or think about in my own marriage/motherhood.
4	1400112000	Enjoyed this book.  Fairly easy read but gave reader food for though about what you would do if you had the chance to repair important life decisions that you regretted.  Really great read. I am inspired to read other books by this author.
5	1400112000	Alice woke up one day and forgot ten years of her life.  I enjoyed this book tremendously. Liane Moriarty depicted a moving picture of Alice's struggle with her marriage and Alice's sisters' emotional battle with infertility. It is a very intriguing and moving read. It makes me think about the past ten years of my life: what would I do differently?
5	1400025600	Great read.  Couldn't put it down. I had to find out what Alice forgot. Life has a way of changing us all.
4	1400025600	I think everyone should read this book. It provided a great outside perspective of how we can lose ourselves, lose sight of what is important, get resentful, get self absorbed, etc., and it was an entertaining read.
5	1400025600	The characters were well developed and the book was a nice diversion for me.  I enjoy Liane Moriarty's books and look forward to her new release.
4	1400025600	The story of a woman loosing ten years of memory and relating to her new &#34;normal&#34; was thoughtful and thought provoking. This book is an easy ready and the characters and their lives feel compelling so that I became invested in how their lives would unfold. All that to say, the characters are not completely fleshed out and, with the way the story is written, I was left feeling like I was looking and their lives, not understanding the motivations of connections between characters. The really interesting outcome of this book for me is asking the question, &#34;what makes up who we think we are&#34; and how our perceptions and memories are filtered by what we believe those experiences and memories mean. The story concept has stayed with me longer than the characters have.
3	1400025600	This is a good book to read on the beach-- entertaining, light and a quick read.  Story line is somewhat predictable.
4	1400025600	Great insight into what marriage can get in to if you let it.  A quick happy ending book.  Not always reality.
5	1399939200	I stayed up all night finishing this book, and I loved it! I don't know if it was meant to be funny, but there were at least a dozen times when I couldn't stop laughing!  Just the way she phrased things that the characters would say just set me off giggling. It was a wonderful story, and she made you care about all of the characters.  I highly recommend this one!
4	1399939200	Tough not terribly deep, What Alice Forgot does offer some thought provoking issues about memory and forgetting and how they twine around the partners in a marriage.
5	1399852800	The characters, the storyline, everything just gets you hooked! Another amazing story from Liane Moriarty. I was up until midnight wanting to finish this book. Would Alice remember?? What an amazing perspective on what your life looks like if you could step out of it and the power of love as you first felt it. This is the kind of story that made you fall in love with reading in the first place.
3	1399852800	Interesting premise. As the story went on the main character became less likeable, more one dimensional. I finished the book but was not as invested in the second half as I was in the first half. Okay had it been 3 bucks or less but I paid more and it wasn't worth it,
4	1399852800	I really enjoyed the book....lovely read.......wonder what would happen if more marriages had a way of reliving the first few years.....would there be as many divorces?
5	1399852800	I found myself terrified at the beginning of this novel. Seriously. It hit close to home - as someone who has been married over 10 yrs now and is staying home to raise our now grade-school aged children. With all the work of raising children and keeping a household all around us, I worry about my relationship with my husband falling by the way side.I love the angle of the book; Attempting to untangle the mess of a relationship &#34;gone awry&#34; through the lens of an earlier version of you.I enjoyed how the book made me think of how (my) relationships and people evolve over time, and that what's important is staying connected while welcoming the change.I did, however, feel chastised at the end of the book - like I was lead to fall in love with the younger Alice's viewpoint, and then chastised for liking her so much.I'd recommend this read to any woman interested in an easy, relaxing read.
4	1399852800	Losing your memory of the last decade or so does present some challenges.interesting to see ow Alice coped and how muscle memory remains.  I enjoyed this and her other books.  The editor has done her some disservice in getting place names wrong.  That really is Lane Cove, not Cove lane!  For. Good light read with some things to think Bout I can recommend these books.
5	1399852800	The best book I've read in a long time. Made me laugh and cry tears of joy. Beautiful charactrrs  You must read it!
5	1399766400	Excellent read! Makes you think about how you live your own life & choices. I couldn't put it down, highly reccomended!
4	1399680000	This was my first book by Liane Moriarty and enjoyed it immensely. Would no hesitate to buy more books by her.
5	1399680000	A book that will have me looking for other books by this writer.  The story moved along but at the same time gave lots of &#34;what if&#34; thoughts about life.  Interesting to watch Alice start to recognize the person she had become in the last ten years
5	1399680000	I was compelled to think about about what I'd done in the last 10 years of my life. It's strange to think about how much changes in such a short period of time. There is also excellent insight into the rift that grows between couples when they aren't paying attention.
4	1399680000	it was slow in the beginning but picked and then hard to put down. I would recommend to other women.
3	1399680000	I have to admit that I did not really like Alice, the main character, for the first 75% of the book. She seemed a bit, well, &#34;flighty&#34; and not so much a deep thinker to me (so not exactly my favorite kind of person). I, therefore, was not so sure about continuing to read the book after, say, the first 50 pages. But I was intrigued by the book's concept (i.e. what would it be like to have an accident and wake up, not remembering the last 10 years of you life (essentially your 30s) and stuck with it, and I'm glad I did. While Alice pre-memories (i.e. late 20s) and not exactly someone who I'd pick as a friend in my late 20s (or maybe, yes, a friend, but someone you shop with, not someone you have deep, thoughtful chats with), she DOES grow through the book and that saves her. She's quite funny and I did like her by the end of the book. The author's style does remind me a bit of the irreverent, funny (dare I say a bit ditsy??) style of Bridget Jone's Diary (although I read that more than a decade ago, so I'm going on old memories here), which I'm not a huge fan of... BUT I did enjoy the book, liked the story arc and am curious, now, to read a few more books by this author to see how she addresses some other novel stories.*Note that, despite the numerous surface similarities to the book &#34;What About Alice&#34; (i.e. &#34;that&#34; Alice is losing her memory due to early onset Alzheimer's, &#34;this&#34; Alice loses 10 years due to amnesia, and yep, I state the obvious in that they share the same name) they are 2 radically different books.
5	1399593600	I rated this book 5 starts because I just couldn't put it down.  It usually takes me forever to get through books, but I was done with this one in no time. You just want to see how it all turns out.  I'm on my 3rd book from Liane Moriarty.  Love her!
4	1399593600	This book provides an interesting perspective on how we change over time. Little by little we change, we are shaped by our experiences and choices. What would me 10 years ago think about who I have become in the last decade? This is a great vacation read.
5	1399593600	Anyone would enjoy this well written and funny book, but if you are married and raising children you will most certainly love it.
5	1399593600	Read the book you will understand the &#34;DOSH&#34;.  Another one oh her books you cannot stop reading!  I have read a lot of books no one compares to Liane's style of writing.  Keeps you in fascinated  just want to keep reading!
5	1399593600	I absolutely love the style of this authors writing. It was so refreshing to read a book that wasn't your typical love story.
5	1399593600	Smart,funny,touching story!I absolutelyLoved it! I loved the characters and unusual twist of events and of course the way it was written.
4	1399593600	I have so enjoyed reading three books this year by Liane Moriarty.  When reading about Alice it really caused me to reflect on my own life and the lives of those around me and how a &#34;loss of memory&#34; could &#34;fix&#34; some of our life situations.  It's an amazing portrayal of how other people and situations in life can change us so much.  No one stays in the same place in life as living is an evolving process, but this book makes you think about just how much you've changed, what inspired those changes, how it affects the ones we love and are we really happy with those changes in us.I highly recommend this book plus The Husband's Secret (in my top 10 favorite books) and Three Wishes.  I promise you will love them!
4	1399507200	This book was not a favorite, but I enjoyed the read.  I have loved other Liane Moriarty books, so I gave this one a shot.  It was a bit dull in some spots, but all in all I was eager to know Alice's current reality once her memory returned.  I definitely couldn't predict the ending :-)
4	1399507200	Very fun read. So insightful about how relationships can get off track . Made me stop and think how it would be for me . I liked the humor , very witty.
3	1399507200	As you read about Alice and her 'accident' you find yourself of  many minds.  First of course is, &#34;What if this happened to me&#34;....then as you read to find a woman who has lost 10 years of her life, and discovers through friends and family, bits and pieces that add names and personalities, events and expectations as well as the possible loss of her adored husband, you wonder why people can't be a little more forthright with their efforts at helping her remember.Alice's changed lifestyles, her unknown friends, her sister, her mother, her successful husband and three unknown children.....all with problems of their own or becoming problems to Alice, slowly bring her into the life her memory left behind.And what's wrong with the physicians who are treating this amnesiac?  Why can't they bring Alice into ten years that are lost or give her a little of the with-held information that might bring her back to the world she left?It's a well-filled adventure into forgetfulness that works itself out in the end, but getting to the end makes the readers happy that indeed it did not happen to them.Worth a read.Develops thought processes of an investigative manner.Dixie L.
5	1399507200	I loved reading this book, because you wanted to find out what happened to Alice, and how her story unravels!
4	1399507200	It tore me apart, ripped and my heart and then kindly picked it up and soothed my wounds. It was all worth the ending.
4	1399420800	This book was another one my book club decided on reading. I read the first few pages and got bored so I put it down and read another book instead. Once I finished the other book, I decided to give this book another try and I'm glad I did.I finished this book in 2 days. Work and sleep got in my way otherwise it would have taken me just one day. It was that good. There were some parts where I would roll my eyes or get annoyed with the main character Alice.All in all, it is a really good book. There's some mystery involved with this book. You, along with Alice, are trying to discover the type of person she is/turned into. You, along with Alice, want to find out why/how her life turned out the way it did. They mention one character and you want to find out how this person effected Alice/Alice's life so much.Another small criticism is about the ending. It seemed too Hallmark-y/cheesy Lifetime movie ending for me and for my book club.But it is a really good read and it will make you think about how you were 10 years ago compared to how you are now. I would definitely recommend this to someone!(I really want to give it 4 and a 1/2 stars but I can't. I didn't give it a full five for the &#34;complaints/criticisms&#34; I wrote about.) Definitely give this book a chance!
5	1399420800	So good... I usually go for different genres (Dean Koontz, GRR Martin) but this book was fantastic and I couldn't put it down.  It will really make you appreciate your significant other.
3	1399420800	This novel was entertaining at times but was too drawn out and a little &#34; trashy &#34; in  some parts.  I think the author tried to please too many tastes thus satisfying too few.Read when you feel like a little break from real life.
4	1399420800	A little slow but picks up and does not end in a pretty little bow. Nice to have a read that is not predictable.
5	1399420800	I love Liane Moriarty's writing style, contemporary relationships told from the perspective of a mother, wife, sister, and daughter's point of view.  It is really refreshing to read a story that reflects what and how many women think.  I found myself thinking about my marriage and what my relationship was with my husband every ten years, how I would have reacted if I had lost my memory.  This was the third book I read by Ms. Moriarty and I am saving the other two for the summer when I can relax and read them.  I might even have to read the others again which is something I never do.
5	1399334400	I have really been enjoying this author.  Here is another great read.  All of us as mothers and wives can relate to this book.  Alice and her relatives and friends are funny and we can see ourselves in the different lives they struggle to get through day by day. I am reading my way through all of this authors books.  I only do that when I really like an author!
5	1399334400	great book i could not put it down. I loved the ending (never would have guess the ending) I think anyone who has been married for more then ten years should read it.
5	1399334400	Alice awakens on the floor of the gym, while being attended to by paramedics.  She has no idea why she would belong to a gym let alone be there taking a step class.  The clothes she's wearing are unfamiliar.  In fact everything around her is strange.  The last ten years of Alice's life have disappeared from her memory, simply erased like a chalkboard.All Alice can remember is Nick, her husband, the love of her life.  He, however, has left her and their three children and the divorce has not been amicable.  Alice is frustrated that he hasn't rushed to her bedside.  But then again, everything is frustrating Alice right now.In What Alice Forgot,  the reader sees the world through Alice's eyes and her struggle to find her life again.  I am a huge fan of Liane Moriarty and she's done an excellent job creating the character's point of view.  Every action Alice takes and every word she speaks is true to Alice's condition.What Alice Forgot also has a message about what is important in life.  With her memory erased, Alice got a chance to start over.  The little things brought a smile to her face when in the past they had annoyed her.  There are times when we'd all like a chance to start over.  Alice shows us that it's not easy but it's never too late.
4	1399334400	One of the best books that I have read in quite some time. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there were a few times I got confused when it switched from one sister to the other and it took me a few parapgraphs to get back on track.  But the story line was awesome!!
5	1399334400	A great read with an interesting storyline. It looks at the often-asked question, especially in cases of divorce, of &#34;how did we get here?&#34;
3	1399334400	Just an okay novel.  Too detailed sex which eliminated it as a great novel.  Story line was good except for so much description of sexual activity!
5	1399334400	I liked it even more than A Husband's Secret.  I am looking forward to reading more of her books in the future.
5	1399334400	This is a terrific read! It is written in such a way that you actually feel what it's like to lose your memory with Alice. It makes you question the &#34;&#34;true you&#34;.
3	1399334400	It was just ok to me.at tines I felt it could gave moved along faster. Since I read it all the way to the end I guess it was that good.
1	1399334400	I think this book is a very trite story. Characters are shallow and silly.I have nothing else to say about it.
5	1399248000	I couldn't put this book down!  It was fascinating to imagine losing your memory and the implications, thereof.  And, so interesting to watch Alice deal with this and the bits and pieces that came back....The author did a wonderful job providing enough information to keep the reader's interest peaked.  Loved the ending.
5	1399248000	this Australian author writes complex and memorable books.  the ten years lost tell us so much about Alice. I couldn't put the book down.
5	1399248000	Enjoyed this story about people and their relationships.  This is the second book of hers I've read and may read more
4	1399248000	If you enjoyed other books by Liane Moriarity, you will enjoy this one.Similar strong female characters, set in Australia.This story is not a strong as others.It's kind of hard to believe that someone could lose just &#34;ten years&#34; of their memory.But it does unfolded in a cute way, and had a happy ending.
4	1399161600	Great persepctive on savng what mattets most...your family! Enjoyable look at what can happen when we &#34;forget&#34; or let things go!
4	1399161600	Loved this easy read! Makes you think about relationships you have and how you hope to be in the future.
4	1399161600	Alice experiences a 10 year memory loss.  The author made it possible to put myself in Alice's shoes.  Thought provoking of what I would have done if the same had happened to me.  A wrenching experience and a good read for anyone wondering about what is really the most important thing in life.  If you had it to do over, what would you do?
5	1399161600	so so good...suspenseful but not too long...Awesome ending.. loved it...great book for women about family and friendships...was worried t :) at she wasn't going to ever remember!
4	1399075200	It was a very entertaining book with an interesting theme.  It made you think about your own life and how you would handle the situation.
5	1399075200	Just a really great book.  I could not put it down, especially towards the end.  It even brought tears to my eyes.
5	1399075200	This is a wonderful story of self reflection wrapped in an amnesia plot. I read it in two days and loved it. Anyone who reads this book will easily be able to identify and perhaps learn something about themselves.
4	1399075200	PRODUCT FEATURES was an easy ,fun read.  The book made you stop and think about how your life decisions may change if you lost your memory and had a chance to have a do over.
4	1399075200	Very interesting read.  A bit slow at times, and somewhat implausible,  but overall enjoyable.  I do think the husband's character could have been elaborated on.
5	1399075200	I loved this book. Made me wish I had amnesia for a short term to see a new perspective on things.
5	1399075200	Others have written about the story plot and I have nothing to add - it was an enjoyable read.  I really enjoyed this book, both for the fictional story it told and its ability to make me reflect on the changes that have taken place in my own life over the last ten years - that take place in everyone's life over ten years.  It reinforced my need to truly enjoy each day, each segment or installment of my life -because the tide of time will take away what I know and find comforting today and replace it with a different &#34;normal&#34;.
5	1398988800	I love the characters, her style of writing and the way you get pulled into the world of these characters. You won't be disappointed in this Newks - get it!
3	1398988800	I was interested throughout, but the author, in my opinion, seemed in a rush to finish it. I was waiting for more story line- more details. Pretty disappointed in how she wrapped it up. The sister's character and her voice was excellent.  Ditto for Frannie.
5	1398988800	Beautifully written. Insightful, a wake up call. I highly recommend this book to everyone and look forward to reading more by this author.
5	1398902400	You will find yourself wondering about how your life would be if you lost your memories.  It was a page turner you will love Alice and can relate to her!!!
4	1398902400	I really enjoyed reading this book.  I couldn't wait to find out if she got her memories back and figure out who some of the characters were that were discussed.  Would recommend.
5	1398902400	This book is completely unexpected.  The quirky characters are so endearing bec of the authors writing style.  I cared so much for these people, and laughed out loud in spots.  One of my favorites!
4	1398902400	I randomly bought this book years ago while browsing and not knowing any other novels by the author. The book was very well written and in a way is a warning to women, not just mothers, to try to not let life's responsibilities take all the fun out of life and a reminder to try to keep some of our young hope and wonder in life. I've subsequently read The Husbands Secret and really enjoyed that as well.
5	1398902400	One of the best best books I have read in a long time!!! A little slow in the beginning but then it reached out and grabbed you! I could not put it down!! EXCELLENT!!!
3	1398816000	This was a cute easy read - would be great for vacation. I like to alternate between books like this and stronger books, so I'd recommend if you're looking for something light.
4	1398816000	After reading Husband's secret, I decided to try another book by Liane Moriarty. I really enjoyed this one too. I was hooked and didn't want to put it down.
4	1398729600	What a great opportunity to start over again by forgetting your last ten years and restarting all over again with a new perspective.  Well written and a fun read..
5	1398729600	I also read The Husband's Secret.  Both were &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of books.  Moriarty is a gifted story teller who knows the value of mystery.  Can't wait to read the next one!
4	1398729600	I had trouble putting this down.  A bit wordy at times, I did a lot of skimming but a good story that kept my interest from beginning to end.  Characters you can identify with.
3	1398643200	&#34;Not the best but not the worst book by this author.  I like husbands secret more.  What else can I say
5	1398643200	The story captured my attention and imagination. I didn't put it down until I'd finished. I would recommend to friends.
4	1398643200	I enjoyed this read, and the further introspection it inspired. I think it was a good remjnder to not get complacent in our relationship with our spouse, and truly take the time to listen to each other...
4	1398556800	Once I started this book, I had to finish it in one marathon sitting. The author's characters gripped me, evoking feelings I had forgotten over the years. This book even had me wrapped up with the children, very much a composite of my own childhood. One simple event when Maddie had studied so hard for a test the next day, but circumstances canceled the test .Maddie was disheartened and surly. I remembered incidents like that had happened to me  too in middle-school. I had studied so hard and long , and then wham, the test is canceled . My sense of fairness and justice took a beating that day. I knew the test and could have beaten any who challenged me.  But test didn't happen,  and I was furious .  That was the first time I realized that life will not always be fair. The author's ease with characters and relationships  are so universal ,anyone could get something out of this book. Recommended.
3	1398556800	This book was good.....not great but  good.  I felt it  was slow in places.  I also felt sad for Alice due to her thinking she was happy at 29 and not liking who she was at 39.  I also kept checking the cover  since it said it was funny.....I  guess I missed the funny parts.
4	1398556800	The main character, Alice, is a posh, over-achieving, soccer mom that loses her recollection of the last 10 years of her life after toppling off her seat during &#34;Friday spin class&#34; and knocking her head against the floor. She can't recall why she and her husband are divorcing, why her neighbor despises her, or why her sister has grown detached. She doesn't recall giving birth to three children or the vicious custody battle ensuing between her and her separated spouse. What Alice does remember is her non-jaded, go-lucky, 10-year younger self -- who is consequently appalled at what her future self has become. This is damn-good storytelling. As a reader, you are engaged, seamlessly in the narration. The point of view vacillates between Alice and several supporting characters that center in her life -- it's all done very well. Recommended.
4	1398556800	I'm a 64yr. Old retired man... Read about a book a week, sometimes more. I liked this book. Well written and thought provoking. Usually read suspence thrillers. But this was a teal good, long, read
5	1398556800	I read it from cover to cover in one sitting!  Very thought provoking.  Loved it!  Now reading The Husband's Secret.
5	1398556800	This book clarified what can happen when we can let go of the past. This is a must read for those looking for a better life
4	1398556800	This book kept me engrossed but it needed to be longer.  It dwelt at satisfactory length on Alice's memories of her early marriage and the week of her amnesia about the next 10 years of her life, then raced through a fill-in chapter when her memory returned, and an epilogue chapter to tie it up.  This left me feeling irked, as though I'd attended a sales presentation that was 90% come on. So, one star off.
5	1398470400	I could not put this book down.  It was funny, emotional and so well written. Highly recommend for a beach or weekend read!
5	1398470400	Loved it!  Well written, interesting story that really made me think about the people we let ourselves become. Highly recommend!
5	1398470400	I enjoyed every word of this book. Liane Moriarty creates characters and stories that are interesting and compelling. I may read it again.
3	1398470400	If a bump on the head causes you to forget the last ten years of your life, can you make some changes before those memories return?  It&#8217;s an interesting concept and similar to the ideas expressed in Life After Life and The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells, in which characters try to get things right in alternate lives.  In What Alice Forgot, Alice Love knocks her head at the gym and wakes up thinking she is ten years younger and pregnant with her first child.  Much has changed in Alice&#8217;s life, however, and many problems loom.This story is a light, feel-good read, set in suburban Australia.  When she awakens, Alice learns that her marriage has crumbled and discovers that, in the past ten years, her own personality has undergone a dramatic change.  Her easy and happy ways have been replaced by a drive and aggression she can hardly recognize.  Her husband, Nick, has moved out.  Her oldest daughter is angry and having problems at school.  As the circle widens, Alice realizes that she and her sister, Elisabeth are barely speaking and her best friend, Gina is dead.  In addition, she wonders how she can be friends with the other &#8220;power women&#8221; in the community.  Alice sees all this through her younger, carefree eyes and struggles to understand.Alice&#8217;s younger personality starts to fix some of the problems, and there&#8217;s hope her marriage can be saved.  As the anger between Alice and Nick recedes, Nick worries that the modern Alice will return and all will be lost.  He&#8217;s sure he will know by the look in her eye which Alice he&#8217;s seeing.  At the same time, Moriarty introduces the parallel stories of Elisabeth and Alice&#8217;s &#8220;adopted&#8221; grandmother, Franny.  Interesting memory triggers, particularly the sense of smell, cause Alice to remember painful events.Moriarty threads the themes of love, marriage, parenthood and family through these side stories.  The plot is well-constructed, and keeps the reader interested in what will happen when Alice&#8217;s memory returns.  A crazy giant lemon meringue pie-making event somehow works to bring the story to an upbeat and happy conclusion, with a few surprises.If you are looking for an entertaining read, check out What Alice Forgot.  While not too weighty, it&#8217;s fun and enjoyable.
4	1398470400	Couldn't put it down!  The character Elisabeth was right on target for her struggle with infertility.  I was kept in suspense over how Alice would recover from her memory loss.  Or if she ever would.
4	1398470400	Alice got just what she needed to be able to reassess her life. The story line feeds the reader Alice's background in small doses so that the reader becomes involved with the character's choices.I really enjoy the psychology of the story and wish there were more story to tell.The book is easy reading, emphasizing the vapid lifestyle Alice has developed for herself.  She needed a knock on the head to jar her into a more worthwhile life.
5	1398384000	Read The Husbands Secret and loved the authors style so much that I ordered What Alice Forgot. Even better than The Husband's Secret.
5	1398384000	This book really makes you ponder what is important in life. Alice has an opportunity, by &#34;accident,&#34; to reflect on her core values. As she recovers from memory loss, she relives what she valued ten years prior. She struggles, but is given a rare opportunity to reflect on her past and introduce her old self to her present. Great read.
5	1398384000	It was probably one of the best books I ever read.  Funny, real life and just totally awesome.  A Must Read
4	1398384000	I really liked the book and could hardly put it down.  End was a little unlikely to me, but I guess it was appropriate.  Recommend.
4	1398384000	This book kept my attention, a real page turner, as we try to figure out what Alice forgot!  Also made me chuckle here and there throughout.
3	1398297600	I'm not a fan of Chick Lit.  This book is well-written, but it's still Chick Lit - emphasis on Happy Marriage, Beautiful Kids, I've Still Got It at 35, etc.  The central conceit is an interesting gimmick, that a woman conks her head and suffers amnesia, instantly erasing the previous 10 years, catapulting her magically back to her younger self.  This contrived plot device is typical of Happily Ever After land that dominates fiction written for women.  That said, it wasn't a bad read for my four-hour plane trip.  The author is a skilled fiction writer, and the characters are believably drawn, hence three stars instead of two.  But if I had known this was Chick Lit I never would have bothered with it.
5	1398297600	Entertaining, unpredictable with a great story line.  The characters came to life and provided the reader with vivid pictures and insights into Alice's life and all she forgot.
5	1398211200	Interesting twisty story. Really enjoyed it and realize now that maturing is not always all it is cracked up to be.
5	1398211200	This book was well written, entertaining and makes you think about how your life path has drifted from what you expected.  I did not want it to end.
5	1398211200	Imaginative and creative way to tell a love story.everything is told in a humorous writing style.very good. I really loved how it all comes together.
5	1398211200	I like that the author allowed the characters to be real...to express honest thoughts. And I liked the simple story of the busy mom and her daily struggles with events that happen to all of us. I couldn't predict what would happen and I couldn't put it down until I found out!  Loved it.
5	1398211200	What a great quick read. Love the perspective from the sister and the main character. The story jumps around but is done so well it flows perfectly between present day and past. Excited to read more of Moriarty's books!
3	1398211200	Enjoyed reading it as the plot untangled Alice's &#34;forgetting.&#34; Give it 4 stars if you really enjoy fiction that holds your attention but doesn't make your head hurt.
5	1398124800	Good easy read what I found amazing was how when your not so nice to people who love you when you need them most they really are not their for you.  As Alice struggled to regain her memory most of her family went about their business without considering she may really need them to help her.  She comes home from the hospital and they sort of go about their business not realizing she should not be left alone.  But in the end she managed to .......
3	1398124800	I truly enjoyed the all around plot of the story, but there was a lot going on. I found the "sub stories" a distraction, and in I found myself rushing through them to get back to main plot. Overall it's worth reading, and enjoyable.
5	1398124800	I loved this book.  I feel  as though I know Alice and I didn't want it to end.  She holds the readers interest and makes the story come alive.  I am reading all her books.
4	1398124800	An enjoyable book that makes you really think about your life and what you would do if you lost precious memories. This book kept me so interested and wanting to finish it but wanting to prolong it at the same time. I thought I could figure out what was going to happen but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised. Great book...sad it's finished!
4	1398124800	Love the concept of returning to a time of hopes and dreams before life got in the way.  Liane Moriarty writes a moving story filled with humor and twists.
5	1398124800	My sister told me about this book and said she couldn't put it down.  I felt the same way.  It was a beautiful story.  I highly recommend this book.
5	1398124800	Such a great story.  I was hesitant to read another Liane Moriarty book because I just didn't see how it could be better than The Husband's Secret and Three Wishes, but this one was excellent and just as good as the others.
4	1398124800	Because I enjoyed The Husband's Secret, I purchased What Alice Forgot. I was not disappointed.  Again, the characters were richly textured, and each of their stories was slowly developed with luscious surprises in store for the reader.  Having been married to the same man myself for many years, I found the basic premise of marriage as one of life's most difficult and rewarding journeys rang true.  I even shared a couple of the most poignant passages with my husband, and we were inspired to reflect over the last few days about our own marriage journey.  Best of all, I love a book that I'm still thinking about days after I've finished reading it.
5	1398038400	A great book - I am now reading a second book by the author and loving it as well.What Alice Forgot really makes you take a step back and realize what is important in life - in your relationships.  I actually highlighted quite a lot in this book because there are a lot of hidden gems of wisdom that I hope I can remember and carry through my life.  I am very glad to have found this book!
5	1398038400	This book really got me thinking about my own life.  I enjoyed it very much.  I wish the end of the story was a bit longer, though.  I love the author's writing style.
5	1398038400	I'm a picky reader -- former English professor who reads critically as well as voraciously -- and I'm picking Liane Moriarty for one of my new favorites.  What Alice Forgot draws the reader in almost instantly, and refuses to let him/her go from the start.  The sweetness of the story parallels the seriousness with which Moriaty guides the characters through a week that collapses ten years.  Using letters, journal entries, and narrative, Moriarty shows what it means to lose, and then re-gain, time.  While one character (Franny) seems less well-realized than others, her inclusion becomes more obvious by the novel's end -- another example of what's lost and then found.  As with The Husband's Secret, Moriaty's forecast of her characters' future is hugely satisfying for those who wonder &#34;what's next&#34; -- perfect antidote for a novel that's all about &#34;what if.&#34;  I loved this book and am eager to pick up another by Moriaty soon.
4	1398038400	Easy reading.  Really liked  the characters. Friends and family by her side. Interesting book  A Good book for summer reading
4	1398038400	This book is a little far-fetched, but it was entirely read in a short time.  It is a no-brainer type book.  It takes you away from your own complicated life and moves you quickly into one that is not so believable, but more complicated.
5	1398038400	Sad, funny interesting book and easy read! Nice read especially for a book club and I would definitely recommend it.
5	1397952000	Loved this book.  Once I started this story I couldn't put it down.  Wonderful characters and a little surprise twist at the end.
4	1397952000	Great insight as to how relationships can go wrong.  I enjoy this author's look at everyday life.  I would recommend.
2	1397952000	I chose two stars because for me it was very slow and repetitive. The book did not hold my attention.
2	1397952000	I'd just finished another of her books and was highly entertained by it..the title of which I've forgotten but it started with &#34;The Hypnotists&#8230;., something or other. I really liked the way she made me stretch my perception about human behavior and motivation but this was no where near as good. It was pleasant. I read it all the way through, unlike &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; which I threw across the room midway through. (It has since won the Pulitzer Prize..what do I know?) But I would not go as far as recommending  &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; for anything other than beach reading this summer.
4	1397952000	This book gives one much to ponder- how different am I than 10 years ago? What has happened in my marriage that would surprise me if I suddenly lost 10 years of my memory? What would I think of my life if I suddenly woke up to live it. Very well done.
5	1397865600	This was an unusual and funny story, and it kept me turning the pages.  I loved the characters!  If you liked Liane's other books, you will like this one.
2	1397865600	I usually love Liane books, however this one in my opinion was very slow. I had definitly didn't have a hard time putting it down to do a chore or two. Story was good and I enjoyed the ending.
5	1397865600	I really enjoyed this book and have read it twice.  I love the take on how a marriage changes over time, and how you have to be committed to it for it to work.
4	1397865600	Mother loses a decade of her memories. We follow her character as she is forced to learn all that has happened during that time.Good story, gets a bit rambling at times. Really satisfying ending.
5	1397779200	Loved reading this story .... great story line ...... stayed awake to finish ......  no tv watching ..... it was that good
5	1397779200	This is the first novel I have read by Liane Moriarty.  I have to admit that I had never heard of this writer but I am absolutely thrilled that I can add her to my arsenal of exquisite writers.  I absolutely loved the story and all the characters.  I was captured from the very first intriguing words.  I've already ordered The Husband's Secret and am really enjoying it also.  I'm sure I'll be reading all her novels available on kindle.
3	1397779200	I enjoyed the story however I thought the ending was a bit rushed.  Would like to have been able to delve more into Gina's character.
4	1397779200	The premise of this story will require some suspension of disbelief, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. Moriarty is a telepathic writer: she really pulls her reader in to a story. Had I nothing else to do, I probably could have happily read this book cover to cover in 8 hours. It's fun, and sweet, and engaging.
5	1397779200	It taught me to value the fun, little things and understand more the petty and wild fights I have had the pleasure of sharing with my hubby. :)
2	1397779200	I liked the book due to the subject of memory loss. It could have been more interesting, but it lost it's flow with the letters of her sister thrown in the middle of the story. I just did not like the style of this author's writing.
4	1397692800	This is a light, heartwarming book. At times very funny & rather suspenseful keeping you guessing and wondering about how all of the pieces will come together. I enjoyed this & would recommend as a quick, entertaining read.
3	1397692800	This story was a bit hard to follow in spots. I didn't understand the characters' letters to people until 3/4 through the book. Didn't flow how I expected it to.
5	1397692800	This was more than I expected and it made me think about my own life quite a little (what regrets do I have? What changes can I still make? Who have I become? And is that who I want to be?).  In addition, it was a really entertaining read.
5	1397692800	I liked this book--interesting the way the author weaves the story through different character's points of view and voice.  Creative premise the story is built on.  It took me a while to figure out who was who but eventually it all ties together.  Made me think about what my experience would be like if I forgot the past 10 years -- it would be pretty wild.
5	1397606400	I couldn't put it down. I think everyone should realize the many times we have too much to deal with and would like to run away.
5	1397606400	I loved this book, and how involved I felt with Alice and her choices, past and present.  I would have been happy no matter how the author chose to end it, as she had developed the character so well.
4	1397606400	This tells the story of someone recovering from a head injury who has lost her memories of the last ten years.  I thought the character development of the main characters was very well done.  It fizzled  a bit at the end but still a good read.
5	1397606400	Couldn't put this book down! She is an incredibly talented author with a very unique ability to suck you right into the story line. I'm also a huge fan of The Husband's Secret, so I've now purchased two more of her books!
4	1397606400	love all of her books I've picked up so far. Easy reads with interesting story lines and well defined characters.
5	1397520000	A good book to read and relates t every Mom or wife out there.  Any mother can't begin to comteplate losing all your memories of your children growing up.  Fun to read.
5	1397520000	I love the author's writing style and I was so engrossed with this book I read it in two days.  It had many twists and turns.
3	1397433600	began Great  & was initially very interesting but  got too draggy.  Did not enjoy it -- should  have  been shorter
5	1397433600	This is the last of Liane Moriarty books that I've read. &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; has a fascinating premise. Anyone who is trying to keep a family from chaos in difficult circumstances will be able to relate to Alice.The resolution was not earth-shaking, but it was unexpected and satisfying.  Liane Moriarty always manages to make the reader think without telling them what to think. Her plots are unusual, provocative, and entirely fresh. Good on ya, Liane. I'm glad I happened upon your books! I'm hoping for another.
5	1397433600	Great book. Loved the way she relates with her audience.  All the characters were very engaging and I found myself rooting for each of them.
5	1397433600	I absolutely loved this book.  such a revelation. truly was a good read and although I read it when it first came out, I remember it like yesterday. Definitely makes an impact!!!
5	1397433600	Tears. Chills! Such a moving plot. One of those books I wish I hadn't read so I could reread. :-)
5	1397433600	This is a great book: Alice falls at the gym and forgets ten years of her life. This memory loss allows her to see her close relationships to husband Nick, her children, girlfriends and her boyfriend through opposite lens and helps her focus her life again around what is important: her family. I loved seeing Alice morph into an empathic being after ten years of robot like living. Because she forgot her pre memory loss neurotic applyer of rules self, she morphs into a complex, rich, understanding, loving human being. Her older daughter Sultana acts out against a classmate; the empathic post memory loss Alice takes Sultana out for ice cream and gives her a beautiful mother daughter heart to heart. This happens the same afternoon Sultana is suspended from school. Alice is confused and lost now that she has to reconnect with her existing relationships without the baggage of 10 years of memories, the struggle she goes through helps me understand how I should always remember to take a deep breath and connect to loved ones without the straight jacket of automatic pilot when I allow years of memories to crowd out what is important in my closest  relationships.
4	1397347200	It was very interesting and have not read that kind of amnesia case from her prospective...appropriate ending but a little let down...I thought the story was building to a  more surprising ending...
3	1397347200	The book dragged along. You knew Alice would remember eventually, but it was nothing earth shattering. The story tries to build but then when you get to the climax it's anticlimatic!
4	1397347200	Really enjoyed this book. Great read and I will definitely be recommending this book to all of my friends, family and book club.
4	1397347200	I enjoyed it more in retrospect. During the read it was an unusual writing style but it came together in the end.
3	1397347200	I thought the story line was very interesting, but there was way too much back story to carry the story in the present. I found myself flipping through pages to get back to the present day telling. There were too many major characters featured. I wasn't as interested in Alice's sister and her notes to her Doctor. I also really don't like stories that carry you forever on the way to a quick two page ending. I was disappointed. For the author to give so much detail and back story, the ending seemed like a quick way to end it. It was almost like she had run out of steam in the telling.
5	1397260800	Enjoyed the book for it's face value/story, but also makes the reader really think.  How have I changed in the last 10 years?  Is it for good or bad?
5	1397260800	When Alice Love falls and hits her head, her world spins into chaos.  Her memory is lost, she can't remember the people closest to her in her life and she's desperate to get it all back.  Or, is she?  I recommend this anyone looking for a humorous  literary escape and love the style in which Ms. Moiarty writes.  Take a chance with Alice; you'll be glad you have.
4	1397260800	This is an enjoyable read!  It is not too light or too heavy reading.  I would read something else from this author
3	1397260800	I really liked this book and I think it was a fun read.  Definitely entertaining, but it just missed the one - two punch that makes it amazing.  If you are looking for your next book to pick up you won't be sorry you read this, but it won't stick with you like some ot the amazing ones out there.
5	1397260800	This book is somewhat comical but it's also a book where I was anxious to learn the ending.  A lot of twists and turns.  The characters are all so very interesting.  Although I was pleased with the ending, I did not want the story to end.
5	1397260800	This book is imaginative and interesting because of the subject matter and the depth of the characters. Liane Moriarty seems to have an unusual knack for communicating emotions without being overly dramatic. One feels as if they actually know the characters in the story and can't wait to see what happens next. Can't wait to read more from this author.
5	1397174400	amazing read. I'm already reading another book from the author. I got to this one after I read the husband's secret which I loved too. page turner!!!
5	1397174400	Loved this book. So original. Recently found Line Mortuary and am reading everything I can find that she has written.  She has transformed a non-reader into a reader. At 50 years old, my mom can finally say she has a reader!
5	1397174400	Author is fantastic. She keeps you wondering and entertained.I suggest all her books. After reading her writing I want to visit Sydney too!
5	1397088000	I loved this book. I discovered this author by chance and now am reading all her books! Each one better than the next!I also recommend Three Wishes
5	1397088000	even though its message is rather simple but it is very engaging. cannot put it down. ending is predictable but does not make this book less enjoyable
3	1397088000	It is an interesting plot but I found Alice somewhat annoying at times.  I just wanted to get through it to see how it ended.  Not on my recommend list.
5	1397088000	I loved, loved, loved it! It's not often I find a story that taps into the exact feelings of a marriage. The beginning bliss of innocent non-responsibilities and then the house, the children, the careers that can both strengthen and weaken a marriage. The author did a wonderful job of bringing the different perspectives of grandmother, mother and sister to show no one is immune to the trials of life - it's how you handle those trials that really define you. I will definitely be reading more from this author!
4	1397088000	I was leary of this book--amnesia?  But I really enjoyed it.  It's a good &#34;slow down. Simplify your life&#34; book.  Excellent reminder for me. Thanks Liane.
4	1397088000	Very entertaining book.  I liked the idea that the story is written from 3 different people.  Good book for young moms that are so busy also.
3	1397001600	Okay and moved well in some spots, but dragged on in others. Focuses on the faults of an overly demanding mother and housewife who loses her memory. Seems odd that the hospital would let her go home so quickly and easily (head trauma), but that is the premise. In the end love wins out and she is better for the memory loss...what a surprise. Really thought it was going to be more like a mystery or psych thriller, more of a romance with a little mystery. Not my cup of tea.
5	1397001600	I loved this book from beginning to end.  I found that I couldn't allow myself to reach the end of the chapter unless I had time to start another because I couldn't put it down.  I immediately downloaded The Husband's Secret and am completely captivated.
5	1397001600	The premise of this book grabbed me, but the author's skill kept me engaged.  I highly recommend it, especially if you are a married mom.
5	1396915200	After sampling so many poorly or over written books this book was so interesting and could not put it down!
5	1396915200	This book was fabulous.  A great love story to read.  It is definately a page turner.  A must read if you love &#34;love&#34; stories!!!!
5	1396915200	I loved this book!  It was well-written and hard to put down, but mostly it really made you think about yourself and the person you are now versus who you were in your younger years.  Would my 25-year old self like the 42 year old I am today?  Great read that I highly recommend!
5	1396915200	On the surface this seems like it could be a very average book, however I don't think that Liane Moriarty is capable of writing anything average.  She can describe the feelings that we have during life so accurately it amazes me, some of these descriptions are things I have barely admitted to myself and she has them in paper!This is a book that I will read more than once!
5	1396915200	Excellent read! Couldn't put it down once I got started. Characters were really brought to life. Finishing the book was like saying goodbye to friends
5	1396915200	This is a fun quick read that kept my attention, wanting to know what would happen next throughout the book.  So much so that I have gone on to read 2 more of Liane Moriarty's books.  They were also very good.
3	1396828800	Loved the characters . Good read, really got involved with the story.  Always miss a good book when I'm done.
5	1396828800	Love the idea of waking up...to who you were 10 years ago! This is a book that I can't stop thinking about! Loved it!
5	1396828800	Couldn't stop reading it!  Forces the reader to look retrospectively on their own life. Definitely recommend to all readers who want a light read.
5	1396828800	I enjoyed every page of this book. It was an easy read that I could not put down. Great book to take on vacation.
4	1396742400	Liane Moriarty is a great writer and she knows how to grab the readers attention and never let go until book is finished.
4	1396742400	You are taken on a journey of a women caught up in her complicated life when she suddenly awakes and has no memory of the past 10years. So much has happened in that time and we get a front seat ride as she discovers the person she turned into and slowly begins to regain her memory. Wonderful story of self discovery and love.
5	1396742400	Very enjoyable reading.  It was both funny and heartwarming. I have suggested it to my friends. Plan to read more of her books.
5	1396742400	This is a great book that makes you want to keep turning the pages. There's no doubt it will keep your attention. The characters are very well written and feel like you are a part of their lives. I would recommend this book to anyone.
4	1396742400	Read as part of book club. It triggered, &#34;which decade in my life is one I would find the hardest to have missed?&#34; I had humor, sadness, and plenty of human interest.
5	1396742400	Loved loved loved this book, it's written with such humor & heart! I had a difficult time putting this book down for any length of time....
5	1396656000	Oh I enjoyed this book entirely. A truly pleasant read. Was hard to put it down. Even when I was super tied from a long day of being a mum.
5	1396656000	Enjoyed the suspense of not knowing along with Alice. Her attitude of believing the best and not wanting to believe any of the bad is very endearing. It's a reminder that we can ignore the bad and look at the best. Do you ever wonder if your memory is exactly correct? Memory is interesting how it works. We each remember events differently. But what would you think if everyone says that nothing you think is real actually is real? That's because the last 10 years of your memory is gone!
4	1396656000	This book was so suspenseful.  It slowly revealed what had been going on in the last 10 years of Alice's life.  Everyone noticed how relaxed Alice seemed.  She was less stressed and took life a lot easier.  She was less hung up on appearances.  I sort of kept hoping that she never regained her memory.  I didn't like the hopping around from Alice's story, her sister, and her pseudo grandmother's stories.  After Alice regained her memory you wondered what she would take away from the lessons learned.  It was a good read.
4	1396569600	Alice makes you think a lot about what if this happens to you  I miss the characters in the book and all their feelings.
5	1396569600	I wasn't sure if I liked this in the beginning, but hang in there. I couldn't put it down. Speaks to so many relationships in our lives. Excellent!
5	1396483200	As you read the story of Alice and her memory loss, you wonder how you would assess your own life if you had forgotten several years of your existence. Would you like what you have become or would you be like Alice, looking at herself in disbelief of how she had changed since her younger days. Liane Moriarty has created a character who is sometimes likeable, sometimes not so much, but she reminds us of the importance of values and what is important in life, most importantly, being true to one's self and family.
5	1396483200	It kept me wondering what had happened to Alice & her sister & husband. It was funny yet sad at times.
3	1396483200	Simple premise, shows how marriage changes when life gets in the way. Simple read not really challenging at all. But entertains just the same. Much preferred the husbands secret to this one.
5	1396396800	Different twist on memory loss and great story with somewhat of a surprising ending.  Very good perspective of why we fall in love and marry and how we need to remain true to the values we place on our choices.
4	1396396800	The writer pulls you into the story from the opening pages. This was selected for a book club otherwise I am not sure I would have found the book to read.
4	1396396800	This was a fun read!  Loved watching the main character change back and forth as I read along. Will definitely get more books by this author.
4	1396310400	I liked the husband's secret a little better but this grabbed me right away.  I need to get into a book quickly and with this book it was no problem.
5	1396310400	This was a really good book.  I liked that it was different the concept was unusual without the preachness of relationship.  I liked how she dealt with the perceive injury that relationship causes and how some people get too caught up in thier heads by exaggerated how they feel. &#34;Like he never &#34; she never&#34; &#34;you always&#34;  I really liked this book.  Now I'm reading Husband secret which is sounding similar in characters.
5	1396224000	This is a fun read. Fun characters, plot twists and turns saddness and laughter all in one. One of those books you don't want to put down. I highly recommend it!
5	1396224000	May be great read for people struggling through a rocky time in their marriage to gain some perspective & for women struggling through infertility.
3	1396224000	I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I've had it on my reading list for ages and finally got to it, just to find it wasn't as spectacular as I'd hoped or imagined.  Alice, after she lost her memory and thought she was twenty-nine and pregnant for the first time, was a sweet character.  Her story was written in third person, but the author didn't take advantage of that &#34;all knowing&#34; style of writing, everything was shown as Alice perceived it.  Interspersed in Alice's story, there were diary entries from Elisabeth, Alice's sister made to a psychiatrist, Dr. Hodges; as well as letters to an old beau written by Frannie, their adopted grandmother.  These didn't add to the narrative at all, and would have made Alice's story flow better if just left out.For me, What Alice Forgot was just an ok book.  There are some really good moments with the children as she tires to learn to relate to these little people she doesn't remember.  There are good lessons to be learned about moderation, in life, in family, in friendship.
4	1396224000	I'm enjoying these books written by an Australian author.  A realflavor of daily life &#34;down under&#34;.  This book gives the reader anidea of what memory loss can be like and a look at how wecan change in the space of a few years.
4	1396224000	Loved it! It made me think about the value of reflecting on how you look at things.  It reminded me to keep my younger, more nave self close by to check on my older, more experienced self.
4	1396224000	Easy, enjoyable read.  A wonderful 'before bedtime' book.  Nothing that keeps you up all night but interesting and captivating enough to bring you back every night.  Just a perfect combination of light and funny mixed with contemplative and some self reflection.
5	1396224000	This book was so good. I didn't want it to end. I had to read it slow so I could make it last longer.
4	1396224000	Can things change that much in ten years? For Alice they did. This book was thought provoking. Made me think a lot about where I am and how I want to be in the future. We don't want to make our past selves cringe, as Alice did.I enjoyed this book, can't wait to read more from this author. It was a quick read and although I had to put it down several times, I could not wait to pick it back up.
4	1396224000	Thought provoking and entertaining, although a bit predictable.  I loved the wide variety of characters and their distinct personalities.  It was a fun read!
4	1396137600	What Alice Forgot by Liane Moriarty reveals how our connections with other people help define who we are. Alice wakes up from a bad fall and thinks she's 29-years-old instead of nearly 40. She can't remember the past decade of her life or the three children she had during that decade. The story moves at a fast clip as the reader tries to figure out what happened to Alice over the past ten years that has so dramatically changed her and the relationships that were once important to her.What Alice Forgot is an unputdownable page-turner -- be prepared to check out of your life for a day or two while you become totally immersed in Alice's. But the book is more than just an entertaining beach read. As Alice struggles to remember her life, the reader learns about Alice's sister, Elisabeth, and her heart wrenching struggle to have a baby. Additionally, an uplifting story about Alice's adopted grandmother demonstrates the blurred line between friends and family.  Ultimately, Ms. Moriarty's What Alice Forgot reminds us what it means to be a wife, a sister and a friend.  4.5 Stars.
5	1396051200	A most enjoyable read that I have recommended to many of my friends. We should all have the opportunity to take a 3rd party look at our own lives sometime!
4	1396051200	What a great book.  Life takes over and we all can forget who we wanted to be, who we can count on and who counts on us.  Life can derail if we don't stop to remember to be our best self
5	1395964800	I loovveeeeddd this book! One of those rare books that is gentle and romantic yet realistic. I won't be forgetting What Alice Forgot for a verity long time!
5	1395964800	Different way to look at a relationship after many years together and go back and see what attracted them in the beginning!
5	1395964800	Really enjoyed this book, as all the other Liane Moriarty books. Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down.
3	1395964800	Much of this book kept my interest and kept me guessing at the outcome.  While the approach taken by the author was different than other books I have read recently, it was handled well.  I was disappointed in the ending.
4	1395964800	This was a surprising book. I had no idea where it was going but found myself following closely as the events unfolded in an unexpected way. I recommend it as a good insight into human nature and responces!
5	1395964800	When I was told about this book, the description did not do much for me but I decided to read it anyway.  I am so glad that I did!  The book really makes you thing about your own life as  you see Alice try and find out what happened to her life.Excellent book.
5	1395964800	I could not put this book down.  The plot is very fresh and different and makes you think about your own life.  A fun read.
5	1395964800	Sit back, close your eyes, and think of everything that has happened to you in the past ten years and imagine forgetting all of it.  Fascinating concept.
5	1395878400	Loved it!  Characters were so real, well developed. Looking forward to more novels from this author. I highly recommend this book.
3	1395878400	A bit predictable but a great reminder not to get to caught up in the harried ness of life, cherish family and remember not much is black and white.
5	1395792000	This was a great, easy read.  I enjoyed piecing the parts of her puzzle (life) together as I read each chapter of the book.
5	1395705600	This was my second Liane Moriarty Book. (I also read and loved &#34;The Husband's Secret.&#34;  Her stories are clever, heart warming and hard to put down!
4	1395705600	A book about finding out who you have become, without even realizing it. This is thought provoking book, for all of us to reexamine our own lives and see if we really still like the person we have become.A quick and easy read.
4	1395705600	I like the idea of waking up and taking a fresh look at your life. I thought it was a really great book. I have read others from same author and so far this is my favorite.
5	1395705600	what Alice forgot is a fabulous book. It is a book that grabs your attention from the first page and you can't put it down.the book makes you think. It makes you wonder what your life would be like if you were to lose your memory from 10 years previous.
5	1395705600	I could not put this book down, I never read this author before & now I am reading everything she's written.  Read this book.....it touches every emotion ...head to toe !!
5	1395705600	This is a great story with wonderful characters and an interesting plot. I love how you learn more about the characters as the story unfolds. The back story of Alice's sister struggling with infertility was heartbreaking and honest. Helps you get an understanding of how painful it is. I highly recommend this book!
5	1395705600	A very good read! I think every person in a relationship should lose their memory once.  Alice shows the reader a different perspective of love and the importance of living life from the outside looking back.  How much we could learn from this!
5	1395705600	Very fast read.  The writing style was very intriguing in that it was from the perspective of three different characters.
5	1395619200	I stayed up until the early morning to finish this book - I loved it! Alice's perspective on parenting, partnership and sisterhood resonated deeply with me - by seeing these things more subjectively, she was able to focus on what is really important and reminded me of those things along the way.  Wonderful.
5	1395619200	Like Alice, I was taking for granted the amazing people and blessings in my life.  After reading this book, I paid more attention.  It has led to a stronger, warmer relationship wtih my husband and my 3 sons.  I love Liane Moriarity's understanding of human behavior.  I could really relate to Alice; this book was a wake up call for me, thankfully, without the head injury and amnesia.  It's also a fun read.  I recommend it unconditionally.
5	1395532800	I loved this book!  I could not put it down!  This is the third book of Liane Moriarty's that I have read in the last 6 months.  Her books are easy to read but really make you think about the subject matter and how you might think in the same situation.  Highly recommend this one, as well as her other books!
5	1395446400	So interesting to see through Alice's eyes how her life had not turned out as she expected.  When she lost ten years and couldn't understand why she was so different and tried to figure out how here relationships had gone so wrong, it was a fascinating look at how her choices made her life go off course,
5	1395446400	Great book and story line. Can't wait to read more by this author. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommend this book.
5	1395360000	I will be happy to rate the books I read by assigning stars but giving a so many word review is not something I want to do!
5	1395360000	Couldn't put it down!  A great read.  I've read two of her books so far and have not been disappointed.
4	1395360000	If you are a mother or want to be mother you will find this book endearing. The author builds characters whom you connect with. They are witty, insightful and connectable. While the plot is a little far fetched, the lessons gleaned are what we all need to be reminded of as we journey through the life of being a wife. Thoroughly enjoyed the unique style and how the author wove the story together in such a clever manner with three characters. Great book.
5	1395360000	I really am enjoying this author.  The characters are well drawn but not belabored.  Pace is excellent and the story keeps drawing you forward.  Not a good choice if you have to put it down to sleep!
5	1395360000	Enjoyed meeting Alice and her family--particularly liked the story line as well as the evolution of Alice and each her children.
4	1395360000	Another absorbing book by Liane Moriarty.There are books that I like, and there are books that I am anxious to get back to - this was one of the latter.  Alice hits her head and forgets the last 10 years of her life.  This leads her to rethink many aspects of the situation that she finds herself in as a suddenly-39-year-old who feels like she's still 29.  She's shocked at some of the developments in her life (including the fact that she has 3 kids).  This is a very interesting story of how we might (or should) change things, if given a fresh(ish)start like Alice.  Not a book that sounds like a page-turner, and I will admit my heart wasn't you know, pounding, as I read it.  But I did thoroughly enjoy it.
5	1395360000	&#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; was a delightful, interesting, suspenseful at times, read. I enjoyed it more than many books I've read in recent years. There is pain, redemption, with family, love and relationships, along with some unforeseen twists and turns. I read it in one day. Couldn't put it down. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
5	1395360000	Love this book. It is the kind of book that you immediately want to read again. It made me think.
4	1395273600	I really enjoyed this book.  It was interesting to think about your life and where you were 10 years ago and what it would be like to not remember the last 10 years.  I never got bored and I usually read mysteries so this was a change.
5	1395273600	Could not put it down and also found myself checking the bottom of my Kindle hoping there was much more left to read.
5	1395187200	The book entertains and makes you think, &#34;what would I do if I forgot the last decade?&#34; It's a super read!
5	1395187200	felt like you wanted to know the characters even more. complex story line very easily followed and true to life as the story could possibly get. made you think of your own life decisions
4	1395187200	My favorite thing about this book was the perspective of the narrator. Seeing the world as a woman who has partial amnesia does is fascinating and fun. It was kind of a mystery story, in a way. I enjoyed the reality of the characters and I recommend this if you're looking for something entertaining, but not too light.
4	1395187200	I don't usually read this kind of story, found it interesting held my interest, will look for other books by this author.
5	1395187200	I found this book to be very entertaining. I both laughed and cried. I was always rooting for Nick and Alice to reunite
4	1395187200	Very fast paste story with a main character who you will really like.  L. Moriarty is so good at making her characters real--what they say and think are so true and it is so insightful how she does this.  It is a page turner and you will be glad you spent the time and $$ on this one!
4	1395187200	This is the second book I've read by this author because I very much like her writing style and the intrigue as to where it will end.  Although I enjoyed this book, the other book, &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, was better.
5	1395187200	I just love the way this author writes!! Another book that I couldn't put down untill finishing it. Highly recommended
4	1395100800	This was truly a fun read about discovering your own life.  It was hard to put down and seemed very real.
1	1395014400	So many trite stories of very small women.  I finally could not continue.  Maybe just not my kind of story.
3	1395014400	I had read &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; and &#34;The Hypnotist's Lover&#34; prior to this one.  I found the narratives of Franny and Elizabeth to be distracting.  It was a bit problematic at first figuring out who they were and who they were writing to. Alice's childlike innocence while suffering amnesia was a little unrealistic.  As with &#34;The Husband's Secret,&#34; I found the epilogue to be enjoyable, but felt a little like the reader had suffered amnesia for 10 years and woke up to a smattering of what had happened since the story left off.  Honestly, if I had read this book first, I may not have gone on to read the others.
4	1395014400	As a 40-something, I could really relate to the plot of this story. Very engaging! I couldn't put the book down.
4	1395014400	Initially, this book was a little bit hard to get in to.  I soldiered on and ended up not being able to put it down. The book examines a situation in which Alice hits her head a loses her memory.  She doesn't remember her children or the fact that she is divorcing Nick.  The ending is predictable but I still couldn't put it down.  Alice's missing memory causes her to examine how she lived the ten years she couldn't remember and how it affected her relationships.  In some ways, she wasn't happy with what she saw.  Change was needed which opened up the possibility of forgiveness.
4	1395014400	Good. Repetitive and wordy at times but great twist at end of book.  Will be a bit diss appointed if you've read the husband lies, which I highly recommend!
5	1395014400	Love me some Liane Moriarty. She writes the perfect chick-lit books. An interesting story with lots of background on the characters-in my experience fairly rare for this genre. I definitely recommend it.
5	1394928000	For anyone who wonders how their younger self might feel about their current life, love and friendships. This book surprised me several times, and I really enjoyed reading it!
5	1394928000	This story was entertaining, but thought provoking. It made me wonder what would  happen if something prevented me from remembering the last 10 years of my life and marriage. Would it be good or bad? What if one couldn't remember bad water under the bridge? How would that impact relationships? What if 10 years later, one could compare the idealistic self with the one that actually exists? This author also always focuses on relationships, families, and the place that women and moms share in the community. A great story for women.....
5	1394928000	I very much enjoyed this book, I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Liane Moriarty's books, such as the Husband's Secret.
4	1394928000	Couldn't put this book down. At first I thought the premise was silly but as I got to know each character I realized there is a reason why Alice forgot,
5	1394928000	Fabulous!  This was a quick and fun read.  Well developed characters and fun plot. Read and loved &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; as well!
5	1394928000	Loved the concept, loved the writing style, loved the ending. Liane Moriarty's books are entertaining and thought-provoking. I will read another one soon!
4	1394928000	I picked What Alice Forgot, because I have read both The Last Anniversary and The Husbands Secret.  I like the book What Alice Forgot, but not as much as I enjoyed reading The Husbands Secret.  I would read more of Liane Moriarty's books.
4	1394841600	Very pleasant read but the characters are unappealing. I would have liked the story better if the main character would have had some redeeming qualities.
5	1394841600	It kept me reading. The author drew me into the story. I wanted to know what had happened to her, just like she wanted to know. .
4	1394755200	Creative plot and enjoyed the read, but could have explored medical issues a bit more. Unrealistic that she never saw a doctor after leaving the hospital. And, why she fell off the bike in the first place - even if it wasn't important to the plot or to her medically.
3	1394668800	The characters didn't get my sympathies . There was just something missing for meI enjoyed her first book much better
5	1394668800	The novel peels like an onion.  You keep discovering things about Alice as she discovers them herself.  Very cleverly written.
5	1394582400	As always, I enjoy Liane's books. They are interesting, the characters are always appealing to me.  Really enjoyed, fun read.
4	1394582400	A good lesson for all married couples... savor the good moments, get over t he bad moments, stay together for each other.
4	1394582400	The story kept me very interested.  I Liked the way the author developed the protagonist through the entire amnesia period.  You saw both sides of her.....her &#34;before&#34; side and &#34;after&#34; personalities.  It was a good concept for a story and made me think what I would wake up to if I lost 10 years of my life.  It was amazingly scary!
4	1394582400	This is another great book from Liane Moriarty. She never disappoints. As I read, I either smile, laugh, or just shake my head.
5	1394582400	I love the way the author writes!  She grips me from page one.  The story really makes one rethink their life.
4	1394496000	I really loved this book- until the epilogue. I've read a few of Liane Moriarty's books and I think she's a great writer. Her writing is quick, easy and entertaining to read but the characters and situations she creates feel real and complicated. Her characters are funny, sympathetic, and believable and I always feel interested and invested in their fate.I thought this was a great, thought-provoking story about how it would feel to wake up from a fall and not remember the last 10 years of your life. Some reviewers complained that the changes in Alice and her family/friends were not realistic ("nobody changes that much in 10 years!") but I completely disagree... I thought all of the changes were completely believable, and were well-explained by Moriarty. Relationships are dynamic, and I thought it was interesting to see how over the course of 10 years and after various breakups, marriages, promotions, miscarriages, and deaths, people's relationships with one another are drastically altered.My only problem with this book was the epilogue.. usually Moriarty's stories aren't wrapped in such a neat package, and I like that because it's more realistic. Her endings are always satisfying without being fairytale-esque.. but in this book BOTH Alice and her sister's stories end in unbelievable, irritating perfection and it makes you wonder why you spent hours reading the book and sympathizing with the characters if all that struggle, self-reflection, and growth is ultimately completely ignored/undone in a pointless epilogue.HOWEVER, even though I didn't like the ending, I enjoyed reading the book and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a well-written, funny, and thought-provoking chick-lit book. If you liked Moriarty's other books (the Husband's Secret, The Hypnotist's Love Story) than you will probably enjoy reading this. One thing I noticed though- this is the third Moriarty book in a row that I've read and some of the characters/plotlines/themes seemed just a little too familiar... but I guess that's to be expected of any author? (She is a fan of car accidents, PTA-Mom characters, wise and endearing but batty old-lady characters, and seems to greatly value the institution of marriage as most of her main characters end up sticking with their marriage despite obvious problems)
5	1394409600	This is the third Liane Moiarty book I have read in 2 weeks. I have never written a &#34;fan letter&#34; to anyone in my life but Liane Moriarty may be my first. I laugh out loud.  They are the quintessential beach reads. I like this one just as much as the Husbands Secret and maybe a tiny bit more than The Last Anniversary.&#34; I read Hypnotists Love Story last month, loved that, too,  Hope she writes her next soon!!!  I am a teacher and never get to read for pleasure during the school year so I have literally been staying awake to read through the night.
5	1394409600	Wonderful story, great idea, totally addictive.Sometimes it is good to step back and look at everything from some other perspective.
5	1394409600	I enjoyed the books. They were interesting,and informative. I really admire her as a writer. Her writing style isclear and percise.Sincerely, Carole Bearer
5	1394409600	This story will make you appreciate your loved ones in a whole new way.  The writing is fast paced and keeps you guessing.
5	1394409600	Very interesting story. Makes you want to keep a journal. I would highly recommend this book. I love  being able to have it on my iPad.
4	1394409600	This is a fun book, with  likeable characters. fast moving pace, good dialogue with underlying mystery of what DID Alice forget.
5	1394409600	this book is amazing. I laughed and cried. I related to the characters. the writing was wonderful. since reading this, I've put all the authors other books on my wishlist. I will definitely be reading everything she writes!
4	1394409600	Interesting plot, a bit slow at times.  Good character development, like the bit of suspense as well as the ending.
5	1394409600	I really loved it!  The blend of humor  and seriousness was well-balanced.  It was fun to read.  Liane Moriarty is an excellent writer.  I plan to read more of her books.
5	1394409600	Great story! Great writing! Fun read!Amazon says i need more words in my review so here they are. ANnoying!
5	1394323200	I love the was she develops each character. The book started out slow but by the end you are rooting for a happy ending for all.
5	1394323200	I liked the book very much. It was a good read with twists. The characters were very believable and interesting
5	1394236800	I realized, about 25% of the way into the book, that I was thinking in a parallel universe, what if this were me? What would I do different? I love Liane Moriarity's writing style, it's captivating. Some of her books I would have written the ending a bit differently (The Last Anniversary) but she did a fine job of wrapping up this story, satisfied that lessons were learned all around.
5	1394236800	I loved this book.  It made me feel warm and bubbly on the inside.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good chick flick.
5	1394150400	Loved the character development in this book!  As a busy mom, it was easy to relate to Alice, but found myself relating to the sister as well.  I highly recommend it.  Its an awesome read!
5	1394150400	Outstanding novel I couldn't put it down. It was a refreshing way to look at your marriage despite troubles things can always work out. Really enjoyed it could have read it cover to cover.
3	1394150400	What if's. What if you only remembered the good times & could start over. She tried but the past seems to catch up with even the best of us. Too much water under the bridge.
5	1394064000	This is the second book I've read by the author and I really enjoy her style of writing.  She has a way of making her characters come alive by writing in such a way that lets you know exactly what the characters are actually thinking even though they may say or do something else.  In addition, the plot was pretty good too.
3	1394064000	in some parts of the book it's a little slow at times but over all once i finished it was an OK read -
5	1394064000	This really made me root for marriage, wedding vows, and the bonds that hold a family together. I couldn't put the book down!
4	1394064000	Alice has an accident, hitting her head. When she comes to she has lost 10 years of her memory. She can't remember her 3 children or the current state of her life with her husband, extended family, or friends. It made me pause and look at my own life. Are there things I would try to forget? If I had a chance to rebuild my life, what changes would I make. I loved the ending!
2	1393977600	EVERYTHING!  I ended up flipping through pages and doing a lot of skimming. That's it.  Everyone was happy and life was perfect at the end of the book. That's It. If that's what you care about, then this is the perfect book for you, no loose ends, no unhappiness, no remembrance of the heartache or pain the book was supposed to be based on.  It's cardboard characters with a cardboard life. If all that sounds great to you then by all means have at it. It's just not the perfect book for me. (P.S. Harlequin Books can give  you the same type of story, and they're cheaper.)
5	1393977600	Captured me at the first sentence and wove a story that kept me from putting this book down.  Love, love!
5	1393977600	One of the best I've read in a long time!I don't like reviews with spoilers so I'll just say the story and ending are quite satisfying.
5	1393977600	This is my second Moriarty novel. Both were fantastic. The characters are powerful, relatable, and haunting.  I think about these people and the possible outcomes of their quandaries long after I have read about them. Excellent.
5	1393977600	This was such a great read - I couldn't put it down!  The characters were so believable and the contrast between what Alice remembered and reality was really enjoyable.
5	1393891200	This story reminds us how simple daily interactions and how you decide to spend your time and energy greatly effects our path in life.  It's a great story and life lesson!
5	1393891200	A very good look into life with Alzheimer's Disease.  Very well-written.  Our book club read this and each of us agreed that we like the author.  In fact, we have read several others by this author.
5	1393804800	The story line interested me right from the beginning.  I ran through a gamut of emotions throughout this book.  At times I was afraid of how it would end.  I liked the way the story allowed the main Character to almost redefine herself. To correct past mistakes and do the right thing even though she didn't remember why she did them in the first place.  I hated to have the story end but I was anxious to see how it would turn out.  A great feeling of satisfaction when all is said and done.
5	1393804800	Very interesting plot . . . how differently would you view your life if the same thing had happened to you?
4	1393718400	A good yarn, with well developed characters and believable dialogue.  Definitely an enjoyable read.  The ending was rather predictable, so I found the story a little less stimulating than The Husband's Secret.
3	1393718400	I&#8217;d heard so much about this book for so long, and just like Moriarty&#8217;s The Husband&#8217;s Secret, people seemed to love it. Also like The Husband&#8217;s Secret, I just couldn&#8217;t make myself love it. The premise of the story was really interesting and raised real questions for me, but the characters bugged me and the writing never drew me in. And, this is exactly the same way I felt about The Husband&#8217;s Secret.The situation that Alice faces certainly had an impact on me &#8211; she has memories of herself from ten years ago and is astounded to discover what type of person she has since become. I absolutely thought about my own life and what my 25 year old self would think of my current self (probably that I am now incredibly boring, but I think she would be proud that I started this blog!). This book also made me realize all the stupid little things that I should be letting go that don&#8217;t matter in the long run. So, in that sense, I&#8217;m glad I read the book.Even though What Alice Forgot did provoke some life evaluation for me, I didn&#8217;t enjoy actually reading the book (I know, this sounds bizarre&#8230;). The writing was too plain vanilla chick lit and the dialogue lacked snap. Alice&#8217;s situation could have resulted in smart, witty exchanges (particularly between Alice and Nick, her husband) and I think Moriarty missed this opportunity.I also didn&#8217;t like present day Alice &#8211; she was one of those insufferable, always trying to impress moms and reminded me of (you guessed it!) Cecilia from The Husband&#8217;s Secret. They were almost interchangeable characters for me, causing me to get a &#8220;been there, done that&#8221; feeling about present day Alice.Finally, and this could be because I had just read Brain on Fire (the medical mystery memoir of a healthy 26 year old who falls into an unexplained madness), I was dying to know what was medically wrong with Alice and why she lost those particular 10 years of memories. The book totally avoids giving any medical explanation for her dilemma (other than hitting her head in a fall off her spinning bike)&#8230;to the point where Alice never returns to the doctor after being released from the hospital despite her memory not returning. Not only is this just not credible, but including a plausible medical scenario for her condition could have been fascinating!After two tries, I think I&#8217;ve just come to the conclusion that Moriarty&#8217;s style is not my cup of tea.For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
5	1393718400	This book kept my interest and didn't want to put it down.  Very good read and the ending was good.
4	1393718400	If all of us could view ourselves from afar as this novel proposes, what changes would we make?Might be a little sappy at times but these charcters show hope for redeeming themselves.Everyone can take something away from this book.
4	1393718400	I really enjoy Liane Moriarty books. She always makes feel good endings....which makes me happy.  I love happy endings. :)
5	1393718400	Loved it. Kept me reading non stop. I lost my short memory once and felt completely identified.  Probably my fav boook from this author.
5	1393718400	If you want an easy, engaging book . . . this is for you!  I read it in Mexico and was highly entertained.  I would recommend it to any one who just wants an &#34;easy read.&#34;  Just kick back and ENJOY!!
5	1393718400	I love this author!  She has a unique style of writing that hooks you in right from the beginning by relating to feelings and insecurities most of us have felt at one time or another. I couldn't put this down - I kept wanting to know what waited around the corner on the next page!
5	1393545600	I absolutely loved this book. Haven't rushed through a book like that in ages.  Love this author and will checkout her other books.
5	1393459200	Liane Moriarty was a new author for me and after the first one I read I quickly read all that she has written and look forward to the next  She has such a great sence of humor and characters. Each of her books is fun. They are all different. Not scripted like many authors tend to do.
5	1393459200	I loved this book.  Liane Moriarty is the kind of author that brings her characters alive with all their quirks, emotions, and secrets. While I was reading this book I felt as if I was in the novel with her characters, that's how easy a read this book is.  I really enjoyed this story of Alice forgetting the past decade, and struggling to find her way with her family and friends.  You will laugh out loud, and also cry as she finds her way....I highly recommend this book.  SIX STARS!!  Enjoy!
5	1393372800	I highly recommend this book.  It was actually recommended to my book club by one of the member's mother.  We will be discussing the book at our next book club meeting and I can't wait.
5	1393286400	This is a delightful book that just spins its tale happily along.  There are no real conflicts or moral choices.  This is much less serious that Liane Moriarty's other books - the description that comes to mind is tasty fluff.
5	1393200000	I give this book 5 stars. From the moment she regains consciousness second by second/ smell by smell/sound by sound/memory by memory...we travel through a 10 year period of joy,pain,gain,loss,growth that makes up life. Suspenseful page turner.
5	1392854400	I thoroughly enjoyed this book and had trouble putting down. I couldn't wait to see if she finally got her memory back and what would happen at that point. I loved the ending and was sad the book was over at the end! I would love a follow up book that continued with the children's lives and the marriage!
4	1392854400	I liked &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; so decided to try another by the author. The story was enjoyable, if a bit unbelievable, but the &#34;lesson&#34; was one that every person married for a time should pay attention to.I recommend this highly for that reason. It provides a good reminder of how to live your life, with family, friends, everyone you interact with.
4	1392854400	I'm not a big fan of amnesia plots - whether it's on tv or in books.  Sophie Kinsella's book was an exception and so was this.  Of course, Sophie's was a lighter tale but I was just as enthralled with this one as I was with hers.  Ms. Moriarty told a good story without making it overly dramatic or implausible.  I also enjoyed reading how the characters changed from who they were to who they are now.  I think she did an excellent job in showing how events and people shape us.  I think I enjoyed that the most!
4	1392768000	I can not wait to read more of her books . I enjoyed the end of this one. Just right.
4	1392768000	I liked the book. Easy read. Easy to put down and pick back up. It did make me think about life!
5	1392681600	This book reads as quickly as &#34;chick lit,&#34; but it has much more depth to it than you'd think.  The characters are very realistic and the plot is interesting and thought provoking.  Great for a book club discussion or just an enjoyable read that will leave you thinking about your own life decisions.
5	1392681600	The mystery of what happened to Alice's life was compelling enough to keep me turning the pages making this a fast and enjoyable read. Great for a day on the beach or a rainy afternoon.
4	1392681600	Alice falls off her bike in spin class and hits her head. She comes to and worries about her baby. You see, Alice was pregnant, 10 years ago! She seems to have forgotten the last 10 years and so much has happened. She's had 3 children that she has no recollection of. She's become quite thin and one of those school mommies that she used to make fun of. She is also going through a divorce. She starts to feel as if she is not herself anymore. She calls her sister Elisabeth and feels a sort of strain with their relationship as well.As she tries to put the pieces back together, she finds out more things that confuse her even more. But What Alice Forgot is not just about what Alice forgot, it also tells us the story of Elisabeth and her desire to have a baby and all the losses she suffers and it's the story of Frannie. Frannie is the girls' adopted grandmother. We read letters she writes to someone she cared about and we read Elisabeth's notes to her therapist. They all connect.I cannot imagine what it would be like to lose 10 years and not even remember your children. The saddest part of the story for me was when Alice asked Libby to tell her about her children. Moms know all the little ins and outs of their children, more than anyone else, and that would be so hard.It did drag a bit for me in parts but it really is a very good book and will make you think of just what you take for granted everyday.
3	1392508800	Ok read. Kept my interest, had to finish it to find out what she forgot. I was disappointed because there was a lot of reading between the lines.
5	1392508800	I loved this book. I read it in 3 days which is amazing considering I have 3 small children at home.
5	1392422400	This book was hard to put down. This author has become one of my favorites. I've read all her books!  Never disappointed.
4	1392422400	I often find a writer who has a style that I enjoy, one that has a talent to tell a story and creatively pull you into the story and make you feel it is believable and unique.  Yes this had some areas that could have been told with less length and demeans ion but she made the story make you wonder what you would have done being in the position of the character. This I loved and I loved that the characters where well developed but slowly adding them as the story progressed. Well done, would recommend as an easy read.
5	1392422400	This has to be the best book I have ever read, and The Husband's Secret is the second.  I love the way she writes and how everything comes together. I don't want to finish them; they are that good.
5	1392422400	What Alice Forgot is a great read. Could hardly put it down. Perfect for cold winter night or warm beach day.
4	1392336000	I am actually still reading & probably will wished I'd given this 5 stars. I love this author' s style. She is awesome. Her stories are fascinating & entertaining. Really enjoying her work.
5	1392336000	I loved this book for many reasons. The author really makes you ponder what life might be if you lost ten years of your own life. What do you do without all those memories? Then how do you handle life if you remember? I really enjoyed the way this author wove the families together, and I totally identified with the sister and her fertility problems as well as the grief issues. I am going to recommend this book to all my friends who read.
4	1392336000	I loved this book. I worried about the ending. Could not imagine how it would end. It was a supprise.
5	1392249600	What an interesting concept...loose the last ten years of your memory. How many ways has your life changed in that span of time? The main character, Alice, has much to decide....kept me wondering how she WOULD decide right up to the end. Good, fun read.
4	1392163200	This book is quite thought-provoking and interesting and will stay with you long after you finish it.  It will lead to lively discussions among readers.  Well done.
4	1392163200	This book would be great for a reading club.  There is a lot of room for discussion on many topics and on things that make you go hmmmm.
3	1392076800	After reading The Husband's Secret the week before, I found this a little slow and the story line was nowhere near as interesting. Overall, it was okay.
5	1391990400	Very good read! I really enjoyed this one. I finished it off in a week. Liane does it again! Will definitely read more from her.
5	1391990400	Great book!  It's amazing how much one's life can change in 10 years!  If we could all lose our memory sometimes and go back, makes you think twice on how much &#34;things&#34; really matter in life.
4	1391990400	I really liked this book!  The premise is a little far-fetched but I could relate to (or at least understand) the characters.  One thing I didn't love is that the characters have too similar a voice.  The three main women felt like they were the same person in different situations.  However, the story is fun and even funny in lots of places.  I actually teared up a little at the end.  Recommended!
5	1391990400	This is a very fun book with a lot of twists and turns. It definitely caught me off guard. And I just couldn't stop reading!
3	1391904000	Alice fell off her bike at her spinning class and forgot the last ten years of her life. She remembers only that she is expecting her first child and that she is madly in love with her husband.  She discovers she has three children and that she and her husband are on the verge of a divorce. She also discovers she doesn't much  like the person she has become. This book makes you think about who you are becoming and is it who you want to be. I didn't give this more stars because of the offensive and unnecessary foul language.
5	1391904000	I so enjoyed this book. The story line is fascinating in that it asks the reader to imagine how we would feel if we lost 10 years of our life. The story is so compelling and the characters are rich and you immediately engage with them. All in all, a great read!
5	1391904000	I've never read a book with such a unique story-- this is my second book by Liane Moriarty and I am just loving her writing! I don't want to stop reading her stories, am so satisfied with the endings, and then feel bittersweet when the books are finished because I wish I was still reading them. The good news is there are still a few more of her books I can read!
4	1391817600	I enjoyed this book. I go for the easy keep me interested reads and this fit the bill.I was rooting for them the whole time.
5	1391817600	I found this book a most compelling read. &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34;, shows us how as we evolve over the years, our lives can turn in new and different directions. These turns are subtle and we may not notice them at first. However, these turns can eventually change our lives into something we do not even recognize.  Alice has been given the rare opportunity to go back and see how and why she navigated the turns that she did.
5	1391731200	This book caught me by surprise.  I did not think I would get too &#34;involved&#34; with a character that doesn't even remember herself.  I tried writing the ending with each passing paragraph and think Liane did an unbelievable job of making the &#34;real life&#34; of Alice, play out just the way you'd want it!  Liane Moriarty does not disappoint EVER!  I've read all her books and am waiting for the next novel!  Hurry, I can't wait!!
4	1391731200	Good read. Enough suspense and humour to keep you interested. Enjoyed the diversity of the characters and the story line.
4	1391644800	Just read my first book by this author The Husband's Secret last week and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to read another story by this author. I enjoyed it and have already recommended it a friend.
5	1391644800	I enjoyed this book on several levels. Alice was likeable and had good friends. She fell in a spinning class and lost the prior ten years of memory. It was fascinating to see how she viewed her &#34;new&#34; world and then slowly regained. Ms. Moriarty must have done a great deal of research because this rang true.
5	1391644800	If you want an incredibly interesting, cant stop thinking about it, rollercoaster ride, here it is! It'll grab you from page one. You can't imagine how this will end.
5	1391558400	I love Moriarty's writing: engrossing, well-written stories with engaging characters. She is not for readers who want fiction that is meaty and meaningful (these are really people who feel guilty reading fiction) but for those who appreciate an excellent story told well.
5	1391558400	After reading the Husbands Lie, I wanted to read everything by this author I was not disappointed by this book one iota. Apparently Liane Moriarty is one of the best authors in Australia, if she's not she should be.
5	1391558400	Loved it as I could relate to it as the main character is about my age.  Interesting to think about how my life has changed over the past 10 years.
5	1391558400	I couldn't put this book down ! I needed to find out what happened next! I usually don't read books twice, but would read this one again.
5	1391558400	Great book! really funny and thought provoking. I just kept laughing and nodding my head. A must read get it now
5	1391472000	I could not put the book down.With its twists and turns,And humor and seriousness.The best part of the whole book,in my opinion is Love and family is Really what life is all about,and of course faith.Enjoy!
5	1391472000	My husband was about to have serious surgery, and I was looking for a book that would grab me, hold me, and keep me distracted while he recovered.  This was IT!  It was so good I could occasionally get lost in it.  And I could pick it up and put it down without any problem.  SUCH a good and interesting story!!  I think this is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I am now a full-fledged fan of Liane Moriarty and will devour every single one of her books.
5	1391472000	Looking at Alzheimers through the eyes of someone with this diagnosis at the early stage is amazing. This intelligent woman was still able to plan for the changes in her career and life - very emotional and educational at the same time.
4	1391472000	Alice lost 10yrs in a moment. Maybe it was what she needed to really get her life back on track. It shows that all relationships from friends, kids, family and marriage all take hard work and effort. I really enjoy the different storylines throughout out the story and how many people benefited from her losing the 10yrs.
4	1391385600	I enjoyed this book. I kept thinking what if this happened to me! The characters seemed real and I could relate to them.
5	1391385600	I love this author and this has been my favorite book by her so far!I couldn't put it down!  A true page turner!
3	1391385600	I was intrigued by the premise for the book, as I like stories about interlocking lives, but I felt as the novel unfolded it ran off the rails. While I did finish it, I found the characters less likable with each page. Perhaps the premise was too far-fetched to begin with and it was hard to flesh things in three-dimensionally from there, but it seemed to me an idea that began with promise ended up pretty much in two dimensions.
5	1391385600	A really compelling story about the complicated mess of love and the wonderful things that can happen when you get out of your own way! Highly recommend.
5	1391299200	Wonderful!!Cannot get enough of Liane Moriarty. I tell every book-reading person I know. She is a wonderful, very talented writer.
4	1391299200	This Australian author pleasantly surprised me with &#34;What Alice Forgot.&#34;  It was a well-written story of amnesia, which is generally pretty hard to pull off in a believable way.  Alice goes to the gym one day and wakes up to find 13 years of her life a blank.The book tells about people's relationships, how they change, and  how the incremental advance of time can cause our marriages to deteriorate without our becoming aware of it.There is quite a bit of humor and insight in this story.
5	1391299200	I enjoyed this, especially since I treat patients who have had traumatic brain injuries. It kept me wondering whether Alice was going to recover her memory or not.I liked how bits of her past were revealed, and I was happy with the ending.This is the second book I have read by Liane Moriarty and it probably won't be the last.
5	1391299200	I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! It was a great read and from the very beginning of the story, I was sucked in and did not want to put it down. The author has you wanting to know more and more of the puzzle, which is Alice's life. It was witty and humorous, all while touching on a few very serious topics. I loved the author's style and how well the characters were defined.Overall, this was a great book and the only good thing about finishing it was  that I was able to go back to my normal sleep schedule; I was staying up way too late reading it:)
4	1391126400	It is more a woman's book.  The writing is excellent including the description of characters.  It keeps your interest, and you findyourself liking or disliking some of the characters.
2	1391126400	this is a very good book and very usefull for childrens and gains much knowedge. it is very heap and can attract customers easily . thus is cheap and available in market
5	1391040000	Not only did I enjoy the flow of the book and the story line, but I have also held on to the thoughts it provoked even weeks after I read it. Liane Moriarty made me think about how the choices I make today will impact my tomorrow...and ten years from now. I cheered for the characters all the way through and truly enjoyed the adventure.
4	1391040000	It's a fun read and a light story that easily held my interest.  Read it in just a few nights.
5	1390953600	Loved the story lines, the characters--all of it.  Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.  I've bought two more of her books.
5	1390953600	I r. enjoyed this book too since i read her other book &#34;the husband's secret&#34;  Love her writing and page turning style!
4	1390953600	This book was a fun, quick read. I really enjoy this author and have purchased 2 of her books on my kindle
4	1390953600	Cute book! Took me a minute at the beginning to understand the authors layout, but once I did, it was a very enjoyable book.  Loved the hidden message that we should all not lose sight of what we have, even with all the chaos of our every days lives.
5	1390953600	A very thought provoking book it was hard to put down but when I did I had to adjust to being back in the real world I was so involved with the characters. Liane is a really good writer, her characters are interesting and believable and the dialogue flows well, you don,t keep thinking &#34; nobody talks like that&#34;.  It made me think about relationships and how they change over the years, but also about how we have changed as people as we have grown older.  This is the third of her books I have read, and so far, my favorite.
5	1390953600	I thought this book was great!  It makes you kind of envious as she rebuilds some relationships that she forgot she had ruined.
5	1390953600	It felt like my life was being told  as I read it. What if I forgot as much as Alice did? What if I no longer liked my life?
5	1390867200	Right after I finished (after being unable to put it down), I almost started right from the beginning again. So fascinating to ponder where our lives take us, and how things would be completely out of context if we suddenly forgot a chunk of time. I've read 3 of the author's books so far, and this one is my favorite.
1	1390867200	It took me forever to get into this book, and I found it an entire waste of my reading time.  Sorry Liane Moriaty.
5	1390867200	I really enjoyed reading this book. Great writing, thoughtful, and thought provoking. Her writing style is very easy to read and allows you to get pulled in.
3	1390867200	The book was well written but I found the story and character development to be pretty slow to pick up. The overall theme is great but I don't think I would ever read it again or over enthusiastically recommend it to a friend.
5	1390867200	I enjoyed it so much that I ordered three more by this author.  Would definitely recommend it to any reader.
5	1390780800	This is the story of Alice losing her memory of the past 10 years in an accident and therefore experiencing her present through the eyes of her 29 year old self instead of the self she had become by her real age of 39.  She has no memory of anything for the past 10 years including having and raising 3 children; her changing relationships with her sister, mother and neighbors; how her best friend died; and (the biggest mystery of all) why she and her husband who she adores are now separated and getting a divorce.  The book weaves the stories of all these characters into Alices story throughout the book in a lovely way that makes you come to know and care for each one.  Although at first I could not understand the mother's story, it came together in such a way that I wept at how much it dovetailed my own story of foregivenss and eventual love for my own mother.  The simple but powerful take away from this book is yes, your life experiences will change you as they should, but do not forget to take your young self along!
5	1390521600	This book was mentioned on a blog post. The lady who wrote it was giving her top books that she liked for 2013.  This book captured my attention as soon as I started it. Loved how the book told you little by little along the way. It kept me reading and couldn't wait to get to the end to see how every thing turned out.  Love Liane Moriarty books. This is the second one that I have read of hers. The Husbands Secret is really good to if you have not read it yet.
4	1390521600	Really enjoyed not knowing what Alice forgot - kept the story interesting and compelled me to keep reading!  Caused reflection on my own relationships!
5	1390521600	My two favorite authors of late are Jojo Moyes and Liane Moriarty. Their works are similar, contemporary (for the most part with the exception of Sophie&#8217;s plot in The Girl You Left Behind), dealing with very real, complicated, life-altering issues. And ironically, with the exception of Me Before You, their novels (at least the four I&#8217;ve read) are set in present times with the primary focus on events that have happened in the past. Moyes and Moriarty have created characters, modern-day women, I can relate to. These mothers and grandmothers are struggling with their identities while doing their best to take care of their families and raise their children.Out of the four Moyes and Moriarty novels I&#8217;ve read in the past three months, What Alice Forgot is easily my favorite. When Alice falls off a bicycle during spinning class, she hits her head and loses all memory of the last ten years of her life. When she regains consciousness, Alice is the naive woman of 29 who has forgotten the experiences&#8212;heartache and joy&#8212;that shaped her life during the last decade. She can&#8217;t remember her three children or the traumatic breakup of her marriage. And she can&#8217;t remember the single, most important thing, the tragic event responsible for all the choices she&#8217;s made, both good and bad. She&#8217;s a visitor, a stranger, in her own home, plunked down in the middle of her busy life without a clue how to juggle laundry, her children&#8217;s extracurricular activities, or her volunteer responsibilities. She doesn&#8217;t know who the prime minister is. She&#8217;s never heard of Google. And she hasn&#8217;t a clue how to send a text message. In her 29 year-old-mind, she&#8217;s pregnant with her first child, not the mother of three. She doesn&#8217;t know what to think of her toned body or the mature face staring back at her in the mirror.What Alice Forgot is written from three different alternating points-of-view&#8212;Alice&#8217;s, of course, as well as her somewhat estranged sister, Elizabeth, and their grandmother Franny. These different perspectives help piece together the events that have shaped Alice&#8217;s life over the last ten years. What happens when Alice discovers she doesn&#8217;t particularly care for her wise, brazen 39-year-old self? You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out.For more of my reviews, please visit my website at Chronicles . . .  An Avid Reader and Indie Author  [...]
5	1390521600	This was a really fun, fast read.  Great story about a woman who takes a fall while exercising and hits her head hard enough that she wakes up not remembering anything for the last 10 years.  She now has 3 children and is in the middle of a divorce and doesn't know why.  Read on : ) Very thought provoking.
5	1390521600	very introspective makes you go back in time to all the years of marriage, challenges as young wives to middle years and as a senior reader with grown daughters and growing grand daughters recommended this book to them, actually one married daughter is in a book group 35-45 and recommended to me her mother, I loved it as did my grandaughter age 23.  sad at times but very reflective, hard to put down!!
5	1390435200	Great book!  I enjoyed it very much.  It was entertaining and quick, yet kept me guessing or on my toes.
4	1390348800	I enjoyed the story. The value of looking at your curret self by your former self was priceless. the view of the children and what was important and what wasn't was well done as well.
4	1390348800	Really makes you think about how you are with others and imagine yourself in Alice's predicament. Very good book to read.  Enjoyed it
5	1390348800	This was a great book! Throughout the story you find yourself wanting a specific outcome to occur. The main character is so lovable but also terrible at the same time.
4	1390348800	If you have ever asked yourself what the 20-something you would think of the 30-something you, you will enjoy this one. It's fun food for thought - if I lost the last decade would I recognize my life? Also, if you had to rely on your friends and family to fill you in on your life, what would their version of your story be?
5	1390262400	Liane Moriarty's writing style is casual, observant and moves along at a quick pace. The dialog is realistic and the &#34;inside thoughts&#34; recognizable. The intertwining events in the character's lives are somewhat predictable but a few twists and turns were unexpected. The ending was a little too pat but overall a good read.
3	1390262400	I read this while on vacation and it was ok.  By the time I actually finished it I liked it better but some parts were kind of slow. Could have had more depth.  I felt like there were missed opportunities to outline/reflect on what Alice learned about herself and her life and how she really changed.
5	1390176000	Enjoyed the book alot. One of those books you could put down and come back to and still follow the story.  Will read more of her books!
5	1390089600	I read it very quickly as I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to find out what happened. I thought it was just a light &#34;chick&#34; book. However, I was surprised that it went deep sometimes about death, infertility, and divorce. I found myself relating to many of the characters. It was cute.
4	1390089600	The writing is excellent !It's light, funny and refreshing.Even though some situations are unusual it brings back to us many fleeting thoughts from everyday life that we don't necessarily share with anybody but think in passing
4	1390089600	Just an excellent read!!  So different and exciting to the very end. I am lovin this author she grabs your interest.
4	1390003200	Although I had a little trouble getting into this book, I was hooked halfway through.  Well worth the read and a fascinating premise.
5	1390003200	I have read all this author's books to date and this one was my favorite.  Great read!  The characters are good, the plot original.
5	1389916800	I enjoy the way Liane jumps from character to character. Keeps your attention and wanting more. Looking forward to reading more of her books!
5	1389916800	I absolutely loved this story. Its funny how our feelings change over time. We need reminders on what caused us to fall in love in the beginning.
5	1389830400	I love the way the author puts out thought provoking subjects that could easily occur in anyone's life. This book held my interest from start to finish.  It was a great read. I highly recommend itI
5	1389830400	I loved this book. It might be my favorite of all of Moriarty's books. It makes you think about your own life and how in just ten years, especially your 30s, how many changes you go through. Some of them , not so good as far as your priorities , dreams, ect.
5	1389744000	The book was great!  I don't want to put it down.  I read it for book club and it's so far one of the best books that we've read yet.
4	1389744000	I found it interesting how she could now viewed her life through other people. And how she 'thought' how things had happened but she was wrong.  And how sad it would be to not have our wonderful memories of loving moments.
5	1389744000	Outstanding book! Written beautiful. I could not put it down. It made we wonder what would I do in same situation .
5	1389744000	I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and leaves you pondering where would you be if you forgot the last 10 years of your life.  I would suggest this book to anyone who loves to get wrapped up in a good book.
5	1389657600	Great book!  Kept me up late wanting to know what happens next. Keeps you guessing right until the very end.
4	1389657600	Liane never disappoints. This was a good read, though slightly predictable and a little drawn out. The characters were believable and engaging. This story wasn't a &#34;page turner&#34; in the sense that you couldn't put the book down, but enjoyable just the same. Liane's characters are always a joy to meet.
4	1389657600	Good, entertaining book. Good plot and written in a humorous, sometimes a little sarcastic, way. Would recommend for easy reading.
5	1389571200	I am so glad Amazon recommended this book to me. It was thought provoking and interesting. I couldn't put it down!
4	1389484800	After reading The Husbands Secret, I was immediately a fan of Liana. I like her writing style, so naturally i moved right along to this book. I thought it was very well written, LOL funny in some parts, while invoking compassion for the main characters in other parts. A must read!
3	1389484800	Easy read for a time you are getting snowed in or on a beach trip. Nothing spectacular, but it does make you stop and think and remember to appreciate what you have. Some of us are always planning the next perfection or improvement before enjoying what we've worked for.
3	1389484800	I must confess I was not able to get through this book due to its writing style. I simply found it to be way too wordy to get to the point.
5	1389312000	Very well written, kept my interest the whole time and had a great ending!! I highly recommend and will read her other books
4	1389225600	And I enjoyed it very much.  Couple things I figured out and wasn't shocked by, but it was a very enjoyable read.
5	1389225600	Highly suspenseful... especially as a woman happily married 21 years and with a child....I  just kept trying to imagine myself in her shoes and it was unfathomable!
4	1389052800	I could not stop reading this.  I was so pulled in by the story and characters.  I highly recommend this one.
5	1389052800	She is a fabulous story teller who develops characters we can relate with and care about. Just enough of a mystery to keep the reader moving forward.
5	1389052800	Couldn't put it down! I always love Moriarty's books. She keeps you hooked and curious to know what really happened while she pieces the puzzle together.
4	1389052800	When Alice looses her memory, including the fact that she had 3 children and was embroiled in a divorce, she also reverts back to the person she was 10 years ago which was very different from the person she had become.  It creates so many scenerios and so many opportunities for change.  Just made me wonder how much I have changed over 10 years.  For all of us, some for the good, some for the not-so-good.
5	1388966400	Any book that has me stopping my normal activities to read is a great book. From the page turning mystery that starts the story, to the characters who inspire you to look deeper into the women you meet everyday, the book is powerful and entertaining.
4	1388966400	I enjoyed the book.  It made one realize sometimes you get a second chance.  I would recommend this book to friends.
5	1388966400	This book was way better than I expected! I love the idea behind this story, if we could all see our eyes throughwho we were tens years ago would we recognize ourselves, approve of our decisions
5	1388966400	I enjoyed this book.  Well written  with some twists and turns towards the end.  I started to really get caught up in the main character and her decisions.
5	1388880000	You know, I always read the one star ratings. If those people don't even finish the book, why rate it? Not fair I say!This was my second book to read of Liane's and I am going to read all of them. I hope the rest live up to this one.Like I said in the title, it REALLY made me re-think how my current relationships have evolved over the last decade.Why I NEVER hope to suffer the same head injury, I am trying very hard to remember the *me* from a decade ago.Thanks Liane! I think this book might have just been the therapy *I* needed :)
4	1388793600	Nice story. Kept me engaged and wanting to keep reading. Somewhat disappointed with the ending though. Felt like the author couldn't decide, so she threw in two endings!
4	1388793600	I really enjoyed this book right from the beginning! This is the 2nd book I've read by this author & loved them both!
4	1388793600	I enjoyed this book because I could never tell what information Alice was about to find out. Very good book!
4	1388707200	This was the type of book you read all night.  Lots of twist and turns.  Really looking forward to reading the Moriarty Book
4	1388707200	What if you woke up having forgotten tha last, pivotal decade of your life?  That's the premise of this sweet story by Liane Moriarty. I say sweet because Alice, the heroine, awakens with a charmingly innocent perspective, free from ten years worth of baggage. I won't say this is quite as compelling as the others I've read by Moriarty, but it is another innovative concept, which, to me, is her specialty. That said, I was thoroughly entertained throughout.  I'm so glad I recently discovered this writer and many friends have agreed that her stories are warm, interesting pager-turners.
5	1388707200	I read this book in about a day and a half - I couldn't put it down! This is the second Liane Moriarty book I have read, and it was just as enjoyable as the first. So thought provoking. What would you do if you forgot the last 10 years of your life?
4	1388707200	Easy to read, unexpected twists. Keeps you entertained throughout.  Would most definitely recommend to anyone looking for a beach read!
4	1388620800	I really liked this book. I liked how it progressed and how she saw herself completely differently when she didn't know who she had become and why she had become the women she was before the bump on the head. It was a nice twist. I even liked the ending and won't give it away by telling.
5	1388534400	I looked through Amazon for a new book. I stumbled upon "What Alice Forgot". Wow! I could not put the book down! The book struck some cords with me and I feel in love with poor, confused Alice and her family. Great from beginning to end. There are some fabulous life lessons that were woven into the book. Even with so many damaged people filling the pages...you walk away inspired and reflective about the good things that life can offer. Great read!!
5	1388534400	Liane masterfully captured the joys and heartache of life as a woman. I related to Alice and her sister Elisabeth in such an intimate way. Exquisite story.
4	1388534400	I like this author's style.  I have read some of her other books.  This one was a fast-read that explored what if you had a head injury and lost your memory?  It's a modern day story.  I think a mother/wife would relate to this book.
5	1388448000	I couldn't put this book down! I had read THE HUSBANDS SECRET and loved it, so I thought I would try another by the author.  I love that the plot doesn't stop twisting until the very end. Great book!
3	1388361600	I started out liking this book. It started strong, and seemed interesting, but it quickly lost me when it became apparent that the main character was not remembering on purpose and it just was not too appealing from there.
5	1388361600	I definitely loved this book. I could not put it down for one second. it was sweet, sad, touching, loving and kept me holding on till the end. I wish it wasn't over!
5	1388361600	Could not put this book down.  Liane's style of writing draws you in from the first chapter on.  The book really puts a retrospective look into how family and children changes a marriage and how it transforms who you are as a person. It makes the reader take an inventory of how important it is to keep aspects of your younger self while balancing it with the responsibilities of being an adult.
5	1388275200	This is a story with which women can really relate. I love Alice. This story is heartwarming, funny, and classic.
5	1388275200	I have read all of Liane Moriarty's books - and love all of them.  I wish and hope she will write more.  They are very entertaining and intriguing without being stressful or dark.  The only problem is I finish them too quickly!!  I love her style!!!
4	1388188800	An interesting and unique way to portray the real-life scenarios in the book.  Made me think about where I am in my life and the paths that have gotten me here.  Entertaining!
4	1387929600	This is an intriguing book that  from the very beginning has you asking what would it feel like to be in her position. ..most good stories let you find out about the character through their thoughts and actions ..this book has you discovering the past right along with the protagonist ..many twists and turns keep you guessing very good book
4	1387756800	I wiuld & have recommended this book.  I was always anxious to get back to the story.  It is not the first book written with this plot but I found it one of the best.
4	1387670400	This is a well written story. Very creatively written from different characters perspectives. A little rushed at the end but still a good read.
2	1387670400	The concept of this book is good, but the execution fell flat.  The story was not compelling and the payoff was too long and unrewarding.
5	1387670400	My attention was grabbed from the beginning to end. I found the main characters real and likable. Though they were not perfect, it was a good balance. The story was engaging and I was surprised by the ending. A good read.
5	1387497600	I read the husband's secret first, and fell in love with Moriarty's writing style. And this book was ten times better than the husband's secret. Must read.
5	1387497600	Great book, I couldn't put it down. I'm planning to gift this book to a couple friends for Christmas, because it really hits close to home being in my mid thirties. I couldn't imaging forgetting this great part of my life. I couldn't put the book down!
4	1387497600	Good vacation read, couldn't put it down.  Enjoyed all the twists.  Pulled me in and wouldn't let me go til the last word.
4	1387324800	I love Lianne Moriarty books. She has a great sense of humor. This book had some deep thoughts about love, marriage and child rearing, as well as relationships with parents. Extremely entertaining. Get it!
5	1387324800	I love the books by this author. This story was real grist for philosophizing mill. If we suddenly lost 10 years, would we like who we have become and who our loved ones have become? And also, what choices made on the spur of the moment or even ones we've evolved towards making, would have a major impact on our lives. To some degree, that can also give us a &#34;do-over&#34; in life, as our heroine had when realizing that she had no idea why she was divorcing her husband. Such an interesting novel!
5	1387238400	Unbelievable Page Turner! Read it in 2 days! You cannot wait to get to the next page! You will not put it down! Right grom 1st page, you are hooked.
4	1386979200	This is a real cute shirt for a little girl who loves mustaches.  It arrived quickly.  There were no issues with this order.
4	1386979200	This was a good book.  It was cleverly written.  I enjoyed the way it unfolded.  I had not read this author before this book.
1	1386979200	Terrible. Way too long without capturing my attention. Painful to try to get to the end. Didn't even bother finishing it.
5	1386979200	Great story although I do feel like the grandmother's letters just prolonged the story and didn't contribute much to the quality of the book.
5	1386892800	I loved this book.  This is the second book I have read of Laine Moriarty and she is now one of my favorite authors.  Already read &#34;The Husband Secret: which was excellent!  I love the characters and  love the story line.
5	1386720000	&#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; was  what a woman s life was like when she had an accident and  forgot what her life was really . Makes you think.. what if you forgot your family, your children.
5	1386547200	Excellent read. Once I started the book, I could not put it down. The ending was a roller coaster ride.
5	1386460800	It reminds you of the importance of family and how sometimes you need a little nudge in the head to realize what your true priorities are.
5	1386374400	Another great story.  Very humanistic and bizarre at the same time.  Really enjoyed it!  Very gripping story and one I couldn't put down
5	1386201600	Great book -- very thought provoking and fun to read with a bit of mystery mixed in.  Talked for weeks with people about this book.  Easy read and really enjoyed the author's writing style.
5	1386028800	Really liked this book. It hit so many different emotionally hard points in life. The flow of this book was great! I had idea about what the ending was going to be like but this book still had me even till the very end.
5	1386028800	Great story - fun to read. Definitely recommend! Makes you think about your own character development over the past decade!
3	1385942400	I bought this book after seeing great reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. Unfortunately, I fail to see the big appeal and was pretty let down overall. It wasn't a terrible read, but it wasn't the best by any means. To me, it kind of felt like a Lifetime movie in print form. I might have enjoyed the book more it I'd known that's how it would be because I was expecting something a little more well-crafted and thoughtful.
5	1385856000	This book really changed my way of viewing things.  It takes the main character through a process of memory loss and gradual return, forgetting and then remembering the things that had happened in the last 10 years which led to the change in relationships and values.  Really interesting premise. It made me look at who I was 10 or 20 years ago, and what made me change into the person that I am today.
4	1385856000	This was a great first purchase for my new Kindle. A quick, light, page-Turner. I would highly recommend this book.
5	1385769600	Love, love, love this book!  It was a page turner.  Could not put it down until I read the book in it's entirety :))
4	1385769600	I read this book because one of the reviews said they were happy with the way it turned out...I needed one of those comfortable reads that created a little anxiety but &#34;it was all going to work out in the end&#34; - It is a book you don't want to put down but are so glad to come back to!  The author does a wonderful job of creating Alice's 1998 world and makes you feel her pain in trying to come to terms with who she has become and where her life is &#34;today&#34;.  Alice has an opportunity to revisit some of the choices she made, reinvent herself, and change the outcome of her future... Everyone I have recommended this book to has enjoyed it and it is a fun book to talk about and speculate about.
5	1385769600	Not only was this a different premis for a book but it was thought provoking for my own life too.  Where was I 10 years ago and is that &#34;me&#34; different from the present &#34;me&#34;?  A good read
4	1385596800	Very enjoyable and entertaining read. Alice has forgotten the last ten years of her life. She thinks she is 29 instead of 39! Find out what she has missed out on and what happens when she does remember.
5	1385596800	Great read. Couldn't wait to find out which Alice would win out in the end! Would highly recommend this book.
4	1385596800	Can't say enough about the insightfully delightful experience reading WHAT ALICE FORGOT was.  I was smiling and crying and rooting for everyone.....
5	1385596800	I've already read it twice and will certainly read it again.  It is thought provoking, serious, humorous and sometimes makes tears run down your cheeks.  I love it.
4	1385510400	This book keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what will happen. And its thought provoking. If you are unhappy but love the person you are with, re-frame and make it work.
4	1385337600	Very interesting and captivating novel. Liane has a way of identifying with each of us. I cried at the end of this novel. Great Sunday read!
4	1385251200	What Alice Forgot gives insight into the longing for a child felt by infertile couples. It is also a good study in what can go wrong in a marriage--how people can evolve into cruel creeps through layering on years of resentment. There's also a sense of the loss when a good marriage goes down the drain. The narrative is entertaining and engaging as the reader is gradually let in on just what it was that Alice forgot. As Alice regains her memory after falling off her bike in cycling class, she realizes that the last ten years have been a mix of the wonderful and the horrible. She re-thinks some of her decisions relating to &#34;the horrible,&#34; and starts to change her direction, reclaiming some relationships that were suffering.
5	1385251200	I loved this book! This was the second book I've read by Liane Moriarty (first book I read was The Husband's Secret, which I also highly recommend) and it was a great read. I am currently in a similar place in life as &#34;young Alice&#34; and this book put a lot into perspective. Definitely a great read.
5	1385164800	This was a really great read. Loved the perspectives of different characters and especially Alice's before and after point of view.
5	1385078400	writing style, multiple character perspectives, story development, connection to the story- loved it! I will definitely be reading more of Moriarty's books.
5	1384905600	Unpredictable enough to keep me hooked. Read it in one week. Interesting to ponder what it would be like... Sweet read.
5	1384819200	I loved this book. I loved learning who Alice was, while she was learning who she was.  And I loved the author's message that it is never too late.  I didn't want to put the book down, I wanted to know what happened next.
5	1384732800	This book is great! It kept my attention the entire time.  It was an easy read, but it also had a great message in the book as well - sometimes you need to take a step back and think about who you are and what type of person you have become.
5	1384732800	Uniquely crafted and woven plot. So glad I discovered Liane Moriarty. I think I only have one book left of hers to read. Sure hope more will be forthcoming soon!
5	1384646400	I have become a big fan of this writer and her sense of humor.  This book really makes you wonder what life would be like if you forgot ten years of your life.
5	1384646400	I read this book over a year ago and I still can't get it out of my mind.  It's one of those books that stays with you forever!  Even though it is a novel, a lot of it is based on fact, and you can't help but think will this happen to me?  Excellent book!
4	1384560000	At first I hesitated to read it because I thought it would be like Before I Sleep, but this was so different.  I loved Alice before and was sad for who she was.  I was hopeful through the whole book.  Won't reveal if my hopes were dashed or not.  Enjoy.
5	1384560000	This book was so good.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Great author. I read her book The Husband Secret and it is also a great read.
5	1384473600	This book was a very fun, light read - but it still makes you think about how we change over the course of our 30s and what we envision for our lives is not always how things turn out.
5	1384473600	I loved this book.  Bought it after reading The Husband's Secret.  Both were really great stories.  I did not want to put either one down.
4	1384473600	This is my second Liane Moriaty novel , The first being The Husband's secret.  I love the way she writes, keeps you reading, wanting to find out about all the characters , is suspenseful and pro family;  Am eager to read her next book.  Unlike some other successful writers has more than one good story in her.  Have already recommended her books to others.
5	1384387200	Fun book! Really enjoy Liane's writing.. Kept me up in the night reading later than I definitely should have been!
5	1384387200	Quick read and a great look at how we all wish to change our past to bring new life into our present and future. Moriarty's books are fairly easy to figure out early on but still highly enjoyable and a great way to pass time.
5	1384387200	Love Liane's writing style. Can't put her books down! Also read Husbands Secret. Can't wait to read more of her books.
5	1384387200	Liane Moriarty has written another fantastic book.  This time it's about a woman who has a head injury and doesn't remember the last ten years of her life.  You can feel her pain and confusion.  I'm not finished with the book yet and I feel I'm treating myself every time I pick it up to read.
5	1384300800	I am a Lithuanian-American and my Lithuanian Grandmother lived with us.  I was in college when she died so many stories about Lithuania were told in our home.  It also gave me a broader understanding of what happened to those Baltic countries during WWII.
5	1384214400	I could not put this book down. I thought it was an absolutely fabulous read. Liane Moriarty is my new favorite author. I've downloaded 3 of her books and plan on getting the rest of them.
5	1384214400	Great premise and characters. Kept me reading! Moriarty does a great job fleshing out the thoughts and feelings of her characters.
3	1384214400	The story line was very good and gave me some food for thought, but the ending dragged. I think this lends itself to a great ladies' night discussion.
5	1384214400	What if you could go back in time and look at yourself 20 years later. This story makes you look at your own life and evaluate what you have done.
4	1384128000	Definitely makes you stop and appreciate life!  Interesting perspective and thought provoking... at times a bit too relatable.  Would recommend.
4	1383868800	A good modern day book, as I call them, ,entertaining, kept me interested and also was at times funny. Made you wonder how it would be to lose your own memory.
5	1383868800	Nicely imagined, well written. I enjoyed it on many levels, especially the many little surprises that were revealed throughout the story as Alice's memories came back. She was given the opportunity to change the course of her future because of the clean slate in her mind and spirit after her head trauma.
4	1383696000	I took this book with me to read on vacation, and it was just perfect for the task. Some of it could have been a little bit more developed but still very enjoyable.
5	1383696000	For anyone who let their life run them rather than running their life. Wonderful! This book is entertaining and thought provoking.
3	1383436800	I'm half way through it and I'm not sure I'll get through it.  It's slow and just not that captivating.
5	1383436800	Great turns and twists throughout. Great character development - you end up really caring about everyone and What might happen.....
5	1383436800	I have read most of Liane Moriarity's books and this book is 5 stars like the rest.  Ms. Moriarity creates such realistic and rich characters and weaves you in and around all of there voices.  The plots and subplots are so interesting and I am never really sure what will develop.  I also enjoy getting a glimpse of life in Australia.
5	1383350400	Another captivating book by Liane Moriarty that had me reading a few pages every chance I got. A great premise, imagine being a blissful new wife, expecting your first child, to then awake to find yourself 10 yrs older and no memory of the intervening years. Alice last remembers being pregnant, lovingly restoring an old house with her husband. Suddenly she awakes to find herself with three kids, a beautiful home, and a nasty divorce. This book really makes you look at who we were, and what would our younger selves think of who we have become. Can there be a happier now if we soften our view of our lives through the lens of  our younger, less jaded eye. Could not put it down, now where is her next book, so I can stop being sad it's over.
5	1383350400	Very well written with wit and depth.  Thought provoking and entertaining.  I'm looking forward to reading more Liane Moriarty books.
5	1383264000	Great book for a book club to discuss. I had never read Lianne Moriarty's books, and now I'm hooked. The book is funny at times, and sad at others with a couple twist and turns. Really enjoyed reading it and have recommended it to severL girlfriends.
4	1383264000	I did not know if I would like this book at first and after the first chapter I could not put it down. Very interesting take on learning what is important.
5	1383177600	I generally avoid contemporary fiction, but the premise behind this book was intriguing enough to download the sample. I found the story compelling and was instantly drawn into Alice's struggles as she tries to make sense of what her life has become. I found myself tearing up with her as she realizes that not only is she not the person she hoped to one day be but she doesn't even know how she got here.
5	1383091200	This book is gripping and a fascinating concept. What would your life be like, if you forgot the last 10 years? I really enjoyed the characters; the children are so realistic. You can almost hear their voices. And the ending is a real cliff-hanger.. what will Alice decide about her marriage?  I also read &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; by the same author and that enjoyed that as well but this book really hooked me and I couldn't put it down.
5	1383091200	Captures wide range of emotions.  Keeps you turning pages.  Reads like emotional mystery, like peeling an onion to get resolution.
5	1383091200	It has often been said that hindsight is 20/20.  What  if you were given the opportunity to have a &#34;do-over&#34; of your last 10 years of life, with the only stipulation being, a loss of  memory for those years; would you do it?  That's the position that Alice Love found herself in, although she certainly didn't choose it, after suffering a severe concussion.Alice Love awakened on the floor of a gym, confused, and not knowing what had happened to her, or why she was being  cared for by strangers who were acting as if they knew her. She had a thousand questions and needed to call her husband.  Nick would be able to calm her.  He was good like that.  But calling him only upset her more.  This loving loving husband of hers' had somehow turned into an angry jerk. He was swearing and accusing her of playing games.  Alice was dumbfounded, all she wanted to know was why everyone was telling her that they were now separated, or more accurately, why she was divorcing him. Who was this Alice?  It certainly couldn't be her.  No, she was going to get to the bottom of this, just as soon as she met the three little devils, her sister keeps telling her, are hers'; and figure out how exactly to be a mother.Liane Moriarty does an extraordinary job in creating unique characters, capturing their emotions and developing witty dialogue. I know that I became so attached and involved with her character's lives that I didn't want to put the book down, or if the truth be known, became a little irritated when I had to.Liane's writing flows easily from one character's emotional gut wrenching event, to another character's laugh out loud funny episode.  This is the second book of hers' that I have read, the first being &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;.  There are just not enough stars to rate this writer.  Don't miss the opportunity to discovery this magnificent and talented author.  You won't be disappointed.
4	1383091200	The premise of the story is compelling and the story moves along well. Some confusion about who is talking when,  but you get used to it.
4	1383091200	I enjoyed the entire book.  It made me wonder what my life would be like if that had happened to me.  I was glad that she and Nick worked through their problems.
4	1383004800	Ms Moriarty has a wonderful gift for writing.  I just don't know why she felt the need to throw in that ugly, fowl word through out the book.  It added nothing to the story line, and only kept me from recommending her books to all my friends.  We are always looking for good books to read and share.  Sorry I won't be able to recommend her books for book club or just a good book to read.
5	1383004800	"What Alice Forgot" is an excellent read.  I "found" this author on Kindle recommendations, starting with "The Husband's Secret" and have read ever one of her books.  I do not write reviews.  But I am writing a review because Liane Moriarty is an excellent writer.  Characters can be "related to" and I love the Australian back drop for her books.  Can't wait until she releases another.
5	1382918400	Ever wonder how things got to where they are and the choices you made that got you there?  This book explores this theme and has fun doing it.  Suspenseful, modern, and memorable.
5	1382832000	Great book. Unique story. Very Honest. Made me want to look at my life and see how I could be a better person. There is some &#34;2008&#34; Alice in all of us - caught up in too much of everything. Made me think about when life was simple for me too!
5	1382745600	This was a great book.  It was a story that real people could connect with,.understand, and connect with.I would highly recommend this book.;
5	1382745600	Excellent read. I wish she had more books written, I cried several times while reading this book. Three more words. This book inspired me. Well worth the read.
5	1382659200	Insightful and profound. I never review books but this one is special. I laughed,cried and could not put down. Read this book it could change your life!
5	1382659200	Alice gets a concussion in a spin class and loses ten years of memory.  While she awaits the return of her memory she discovers she had changed to a not so wonderful person to those who once were close to her, be it family or friends.  I really liked this book.  It was another book I needed to finish so I could return to library before day was up.  I was 50% into the book when the loan was returned.  I couldn't take it...I went to Amazon library to buy the book so I could compete the story.  I was not disappointed.  Loved how the author developed the different characters and also appreciated how she tired all the loose ends.  Great book to get lost in for an afternoon of reading.
4	1382572800	I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It could apply to almost any person, or marriage, or family.  It was a little extreme in examples but was such a good read and caused me to reflect a lot.
5	1382486400	This is a fantastic book!! The characters are described in depth and the story is weaved together in an incredibly good way. It is a real page turner. Liane Moriarty is a very talented author. I just bought another of her books and can't wait to get started reading it.
5	1382486400	This is my 3rd Liane Moriarty book and it is very good.  Not quite done yet so I don't know how her memory goes or comes but it is very good.
5	1382400000	Will choose more by this author. I enjoyed the story so much that I put more of this author's books on my reading wish list.
5	1382400000	Very well written with excellent character development. I really got wrapped up in the characters' lives and felt emotionally attached to them and was very emotionally invested in the book- which is not very typical for me. Well done on not just delving into the characters' lives but really getting into their heads! Solid plot and story line throughout- keeps you engaged without any big lulls or boring periods like sometimes occur halfway through other books I've read. Definately reading more from this author!
5	1382400000	Wow, what an imagination for a writer who presumably never had amnesia herself.  I could feel Alice's confusion and frustration.
5	1382313600	I could not put this book down. It was so thought provoking and well written. Satisfying read from start to finish.
5	1382313600	Purchased these several weeks ago. I needed something to get me thru late afternoon until supper.  It is too easy to snack during this time for me.  This product WORKS!  I love it - can get easily thru this time and eat a very little supper.  No side effects.  Love It.
3	1382227200	It's a nice lovely Sunday/holiday read - but it wont change your life. More thoughtful and well written than Sophie Kinsella's similar book Remember Me?
5	1382227200	I rarely, if ever, do more than the perfunctory star review, but this novel blew me away.  Such well developed characters, and real to life scenarios.  I couldn't put it down....except to prolong the experience that hits so very close to home.  The relationship issues, family issues and friend issues are so real in everyone's life.  This novel is so well written, it makes you want to be Alice, and experience the wonder of self reflection and fresh perspective.
5	1382140800	A warm and wonderful story of someone given a second chance to fall in love with her husband and discover who she really is and what matters in her life.  Inspires to look at one's own life and to not forget why you chose what you have chosen.
4	1382140800	I was not sure what to expect. However as a busy mom I enjoyed this book from opening to the end.  I think everyone can relate.
5	1382140800	This book goes straight to your core - makes you consider your life as you live it today, and the choices you would make if you could do it again.  One of the best books I have ever read.
4	1382140800	Love the uniqueness of the plot without it being too corny.  Gets you thinking about the evolution of life and marriage once a home is filled with busy lives and children...
5	1382054400	I read this book quickly. It was a complete page-turner. The topics covered in this book made it great for book club discussion.
4	1381968000	Liane Moriarty's book about Alice's lost memory of the previous ten years of her life is so real you can feel each tremble in Alice's brain as she searches for the answers to questions of her lost years.  How could she forget she had three children?  Delicious and surprising.  I LOVED it.
4	1381968000	What an excellent book. Both the general premise and the characters are interesting, and the effort that is put into the characters is astounding! I thought I had all the twists figured out, but I most certainly and absolutely did not. This book definitely takes you on a journey, and you start to really examine your life and relationships, but somehow, magically, the author does it in such a way that doesn't come off corny or saccharine. I will most certainly be looking for her other novels now. I definitely recommend!
4	1381795200	A good book to read on vacation! I love this authors way of writing. It reminds you of Maeve Binchey.
5	1381708800	A lot of people are comparing this book to &#34;remember me&#34; by Sophie kinsella. Yes she woke up and didn't remember her life, that's about the only similarity. I loved this book from beginning to end. I had my hopes and ended up not being disappointed at all! Great vacation read :)
4	1381708800	What a wonderful author! Love her books. This book was readable and engrossing. I am so glad I have discovered this author.
4	1381708800	this is the first book I have read by Liane Moriarty, but it will not be the last. I could not put the book down.
5	1381708800	Can't imagine bumping my head and waking up to find that I couldn't remember the last 10 years of my life.  That's what happened with the lady in this book.  Slowly, but surely, the blanks start to fill in, but she has no idea why she and her husband are getting divorced and she has three children?  The last thing she remembers is, she was pregnant with her first and was madly in love with him.  This was a page-turner.  This author is so interesting.  I love the way she writes, I discovered, after I read The Husband's Secret.  Now I am reading her book about The Hypnotist.  Got company for a few days while I was into What Alice Forgot, and couldn't wait for them to leave so I could finish the book.
4	1381708800	Thought-provoking subject matter that sparked lively book club discussion. A bit predictable, but has some quirky twists. A fun read!
5	1381622400	I loved trying to figure this one out. The author was very comical at parts. Would definitely recommend this to a book club, my friend and I went back and forth discussing it.
4	1381622400	I chose this book based on this author's other works.  The start of the book was slow and repetitive but I'm glad I stuck through it because it did get really good towards the middle and through the end.  I loved how the book gave perspective on how caught up in life you can get and how one should remain grounded and true to his/herself.
5	1381536000	Even when things are very bad - there is always hope...Definitely recommended reading for men. It is interesting, entertaining and informative in terms of the psychology of women.
4	1381536000	This is the second book by Liane Moriarty that I have read.  This book kept me engaged with Alice as she discovers who she has become and remembers who she is.
5	1381449600	This is Great book. Leaves you guessing until the end. It's a great quick read! I would definitely recommend this book.
5	1381449600	This book is so good.  It really makes you think about how life can get so overwhelming that you don't even realize how you neglect the most important people for such silly things.  Highly recommended.
5	1381449600	The writing was clear and the people were described so well they could be invisioned while reading the book.  Such an ordeal to have to go through and given a second chance to change your life. Lots to think about even when the book was finished.
4	1381449600	As the title says, Alice wakes up and can't remember the last ten years.It's interesting to ask oneself the question &#34;What is I woke up and thought I was in my life 10 years ago?&#34;Some of the plot twists are predictable, but not all.It's an interesting study of people and relationships.Chick lit at its best.
4	1381363200	I didn't want it to end and  yet I couldn't stand not knowing what happens next!I enjoy Liane Moriarty's work.
5	1381190400	Couldn't put it down.  Held my interest till the very end.  Nice ending that surprised and delighted me. This writer gets me.
5	1381190400	I love the twists and turns. It never got boring... it always kept me wondering... I enjoyed it very much.
4	1381190400	Enjoyed it, laughed out loud. Great book especially if your raising small children. Makes you think and gives a bit of perspective.
5	1381104000	I could completely relate to Alice and felt that the book spoke to me (and moms all over I'm sure).
5	1381017600	I have found a new favorite author! Lunar Moriarty writes so that you fall in love with the characters. Her books always reel me right in. I find them very interesting and both of her books that I read back to back have had me hooked. Now I'm off to find another!
4	1381017600	While I did enjoy this novel, and did want to put it down, I felt it was tiresome at times as well.  The idea of the main character forgetting everything about her life is very intriguing.  I was frustrated with the way the other characters handled this situation though.  I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers, so I'll be vague...no one seemed to be willing to be open with Alice and help her understand.  And I can't understand why they were all so reticent to converese with her.  I didn't really like the ending...would have preferred another one instead.  The ending was abrupt and too perfect.  Life is not perfect though.  Like I said, I'd have preferred it to end much differently!
5	1381017600	A quick read that keeps you interested and anxious to see where the story takes you.  Easy to identify with the characters and their relationships.
4	1380931200	This is the kind of book that becomes your new best friend. The characters are that real, you want to get to know them and go through all the challenges of joy and sadness as your life  parallel theirs.I really did not want this book to end. It was a bittersweet goodbye to these people who seamlessly entered my life. Maybe you will feel the same, but even if not its a good way to pass the time. I envy you the first read of this novel.I Highly recommend What Alice Forgot by this talented writer. I plan on reading more from Ms Moriarty.
5	1380931200	Made me really think about how we change, and we don't notice it how we lose track of who we are
4	1380672000	After reading the Husband's Secret I HAD to get another Liane Moriarty book. In this book she very was able to make the premise of having lost 10 years memory by hitting your head - believable. It left me thinking about how much I would be surprised by if lost 10 years. It's very hard to recall the way you looked at life having not lived it.  I know I have been and am in circumstances I would have never predicted.  I also related to her confusion about what could possibly ever make her want to divorce her husband.  The idealism you have as a newlywed is hard to conjure up after many years of life together. Very provocative.
5	1380672000	Intelligently written chick lit.  I liked it just as much as the Husbands Secret.  Very entertaining...did not want to put it down!
5	1380672000	You can really feel how it would be to lose your memory. Liane really writes extremely well and I am so thankful I found her. I've now read 2 of her other books, all just as intriguing.
5	1380672000	A long book but a quick read, What Alice Forgot is a funny yet endearing novel.  The characters are relatable  and the situations are real and familiar.
4	1380585600	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  There was a good bit of subtle humor.  What I liked best is the fact that I wasn't terrified of what was going to happen next.  Kind of like reading Maeve Binchey.  Nice glimpse into other lives and the way people deal with the things life throws at them. After reading this book I bought all her other books on Kindle and read them.  The characters were likable and very human.  I entertained myself for several days.  Nice little look at Australia.
5	1380585600	I really loved this book. The story opens with Alice slowly coming awake after falling and hitting her head at the gym. Except she has no idea why she would be at a gym since she hates exercising and she has no idea who all the people are around her that obviously know who she is. When she is asked what year it is she confidently says 1998. Except that it is really 2008. She has somehow lost all memory of the last 10 years. As far as she is concerned she is 29, happily married and in love with Nick and pregnant with their first child. In reality she is 39, mother of three children and in the middle of a nasty divorce. And she has no idea how her life got to this point.The writer does an excellent job of building the story and keeping the reader interested as the memory gaps start filling in.Interspersed with Alice's old memories and current experiences are letters from her sister Elisabeth to her therapist and letters from her adopted grandmother to her own dead fiance. While these letters do a nice job of offering some more insight into how Alice's life got to this point, the side story of the letters was really not necessary.This book is definitely thought provoking. I look at everything that has happened in my own life in the last 10 years and tried to imagine what it would be like to have no memories of that time. Like most people, my life was very different 10 years ago. It also give an interesting perspective on divorce and how seemingly happily married couples can end up drifting apart and forgetting why they got married in the first place.
5	1380499200	This author is so good and I want to read all her books. So far I've read three and hope there are more. Enjoy!
5	1380499200	Another winner from Moriarty!!  Funny, sad and captivating...the intertwined storylines keep the reader intrigued throughout the book.  Once again, this author zaps you at the very end!! Enjoy!
5	1380412800	I loved this book.  It was fast and impossible to set down, yet it addressed a lot of issues and has left me thinking.  It's a book that has stuck with me through other great books, and left me a huge fan of Liane Moriarty.  One of my favorite reads.
4	1380412800	Great read.  Very well written and kept my attention.  Really is good &#34;food for thought&#34;.  I am looking forward to reading more from Liane Moriarty.
5	1380412800	This was the first book I read by this author. After this one, I went on to read two others by the author. Great story. Kept you wondering if this happened to you, how would it feel? I really enjoyed it.
4	1380412800	I liked the character Alice. There were several storylines to follow, but I liked the way everything came together at the end.
5	1380326400	Even though I purchased this book used, it came in immaculate condition. There were no tears, rips, or stains. Would definitely use this vendor again!
3	1380326400	I don't really know how to review this book.  Although extremely well written and based on an interesting premise, it really did not make for the most compelling read.  Since we all become several different people over the years, I fail to see the whole point here.  I really had trouble getting through this and, when I finished I couldn't help wondering "So What"  This was certainly not this authors best!
5	1380240000	I just like the whole theme of the book.  It makes you kind of reflect on the person you have become in your lifetime and do others see you as you see yourself.
5	1380240000	Liane Moriarty has a way of making the characters become real. She paints a realistic picture of what a person feels when going through the circumstances of life. Excellent plot. Gives the reader a lot to think about. I would highly recommend this author.
4	1380240000	This is an older genre, but the story line is believable this could happen to any of us.  Tragedy but in the light of tragedy there is hope, that is what I liked.  The light at the end of the tunnel and great story to read at your own pace.
5	1380153600	This was a great book.  This author has become one of my favorites.  She writes multiple narrator's flawlessly.  I found myself routing for 1998 Alice the whole way!  And the ending was perfect.  I highly recommend this book!  Also, you should def read her other book "My Husband's Secret"  Great read as well! :)
5	1380153600	I am in love with Liane Moriarty!!No kidding!  I started by reading the Husband's Secret. Then the Hypnotist Love Story.Her writing in completely enchanting and fresh.  She explores different lives and puts them together without any gaps in the story line. I recommend her 100% to whoever wants to read good books with amazing characters, some suspense, and truly excellent writing.
5	1380067200	Love this author --- I read the Husbands Secret and then all the rest of her books -- her characters suck you right in.  Love!
4	1380067200	I really loved this book. I love how this author makes you think. About how precious life really is & how your choices can have so many outcomes.
5	1380067200	Once I got to the part that Alice got her memory back I automatically stopped reading because I was really leaning towards her and Nick getting back together..but then I started reading again and finished it and it ended exactly how I wanted it to. I love love love great endings.
4	1379980800	This is one of those books that makes you put yourself in the character's place. It also helps you remember to be grateful for what you have.
5	1379980800	hard to put down. Not quite as good as &#34;The Husbands Secret&#34; but close. The characters are like friends. A good read.
5	1379808000	What Alice Forgot is funny and heart-wrenching at the same time.  A very good look at how we cope with the tragies of our lives.  I have never been one of those who want to go back in time and relive (and possibly revise) moments, but Alice's return to an earlier time in her life is a fantastic affront to those family members who expect so much of her.Very good and though provoking.
3	1379808000	I liked the book. It was a decent read, but sometimes I felt like it was a little disorganized and some of the plot was built up without a better ending. It definitely made me think about what it would be like to lose 10 years of memory and how different it could make you.
4	1379808000	This book makes you think about how different experiences, situations, and relationships can shape and change your life-for better or worse.  I like thought provoking books. Liane Moriarty does this in What Alice Forgot and also in The Husband's Lies.  I would recommend both books, as well as Three Wishes. She is a gifted writer with a great  imagination.
5	1379808000	Liane Moriarity is a delightful writer. I laughed out loud as I read this book.Funny ,poignant , very real .  Imagine waking up one day remembering all your hopes and dreams from youth, without all the real problems of life.  What do you do?
4	1379721600	but the end  seemed a bit preachy. It's well written, an interesting way of looking at how we change over time - and one of my favorite themes, how getting what you wish for can go wrong.
5	1379635200	I love the way Liane Moriarty writes and this book was no disappointment. You get involved with the characters and feel for them.I didn't want the book to end.
5	1379635200	What a surprising and fun read! I give this book five stars and more, because it has everything you could want in a novel! Liane Moriarty includes it all...comedy, drama, romance, mystery, and pure emotion. It will make you laugh, cry, and contemplate the "what ifs" to figure out what exactly has taken place in Alice's life. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
4	1379548800	The beginning was slow and boring for me, and if I had not paid for it I MIGHT have put it down. Luckily, after about 50 pages it became really good. The whole time I was wondering what was going to happen next. The last few pages were my favorite. I might even add this one section (and if you read you will know)to my quotes. This book made me really think about what I would feel like if my husband or I forgot 10 years of our lives. We have been together 8 years so that is a terrifying thought. I like the little bits and pieces of story told from Frannie (grandmother) and Elizabeth (sister). It wasn't necessary, but I enjoyed it. This book sounds like the authors best piece of work so I prob. wont read any of her other previous books, but I will keep a look out for future books.
5	1379548800	First book I read by this author and I am now reading all her books. I love her writing style and so far love all her books
4	1379548800	I really enjoyed this book.  It is well written with a good story line. I liked the characters - they felt real. I did feel the sister's story line was too dragged out and long - got it. Otherwise good read
5	1379548800	Loved it! It was a page turner and I really like this author. Iwould recommend her other books too.
2	1379462400	I had just read Liane Moriarty's book &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, which I really enjoyed, so I was excited to find a new author I liked.  I ordered this and was eager to dive in.  I had found the &#34;Husbands Secret&#34; to be a great beach read, light enough but also complex enough to be really GOOD beach reading.  I was really disappointed in this title.  It starts out with an interesting premise, a woman who has lost memory of the last ten years of her life, but it never develops enough character or tension to make me really care.  Good fiction has to get you interested in the character and has to set up a core dilemma early.  While obviously the loss of memory is supposed to be the core source of tension it either isn't strong enough or the author just goes into too much chatty detail to keep the readers interest, my interest at least.  Also we learn that she has a sister, and the sister's narrative is interwoven into the book in the form of letters to her shrink or someone of that ilk. For me the letters were just boring.  About 25% of the way through the book, I decided I just didn't care about either of them.
2	1379462400	I'm sure if I enjoyed books like this, then I would have liked it, but I don't.  It's no fault of the author, the book is well written, just not my cup of tea.
5	1379376000	Fun and interesting read.  There are a few good story lines going on at the same time, one of them will certainly make you think about your own life and how the story relates!  Interesting to read the different perspectives on having kids/trying to have kids.
4	1379289600	I liked how it made you realize that you need to stop and remember what you love about a person and forget all the little things that drive you crazy.
4	1379116800	Would life be different for all if we lost the memory of ten years? Would we think twice on how to live our life?
5	1379116800	This is one of those books that I just couldn't put down. Suspensefull,  and a love story all in one captivating story.
4	1379116800	Funny and fast read. You just want to keep going until all the pieces of Alice's life falls into place. Looking forward to reading more of Moriarty's books.
5	1378944000	I like the way the book brought everyone together like 100 degrees of seperationSupposed to write 11 more words so this is how I'm going to do it.
5	1378944000	There was something so gripping about Alice's struggle from page one. I knew she'd forgotten something monumental, something so difficult to stomach that remembering it would bring her to her knees, and as she remembered I felt every part of myself clenching and bracing as if the pain was my own. Moriarty captures extraordinary life moments so well, I feel like I am connected to the people in her stories. She is not afraid to explore the things we keep to ourselves, and I think that's one of the things I love most about her books.
3	1378944000	This book was a book club read, it was interesting and had a good story line but seemed to fall flat at times. The ending was different and not predictable like a lot of books. I hear there is supposed to be a movie made about this book. Hopefully the movie will be better than the book.
3	1378857600	This was a pleasant, light book. I enjoyed it but it wasn't great literature. Five more words are required but I can't think of that many.
4	1378771200	A good read for women.  Alice falls off a spin cycle and loses a decade of her life.  She thinks she is pregnant with her first child when she actually has three and she doesn't remember that she and her husband are going through a divorce.  There is a surprise twist at the end.
5	1378771200	One of the most intriguing books I've ever read! It's fun, interesting, can't put it down. I would recommend to anybody!
5	1378684800	This is my second book by Liane Moriarty and I must say I have become a fan.  I read the book very quickly because I just couldn't put it down.  It's like I had to know what was happening next.  I love stories like that!  I know many others have given a proper synopsis of the story so I won't waste time repeating but I recommend "What Alice Forgot" and truly enjoyed it.  I will admit that I did not really "get" the letters to Phil or see the point.  For me that portion could have been left out and never missed.  Thank you Ms. Moriarty for a very enjoyable read!
5	1378598400	What Alice Forgot is a wonderful read, especially for us 40-something's that need to reflect on the busiest years of our lives.  Very emotional and thought provoking!
5	1378598400	Really good book. Makes you wonder what a bang on the head can do. Can't wait to read another book by Liane.
4	1378598400	Book was an easy read.  I enjoyed it from start to finish and have downloaded another Liane Moriarty book on my kindle.
5	1378512000	Great I seem to sense the independence of British authors ( in general) very current setting up to dateFelt the heroine grin and pull herself up by the bootstraps.
5	1378425600	I loved the characters.  The story was never boring with some twists.  I would confidently recommend this book and look forward to reading other books by Liane Moriarty.
4	1378339200	Interesting premise and a surprise to the end. Kept me hooked. Look forward to reading more of this author. Thank you.
4	1378339200	I've been wanting to read this book for awhile. I did enjoy it very much, and read it in just a couple days. Loved how it made you think of how we change our perspectives over the years. Think it would be a great book for a book club discussion.
5	1378252800	loved this book. best book ive read in a while. i could not stop reading . i will immediately read the authors others
5	1378166400	It feels like Liane Moriarty writes just for me and &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; is wonderful.  Alice is a suburban Australian mom who's completely caught up in the day-to-day of being &#34;perfect&#34; - to the point where her marriage is ending and she's completely spent.  A head injury (at Spin Class!) causes her to forget the last 10 years of her life and takes her mind and her heart back to a less complicated time.  Everything about this book was immensely satisfying.  I've been singing Liane Moriarty's praises since I read &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, five books ago.  Moriarty's skill lies in her ability to tell a different story every time - there's nothing formulaic about her books.
5	1378166400	This book was great!  So many nuances to identify with. The story was well written, captivating, and enjoyable.  The reader will find any way to hide the laundry and dishes just to capture a few more pages.
4	1378080000	I loved this book, and I really liked Alice's voice. The main story was compelling, but sister and grandmother's stories, in my mind, were not. They felt a bit like filler, almost as if the author needed to make the book multigenerational or multi point of view or something. Delving more deeply into Alice's world would have been more satisfying, but it was still a very compelling and enjoyable read.
5	1377907200	I don't often cry while reading but boy this story has so many unexpected sentimental moments I should have had tissues at the ready! I fade The Husbands Secret prior to this and was so in love with the authors style decided to try this one. Loved it as much as the first.
4	1377820800	Interesting characters. Was a book club choice and we all liked the book. Recommend for women; not a guy kinda book.
5	1377820800	I could not put it down!!  This is a great book and a quick read!  One of my book club's favorites!
4	1377734400	Hilarious and a fun easy read.  Great ending, not too predictable.  Makes you look inside yourself and examine who you are now with who you thought you were going to be.
5	1377648000	I could not put this down.  Such a great read and really made me think about my life and my life 10 years ago.  Very good book.
5	1377561600	Kept you hanging until the end, thought you knew what was going to happen and then it took a twist.
4	1377475200	My hairdresser recommended this book and it was a cute beach read.  I won't give it away but I wasn't thrilled with the ending but the story had a great concept and was enjoyable.
5	1377388800	This story of a woman trying to figure out how she ended up the way she did after just 10 years was fascinating. It made me think of who I was 10 years ago and how I might react if this happened to me. The author captures the journey so realistically and we get to see all sides of the story and how the characters ended up the way they are now.
4	1377216000	There were aspects I didn't like, but overall this was a good read. The storyline was very interesting, but the book can be jumpy and confusing so pay attention.
5	1376956800	I loved this book! A quick read and a great story. It's also a great book club discussion--what would you do if it happened to you!
5	1376956800	I gave this book 5 stars because I really enjoyed it. Alice is unforgettable even she has forgotten the past 10 years of her life.
5	1376870400	I loved this book.  The struggles Alice and Nick face are very real in this book and so is their love.  It is a journey that you can learn from if you let yourself.
5	1376784000	This book really makes you reflect on your own life.  There were many parts of the story that made me think of my own life. I really enjoyed reading this book.
5	1376697600	I loved this book. I loved the story, the way it was written, I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend this book!!
5	1376611200	as a 30 something with 2 1/2 kids and a husand, i often find myself wondering what life will be like in 10 or 20 years.  Am I really headed down the right path?  This book looked at real life in a humorous but REAL way.  I couldn't put it down!
5	1376524800	was a good book to read - interesting and kept me wanting for more.easy quick read in a night
4	1376524800	This is total fluff and just the right thing for a day at the beach.  No heavy thinking is needed;-)
4	1376352000	I really enjoyed the book. It's a light summer read with some seriousness. The mystery of what Alice forgot provided enough suspense that I wanted to know what happened. By the end of the book, it just felt real to me. As a married mom of 3, I connected to the ups and downs of the character.
5	1376352000	I read this on vacation and tore through it in a few days.  Quick read, kept your attention.  You are rooting for Alice and her relationship and it makes you think about how different you were 10 years ago or how different you may be in the next 10.  I would definitely recommend this one.
3	1376265600	About a woman who lost her memory.  I have gotten away from reading this type of book and it's the first one I have read in long time.  It was recommended by someone who is in a book club.
4	1376179200	Not exactly literature, but this book provided a nice opportunity for a brain reset whilst on holiday.  What mother with older children has not looked back and wondered how her life has evolved?  It was a nice ah to regain some perspective.
5	1376179200	I thought this book was great. It makes you take pause and try to remember back to those original days early in your marriage when there was so much possibility. It makes  you realize that life comes along and chips away at that happy feeling little by little and before you know it you have gotten 10 years in and forgotten why you were so excited to begin with. I love the way the author handled the ending too. Great book if you want to do a little introspection and read a good story at the same time.
5	1375833600	Couldn't put it down. It is very easy to relate to Alice and Moriarty kept me guessing through the whole plot. I highly recommended this great book!
5	1375833600	Great book. I hard the hardest time putting it down.  A reminder to slow down and recognize your own life
4	1375660800	This book kept me interested by dangling the relationship outcome in front of me.  I was dying to know if they work it out or not.  I would recommend!
3	1375488000	Hard to relate to the characters.  Never makes the conflict source very clear.  Interesting story line.  Not much development or movement in the story.
4	1375401600	I enjoyed this book.  It was a quick read, hard to put down and an enjoyable story.  The main character looses her memory, 10 years of her life, and is a nicer person.  She is in the middle of going through a divorce, but doesn't remember it and only remembers how great her husband is and how much she loves him. Without ruining the plot, other characteristics she developed over the years, disappeared and she was suddenly a more warm person.  Eventually, her memory comes back and you have to read the book to see if she learned anything from her medical experience.  I know it made me reflect on the person I was ten years ago and how life's issues tend to change us (not always in the most positive ways).  Overall, a very enjoyable book, one that makes you think after you have finished it.
4	1375401600	I couldn't put this book down, attempting to piece the story and eager to receive the next piece of the puzzle!!  Fast, witty, and entertaining read.
5	1375315200	This book kept me interested from the beginning to the end. It was funny and clever and had a nice little twist to it.
2	1375228800	Good but ending predictable- good beach read.  Would recommend for just that type of leisure reading.  Friend recommended to me.
4	1375142400	This was an intriguing book that makes you think what it would be like to lose your memory.  It seemed repetitious in parts, but all-in-all a good book.  I enjoyed reading it.....
5	1374883200	Nice story.  Page turner.  Hard to put down.  Highly recommend it !!!  Kept my interest for the first page.  Thoroughly enjoyed it !!
4	1374883200	Hmm...I found this book to be very interesting. The whole idea of forgetting 10 years of your life. I do think that for Alice, it was a good thing. I liked younger Alice better, she was a little more carefree and a lot less stressed. It also really helped her to get a better perspective on her life in the present. The book does read at a slower more rhythmic pace, so you if are looking for a funny, witty, face paced, chick-lit book, this is not it. It is more of a reexamining of life, making you think book. Are you where you want to be in life? Are you where you thought you would be ten years ago?Will Alice's memory of the last ten years come back? Will Alice and Nick get back together or stay apart? Read the book to find out.I read this for book club and I can definitely see us getting a good discussion out of this one.
4	1374710400	I oved this book. It kept me engaged from start to finish. I liked her writing style and loved the story.
1	1374710400	This book was so under whelming! I wish I could get my money back because it was not worth the $10 I paid for it. I read the sample first and I was hooked but after that I was just so disappointed. I ended up scheming through it just to finish it.
5	1374624000	Simply put, by more than one character in the book, "what would I think of myself if I woke up with no recollection of the last 10 years"? Gets you thinking, maybe even a bit inspiring to make some changes.
5	1374451200	This book was so hard to put down! A great story of a woman's life of being a mom, wife, daughter, sister and friend and her attempt to recall the last 10 years after an accident.
5	1374364800	I love this book. Another terrific page-turner with well-drawn, interesting, and sympathetic characters. I get the idea that this is considered chick lit, but maybe it&#8217;s just that it doesn&#8217;t have enough U.S. exposure (the writer is Australian). Anyway, it&#8217;s not chick lit; it&#8217;s more of a well-written psychological thriller with all loose ends tied up nicely. The author seamlessly juggles and exposes the past and present lives of several characters, and does so with ease and talent; it&#8217;s nothing short of brilliant. A woman bumps her head and forgets ten years of her life. Of course, it made me try to imagine what that would be like. Emotionally, you&#8217;re the optimistic and care-free self from the old days instead of the responsible, loving mother of the present. Imagine suddenly having to raise three children who are complete strangers to you! And imagine how much your relationship with your husband and sister would change over 10 years, and how weird it would be when you&#8217;re emotionally thrown back into the good days (where you&#8217;re happy, hopeful, poorer, and childless) and they are of course in the very different and complicated present day (where you&#8217;re sterner, more skeptical, richer, and childful)&#8212;and of which you know nothing. They are treating you so differently and you have to suddenly wonder, who IS this person that I apparently have become? And what has happened to the people I love?&#8212;they are older and sadder and madder. They relate to you as the person you really are in the present, but emotionally you are no longer that person but an earlier version of her&#8212;more innocent and hopeful&#8212;and you are confused and don&#8217;t know how to act. It&#8217;s a super interesting idea and the author works it with brilliance. I want to check out more from this writer. Highly recommend.
5	1374364800	I've been waiting for this book to become available in our local library!  It took forever, but it was worth the wait!  I enjoyed the book immensely.  It was an easy read and I enjoyed how the book ended.
5	1374278400	As I read this book I couldn't help but reflect into my own marriage. It's funny how sometimes fantasy mimics reality. This story was absolutely wonderful, thought provoking and heart warming. The characters seem like neighbors or possibly friends or even yourself. I wouldn't call it a happy ending but a real ending. I think it begs the question for the married reader: if you lost the last ten years of your life, would you want to remember?
5	1374192000	It was difficult to put this book down.  It was an outstanding story.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading a good book.
5	1374192000	Such a sweet book.  Makes you want to slow down and pay attention to your own life.  Stop getting caught up in everything and Savor the moment.
4	1374105600	This book was an easy read that made you really think about how your own life has changed over the past 10 years.
4	1373932800	It was better than most books as it had a chance for the main character to self- evaluate herself and her own changes thru her growing period.We all change through life, with our spouse seeing things similarly or not.  Do we let outside people influence us.  What started out as a perfectly happy couple with a lovely family - we saw what money can do to change us to what might not really be important.Good book - in some way or another one is apt to see a bit of themselves and maybe see what is important in life.
5	1373846400	this book had you believing one thing and then turned around at the end and changed everything! a must read
3	1373846400	Well written,  sensitive and poignant.I was expecting more of a plot, but it did keep me engaged.Not a bad read.
4	1373587200	I didn't want to put it down. I have to admit though, it took me a little bit to put all the pieces together to recognize who was who.
5	1373328000	this was such a good read.  had to read it all in one day.  I recommend this book, I will look for more books by this author/
5	1373155200	This book took a while for me to get into. The beginning has very little dialog and is a parallel of the vague amnesic state Alice is in. Mid-way through the book though I was deeply intrigued by her back story, what she would find and I was rooting for specific outcomes to take place. All in all, this proves to be a very satisfying read.
4	1372982400	A friend of a friend said this book saved her marriage...maybe I could see that happening.  It for sure did make me think about some stuff.  If you've been in a long term relationship, and especially if you have kids, it will certainly make you consider some stuff.I enjoyed it.
5	1372636800	I found the story intriguing as well as I LOVED the eplilogue.  At the end of a book I frequently am left wondering how the story would continue.  I thank Liane Moriarity for giving us a glimpse on how she envisioned the furture for these characters!
5	1372636800	This is a great book for any adult-especially women in their 30's, 40's.  It really helps you reflect on life and the changes we experience over the years.
5	1372550400	Really interesting, captivating and a different kind of read.  Loved the challenge of the conflict and it's resolution even more.
4	1372550400	For any grown woman who would like to forget about past mistakes and remember life when it was good should read this book. It really gives you a sense of thanksgiving for what you truly have.
4	1372377600	This was an easy read that kept your attention throughout! It is a great vacation book!! The book is perfect for a book club as well!!
5	1372118400	I loved seeing both sides of Alice in this book. It was a good book to inspire self reflection and think if the you from 10 years ago would even recognize the you today. A great read.
4	1371945600	I like the book was different and kept your interest. I would suggest to  my friends that they might like it.
4	1371859200	A really enjoyable book that kept me reading to find out what happened next. A great beach read that I recommend!
4	1371859200	This book will make you laugh, cry and THINK about time, memories, family and relationships.  I recommend it whole heartedly!
5	1371772800	From the first page to the last I was hooked on Alice's story. The topic itself was simply. Girl loses memory.. But the way she told the story was brilliant. As a mother, I related to this story and the complex nature of motherhood, marriage and life. I recommend this book to anyone  who is married with children and juggling the everyday stresses.
1	1371686400	this seems to only charge my iphone 4 and not the 4s or ipad, and then does so really slowly (like overnight to get back up to 100%).  I'm annoyed.
5	1371340800	I loved this book. Great story, well done, made me think about my own life. I would read another book by this author.
3	1371340800	Took awhile to get rolling, but I really liked to look at life from a wife's perspective of her younger self.
5	1370736000	Loved it!  Kept me hooked from beginning to end.  I like the way the author intertwined writing from the sister and grandmother within the story.  Had some nice twists.
5	1370563200	Makes you consider what is important in your life!  Great book and would highly recommend to anyone!  I loved it!
5	1370304000	When Alice Love falls down in spin class and hits her head, everything in her life is seemingly turned upside down.  For once she is in hospital, she realizes that a large chunk of her life is missing...kaput.Memory is a strange thing.  Sometimes it is distorted, and it definitely is different for people living the same moments.What Alice Forgotreminds us that perspective is a large part of memory, and each person's reality is different.Finding those lost ten years that she has forgotten, supposedly due to that blow on the head, Alice also rediscovers who she is.  Is she the person she was at 29...or at 39?  Or is she a better version of herself because of the experience?Meanwhile, what a great ride this story was for me.  I loved how I found myself right in the middle of Alice's world, rooting for her and for the lost connections in her life.  At times I couldn't stand her three children, especially Madison, who seemed unusually annoying.  And Nick was not a favorite of mine either.  But as the pieces began to slowly come together and the last ten years were filled in, it was possible to understand everything that had happened to them and how it all changed.I loved the part of the story where Alice philosophizes about how it is very easy to love in the beginning of a relationship, when everything is light and bubbly, but that anyone can love like that.  The kind of love that has gone through things and moved beyond them is a special kind of love that "deserves its own word."Another part of the story I enjoyed was Alice's sister Elizabeth's journey to motherhood.  Infertility and those struggles seem to define her.  Her perspective is revealed through letters she writes to her therapist.And Frannie, the grandmother-surrogate who was there for Elizabeth and Alice as children is sharing stories of her life through letters she writes to her fiance Phil.  We learn more about him later....Beautifully wrought characters that felt so real they earned our love, our hatred, our annoyance...just like people we have known and loved to hate.  Five stars.
1	1370044800	I didn't finish this book as I lost interest so can't say more. Moriarty does write well but the central characters weighed me done.
5	1369872000	I enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down, many ups and downs and easy to get into the main character and find out things as she did after her accident.
4	1369872000	Though quite predictable and not always the &#34;smartest&#34; story, What Alice Forgot will keep your attention. Great book for the beach or a plane.
4	1369699200	It really made me wonder what it would be like to lose your memory, forgetting the bad things that have happened & thinking that would be a good thing.  I liked the book because I couldn't t figure out how it would end...until the very end!
4	1369526400	This book was a very interesting concept of a woman forgetting the past 10 years of her life. Some of the minor details didn't add to the story, but it was a thought-provoking read, nonetheless.
5	1369094400	Couldn't put it down. I was sad when it ended. I have recommended this to So many people.  Such a good book, especially for all of us busy moms who get lost in everything we have to do everyday and how easy it is to lose sight of your relationships. I highly recommend.
5	1368921600	This book has 459 pages, but it was such a fast read.  I was rooting for the main characters, hoping everything would turn out ok.  I don't understand why some reviews call it funny.  I didn't find it funny. It was thoughtful and poignant.  Very interesting characters and situations.  A pleasure to read.
4	1368662400	I enjoyed the book. The idea of losing your memory for the last 10 years was appealing. I also thought the way the author showed how three women deal with stressful issues was interesting.
5	1368403200	I was surprised how it drew me in from the beginning. I was afraid it was going to be a gloomy book but it wasn't. I couldn't put it down. Just loved it!!
5	1368403200	Was a really fun novel to read and loved the message.  Thought it spoke volumes.  Was a quick and easy read.
4	1368230400	It makes the reader stop and think about how he/she may have personally changed over the years...and whether or not its a good thing!
4	1367452800	A friend recommended this book, and I am so glad I took her advice. I can usually tell in the first chapter if a book is going to be for me or not. This book was true to that rule. Going on the journey with Alice to put the pieces of her memory back together made for quite a page turner. A fun easy read.
4	1367452800	Great book.  Holds your interest throughout the book.  I had wished for a different ending, but still a good read.
5	1367193600	I can't imagine what it would be like to lose memories from the past 10 years.  Getting to know the &#34;old&#34; Alice and the &#34;new&#34; Alice is interesting.
4	1367107200	Interesting plot that gets you thinking about your own life. What if you woke up one day and the events of the last ten years are gone from your memory?It was fun trying to figure out what had led to the break-up between her and her husband, which man she was going to choose in the end, and whether she'd actually like the children she didn't even remember giving birth to.
4	1367107200	This is one of those books you won't be able to put down once you start for sure. Extremely entertaining...you are learning about the main character's life as she is since she has amnesia. It makes for a really intriguing read right from the start. Unlike many, however, I thought that the author dropped the ball a bit at the end. It felt like to me one of those &#34;Season Finales&#34; where the show was cancelled and they had to wrap everything up too quickly. I don't want to give away the story so I won't say any more than that, other than the quality of the end was very different from the quality at the beginning.
4	1366934400	This is an interesting story that looks at the expectations we have for our lives and the reality of how things actually work out. It was entertaining for an easy read and although I did not care for all of the plot I would recommend it to friends.
3	1366848000	The book was okay. Gets pretty good towards the end, couldn't put it down. It is an Easy read, and I enjoyed it.
1	1366675200	This cord does not work. The connection at the top that plugs into the phone has a short in the wiring. Not sure if they are all this way or not but would not charge my phone.
5	1366588800	We actually purchased two of the larger Hugglepod deluxe swings directly from HearthSong.  I have a 9 year old and an 11 year old both with sensory issues and it's been fabulous.I was back and forth between the two, but I'm really glad that I chose the larger swing.  There is plenty of room for them to grow into it and it's still very cozy and womb like.  Anytime my kids are getting hyped up it's out to swing we go!Second, after reading about all the ripping, I decided not to hang the swing without a swivel hook.  I purchased a safety rotational device for $29.00 and it works beautifully.  I am hoping that this will avoid any troubles.They've been up for a few weeks and so far we LOVE them!
5	1366588800	This was a book club selection. Everyone in the club enjoyed it. It is a fast read with humor & making one realize what is really important in life.
4	1366329600	i totally got this book, i totally get how you can fall intothe ideals of a community and forget what you truly wanted and worked forwhen you were planning your life...how all of that gets put on the back burner when trying to keep up with the &#34;neighbors&#34;
4	1366243200	Well written story flows so well you are just lead to  read on, definitely worth the read! Will read more by Liane
5	1365984000	I wasn't used to this style of writing but once I got the characters strait I was totally hooked.  Alice falls off a bike in a &#34;spinning class&#34; and hits her head. When she wakes up, she thinks she and her beloved husband, Nick, are pregnant with their first child.  Actually, she is not 29, she is 39, has 3 children, that she doesn't remember, and she and Nick are on the verge of a divorce.  When the fist side story was introduced I wondered who this Elizabeth was and why she was writing &#34;homework to her Dr.&#34;  (Basically journaling to her shrink.)  I wondered what I missed and paged back.  Just keep reading!  The author sort of backs you into characters. (For lack of a better description.)  For example,  there was a side story about Elizabeth writing this &#34;homework&#34; for a couple pages.  Then it goes back to Alice and Alice says she was very close to her sister Elizabeth and wondered why she wasn't coming to the hospital to see her.  That's how you find out who that Elizabeth is.  So just keep reading.  After you figure out the style of writing the story just flows but keeps you wondering.  I couldn't put it down and read until the Kindle dropped out of my hands because I couldn't keep my eyes open any more.  I liked the side stories about the sister and mother and the developement of each character.  It  was thought provoking while Alice is trying to balance the free spirited 29 year old she feels like and the reality of her life at 39.  It led me to examine priorities and my participation in relationships.  I loved the twist at the end.
5	1365984000	Loved the author's writing style, and was kept guessing from start to finish. The characters were relatable and The ending did not disappoint.
4	1365897600	perfect for 40+ women....easy fun read; makes you reflect a bit...not exactly &#34;literature&#34; but a fun read nonetheless.  Good vacation read.
4	1365638400	These are very adjustable to fit any size, I bought for my toddler and they fit great ! I haven't listened to sound quality, but that's not too important for a little one.
4	1365465600	Enjoyed reading, kept my interest. Have read a few books with the same premise. Thought all the characters were believeable.
4	1365465600	I did not care for this novel  in the first half of book but it definitely got so much better the second half -I couldn't put book down!!
5	1365379200	Entertaining, provocative! How we change and adapt yet keep what is dear & necessary.  A great read leaving you wanting more!
4	1364947200	This book was chosen for my book club. I initially worried it would be predictable chick lit....but I was wrong. Moriarty gave the opportunity to become invested in the characters and created a great story I could not put down.
4	1364860800	Its an interesting perspective on memory loss and life's progression.  Makes you stop to consider your own life and the different directions that are possible.
5	1364774400	This is one of those books that you don't want to put down.  I couldn't wait to get back to reading it.  Highly recommend it.
4	1364774400	Amazing tale. What if it happened to me!  A good read.  Why do we let like get so complicated. This makes you think
5	1364688000	I thought this book would be a chick lit but it is not.  it really makes you reflect on your life and how much you have changed over the past ten years.  How life makesnyou turn hard. It makes you reflect on your past friendships and what is truely important in life is your relationships.  Great book highly recommend it.
5	1364601600	Alice forgot it all, but after reading this book I know I won't forget any of it :) great read!
3	1364428800	I forgot what the book was about, I can't remember a damn thing about it.I'm thinking....no stil nothing.  Sorry.
4	1364428800	I ended up really liking this book, not loving it.  As a mother if 3 children, married for 14 years and 40, a lot of it rang true.
5	1364342400	Thought provoking, could-not-put-it-down sort of book. I found myself discussing it with my husband each night or with my father on the phone. I absolutely loved it.
5	1364256000	Wow, what a novel (ha-ha) idea for a story.  It was funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.  My husband and I spent sometime talking about what it would be like to live through this type of experience.  I found myself thinking about the story line frequently during the time I was reading the book.  To me, that indicates I'm very involved-a good feature for a novel.
4	1364083200	I liked the book, liked the premise, and I also like a book that has drive- what's going to happen?  I would recommend it.
5	1363737600	Just plain amazing. I was captivated throughout the book!!!!  What a brilliant writer and beautiful characters that evoked so much emotion from the reader!!!!
5	1363737600	This book makes you think about the choices you make in life and how to treat the ones you love.  Quick read - keeps your attention to the very end!
3	1363651200	I was hooked at first. Then I got confused. The book became a story when the husband came into play. It was just okay.
3	1363478400	The book took a bit to get into. I actually put it down and came back weeks later to finish. When the book was finished, I did enjoy it.
5	1363392000	I was hooked in the first paragraph.....I hated putting it down as I wanted to just keep reading it.  Very well written.  Very enjoyable.
5	1363219200	I can't stop thinking about this book.  It's the best I've read in a long time.  Loved the underlying messages in all 3 separate stories.  It's one I'll reread for sure...and I haven't reread a book in decades.
4	1363219200	This is a touching love story with a happy ending. The characters experience highs and lows just as we do.
4	1363046400	Good book for book club too.  Those of us in our 40s-50s could really relate to the book in many ways, and it was very thought-provoking.  Great discussion material and a good read.
4	1362960000	The book was good.  It was recommended by my book club so it was not a book that I would have picked out independently, but I did enjoy it. I did not give it five stars because I could not really relate to the main character.  This is the kind of book that moms and housewives would love, but I am neither.  Worth the read though.
5	1362873600	If you're in a hurry. If you're feeling bitter and angry. Stop, slow down, and read this book. Here's to remembering.
5	1362787200	Couldn't put it down! Made me think about how I would feel in that situation. It was a great book!
5	1362700800	I read this for a book club and couldn't put it down, I read it in three sittings.  I kept wanting to read to find out what happened next and wanted to know if Alice would get her memory back and I had to know who she ended up with at the end.  It was a excellent easy read.
3	1362700800	There was a lot to skip over as it was the emotional decline of a barren sister.  However, an interesting view of a second chance at marriage.
5	1362528000	I found this a very interesting story.  Well written.  It kept my attention, but was nicely light-hearted.  I was happy with the ending.
3	1362441600	I found the idea of this book to be very intriguing,, and at first could not put it down. However, as the storyline progressed, it seemed to lose momentum. I also felt that the ending fell flat in some way, though I can't explain why I think that. I'd give it about 3 1/2 stars.
5	1362355200	One of my most recent favorites.  I am still thinking about it.  I did not think it was too long at all.
5	1362355200	It was really interesting to look at your life from the perspective of a 20 something year old person.  You'll have to read the book to see what I mean.
5	1362355200	I enjoyed the way she was able to weave the characters together in such a creative and believable way. She left you always wondering what was going to happen up to the very end. Yes, I will recommend this to my book club.
5	1362268800	This was such an interesting book and it went from before to after Alice's fall.  We discussed her family situation, friends, upcoming divorce, boyfriend and how much she had changed in 10 years.  We all liked the old Alice and were glad to see that she went back to being that person after her fall.
3	1362096000	What would I do if I woke up not remembering the last ten years? I have no idea. I don't think I would have handled it as well as Alice did.  I think the story is great very interesting at how you look at people and how your ideas of how to live can change in just one decade.I just wish the story had a quicker pace.
5	1362009600	What happens when you find out your life hasn't gone the way you planned? Every relationship you valued has changed. A woman wakes up with no memories of the last 10 years of her life, and she doesn't recognize herself.
5	1361750400	This book has made me think long after finishing it. Funny (even when the situation should t seem funny), heartfelt and Highly RECOMENDED!
5	1361664000	This book has the power to pull you into the story. You feel the emotions of the characters as if everything they experience is happening to you. I could not put the book down  I found myself thinking that the book held a message for every reader that would fit their own life story.
5	1361577600	I really enjoyed this book.  We read it for my book group and it was an interesting topic - what if you didn't remember the past 10 years of your life?  Would you recognize who you'd become?  Great book for a group of women to discuss!
5	1361491200	A page turner.  Makes you very introspective about your life.  Recommended read for all females.  A very fast read that holds your attention.
4	1361491200	This was an easy, fun read. Would recommend, especially for the beach! Also could be fun for a book club. Enjoy.
4	1361404800	When Alice forgets the past years of her life, she finds herself with unexplainable reactions by the people she loves.  Through the act if regaining her memories, she gets the opportunity to examine how things went so wrong when her expectations were so great.  This is a compelling story which allows the reader to understand the evolution of relationships ( and what it takes to turn things around.)  I rated it 4 stars, because it is an easy read, the characters are believable, and the story line sticks with you after the book ends.
5	1361232000	This was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. As a mother of two boys in my mid-forties, I was very intrigued by the plot. In addition, the story had a lot of twists and kept you guessing up until the end. I could not put this book down once I started reading. Would highly recommend!
5	1361145600	This book provided an excellently satisfying cry. I read it for book club, but would definitely read it over again.
4	1361145600	Book was kind of repetitive at first but turned into a nice story . Had a good ending. A happy ending.
5	1361145600	Excellent development of characters, the young Alice versus the older Alice and the people who were in her life the entire 10 years.  Teh sentence/thought structure is marvelous.
5	1361145600	What a great writer. I couldn't put this book down and didn't want it to end! Looking forward to reading another book written by Liane Moriarty.
5	1360972800	This was my first novel by Liane Moriarty that I have read.  I picked it up because a blog I follow was reading it.  And, I absolutely loved it.  I was so engaged in the characters I was really mad when I finished the book.  I really wish this book was a series.  A must read.  I have recommended it to several people who also loved it.  I will be back soon in the Kindle store looking for something new from Moriarty.
4	1360886400	What Alice Forgot is a delightful book that is both entertaining and thought provoking. Alice is knocked unconscious and wakes up with amnesia that causes her to have forgotten the past ten years. She does not recognize her three children and is shocked that she and her husband are getting divorced. She also does not recognize the driven, spiteful woman she has become. This book includes a lot of humor and is written in a light-hearted manner, while still making some important points about treasuring what really matters in life. It will make you ponder your own values and relationships and also provide some giggles.
5	1360800000	I really enjoyed  this book an  had trouble putting it down. Will definitely be suggesting it to my friends and family.
5	1360627200	Great character elements and easy to read style. A story that seems real page by page as if you are part of it.
5	1360627200	A funny premise leads into a thoughtful and current drama. Engaging characters and story line.reall life portrayed not too exageratedly!
5	1360627200	Best book I have read in the last year! I have recommended it to all my friends.  It has humor, compassion, and hits you in your heart and soul if you are a women between the ages of 30-60! Do yourself a favor and READ IT!
5	1360540800	Funny parts, sad parts, all around excellent! Both romantic and mysterious, each page leaves you wanting more. Easy to read, hard to put down!
4	1360454400	Easy read.. could relate to Alice and how sometimes life gets so involved that you loose your focus.  Happy ending.  Not great literature but certainly entertaining.
5	1360454400	Great gift for a busy mom who just so happens to be perpetually late by trying to fit 30 hours of stuff into a 24 hour day. All our friends want one!! As an added bonus it also keeps great time !
5	1360281600	This story grabbed me right from the first page. I experienced every emotion but mostly, it is an extraordinary reflection on second chances. This is a must read.
5	1360022400	Lovely tale, beautifully told. I couldn't put it down and now I can't wait to read more of her novels.
4	1360022400	One thing you should know about What Alice Forgot is that it takes place in Australia -- so be prepared to remember that a &#34;jumper&#34; is really a sweater and things like that.Poor Alice, she temporarily loses her mind and goes to a Spinning class. I mean, poor Alice, she goes to Spinning class, falls off her bike, hits her head, and loses the last ten years of her memory. Ten years! Ten years ago I was living in a different house, had no children, and was spending more money in gas getting to work than actually making at work. Alice realizes she, too, has no recollection of giving birth to her three children, remodeling her entire house, or beginning divorce proceedings with her previously-adored husband.The thing is, this book is a little bit fluffy. It is not an amazing literary masterpiece. But it is kind of relatable. It is easy to visualize the scene, to feel what Alice must feel, to be a member of her family, wondering what on earth is going on. I was worried the author would mess up the ending, though. Fortunately, she kept with the characters she created, and finished the story in the way each player would truly have dealt with the consequences, given their earlier thoughts and actions. Does that make sense? Strangely, this book does.Enjoyable, readable, interesting. Check, check, check.
4	1360022400	Good book; a little confusing sometimes because it flips around between the past and present but I am enjoying it nevertheless!
5	1360022400	This books sucked me in from the first page. Thought provoking and well written. I would highly recommend this book!
5	1359936000	This was a great book.  It kept me engaged the entire time, and I couldn't put it down!  I enjoyed the little twists throughout the novel as Alice rediscovered her own past.  I can't imagine forgetting 10 years of my life.  It was interesting to learn about Alice's life right along with her.It reminded me a little of Sophie Kinslla's "Remember Me" but I loved that book as well.  I recommend this for a great read!
5	1359936000	Loved this book....clever writing...funny at times and keeps you turning the page.  Just a lovely and thoughtful read!  This was the first book that my whole book club really liked.
5	1359763200	Ms Moriarty keeps you glued to the page.  The evolution of each character becomes mesmerizing.  It is entertaining and thought provoking.
4	1359676800	This was a very interesting story.  I found it to be a great read !!!  I would definitely recommend this book to a friend !
4	1359590400	Scary how this could totally happen...good book to read to gain some perspective. :-)I would recommend this book to others.
5	1359417600	Suspenseful.... and relatable on several different levels.  This was a joy to read.  I will be recommending to all my friends.
5	1359331200	This was a great book and I suffered along with the character in her memory loss.  I would reccommend to anyone.
4	1359331200	This was a light, easy read.  It was not quite a quick read because it was long at 400+ pages, but it was quite entertaining. I would recommend it to other women.
4	1358985600	I'd come across this book on several recommended reading lists online, and while the storyline sounded somewhat cheesy, all the positive chatter drove me to take a chance.Alice was a very relatable character, and the amnesia was an interesting way to show the differences between the 29 YO optimist and cynical 39 YO: a sad but all too familiar circumstance.  It was interesting to see the interactions with her family and "friends," and to learn what drove Alice and Nick apart.  Elisabeth's journal entries (her "homework") were a bit confusing initially, but portrayed the pain of infertility very well. I do feel like all the drama with Gina was a bit overdone, and when all was revealed all I could think was, "that's it?!" Finally, I liked that the ending was not just a simple happily ever after.
5	1358812800	First time I heard of this book at book club and so glad.  The experience of losing one's entire memory and ramifications of recovery - getting another chance at life..........interesting
4	1358726400	I read this in a book club because the whole &#34;forgot my memory thing&#34; sounds trite and not like a book I would choose. Well I am SO glad someone else picked this book because I truly enjoyed it and read the 350ish pages in 2 sittings. It was interesting because we found out about Alice through the eyes of her friends and family... at the same time as she was figuring out about herself. And truth be told, the &#34;old Alice before the accident&#34; was kind of a jerk. It was so interesting the whole time to wonder &#34;Will she get her memory back? Will this experience change her?&#34; I really liked what the author did at the ending. I feel like it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster, but a satisfying ending. I would recommend this book.Note: There is a strong infertility treatment/ miscarriage plot weaved throughout. As someone who has struggled through that in my life, I wouldn't have been able to read this book a year ago when we were in the midst of treatment and losses. Just a note if you're in that situation too, so you won't be caught by surprise:)
5	1358726400	This book was chosen as a  read for my bookclub. I enjoyed the characters in this book-keeps you wanting more. Can you  imagine losing 10 yrs of your life and forgetting the birth of your children?
5	1358553600	This was such an amazing story. There were so many story lines and I loved how it all tied together.
5	1358553600	I loved this book!  If you are a parent, and have given up a career or quit working to stay home with your kids, and have been married a long time, you will be able to relate to many parts of this book. Its about loss of self, of trying to gain control, of over-doing that. Parts of it (not all) were very real. I loved the way the author played situations out.
4	1358380800	This was an easy read that kept me interested the whole time and I was sorry to see it end!
3	1358294400	Interesting premise, but I just never came to care much about the characters. I'm an avid reader so I go through lots of books. This was mildly entertaining, but not on my list of books to recommend.
3	1358294400	Didn't look as much like piano keys when it arrived. The contrast was low, more black and gray than black and white. Otherwise just ok.
4	1358208000	I actually only read this because my mom accidentally downloaded it using my account...  I normally read high action stuff but I really liked this book. It was filled with some great thoughts that are so easy to relate to once you've had kids and have gotten busy in your life. I loved the method that the author employed to allow the lead character to examine what her life had become and the type of person she'd grown into. Very introspective read.
5	1358208000	To think about how much a life can change in 10 years and how to reconcile the changes you're not happy with because you're seeing them through a 10-years-younger lens...captivating!
4	1358208000	I have read several of Liane Moriarty's books, and thoroughly enjoyed them.  This is no exception.  Her characters are wonderfully developed, with depth and complexity.  She is so good at describing the subtle nuances of a person's mannerisms; she must be quite an observant and reflective person!  I liked getting to know the characters through her wonderful writing and I was easily able to relate to this book, I see this type of family dynamic going on all around me (not the amnesia part!)  Great idea for a story!
4	1358121600	This book makes you think. It makes you more appreciative of life, and perhaps not so dissatisfied, in constant pursuit...So often, a book that makes you examine yourself is not an "easy read." I found What Alice Forgot hard to put down. I recommend it highly.
4	1358121600	I enjoyed this book very much.  It was frustrating at times!  At first I really like the perspective of Alice's sister and &#34;grandmother,&#34; but by the end I only wanted to know what Alice was thinking!  The ending was a surprise to me, but I liked it!
4	1358035200	Great book.  It made me sit back and reflect on my own life.  Provided a great perspective and an easy read.
5	1357948800	Simply said; I adored this book! Makes you think about how much of your life happens in a 10 year span! And how much can change in that time frame as well. Great for book groups!
5	1357948800	LOVED IT!!!! I had a hard time putting this book down.  It was a quick read and a great book!
5	1357862400	Fantastic story that I couldn't put down! Highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed. Makes you think about your own life and how your relationships with others change over time.
5	1357776000	In simple terms, I Ioved it! It made me reflect on my relationships and my treatment of those around me. This book brilliantly warns you that mistreatment can totally change your relationships and future. Great book club book!!
5	1357603200	well written.  enjoyed it thoroughly.  great story and good romance to boot.  i think anyone who reads chick lit will enjoy it.
4	1357603200	Hard to read in the beginning, but once you figure out the characters, it's an easy read. Good story. Satisfying ending.
5	1357516800	Really enjoyed this book. Enough details to keep it interesting and make the story feel complete. Liked ho different character narratives were were written in different formats but there stories blended together so well.
4	1357430400	I found it got slow in the middle but overall it was a good book and I would recommend it.
5	1357344000	Loved this book.  A little slow at the beginning but got good quick!  I could not put it down.  Definitely a page turner.
5	1357344000	I really enjoyed reading this book.  It's a pretty simple read but you get to know the characters well and I found myself cheering certain ones on.  I like a book that gets me involved with their lives and I couldn't wait to see how it all ended.  I think it also has a great message and everyone should get a bonk on the head once in while.
5	1357344000	Dr we treat xxx the ad ad h loo r Xxx but Emma Watson said that the first place in my opinion that is played by the game and I think that the rope and I have to get out
5	1357257600	We used this book for our book club.  We have all ages in our group and all of us loved it.
4	1357257600	This was a witty, interesting story that was a very quick read. I enjoyed thinking about what it would be like to lose the last 10 years of your life.
5	1357257600	Absolutely loved it. Ending was perfect couldn't have thought of it any other way. Really liked the writing style. Great read.
5	1357257600	Couldn't put it down.  Engrossing story of the life of a marriage.  Fabulous read no matter where you are in life.
4	1357257600	Life is messy. Moriarty writes a compelling story that captures real scenarios and  plausible characters. I don't often dig deeper into the &#34;underlying issues&#34; of a story, but after reading this, I did reflect a bit on how my life would be affected if I temporarily forgot some of it.
5	1357171200	I loved this book. It made me appreciate my relationship with my husband and children.  Also I reflected about the person I was 10 years ago and the person I want to be in 10 years.
4	1356998400	I truly enjoyed reading this. It is very thought provoking book and perfect for a group of married moms to discuss. Great character development and fun ending!
3	1356739200	The book's premise - the main character, Alice, hit her head and forgot the last ten years. Her reaction to having lost her memory, and the reaction of her friends and family to a serious injury just didn't ring true. Alice, her mother, her sister, her friends and her estranged husband didn't seem all that concerned. Maybe I've spent too much time with brain damaged family! It's pretty easy to tell when a family member or close friend has lost touch with current reality. I realize that the whole book hinges on this plot structure but I found it to be too artificial to forget that I was reading a book.
5	1356566400	A good book. A great story to show how our ideas, priorities and perspectives change throughout our stages of life. I wonder what my "younger self" would say to my current self.
5	1356393600	A friend of mine read this book and suggested I read it too. It was hard to stop reading once I began. I was hooked.
4	1356220800	The book was a good quick read! A little predictable but still enjoyable. I felt compelled to keep reading to find out more of Alice`s story and read about the family dynamic between all the other family members!
5	1356048000	I really enjoyed this book. The premise was so interesting and made for some great conversations in our book club. What would you imagine for yourself in 10 years time? Everyone in the group enjoyed it. Some felt the story line dragging a little in the middle of the book. Loved the sisters realistic relationships. Great book about family relationships from moms to husbands! Going back for more from Liane Moriarty.
5	1355702400	a friend suggested i read..i enjoyed from the first page to the last .. a great fun light easy read
5	1355184000	Very thought provoking. This was recommended by my daughter and prompted some really serious discussion about life, choices and repercussions.
4	1355097600	Have had this heater for a year still going strong! use it in the bedroom over the garage for my daughter's cold room. you set it for 24 hour period which is great when you set it and forget it, I did add a small fan to circulate the air more, the room is large, and the heater is silent. looking to buy another one since the price of oil is doubled since we moved in.
5	1355011200	Great read.  Story about a woman who forgets the last ten years of her life. Will generate good book club discussions. Interesting story, well written, and a quick read.
4	1354838400	I did find this to drag a bit in places, but it was well worth the read.  This definitely makes you think about life and how our perspectives change with age.
4	1354406400	Well written characters in a sad, but lovely, story. Similar to The Vow, but with more depth.  a good, quick read.
5	1354060800	I chose this book for my book club this month and it was really good.  It had great themes and will cause you to evaluate yourself as well.  This is a quality I find most important when reading for leisure.  It is sure to spark great discussion for any book club.
4	1353974400	I found this book to be very entertaining.  The characters were great and there was some suspense to the story.
5	1353888000	I loved this book and couldn't put it down.  Real easy read! Also a good life lesson to remember what you have and not let the every day stuff get in the way.
5	1353888000	I just finished this book today, and really enjoyed it.  I'd heard it was about a woman with amnesia, and what she'd forgotten, and that it had both funny and sad parts.  As I read, there were a number of times when I thought "that could be me!"  Haven't many of us occasionally questioned how we got to a particular point in our lives, or pondered a pivotal moment, and wondered how it would affect us, going forward?What I didn't expect: This book did a great job covering grief, from a couple of vantage points. And it did so in a great way -- it's touching, but not depressing.  The book is gentle with those suffering loss, and respectful of the characters' grief.  I smiled a lot as I read, but I also felt deep empathy for when a character was struggling.  The author did a really nice job, and I would definitely read another of her books.
5	1353801600	This is a great book for women. I really connected on a few levels with the messages in the book. I highly recommend it. It is not hard to read yet it has a deep meaning and makes you think.
5	1353715200	Superb book!  Loved it!  I could relate to the characters on many different levels, but also felt relieved not to be going through what they were going through!  This book provides excitement and a real escape from the busy, chaos of my own life!
4	1353628800	I thought this book was pretty good. There were some charachters that I thought didn't enhance the story much...the grandma.  All in all I liked it though.
3	1353110400	It was just okay! I had difficulty getting into it for a few pages/chapters!! It turned out to be better than I thought.
4	1352246400	Great insightful book.  Makes a person think of how a family evolves throughout a 10 year span. I like the writing and the events that have occurred throughout the book.  At first I was leary of the length, but the book was a quick read that made me think over and over again of my own life.
5	1352073600	This story is so enjoyable and easy to read!  I was quickly wrapped up in Alice's story and the stories of her family members.  But most of all, I can't stop thinking about the bigger message- is my life what I expected it to be at this point?  Would I recognize myself if I was in Alice's position?  For a nice little story, it's had a lasting impact on me.  I definitely recommend this book.
5	1352073600	Really interesting book!  Makes you think about anger and hostility and what would happen if it was just erased from your mind, and you went back to a peaceful and happy time with another person.  Not so easy to do but worth trying!
5	1351728000	This was a really fun book to read.  I makes you think a little about your priorities.  The only downside was a few unnecessary cuss words, but it was less than 10, so that's not bad with today's society.
5	1351123200	I really liked the mystery of it.I wanted to keep reading to get to the end to find out what happens.
4	1350777600	I have recommended this book many times and everyone loves it. Easy read and well written. Couldn't put it down!
3	1350604800	I enjoyed What Alice Forgot.  It was entertaining but not great.  My book club read it last month & there wasn't a lot of discussion.
5	1350345600	This book was great and easy to follow! I read it in 2 days and have started reading all of her books! They are all great!
4	1350086400	This book held my attention all the way thru!  Lots of surprises!  Love her sense of humor. Felt sorry at times and happy at times for the heroine.  Very good read
5	1349913600	Enjoyed this book throughly.  It made me ponder what it would be like if I were to suddenly lose my memory.  It really made me think about how much my life has changed in the last 10 years, my thoughts, my ideals, my friendships, my idea of fun.  It was one of the most interesting books I have read this year.
5	1349654400	I absoulutly loved this book. It makes you stop and think, what if this happened to you.  Would you go about it the same way she did.  It makes you also remeber to slow down sometimes and enjoy the life you have.
4	1349222400	I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and kept me interested. This book is fabulous for reading groups. There are alot of aspects that can be great for discussion.
4	1348444800	Finished this book in a couple of days. Keeps you guessing and keeps you interested. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a well written, easy read.
5	1348272000	I really loved this book.  It isn't one that I probably would have picked on my own, but my book club picked it to read this month.  While it was a quick and fun read, it also had me thinking about all of the seemingly little choices I have made and how they impact life as a whole.  It will be a fun read that makes you think.
5	1347148800	I loved the concept of the story.  To be able to see whether you kept the ideals and dreams you had ten years ago made me almost wish I could remember what I had in mind ten years ago and how well I followed my dreams.
5	1346976000	I loved this book!! Made me remember my life 10 years ago. Hope I love my husband and kids now like I did then or even more!
5	1346889600	We just read this for our book club and I loved it!  Quirky characters make it enjoyable but the situation also makes you pause and reflect on your own past 10 years. I already have purchased two of her other books.
4	1346889600	Right from the beginning this book kept me asking questions for which I could not read fast enough through to get the answers. Not only was this story line enjoyable but there was also a very important life lesson it carried. One we should all hide on our hearts. How we view our lives and the people in it is very vital and life affirming. In Alice's memory loss she finds her true essence, her salvation and her purpose.
5	1346889600	I thought this book was excellent, I was completely engrossed while reading it. The characters were rich and well developed. Being in my 30's with children, I felt the book touched upon many topics to which I could deeply relate.  I highly recommend this book.
5	1346889600	I read this book, as a suggestion by one of my book club members. And I ABSOLUTELY loved this Book! I was finding that I did not want to put this book down! It was one of those books that makes you take another look at your own life. Would recommend as your next book to read!
5	1346889600	I read for leisure so I really enjoyed this book. It had the right balance of emotions, with a happy ending.
5	1346803200	I almost didn't read this book because of the mixed reviews, but I am so glad that I did! I think this is a book that every woman should read, twice if possible. What Alice Forgot opens as Alice Love falls at the gym during a spin class and loses ten years worth of memories. Instead of being a happy-go-lucky 29-year old, happily married and newly pregnant, Alice finds she's actually almost 40 with 3 children and in the process of a divorce. She also comes to find that the woman she once aspired to be isn't exactly how she turned out, which both impresses and horrifies her. Through her bout of amnesia, Alice is able to reevaluate her life through the rose-colored lenses of her youth and is given an opportunity to make some changes in her life she couldn't have appreciated without her new perspective.Many reviews I read said that this book was too long; some argued the beginning should have been cut, some argued the end. Honestly, I don't think this book would have been the same if cut in half and I thought the length was perfect. While the beginning is a little slow and it takes some time to grow attached to the characters, Moriarty does a wonderful job of weaving Alice's present-day experience in with her memories to give the reader the best understanding of how Alice is maneuvering through her amnesia. Just as Alice develops memories that are reintroduced into her life, so the reader gains a new piece to the puzzle of Alice's life. While this slow development can be frustrating, I found it necessary for telling the story.This book is powerful in that it challenges the reader to examine their own life with a different perspective. Alice is able to do this in many areas of her life that have changed, but most important is her relationship with her husband and her relationship with her sister. Without the memories of the past decade, Alice is not weighed down by the hurt and bitterness of each relationship so she is better able to meet the needs of those around her. While not all of us are given an opportunity to look at our lives as objectively as Alice, this book invites you to strip away the emotions and memories that cloud your everyday lens to see life with the optimism of youth. As I mentioned, I think this book should be read by every woman, twice if possible: once before turning 30 and again later in life. I think it will be interesting to read again when I'm older and maybe less optimistic like Alice. Hopefully I won't have to do so much damage control!Bottom Line: Every woman should read this book. If it starts out a little slow and disjointed, give it time and keep reading. While I'm very conservative about giving out perfect scores, I really think the message of this book pushes it past the 4 stars the story and writing might deserve. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;/5
4	1345334400	I enjoyed this story very much.  It was entertaining and easy reading.  The story focuses on what happens when Alice passes out at the Gym during a workout.  I liked the element of suspense and I liked the approach to the problem.  It makes you aware that emotions play a big part in decisions and that time does change us.  Perhaps we would all be able to make less emotional decisions if we thought back to how we were in the past and considered that before we made final decisions.
4	1344988800	What a nightmare to wake up and find you had forgotten 10 years worth of living. This actually happened to a person I know. She forgot she wasn't engaged and demanded to see her fiance who was married to someone else. Everyone humored her for a while but she actually never did remember it all. It was well written and a little disturbing so that makes it good.
4	1344470400	What Alice Forgot was a really fun, quick read.  One of those books that you can't put down and makes you think "what would I do in that situation". It was a book club pick and the discussion was very entertaining!
5	1343433600	This was a wonderful book with lots of emotion.  I found myself laughing out loud at times and then feeling frustration and sadness for the characters at other times.  Alice is an example of how people can lose track of what is important in life and become someone they would not like.  Sometimes it takes a shock or tragic circumstance to bring you back to understand and appreciate your blessings.
4	1343174400	This was an overall well written book.It was interesting to see how things turned out and of course she stayed with the rich guy!
4	1342483200	This was recommended by my book club, and I was a little nervous that this was be your typical "chick lit".I really liked this book. I think my only frustration was the mother and sister were so reticent to just tell her what was going on. We discussed it in my book club, that perhaps the reticence is cultural. If I was Alice I'd have sat my sister down and said "spill it all!"It was weird, going from liking the past/present Alice to not being sure if I would have liked the "future" Alice. Seeing her struggle with decisions that SHE made, and living with the implications was hard. If I think about my ten-year younger self, what things am I doing now that I would think are wrong or bizarre or go against the kind of person that I am? And what about the entangled relationships in the book? SO many points of view, it's not easy to just say "this one's right, this one's wrong!" Everyone makes decisions for themselves that affect the people around them. Ironic given that many of the characters were so self-absorbed. Can people really be so emotionally detached form each other like that in real life, especially with family members?Definitely a thought-provoking read. The ending went from being unexpected to making perfect sense. It's certainly a book I'd recommend to a friend... I'm already planning to share it with my BFF via Kindle!
5	1342396800	I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down. The characters were all believable, lovable, humorous and very genuine. Alice's amnesia was a very clever vehicle for delivering the story of the last 10 years of her life, being revealed to Alice at the same time as it's being revealed to you. It helps you to feel her frustration, her hurt and her confusion as she tries to figure out who she's become and how she got to this point. I was sad when it was over. Wished I could forget it and read it again. Get this book. You won't be disappointed.
4	1342051200	This is one of those books that keeps you wanting to read more.  I enjoyed how the story unfolded a little at a time.  I can see what some people mean when they say the story seemed to drag on.  But I think they are missing the point.  This story is like pieces of wrapped candy.  You open it one piece at a time and savor the experience and then open another....A very good read overall.
4	1341964800	Alice falls at the gym wiping the last 10 years of her memory.  When she comes to, she believes that she is 10 years younger, a much happier time of her life where she is newly married, pregnant for the first time, has a wonderful relationship with her sister and a caring best friend.  In reality, she is on the brink of divorce, with 3 children, she has lost her best friend and her sister hates her.  Image has become incredibly important to her and her identity as super mom is superficial and we find out that she has lost what she had really aspired for herself.The book is one where Alice is forced to learn what happened during her 10 year memory loss.  She has the ability to question decisions made over that decade, understand how specific events and the choices that she has made as a result, had affected her life and that of her family.  Her memory loss allowed her to gain a new perspective on what is truly important to her.  After the accident, it was clear that what she had aspired to build wasn't what actually got built.  Her new challenge was to determine whether or not she was going to continue to live her life as if the accident never occurred; or use the accident as the opportunity to change or "do over" the things that didn't turn out as she had planned.I was surprised by the ending -- as it didn't turn out as I would have expected.  However, it was a very satisfying ending.  I also found myself thinking during the book that there are many times in our lives where if we actually sat back and reflected on our values, what we really wanted from life and what was really important, that we could actually do things differently and make more course corrections.  It made me recognize how our own ego can often get in the way of what we really want in life.I thought that this book was outstanding and different.  I also loved the fact that it takes place in Austrailia.
3	1341446400	I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  It is such an interesting idea.  I thought the first 3/4 of it was good and kept me rather interested to see what all Alice would remember.  I guess I thought there would be some kind of big reveal in regards to her friend Gina, but there really wasn't.  They kept hinting at it and it never happened.  The ending was very dull and not at all what the book had built the reader up for.
5	1339459200	This is not a literary masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but I found it to be a thoroughly engaging, enjoyable and satisfying read from start to finish.  Even the secondary characters and stories were fully fleshed out.
5	1338854400	Lots of stuff that we can all relate to. An quick and easy read, but worth it. I like the way Laine gets into peoples heads!
5	1338163200	Thought provoking, interesting, well written. From the moment I started reading, I wanted to read to the end. The characters are very well developed. And the ending works.
3	1337644800	The book itself is wonderful.  I love the writing style and the story has really drawn me in.  I just wish that there had been some mention of infertility and/or pregnancy loss in the description.  It might not have been so hard for me to read those portions had I been warned about it.
5	1337472000	great plot. great characters. it has amazing twists. i enjoyed it so much... and so has everyone that i have recommended it to
5	1336694400	I found this book reviewed in a Magazine and it sounded interesting, so I downloaded it on my Kindle.  Wow what a story for anyone married 17 years with 2 kids.  Just the idea of waking up and all the history between you and your husband gone.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  Would you see him different?  Have you let the bad voice in your head change how you feel about him?  It was the book that made you put yourself in Alice's shoes and hope you like what you seen.  I was not always sure who I was cheering for, as all the characters were just nice people trying to live the best way possible.  I recommend this book to all my friends.  I always hope they got out of it what I did, how fragile relationships are and not to let the water of every day life erode away your love for your partner.  Loved this book.
3	1335744000	An interesting concept to tell a tail.  Slowly learning the back story of all the characters, along with the protagonist, kept my interest far better than 'just telling about people and events.  An interesting read.
5	1334620800	At a friend's recommendation, I bought this to read on vacation and it didn't disappoint.  I didn't want to put it down!  Made me think about my life as it is, the different paths I took and that I'm grateful how it all turned out.
4	1330041600	Author: Liane MoriartyPublished By: Adult PBSAge Recommend: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanRaven Rating: 4Blog Review For: GMTAReview:"What Alice Forgot" by Liane Moriarty was a good and long read. I found that this novel was a adult fiction that covers a lots of topics.... divorce, death,infertility, and a very dysfunctional family members. There is a lots going on in this novel, so you have to really pay close attention to what all is going on. The author was really good in the presentation of the story( in third person at some times) because in the end the story will all comes together making this novel a good story. There were three parts to "What Alice Forgot"...... the first being with Alice Love... next...Alice's sister Elisabeth and then their is the grandmother....Frannie. Each one of these people bring out the essence of the plot of the story. All of the characters of the story were really brought to life making the story very real and interesting....Nick (husband), children (Madison, Tom and Olivia) Barb, Roger, Nora, Ben Kate, Choe, Maggie, Mrs. H., Xavier, Dominick , Jasper, Gina, Mike, Sophie, Jane, Mrs Bergen, Luke and there are others that you will just have to read to find out who I missed(smile).The story starts out with a Sydney housewife, Alice falls at her gym (spin class) and hits her head and this causes her to forget the last ten years of her life. The story continues on with Alice trying to piece her life back together and then the story really takes off for lots of drama. And then the end come of the story ..WoW!I really did like the part of the story around of the making of the pie. Now I know you probably want to know about this 'Lemon Meringue Pie' and you will simply have to read this novel to find out what I am talking about. Is Alice's memory coming back?I did enjoy the humor that was all through this novel. It really kept me really liking the read. "What Alice Forgot" will definitely catch and keep your attention if you are willing to stick with the long read. I enjoyed this read because it really makes you look at your life and wonder what really is important. I would recommend this novel as a good read.
5	1329696000	This book was actually like 3 stories in one. You have Alice's story, her sister Elizabeth and her grandmother Frannie's.I loved this book. Can you imagine how you'd feel if you fainted and came to but lost the last 10 years of your life? You don't remember anything from that time. You don't even remember your own children. I think that is just simply heartbreaking.In a way you are able to have a do over in a sense if that were to happen though. You can learn what your mature personality is like. If you don't like things about your life, you can change them. It's like an outsider looking in.Time doesn't always heal all wounds but you learn to find a way to live around them. Remember forgiveness is a 2 way street.
4	1328313600	We all make mistakes and we often wish we could start over and do things differently.  Alice had that chance, albeit involuntarily - a bump in her head caused her to forget everything from  a decade ago to the present time.  Learning of current situations resulting from her present self's decisions was not at all pleasing to her younger self; and she was able to amend most of them.The story tackles serious matters about human relationships, yet the presentation was done in a light manner, with even humorous undertones.  The result is a fabulous and enjoyable read, with its life lessons making a mark in the mind and especially in the heart.
4	1322784000	I thought this book would be better than it actually was...it was very slow and boring at times. It could have done without Elisabeth's homework for her psychiatrist and Frannie's letters to Phil.
5	1322179200	I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down.  I loved everything about it. Looking forward to reading more books from the same author.
3	1320192000	Interesting story, but I found it so tedious to read!  I feel that I could have skipped at least a quarter of the book and still not missed anything.  I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I'm done!
5	1317686400	This book kept me in suspense in it's entirety.  I read it while flying and had to keep wiping the tears away from my eyes.  I think I read it in less than a week.
5	1317513600	I saw so many reflections of my own life, of my own love, of my own family and friendships in this book. You can not get through this book without reflecting on your own life and where things have gone wrong, and how you have let those experiences shape and mold you into the person that looks at you in the mirror everyday. Is that person better, bitter, wiser, jaded? Not only is the book relatable, but it is fully entertaining and hilarious. You think you have the story figured out, and you don't.  I love that!  You fall in love with the characters, even in their flaws. You feel for them and understand them. Every emotion was evoked as bits and pieces of Alice then and Alice now were revealed. It makes you want to work that much harder to maintain the bonds you have and continue to strengthen them. This is definitely an all time favorite.
4	1316476800	Like another reviewer commented, I tend to stay away from chick lit, but I really enjoyed this story!Imagine waking up and thinking you're 10 years younger, not knowing your children, your life or your soon-to-be ex-husband who despises you. Weeding through this mess is Alice, a Type A Mom if there ever was.As Alice begins relearning her life she finds some things she's not very happy about - when did she give up desserts in pursuit of the perfect body? When did she begin choosing her best friend over her husband? When did she start to hate her husband?Some strange twists (her mother marries her husband's father for example) didn't really add anything to the story for me but provided a slightly over exaggerated way to portray how different things can be in the course of 10 years. Her relationship with her sister painted a very vivid scene as they were once close but her sister's multiple miscarriages and Alice's obsessive mothering nature (among other things) drove them apart.It was an entertaining read that I enjoyed, my only complaint was when Alice refused to punish her oldest daughter for cutting off a classmate's hair! Even though Alice was recovering from amnesia, and even though her daughter had been through a lot in the past year (I won't spoil it, but her parents' divorce wasn't all she was dealing with) this is no excuse not to punish your child for something she clearly did wrong. The author should have used that situation to illustrat how the "new Alice" addressed the issue, whereas the old Alice would have just grounded her child.
5	1316476800	'what alice forgot' is an extremely absorbing story that stays with you.  from the moment alice wakes up from her fall at the gym you are just as clueless as she is as to what her life has been like for the last ten years.  you slowly learn things about her - how she went from being 29 and crazy in love with her husband and pregnant with their first child to a strict,rigid, control-freak who doesn't allow her children to eat sugar - who is told she hates the husband she is about to divorce. you see what alice was like - the funny, klutzy, agreeable woman nick fell in love with and how she ended up the way she did - which meant she just grew up.  maybe a little too much, but that is what alice learns as she regains more and more of her memory.  very well written and the side story about her sister's inability to conceive was heartbreaking and real and the other story of their "adopted" grandmother's late in life romance was funny and charming.  i loved how it kept you unsure about how things would turn out until the very end.  i highly reccomend it - very witty and fast paced.
5	1316304000	Great weekend read...  I loved the idea here, what would happen is you forgot 10 years of your life.  WOuld you be the person you thought?  Interesting, sweet, sad, touching and thought provoking.  A great read for a long lake/beach weekend!
4	1316044800	I expected to absolutely LOVE this book. It's so far from my normal reading, which is mainly Historical Fiction. I loved the premise, and I thought it was a really original idea. Unfortunately, I didn't love it, but I did, for the most part, really enjoy it.I won't summarize the plot since it's already been done here, but the beginning of the book really grabs you. We meet Alice Love just after her accident at the gym and she thinks it's 1998, not 2008. The first third of the book was awesome. Ms. Moriarty can be very funny without trying too hard, and it was amusing to see Alice try and remember what was going on, and the strange paths her brain would lead her down. After the initial fall and confusion though, things start to slow down. I was waiting and waiting for Alice to come into contact with Nick, her husband who was once the love of her life, yet now she can't stand the sight of him (or so she's being told). Well, that doesn't happen till half-way through the book.There were times when I felt Alice was acting a bit TOO young. She thinks she's 29, not her actual 39. Well, I myself am 30 years old, and some of the things Alice would say or do seemed kinda inappropriate...even for a 29 year old. She would giggle at strange times, or carry on a conversation as if she were 19, not 29. I sort of trudged through this part of the book.The last third of the book makes up for it though. The ending was great, and I loved the epilogue, which takes place 10 years after her accident. I think Alice and Nick have a marriage that is very, very common today, and Ms. Moriarty did a fantastic job of portraying a realistic view of how a couple once madly in love, can drift so far apart and grow to despise one another. How silly little incidents can pile up and pile up till they become so big that it can end a seemingly strong marriage. This was my first book by this author, but I'm definitely gonna check out her previous two novels. So, while the middle slows down a bit, I still absolutely recommend this. Overall, a really good story.
5	1315008000	A VERY good book.  Quite hard to put down. I really identified with the characters and cared what happened to them. Laughter and tears.
3	1312502400	This book was selected by my book club and will certainly give us all a lot to discuss, since we're all very busy married women with kids and social lives and activities. You can tell that the audience for this book is pretty specific. It's a timely, apt, and innovative way to present the struggles of lots of busy women who can sometimes get their priorities out of whack - but it's not going to present that audience with issues they've never considered. The book moves along at a good pace and the parallel stories of Alice's sister and grandmother provide other points of interest. If you're looking for an escapist read that transports you out of the humdrum of daily life, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a book that sharpens the focus on tensions in contemporary family life without being overly heavy, this is a nice book to check out.
3	1311638400	I saw this recommended in Reader's Digest and decided to give it a go.  Having read See Jane Run, a real page turner, I set myself up with unrealistic expectations.  I found the individual character narratives in this book a bit distracting, but it helps to view things from different perspectives.  What I really liked is how Alice related to her children when she forgot the parent rules.  I especially loved the beach scene when Madison was in trouble.  It illustrates how we cannot change the actions of others, but by changing our reaction, we can cause change.  I am fond of this book for that.  Now, I am ready for a page turner.  I'm glad I saw this book through.  I don't know that I would highly recommend this book, but I am not sorry I read it.
5	1311206400	This was really an enjoyable book. Very well written, with extremely engaging characters. The story will keep you turning the pages and sad when it ends. Throughout the book, you're rooting for the main character, almost hoping she doesn't remember. Excellent summer reading!
5	1310947200	I am what you would call a 'serious reader' who tends to stay away from the fluffy stuff however Moriaty always takes subjects that could be fluff and brings out real human beings and believable characters. She is a beautiful writer and spins a good story.  This book is perfect for that summer read on the beach or to bring out that spirited discussion at Book Club! The story is so compelling that it is hard to put down.
5	1310774400	I couldn't put this book down.  Beautifully written.  Made me reflect on how I've changed since marriage and children came along and ask myself, &#34;Do I like who I am now?&#34;
4	1309219200	I really enjoyed this book.  It's not really "chick" lit because I don't think it has the same humor although it is funny at times.  This is really a story about a man and woman who have fallen into life and out of love.  At the end of the day. they are both helped by a happy accident that causes Alice's amnesia.  Being married requires having a selective memory and selective hearing.  Alice needed that advice when she was younger.
5	1308096000	I was little concerned about the book initially because there weren't many  amazon reviews...but the summary was interesting, the price was great and I was boarding a plane in 20mins and needed a quick download and something to read.I'm a HARSH critic, and I must admit that I couldn't put it down. I read it on the plane, in the hotel, during my workshop, during dinner, and finally finished it in my hotel. It was absolutely addictive with great wit and humor. Before this book I couldn't imagine ever wanting Amnesia...but "What Alice Forgot"...makes me want to say sign me up!!!Excellent Read!
5	1308096000	My daughter won a copy of this on GoodReads before it was released and I got to read it.  I couldn't put it down.  It was such a fun story!  The author has a great sense of humor and I laughed out loud.  This would be a great book to read on the beach.  I had not read this author before and now I want to check out her other books.
5	1308009600	I LOVED this book! Super fun read.... not your traditional chick-lit book. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. Contrary to some other reviewers, I really liked the set-up where we get 3 perspectives on the story (Alice, her sister and her grandmother) - it adds an element of originality. Highly recommendable!
4	1307232000	Loved this book!  It is a great concept, well executed.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because Alice's story (in 3rd person) is occasionally interrupted by narratives from two minor characters about their own side stories.  I found them distracting.  I would have much prefered to stick with Alice's perspective.

The bubbles are much bigger and fluffier than any other bath you've had. Love. Break it up and use it in multiple baths.
