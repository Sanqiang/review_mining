5	1405123200	Just as I remembered
2	1405123200	Does not keep the bread any fresher than sitting out in the open on the counter.  Sure, it keeps the cats off it, perhaps, but that was about it.  The &#34;cutting board&#34; is too small to be very useful unless you make tiny loaves, which would be fun, but our bread-maker doesn't.  The adjustable vent is kind of offset by the fact that the box does not seal on itself, so air is always allowed to enter, regardless of the setting of the vent.  This was very unsatisfactory for our bread.
4	1405123200	this container does keep my bread fresh....does serves its purpose including the white board to cut the bread...although wished that it is anti skid because it slides easily while slicing the bread. like the adjustable opening, too.
5	1405036800	This was a serious improvement over plastic bags for me.  Loaves of homemade bread would last at best 3 days when I was storing them in plastic bags, even less if you wanted to store some higher moisture baked goods.  With this, however, I have had loaves stay fresh up to a week and the cutting board does a surprisingly good job of collecting the crumbs produced when cutting bread, as well as saving you a step by not having to get out a cutting board.
5	1404777600	I have been making bread for my husband since he is extremely limited on salt, and I have a recipe for salt-free bread. We were using old bread wrappers, but the bread stayed too moist and became moldy fast. I also make bread for myself, and I like a very &#34;crusty&#34; bread. The option of how much air to allow into the box makes this suitable for both of us (I bought two and marked one with masking tape as mine). To preserve my husband's bread even better, I put this box in the refrigerator during the summer months.
3	1404518400	This bread keeper is too small to hold a store bought 1 pound 4 oz loaf.  The quality of the box is fine.  It was just too small for what I needed so I returned it.  There was no hassle in returning it.
4	1404518400	Great keep on counter doesn't take a lot of space. Clear so I don't forget I have bread and keeps out my cat.
5	1404345600	a kitchen essential for use with breadmaker!
5	1404259200	I have had no issues with this bread keeper.  Does a great job of keeping bread fresh.  All 3 sizes of bread from my bread machine  (Panasonic SD-YD250) fit perfectly in the container.
3	1404086400	Works great 3 stars because it cracked within a week. If it were less fragile this would be a four star need to buy.
5	1404000000	Wish I had one of these bread keepers years ago. It does keep bread fresh and moist without plastic bags. As you use up a loaf push the ends together to reduce the size and air inside. Perfect for home made loaves. I keep it on my counter with a bread knife on top.
4	1403827200	For someone who bakes their own bread, this is wonderful. The cutting board and the adjustable container is a plus.
5	1403740800	Keeps the bread fresh longer.  Just love it!  So perfect for homemade bread size wise.  Highly recommend.  Love that you can see the bread since its a clear container.
5	1403740800	I have seen that the bread looks and feels good when it is in this container. whole family like it
3	1403740800	keeps crumbs off the bench. seems to be keeping bread for a reasonable time. neat, tidy appearance. would recommend this item.
4	1403654400	For the cost, this is a bit cheesy. It also didn't state on the packaging that it was BPA free.  However, it does keep the bread relatively fresh and the little holes help to keep moisture from building up (as it does in a closed plastic bag). Sometimes my bread machine bread rises up a little too high and will not fit into this container, but otherwise it works great. I don't use the little cutting board inside as I have a bread slicer with slicing guides that I prefer.I haven't seen anything else that would work as well as this, so I recommend it for anyone that wants something to use to keep bread fresh for longer, especially if you make homemade bread.
5	1403654400	I am new to the bread scene and I find this a very handy container to store bread in. It is much better than wrestling with foil or plastic wrap. I did notice that the cutting board gets some slice marks that can accumulate crumbs which will mold in the humid weather ~ I run it through the dishwasher in between loaves. Overall, I am quite happy with this item.
4	1403568000	Barely fits the bread that comes out of a regular bread maker. Other than that it has to be free to get 5 stars
4	1403568000	It really works quite well for our breadmaker bread, and I fell less guilty about throwing out the plastic bags. just wish they will have a round version
4	1403481600	I am happy that it adjust to different sizes, Store bought and/or regular breads.  The cat is disappointed and sad.
5	1402790400	Recommended by my sister.  I use to to help keep my homemade bread fresh.  I definitely see (and taste) the difference since purchasing.  My bread stays fresher much longer and bread with fruit in it doesn't get moldy (yuck!).
5	1402704000	I used to have to throw my bread away after a few days but with this it stays fresh for five days.
3	1402185600	My husband doesn't like it but I do. So, it stays. It was a bit more expensive than I would have liked.
5	1402099200	I like to bake my own bread and it is the perfect size for both small and larger loaves. Works great to keep the bread. Easy to use would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys baking bread.
5	1402099200	I just started making bread but I didnt want it to go bad to quickly. This thing fits for pretty much all loaves of bread from my bread machine so no complaints here.
5	1402012800	This breadkeeper holds a large loaf easily and keeps it fresh for long enough to eat the whole loaf. I really like the vent, which makes it possible to put the warm bread in the keeper almost immediately without getting a soggy bottom, resulting in early mold.
2	1401753600	I liked the concept, but I tried adjusting it ever which way to no avail.  I still had moldy bread in a couple of days. I tried putting it in various places with the same results.
4	1401753600	We have a big dog that can stand and reach the counter top.  Ever since we got this bread box, we haven't had to hide bread in a cover when we leave house.Only small problem is that the vent hole nob comes off too easily.
4	1401753600	What a nice plastic bread box!!! - and it is just the right size for a 2lb. loaf of Bread Machine bread.  It even comes with its own handy little cutting board and another nice feature is that it has an adjustable vent so the bread can get some air.I did not give this bread box a five star rating because I am concerned about the durability of the plastic.  What happens if I should drop it? - Will it break all to pieces if dropped?  I wish the manufacturer would have made this box using a more durable appearing material e.g. stainless steel, or a different type of plastic.
5	1401667200	I have been pleased with the results of this product.  It keeps the bread fresh and easy to clean and store.
5	1401321600	I have used this bread box for a few weeks and like it just fine. It replaced large bread bags (the kind that are supposed to keep bread fresh) but I got tired of buying more and more bags. I have a Zojirushi bread maker and this box holds a 2lb loaf easily. I haven't experimented much with the vent hole adjustment. I leave it open 1/2-1 hole and the bread has never molded or dried out. I never used the little cutting board so ended up taking it out.
5	1401148800	What more need be said? Keeps bread fresh and looks nice. I use it daily with my homemade loaves. Love Progressive products and will continue to use them:)
2	1400976000	This is a little plastic thing which you can lengthen (somewhat) or shorten by pulling both ends away from or pushing both ends towards each other. I would definitely put bread in secure plastic or some type of packaging inside, because this does not seal.
5	1400889600	This is a great way to store bread.  It keeps the bread as fresh as any bread storage container can; and because of its design, the size of the thing can be adjusted (very easily, almost unconsciously) as the bread gets eaten and smaller.  Its design lets you save on counter space;  it's unobtrusive, light, and does the job of keeping a loaf of bread fresh.  It is however, as some reviewers have observed, made of very thin flimsy plastic, so this is not a container you can beat around.  If you want something heavy duty and sturdy, this is not the bread keeper for you; but for my household, it works very well.  Another slight problem is that it does not fit the 2 lb loaf of bread my machine makes without me eating a piece of it first or switching to making a 1.5 lb loaf; other than that, I love it.
5	1400889600	Love it!  Keeps bread fresh longer!  Love the cutting board, too!  Looks great and is easy to clean!  Very good deal!
3	1400803200	I liked t-his bread saver.  I ordered it for my husband who enjoys making homemade breads.  However, this keeper seems to be backward (or else &#34;I&#34; am!  :) )  because when you pull it open the bread is not on the right side to slice it.  We have tried and tried to figure out what we are doing wrong, but all--and--all we just quit using it and went back to a kitchen towel instead.  HooHum.
4	1400716800	Because you can keep the air out or at least minimalize it, it will lengthen the keeping period. It does extend to nearly 12 feet, is dishwasher safer, and comes with a cutting board. Don't get it for the cutting board, though; because of the bread box's design, using the cutting board is awkward. You'll be better off slicing it on a propercutting board. The box itself is also awmward because you have to slide the two halves together and apart to get the bread in and out, but that also makes it more convenient. Shorten it up for smaller loaves, including when larger loaves are half-eaten.This thing is frump and might disappoint you if you're looking for a 'traditional' bread box, but otherwise Ivrecommend it.
5	1400544000	Really does beat the plastic bags I did have to use to keep my bread fresh.  I like the convenience of ready access to my bread. The size is great.
5	1400544000	I hate to buy kitchen items and then find out they take up more room than they are worth.  But, I really like this keeper - perfect little size and nonintrusive.  I use it for all sorts of things (raisins, nuts, etc.) when not being used for bread.
5	1400457600	Perfect for 2 lb loaf!! I don't really use the cutting board, but the storage part is great! I was looking for a solution to saran wrap and ziplock bags...this is perfect.
5	1400371200	Awesome Product For Any Bread Machine Owner. Keeps Bread Fresh For A Couple Of Weeks And The Handy Crumb Tray Helps With The Mess As Well.
5	1400371200	The perfect item to store your home-made bread and show it off to boot.  The adjustable vent is a useful feature especially throughout the humid summer months.  The cutting board is an added bonus. Washes and dries beautifully.
5	1400371200	Works great! I got this during a very humid, rainy week and the vent was put to use right away. The first loaf I tried in it was a very moist, dense, homemade loaf and it kept it fresh for days with no mold. Great price, great product! I'm glad I got it. The cutting board is a nice addition.
5	1400198400	After about a month use, these have proven very handy.  Good value for the price; I'd buy it again.  Again.
5	1400198400	I've been making a LOT of bread using my bread maker recently -- usually 2 loaves every 3 weeks -- but storing them has been challenging.  Zip bags don't work all that well, trapping too much moisture and unfortunately tending to promote mold.  And leaving the bag unzipped causes the bread to dry out too quickly.I searched Amazon for a solution, saw this, and decided to give it a try.  It DEFINITELY works better than a re-sealable plastic bag for me.  It fits the loaves perfectly, has its own cutting board, and an adjustable vent to control humidity.  I haven't had a problem with spoilage at all since I started using it, so that tells me it's working.I wash it in the upper rack of my dishwasher; no problems so far.  I've had it for about 6 weeks, and it's holding up beautifully.Highly recommended.
3	1400112000	Get this because you have no choice. Someone should design this sort of thing better but I'm not sure how. Maybe have a better way to grip the ends. Or have it open from above. And have the air holes above for escaping steam?
1	1400025600	This product is a waste of money. I tried different settings on it to keep bread fresh but to no success. I finally quite using it and wished I had my money back. I found out after experimenting with different ways that simply using the bread wrapper that the bread comes in works better than anything I tried.
5	1399852800	As with the trashcans I purchased, this product was out of necessity, given that our newly adopted cat LOVES my fresh baked bread. Tired of torn bags and breadcrumbs on the floor, I bought this breadbox for the counter.  I've only had it a few days, so can't say yet how the bread will hold up in it, but so far, so good. Living in the Southwest, it is pretty dry here and bread either dries out quickly if left in a towel, or molds quickly if left in a bag with any moisture still in the bread. I have the dial set so only a very few holes are open and the bread seems to be doing ok.  I mill my own wheat and make the bread immediately, so the bread will spoil much more quickly than store-bought bread. But if I can get 5 days from this breadbox I'll be happy. I think I'm on my way to happiness. I have it in a spot on the counter where it is unlikely that the cat will push it off, but it would surely crack and be useless if it fell--it is heavy plastic, but plastic nonetheless.  The little &#34;cutting board&#34; that comes with it is just a little square (as you can see in the product photo), so you have to stick it just under the part you are cutting. The pieces fit together nicely, and the back piece has a little piece to hold onto while you open it, which is handy. It's a nice design. Glad I bought it.If you've been stuffing your bread in the microwave to keep it out of the way (or safe from cats), this is a much better solution.
3	1399593600	The bread keeper came with a crack in it.  The plastic is too thin and will not hold up to long term usage.
5	1399420800	It works for homemade bread, rolls, etc., but also take out items like bagels and pita breads. They would always go stale before within a day. This little box is seriously fantastic and very worth the price.
5	1399420800	I like it! My bread is staying more fresh. I also like the clear container. It &#34;displays&#34; my work and also I can monitor when it's time to make more. I did remove the smaller plastic cutting board and use it in the kitchen and replaced it with a wooden one I planed down to fit inside perfectly.
5	1399248000	I bought this because I needed a storage container for homemade bread, and just didn't like the idea of having to buy plastic bags that end up in the landfill. I like being able to adjust it for either humid or dry climate storage.
5	1398816000	This keeps the bread fresh.  It has a air vents that you can choose what setting you want.  I like how it adjustable as your bread load gets smaller so does the keeper.  Saves a lot on plastic bags which can also make your bread too moist that it is chewy.  Also the slicing board, I use with the Norpro 370 Bread Slicer and Guide with Crumb Catcher (also sold on Amazon) - It fits in between the guides so you don't cut the wood.
5	1398470400	I've tried other bread boxes/containers and none of them really keep my soda bread from drying out by the end of the loaf so it just crumbles apart at the end. I'm very happy to say this keeper works great. I just had to change bread shape from round to square, not a big deal...
5	1398297600	really does work
5	1398211200	This was the companion piece I bought along with his breadmaker.  It's very functional.  I love the way it collapses as the loaf of bread decreases.  It does still seem to have a little condensation inside it, from time to time, but not enough to damage the quality of the bread.
5	1398124800	This bread keeper works great.  I put the homemade bread in it after it has cooled down and place in the refrigerator and it is always fresh.
5	1398038400	Simple but keeps bread fresh, not pretty but does the job very well. Made very sturdy and very easy to use.
5	1397952000	It is expandable. Also the adjuster on the side allows bread to lose the moisture within first few hours so it wont get wet and then retain it so that the bread doesn't dry out. Very nice
5	1397952000	This is a great bread keeper.  It's roomy and you can let in as much or little air as needed.
4	1397692800	We bake a lot of our own breads. The problem is often that they do not keep so well in the refridgerator. The bread is often cold or moist. It really has to be kept at room temperature. To keep it safe from bugs you need a bread box. This has been most excellent and the mini cutting board inside is great.
5	1397606400	I needed a bread keeper that would not take up too much space and would keep my homemade fresh fresh.  This keeper does the job well.  I like the fact that as you use the bread, the keeper gets smaller.  I like the adjustable air holes that allow you to determine how much air you would like circulating inside.  From time to time I adjust the dial because of changes in the weather.  My only problem has been that when I make an extra tall loaf of bread the top scrapes the holder.  This has been corrected by just adding a tiny bit less yeast.  That is no reflection on the quality of this well made bread keeper.  I highly recommend it.
5	1397347200	Perfect solution to the bread crumbs and general mess on my kitchen counter as I started baking with my new bread maker.  This bread box is collapsible and easy to use.  Keeps the home made bread fresh and the kitchen counter neat.
5	1397174400	Along with the gluten free flour that I bought I made wonderfullyyummy bread! I love this little machine! it is amazing
5	1397088000	Wow, I love this bread keeper. For one thing, I've been able to say &#34;Goodbye!&#34; to disposable bread bags. (You're welcome, mother earth) For another, I've been able to keep my bread so much fresher in the keeper than a bag. Oh also, it looks much better sitting on my counter.
3	1396828800	PRODUCT WORKS PRETTY GOOD FOR THE PRICE.  ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER AS SHE HAS BREAD MACHINE.  I THINK SHE FELT IT WAS MORE TROUBLE TO USE SO I HAVE IT NOW FOR BOUGHT BREAD WHICH WORKS FINE.
4	1396483200	Yes, it is cleverly designed, and length expandable (SMART!), with humidity control.  It also fits bread machine loafs, which some of the bread cutters available here on Amazon do not, we learned from our amazon purchase of.. (see my review for the &#34;Bread Slicer Elite&#34;, made of maple and stainless from Tampa Bay, FL).  That is good for us, as we are making allot of bread with our with our new Panasonic SD-YD250 bread machine (five stars!! , see my review there).  We live in MN and it very dry here in MN in Winter.  However, we, like another reviewer here, found that in a dry environment a zip lock works better to prevent mold from occurring as soon, but this summer when there is more humidity this keeper will work good, I'm sure. (Keep in mind with a bread maker you do not add the preservatives that make the bread last longer when store bought.) Plus, looks good, like a presentation case for the bread you make!  Please rate my review if you found it helpful! ty stcroix_man2002@yahoo.com and read my review of the Panasonic Bread Maker.
5	1396483200	Easy to use, clean, and looks good on the counter.  We make our own bread and our loafs fit well in this bread keeper.  It is a good buy.
4	1396483200	Works like a charm did a lot of reading on this product and I guess its a hit or miss but for me keeps my bread fresh when I'm done making it in my bread maker. I recommend it.
5	1396483200	I wasn't sure what to make of this product originally. The plastic is a little thin, however, it appears to work as described: keeps bread fresh and moist. Homemade bread doesn't last long to begin with, but I was happy to find that it keep nicely in this keeper as long as we needed it. My only complaint, and to be honest, I'm not sure how they would solve this, is that fresh bread should be stored cut-side down to ensure moisture, which is only possible with a one pound loaf or smaller. (Given that this keeper expands side-ways.).  Although we haven't used it yet, the cutting board is adorable and makes for a nice added feature so you don't have to pull our your big cutting boards just to cut a slice. Enjoy!
5	1396224000	Love this product.  The bread from my bread machine fits with room to spare.  Haven't used it for handmade breads yet - will have to  size/shape loaf to fit.  The two parts slide apart and back together easily.  I prefer not to use the cutting board that comes with it.  Crumbs don't know they're supposed to stay on it, so I use a larger wooden cutting board.  Not a big deal.  So far, it's kept the bread fresh, doesn't dry out or get moldy.  I may have to buy another for bagels and muffins.  You won't regret the purchase!
2	1396224000	I was so excited to use this Bread Keeper. I make home made bread constantly and hate storing them in plastic ziploc baggies. It looks tacky and I know it's not the best solution.Let me be clear, the DESIGN, function and QUALITY of this product is beyond excellent. It's INCREDIBLY well made, sturdy, efficient and high quality. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it's built like a Rolls Royce of kitchen appliances.However, a Rolls Royce may be incredibly sturdy, well built and look fantastic, but if it can't take you from point A to point B, it's worthless.I bought the Progressive International Adjustable Bread Keeper to keep my home made bread fresh longer, but over the past 2-3 weeks of using this product I've baked 3-4 different loaves of bread, placed them in the Bread &#34;Keeper&#34;, and I've never seen bread mold so fast.I just baked a loaf of bread Tuesday morning, placed it in the 'Bread Keeper', and 5 days later the entire back of the loaf was covered in mold.I've tried the vent on the 'Humid' setting, I've tried the vent on the 'Dry' setting.One of the settings did keep my bread more 'moist' and 'fresh', but on either setting the bread was inedible within days. Even if you cut the mold off, the whole loaf tastes moldy because it's been sitting in a small, enclosed, moist, moldy space.This product would be PERFECT for a family that goes through maybe 1-2 loaves of bread a week. Your bread will taste moist and soft like it just came out of the oven. But it will be moldy in days, and for my family of 2, that just doesn't work.
5	1396224000	We have 2. My husband uses them every time he makes homemade bread. They work really well for keeping the bread fresh.
5	1396051200	This container is perfect for people who make their own bread. The adjustable size is perfect as the bread gets used.
5	1395878400	I have already had 3 loves of bread stored in this. I like that it's clear so I don't forget that there is bread on the counter. Feels sturdy but not too heavy. The board is a little small but works for what it's designed for.
5	1395878400	Have been using this for about a month and am very happy I purchased this bread keeper. I make 2-3, 2lb loaves of bread a week in my bread machine and they fit perfectly in this bread box. It keeps them fresher than a lock 'n lock container, foil, plastic bags, etc. I like the vent at the end as well. (The cutting board is very small and we don't use it, preferring to set our bread keeper on a wood cutting board we use for slicing our bread, but it works fine if you want to use it.) I would recommend this to anyone who makes their own bread in a bread machine. I also noticed it is sold in King Arthur's Flour Catalog. You will notice your bread stays fresher longer.
5	1395619200	We bought a breadmaker a couple months ago and while we were extremely happy with the bread that it produced, we found that we couldn't eat it quickly enough. We were happy to slice some and store it in the freezer (since we were just going to be toasting it later anyway) but as for the bread that we wanted to consumes within a few days, we weren't having much luck keeping it from getting stale. We tried a few different methods (some of which did little to keep it from getting stale while others actually caused it to get too soft by trapping too much moisture. This bread keeper has solved both of those problems.It's a simple item but it works perfectly. Homemade bread stays fresh for up to a week and it's great to be able to control how much air you want to allow into the box. The cutting board is a bit worthless (and often doesn't even fit in the bread keeper with a large loaf) but all in all this is a wonderful product that I highly recommend for anyone with a breadmaker.
5	1395532800	Purchased this for my wife who just started making her own bread.  She loves it. Would highly recommend to anyone who makes their own bread.
1	1395446400	I ordered this at the same time I ordered my breadmaker and it came to me busted up.  I think I'll just go to the store and get one.
2	1395360000	I used this several times and every single time I did the bread molded in less than 2 days, which is unacceptable after all the effort one puts into making homemade bread. I made sure the bread was completely cooled when I placed it inside and turned the 'dial' on the keeper to the proper setting (opened or closed) and it made no difference. Hope others have better luck than me.
4	1395273600	I really like this. The only drawback is the 2 pound loaf gets really tall and is hard to fit in the keeper. Only by about 1/2 inch so I just squish it down a little.
4	1395187200	I bake frozen bread dough from the grocery during cool/cold weather in a cast iron loaf pan and this fits those loaves perfectly.  No more expensive gallon baggies.  Vent open for fresh baked to release excess moisture, and closed for sliced loaves to maintain freshness. The cutting board is small, nut it has to be for adjustability. Five stars if not for that.
4	1395187200	I live in a dry area, so I have to be very careful that the adjustable 'wheel' stays closed.  It tends to move easily.  The keeper looks very nice on the counter.
4	1395014400	This is a simple plastic container for bread.  I use it for baguettes.  I have to cut them in half to fit into the box but that is not a problem.  It is small enough to not take up too much valuable real estate on the counter top and displays the contents quite well to prevent the 'out of sight, out of mind' problem with old bread.  It comes with a cute little plastic cutting board that I have placed in a drawer until I can find a use for it.  I wound up getting a small, but larger than the cute little plastic one, cutting board that sits underneath the bread keeper as well as a Komachi bread knife that sits on top of it.  All in all, it serves its purpose.  It is plastic so somewhat subject to the problems that plastic present, but I anticipate, with adequate care it should last quite well.  I would buy it again should I ever need to.  It is for bread that is being consumed and is not large enough for storage of anything more that a loaf.
5	1395014400	Refused to pay the obscene prices for bread anymore and started making my own.  I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised and how long this kept my loaf fresh.  I don't use the cutting board that's on it but I'm glad it's there.
5	1395014400	Works great. Seals the bread air tight and easy to use. Will recommend. Keeps my bread fresh. Great price for it.
5	1394928000	I love this little container.  The cutting board that is included works great to slice the bread on.  It has an adjustable moisture control and keeps my homemade bread fresh much longer than bags do.  Since my homemade bread is usually larger than store boughten, I didn't know if this would work, but it fits my oversize loaves.  Definitely would recommend this product.
2	1394841600	Too small to hold a standard loaf of bread, and the gap between the two parts is large enough for a bug to crawl though.  Will be returning it.
3	1394841600	I bought this for my home made bread so I wouldn't have to wrap the loaves. I had thought that with this, and being able to adjust the humidity, my bread would stay fresher longer.  It was just okay.  The bread didn't go bad, but it didn't have the same freshness that you get when it first comes out of the oven.  It did keep the bread longer.
5	1394755200	I was looking for a way to store my bread without taking up too much space on the table.  This worked great, and it shows off my beautiful home made bread.
5	1394668800	I love this bread keeper.  It's working like a charm, keeping my homemade breads slicable and fresh, with no mold.  The airlock dial makes this possible.  Large zipper bags are wasteful and no longer needed.
1	1394582400	I bought this in the hopes it would keep bread I made fresh. However, after a few times of usings the I found out that moister w still getting inbread would become stale or moldy at first I thought I was using it wrong but after the 3-4 time I threw itout putting it in a freezer zip lock back works better
5	1394582400	I began needing to make my own bread after discovering my family's wheat sensitivity. Without the preservatives in store-bought bread, I soon realized that I needed something to keep my homemade bread fresh longer. The Progressive Bread Keeper has been an amazing find. My homemade bread stays fresh days longer because of the adjustable air flow. I am no longer throwing out bread a couple days after making it because it's either dried out or moldy. The Bread Keeper keeps my bread fresh and moist for days. Love this product!
5	1394496000	Works as advertised. Please understand that we haven't put the keeper to a true test because the bread from our bread machine doesn't stay in it long enough to test it's keeping qualities.
5	1394409600	This is a great bread keeper.  The adjustable vent enables you to make sure you are getting the right amount of air flow so your bread doesn't get moldy at the same time making sure that the bread doesn't stale too quickly.  The included bread board is very nice.  I keep it in the holder with the bread so that I don't need to take out and clean a separate larger cutting board every time I want a slice.
5	1394409600	I love this bread box. It's easy to remove a couple slices without getting any crumbs on the counter. The size can be adjusted depending on size of the loaf, and how much you've consumed.I've noticed some condensation forming on the box, even with the vent fully open, but I don't know what I could do about that.
4	1394409600	IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BREAD BOX. I NEVER SAW ONE QUITE LIKE IT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT IS INTERESTED IN USING BREAD BOXES.  I AM ON A GLUTEN FREE DIET AND BREAD IS VERY HARD TO KEEP.  THIS LITTLE BOX IS VERY HELPFUL.
4	1394236800	Not too bad of a storage container. If you make the 2 lb loaf you'll have to take the board out or the bread won't fit. Make sure the bread is well cooled or it will cause the bread to get wet from sweat (even with the vent open). I like that it adjusts so it takes up less space. I think it'll do for my purpose.
5	1393977600	I am so glad to have this adjustable bread keeper.  It is just what I needed to keep my kitty out of my plastic bag covered bread!  It can be made large to hold a whole loaf or made smaller as the bread goes down.  I actually keep two loves at a time in it and the cat doesn't seem to want to mess with it.
4	1393718400	This holds homemade bread. Goes together easily, comes apart just as well. My only complaint would be this is far, far from air tight. It's much more convenient than a 1 gallon ziplock, but far less effective.
4	1393545600	I make my own bread in my bread machine and I put the loaf in a plastic bag and slip it into this keeper.  It works GREAT.  My bread fits into this keeper... as it adjusts very easily.  I find my bread stays fresher now that I am using this keeper.
3	1393545600	I bought this item as s gift to my son. It was broken when it arrived, however he used it because according to instructions, it couldn't be exchanged.
3	1393545600	I like this and its cute and looks good on the cabinet, but it is a bit small and doesn't do well with larger loaves of bread or some of the bigger loaves made in machines, also I've had loaves mold it it fairly fast as it keeps the moisture in and allows the mold to grow, it has vents but I'm not sure how effective they really are.
5	1393459200	I really like this adjustable bread keeper.  The cutting board with the slice indicator on the bottom has worked great. You can see at a glance how much bread you have.  I love the fact that it is adjustable.  I would reccomend this product.  Great price
4	1393459200	When I first put it together I thought there was enough space for something to get thru but it seems I was wrong. It's ingenious how it seals. I keep it on top of the frige just in case, and the bread never gets cold. I think it's an excellent product, an excellent invention.
5	1393372800	This is well made, heavy, and well designed. The two ends mate perfectly for precise humidity control. The adjustable vent has multiple useful settings. Highly recommended by a happy buyer.
5	1393286400	I placed my first whole wheat breadmaker loaf in the bread keeper and it is doing its job very well.
3	1393200000	This is a wonderful idea, I was wanting this for my homemade breads; something that was reusable.  It works fine for a loaf of bread, but I put my homemade individual hoagie rolls in this and it's really rather cumbersome to try and open it and just get one out while keeping the others in.  This is really only a good fit for one loaf, not multiple loaves, rolls, etc.  It is rather short also.  It would definitely not fit a sandwich loaf in, a regular bread pan loaf touches both sides and is just closing.
5	1393113600	I purchased this Bread Keeper to store my bread that I have been making in my bread maker. It works great My bread stays fresh and soft. I live in Arizona and bread has a knack of molding very quickly. So far so Good
5	1393113600	Keeps bread fresh. It is nice that the bread is still fresh after a couple of days.  I make bread every week, so this is perfect for me.
3	1393113600	This bread keeper is ok.  It does prolong the life of your bread by a few days.  Mine came in a damaged package and was cracked on the bottom of the keeper.
5	1393113600	The bread stays fresh. The side vents allow air circulation, if necessary, depending on the climate (humid or dry). The box slides sideways to adjust different shapes of baked goods and the tray works fine as a cutting board.Inexpensive and useful tool to have in the pantry.
3	1393027200	This is OK, and lots of people think it retains freshness for a long time.  I found it to be more clumsy and irritating to use than it was worth.  Within two weeks of buying it, my cleaning people had managed to crack it somehow - so I can't return it.  Personally, this is something that I could easily live without.
5	1392940800	The humidity control feature is nice and the adjustable size is handy.  Plus since its see through it helps me keep track of when I need to make another loaf
5	1392854400	the box looks great and the bread stays fresh I love the ability to adjust the vent to compensate for room humidity
5	1392681600	I used this for homemade bread, cookies, etc. This really helps keep your baked goods fresh even if the grocery store is the one who baked them. Easy to clean.
5	1392595200	I've use this for about 20 loaves of bread and it is kept all of them fresh for at least a week. You can control the amount of humidity with a vent on the side.
5	1392595200	I just started baking bread again after a long hiatus....same old problems....drying out and going moldy...this is the answer!!!! My bread lasts better than a week now...(if I don't get it all eaten first).Nice package, slide out cutting mat. Can't ask for anything better...Rate it a Best Buy....
5	1392595200	I really like this container,  I make homemade bread every weekend and needed something to keep it in.  As well as being cute, to me it is ideal for bread.  I like the size of the keeper and it keeps my bread fresh.
5	1392422400	A bit of a learning curve regarding how much air to let in but we like it.  Maybe put only one kind of bread at a time in it
4	1392336000	It seems to work very well; just have an  small issue in sliding it open.  But it keeps bakery stuff fresher and longer.
5	1392163200	I love this bread keeper so much I've bought a second one. It works very well and keeps the bread a few days longer..
5	1392163200	My wife and I love this bread keeper.  Better than any of the others we've had.  Perfect size for what comes out of our bread machine.  Nice features like handles on both ends, adjustable venting, and a cute little cutting board inside.
5	1391990400	I recently bought a bread maker and found this saves me from wasting so much. The adjustable size lets me cram in a lot of different  types of slices, so I can have more then one type of loaf going at the same time. Also is pretty unassuming in my kitchen.
4	1391904000	I like how this container holds the bread without too much air space.  That was the primary reason I bought it, to quit wasting bread due to crusting and air-space dehydration.  Well, this works ok, but is still way too large for keeping, in my super tiny kitchen, anywhere that is convenient.  Functionality-wise, it's fair to good at what it does.
4	1391904000	I am gluten intolerant and have been since I was 57 and now near 75 ,well I've been baking bread for a while now and this container keeps my bread from being crushed ,but its not totally air tight ! however it is worth having !!
5	1391817600	I can't imagine how one can keep bread fresh without the use of the bread keeper.  It is excellent.  We bake bread nearly every day and the PIA bread keeper is well worth the nominal price.
5	1391817600	My most recent homemade loaf has been in the keeper for nearly 2 weeks, and I think some mold sprouted last night. I live in a very humid climate and this bread keeper is fantastic. I like the little cutting board, as it saves me from dragging one out every time I slice bread.
5	1391817600	Very Happy with this quality product, can take warm bread straight from bread maker or just store and keep fresh bread
3	1391817600	I thought maybe 2-4 loaves.  Only one at best.  Will have to keep storing my bread in the fridge.  Will use it to keep the last slices in the loaf fresh, but not what I expected from the pictures on line.
5	1391817600	My wife got tired of keeping the bread that I bake in a bag, so she ordered this keeper.  I bake a loaf every 5 days or so of a wonderful multigrain bread recipe that I devised with no fat, added sweetener, or salt.  We love the bread but it does get a little hard after the first few days if kept in a bag.  This keeper does a great job of keeping the bread fresh and moist through 5 or 6 days.We also occasionally buy a loaf of San Francisco style sourdough bread (we do live in Sonoma County in the SF Bay area and it's baked locally).  While this keeper does maintain freshness, the crust doesn't stay super crispy.  That's easily reversed by toasting the bread, so it doesn't bother us!Note in both cases we kept the keeper vent fully opened.
5	1391644800	I like the way this keeps my bread and can be adjusted according to the length of the bread loaf.  One drawback is that the cute little white board that comes with it is not a cutting board.  We tried it and it leaves cut marks.  We just use a different cutting board now.
5	1391644800	This was a replacement for a wooden breads box.  Turns out that people eat more of the bread when they can actually see the bread. Also the selectable holes are useful when putting new bread in, or keeping a new loaf fresh. Enclosed cutting board is short but still useful. It is Easy to put bread in and take it out.
5	1391644800	We bought this bread keeper for use in our RV, since I have food allergies, and we have to make and keep our own bread.  The cutting board is  great, and the keeper works well in all respects, and is easy to clean.  We now use it in the house when we are at home.  :)  The plastic would break if dropped, so one must keep that in mind.
5	1391558400	After wrapping our bread in plastic wrap for months, I HAD to get a permanent solution because I hated the waste.  This was perfect.  It holds the large loaves that our breadmaker makes and even has room left over.  The bread stays fresh for much longer than before.  We tend to make about two loaves a week and we never have it get stale or hard.  One loaf has lasted for at least six days and was fine.  Would definitely buy again!
5	1391558400	I just wish it were just a bit bigger.  Occasionally my yeast over achieves and I kind of have to smash the top to get the loaf in the box.  80 percent of the time, it's the perfect size.
2	1391558400	I still had moldy bread in a couple of days. I tried putting it in various places with the same results. It's just me and I can't make a loaf of bread last a week. Now I par freeze slices and then vacuum seal them without crushing and get pretty good results.
5	1391299200	This is a quality piece of equipment.  I never thought I would get such a fine working Keeper for this price. I may buy another just in case.
5	1391040000	This bread keeper works great! I love keeping my bread in it. It keeps bread a lot longer than in other containers that I have used in the past. I can adjust the holes for moister bread or close it for bread that does not need the air so it does not dry out.
5	1391040000	I was apprehensive based on some of the reviews that the bread molds quickly. So far, not once for me. I made whole wheat bread the other day and it turned out a little dry. I put it in the keeper and somehow it was moister.
5	1390953600	I got this with a bread maker.  It does keep the bread fresh for up to 5 or 6 days. The removable board that the bread sits on does make a good bread slicing board.  Best of all, it is small and its size can easily be changed to fit exactly what it needs to hold.  I wanted a breadbox but didn't have the counter space, especially with the new bread machine.  This one fits onto my counter perfectly.
2	1390780800	It is way too small for me.  I should have paid better attention.  I'll keep it to give to a friend with a very tiny kitchen..
2	1390694400	I purchased this bread box over 6 months ago. At first I loved it. After a while I started seeing cracks develop around the air vent holes. It seems as if the plastic used is very brittle with very little give.
5	1390262400	This is perfect for home made bread! So far, my wife and I haven't had any issues with this. It allows you to adjust how much air the bread gets so it doesn't get dried out.
5	1390262400	Plenty tall enough for even the highest loaf of bread. Slides easily to open and close. No 'plastic' aroma to contaminate your bread. The knob on one end adjusts easily for any air flow you may want. The small cutting board is sturdy and of the right size. The plastic construction is sturdy enough. I hand wash - I think other users are putting in the dishwasher and then acting surprised when the item cracks. I dont know what there is not to like about this bread keeper, it is exactly what I have been hoping to find.
5	1390003200	I have a Zojirushi 1 pound bread machine, which I do &#34;love&#34;.  This bread keeper is exactly the right size.  It slides easily, no fuss with it.  I bake a loaf of bread, put it in, and it keeps it well.  It's not too big on the counter.  It's relatively attractive.  I have given it 5 stars but I find it hard to &#34;love&#34; a &#34;bread box&#34;--even though I guess I do &#34;love&#34; this bread box.  It does everything a bread box should do, but it's a bread box when all is said and done.  So &#34;love&#34;, well maybe, I guess so...
3	1389830400	This bread keeper is okay but a little awkward to use.  However, this was a good transaction and I appreciate that.
5	1389744000	Was not sure what to expect, but this bread keeper is great. It keeps my homemade bread nice and long.  no more plastic shopping bags for my bread.
5	1389657600	Purchased with the new Breville bead machine.  This does not quite hold a 2.5 lb loaf but does do the 2 lb very nicely. Very sturdy and nicely made. .
5	1389657600	Love this bread box. Use to keep banana bread, etc and love the fact that it adjusts to length of loaf. Works well. Recommend
5	1389571200	Magical invention.  It keeps my homemade bread perfectly fresh for much longer than I expected.  The adjustable vent keeps the box from being too damp or too dry.
5	1389571200	Keep bread fresh longer than the bread-box, opens and closes easily. This is cheaper than buying bags to store my homemade bread.
5	1389571200	This is a very nice product.  Keeps my bread fresh.  Love it!  Would recommend this purchase a bunch.  So go get one!
5	1389484800	We love this storeage bread box wholes a large loaf and keeps it fresh.  If I liked it you will love it.
2	1389484800	I bought this to prevent the bread from drying out ... I bake my own bread and don't use preservatives so our bread doesn't last as long as store bought bread.I thought this might be a snazzy solution to our problem. And it sort of is. It definitely keeps the bread from drying out and the vents allow you to let more or less air in - which is cool. However, the bread develops as &#34;stale&#34; taste after being in the bread keeper after a day or two. I can't exactly pinpoint what exactly it is but it is a funky smell/taste that is worse than dry bread. Won't be using it again.
5	1389312000	I make homemade bread and love this bread keeper.  It cleans up real nice and adjusts to the length of loaves, etc.  I like the dial in front with the air holes, so if there is moisture in the keeper you can turn the dial and let a little air in.  Especially if your bread has not cooled completely and a little moisture forms. I bought one for my daughter and am buying another one for myself.  I like it and would recommend it to anyone.
5	1389312000	This bread keeper is not complicated, and does what it is supposed to do.  Really keeps our bread fresh and moist.
5	1389139200	I have been baking all my own bread for about 6 months now and I would not be without this product!  Prior to getting this bread keeper my bread did not last very long and now it can last over a week in this container!  It holds one homemade loaf plus about half another loaf.  I also really like air holes on the end that can be opened or closed.
5	1389139200	Our first attempts at bread did not leave enough after eating to use the bread keeper. However, recently we have begun to use it and really like the way it works, and the fact that it is transparent. It is easy to wash and dry, also.
5	1389052800	It is a great product and I have recommended it to friends. In the future I may buy one more.
5	1389052800	This was a Christmas gift. Since then I have made a Kulich, and a 1-1/2 loaf of white bread , I plan on a whole grain nextI own a Panasonic from the 80's. That worked great also. I also own a collection of bread books  the Virtuoso also looks great on the counter next to my Keurig
2	1388707200	I find the manipulation of the inner and outer shells to be difficult - arthritis in my hands - and I will find another solution for keeping my bread fresh.  Would probably be fine for someone with better gripping/manipulation skills.
1	1388707200	Its too much of a hassle to open this thing, your better off with plastic bags also sold on Amazon and an actual bread box.
1	1388620800	This is a waste of money.  My husband makes a two pound loaf of bread machine bread.  The bread storing unit says a loaf of bread fits into the device.  A one pound loaf wouldn't fit into this device.  I did put part of a loaf in the container and left the vents open.  The bread was moldy within two days.  Not worth the money.
5	1388534400	This is amazing. Today is Day #7 of a loaf of bread we made to test out the bread keeper, and the bread was fresh and moist as ever this morning before we finished it off. Even the cut end of the loaf did not dry out at any time. Previously we could really only get three days out of fresh bread, and it would dry out over those days (not great on Day 3), and if we put it in a plastic bag, it would get soggy (we live in Florida). So, to be able to eat great bread on Day 7 is just amazing. Now we'll only have to make bread once a week, and there will be no waste! Plus, the bread looks great sitting on the counter in that nice container instead of wadded up in paper towel and tin foil. This little contraption is worth every penny and more.
5	1388448000	It is perfect!  Love that it has a little vent and that it is see through!  Can be used to keep other backed goods as well.
5	1388448000	Is perfect for the large/tall loafs that come out of my machine and makes the bread last a lot longer than if it were in a bag or just sitting out.  Easy to wash.
5	1388361600	Our bread machine makes rather large 2-lb loaves, and we have very limited counter space in our kitchen.  We also have two cats who stay off the counters when we're watching, but who can't be expected to stay away from fresh bread left out in the open.  The bread boxes I've had in the past have either been too big or too tight for fresh bread, making it soggy.  The little side vents on this bread box are the perfect solution, and the telescoping design solves the space problem, too.  The little cutting board inside was a big plus.  Great price.  It's perfect for our needs.
5	1388188800	Bought a new bread machine.As such, fresh bread does not have the preservatives in it that the grocery store &#34;bread isle&#34; bread has, this it goes stale quicker.I love this simple bread keeper for the main reason that it is fully adjustable. You can slide the two sides as close or far apart  (can hold a loaf and a half of a medium setting bread in it)Also, like the adjustable vent, for fresh or already cut bread.Small cutting board is included and is a nice touch.FINAL VERDICT -&#62; A- ... (RECOMMEND)
5	1388188800	I like the air vent on the sides.  I do find the little slicer board a little awkward and small to use.
5	1387929600	Have never seen this device before!!  It keeps our NON-additive bread moist and fresh although the bread is so good we doeat it SO fast!!!!!
5	1387497600	The Bread stays fresh and moist in the unit and it performs as advertised.  The clear cover allows you to see how much bread is left and the adjustable feature is easy to use.
5	1387324800	I really love this bread box. It slides apart so you can put in a full sized loaf or pushed together to store smaller items and you can always see what is in there. It has the adjustable knob on it to allow more or less moisture in. It looks neat and clean on your counter yet takes up only the amount of space you need.
4	1387324800	Don't freeze them. Don't heat them, and you won't have the problems mentioned in other reviews. I gave these 4 stars because I don't think the vent actually does anything to keep the bread fresher.
5	1387238400	Great way to hold bead from my machine!  Keeps bead from spoiling for an extra day. Looks nice also! Great!
5	1387238400	Bread really does last longer in this bread keeper. It looks very nice on the counter top so I keep it out. I highly recommend this product.
4	1387238400	So far this is working pretty well.  My bread machine bread gets a little dried out by the end of the loaf but not any more so than when stored in a plastic bag and with this, no mold forms.  Perhaps this may change in the hotter months but right now, I am liking it.  The bread hasn't been dry enough to try the little trick to moisten it up.  It is much easier to get bread out and slice than when stored in a plastic bag also.  The little cutting board makes a nice little tray to hold on to when removing or replacing the bread from the bread keeper.  My bread machine makes a horizontal loaf it fits with plenty of room.
5	1387065600	Keeps the bread fresh and lives up to the expectations,would defiantly order more as gifts.Excelent produc.Thank you so muchReon
3	1386979200	I like that I have a place to store my bread. You do have to make sure the bread is fully cooled before putting in bread keeper otherwise there's condensation inside even with vents open.
5	1386806400	Really handy for anyone that likes to bake their own bread (especially if you have pets). My cats were always trying to get to where I kept my loaves of bread, so I had to stick them way up on the top shelf out of the way (and out of reach). I was skeptical of this item, but decided to give it a try. It works great. The adjustable sliding action is really nice and I guess the air control bit helps with keeping my bread fresher for longer. Clean up is easy if a loaf does mold, or you want to clean it up. I just throw it in the top rack of my dishwasher and then take it out to let it dry.
5	1386720000	Handy gaget and does a good job of keeping bread fresh.  Keeps bread from being smashed by other items and easy to see the amount of bread left.  I use this all the time with my homemade bread.
4	1386720000	Worked as advertisedPros: fits most breads, cutting board is a nice feature.Cons: We don't make bread very often so when we do we don't have many left overs.  We don't use it as much as we would like.
4	1386633600	Keeps fresh bread longer and I like that it is adjustable to the bread size.  The cutting board came in handy.
4	1386633600	So far it is working great...  we can store our bread longer giving us a chance to eat it all and not have to throw it our to the birds...
5	1386547200	This is really an I prove net on the traditional breadbox because it adjusts for size and humidity. Another plus is that you can see how much bread you have left.
5	1386547200	I make all my own bread and for a long time kept trying to stuff loaves into plastic food storage bags.  The results were less than satisfactory.  This bread keeper was inexpensive but works well.  The bread stays fresh much longer.
4	1386288000	I cant really rate this item as I did not buy it for myself, but as a gift requested by a relative
5	1386288000	This is something that I hope will last a lifetime.  It's very easy to use and keeps the bread almost as fresh as a bag does.  Plus you have a cutting board the right size for a pound and a half size loaf.
5	1386288000	love love love, can not image storing my homemade bread in anything else.  Clean look and easy to clean.  beats plastic bags and the cutting board is exactly what is needed.  Awesome product
1	1386288000	Not impressed with this purchase, not air tight and rather big and clumsy for setting on counter, just not what I had in mind
4	1386115200	This product keeps the bread nice and fresh, however it is not quiet long enough to hold most whole loaves.
4	1386028800	Love this little box, except for when my bread is too big for it :)  I don't use the cutting board, but it seems to keep the bread at a good moisture level.
5	1386028800	work great to keep bread fresh and helps keep it from molding up.  Nice product for any home bread makers
4	1385942400	I like this & it does a great job of storing my bread machine bread, but it needs replacing every 2 years or even sooner if you put it in the dishwasher rather than handwash it
5	1385942400	This unit is quite nice.  Well built and strong enough to last a long time in high use.  Easy to clean and does not show its age.  Expandable to almost any size lofe.
5	1385942400	Keeps our bread from molding. Nice bread-cutter plate included. Easy for my Mom to wash in dish washer. Well worth the cost.
1	1385856000	Flimsy, and after the first washing (on the top rack of dishwasher), the product was cracked. Greta idea, but poorly executed.
5	1385856000	I think it's a great way to keep baked bread , what's neat about it is you can control the air-flow inside the bread keeper.
5	1385856000	Fits my homemade (bread machine) bread perfectly and keeps it fresher longer. It's easy to clean and I am very pleased overall.
5	1385769600	This is an amazing product. Just kidding. It holds bread. I have never lost a loaf of bread since I bought this bread keeper. The bread from my Cuisinart CBK-200 2-Pound Convection Automatic Breadmaker fits.
4	1385683200	IT IS OK BUT MY FRESH;Y BAKED MUFFINS STARTED GROWING MOLD IN 4 DAYS IT IT WE DID EAT 4 OF THE MUFFINS BEFORE THEY STARTED GRWINF FUZZ
3	1385683200	This container is nice in theory.  I like not having to use plastic bags and creating more waste; however, it doesn't keep it as fresh as I would like.  I have gone back to plastic bags.
5	1385510400	I love this bread keeper. This is a very good product and it really does keep bread and pastries fresh longer.
2	1385510400	This was bulky, broke easily and didn't do the job it was supposed to do. I cannot recommend it at all.
5	1385424000	This does a really great job of extending the shelf life. Unlike the bags the bread can breathe more and it doesn't get moldy - love it!
5	1385337600	We have had other bread keepers, but like this one the best. It is larger and can easily handle a loaf of homemade bread. I like the air vent on the end--it allows for more circulation that some with just a small hole or two. This is our second one, and if I find I need another, I'll buy this brand again.
5	1385251200	I make bread almost weekly.  I don't like to cut the bread until several hours after it is finished to let the steam escape.  This bread keeper is great for keeping the bread fresh before I cut and freeze it.  I like that I can choose to open up the holes to let the bread finish cooling overnight without it getting stale.
5	1385164800	This breadkeeper fits my bread machine loves perfectly, and keeps the bread much more fresh.  I would say that this keeps the bread fresh for an extra two days over just keeping it on the counter.This really helps if you don't devour fresh bread right away.
5	1385078400	Keeps bread fresher longer. I buy a lot of whole loaves, and this keeps them for 4-5 days, instead of the 2 days they usually last.
5	1384992000	I got really tired of seeing my beautiful loaves of bread sitting in plastic grocery bags. This product is perfect. Extra large loaves fit perfectly inside. It looks great sitting on the counter. So easy to just slide open and cut it right on the cutting board inside. As the loaf shrinks so does the keeper.
3	1384992000	I have had problems with moisture.  The bread will mold.  I quit using it. Depends on where you live - I guess.
4	1384905600	It really works quite well for our breadmaker bread, and I fell less guilty about throwing out the plastic bags. I put it in the dishwasher every two loaves or so. I wish that they made a round version, because my children make bread too and they would like it in a round version.
2	1384819200	This does not do the job.  Bread get stale in 2 days.  Am looking for something else to use in it's place.
4	1384646400	Great for keeping bread fresh. We bought this along with our bread maker. Really cool thing about it is that it has a chopping board. Only con is that this is way to expensive.
3	1384560000	Its ok..I don't use it anymore. You are really better off just using zip lock bags. Mine just sits on top of my microwave gathering dust.
5	1384473600	Very happy with this item  - I am baking bread constantly and this one is just right item for me.Very happy with this purchase.
5	1384473600	This bread keeper really works.  I've been making some homemade bread and it would be stale a day or two later.  This one keeps the bread fresh for a week.
5	1384473600	it was great thing to put bread in when i only go to the store weeklysoft breadgreat find
3	1384300800	They're okay. The holes do not keep the fruit flies out, so once the bread cooled down, you will need to shut the vent.
1	1384214400	The vent opening broke very quickly.  This is just not sturdy enough for normal use.  A plastic bag and twist tie works better.
5	1384214400	I recently started making bread and wasn't sure how to store it then came upon this bread keeper. I love it! It keeps bread fresh and the little cutting board housed inside the case is very handy. The adjustable vent is effective and a must to keeping bread fresh.
5	1384128000	Wow it really do keep homemade bread and rolls fresh for 3 days maybe more, because we eat a lot of breads and rolls using my Bread Machine. Love this keeper it live up to it name.
5	1383955200	This adjustable bread keeper is the perfect storage for all types of breads.  Moisture level is adjustable, easy to clean and fits in small cupboard spaces.
5	1383782400	It does the job at a great price. Keeps the bread fresh and the crumbs nicely contained. Just don't leave it right next to the bread machine while you are baking bread or you'll get melted plastic and have to purchase another one as I did.
5	1383782400	This is a great bread keeper. I made bread about every week.I would keep it in a zip lock bag,which it would have mold on in just 4 days. I have kept bread in this for 9 days with no mold problems. The cutting board is very handy.
4	1383696000	It stores the fresh bread and you don't have to worry about it squashing it.  The only problem is that it takes up lots of room in the fridge.  I used it whenever I make make bread which is weekly.
5	1383609600	We love the adjustable size of this bread keeper.  The vents and cutting board are a nice feature too!  Perfect for all the home made bread loaves we make - holds up to our 2 lb loaves.  Some extra tall loaves might need some &#34;help&#34; to get in the box.
4	1383523200	Works like the description said, But I would prefer one that opens on the top.  I don't find the cutting board helpful, so I slice it before I put it in the keeper.
4	1383177600	I have bought two of these bread keepers for my homemade bread.It keeps the bread very nice and is wonderful for that purpose. Theissue I have had, however, is that it is not durable and cracks despitemy most careful washing. Once cracked, it is rendered useless. Thatbeing said, it is the best I have found on the market and I will just keepreplacing it, as needed, and hope they improve the quality of the product.
2	1383091200	I had hoped this was the solution to our homemade bread storage problems.... It does seem to keep bread fresh longer and is certainly more attractive than plastic wrap. However, if the vents are left open (as suggested to prevent mold), small flying insects can still get in! Yuk!
5	1383091200	This is just the right sized box for storing bread that I made in a bread machine. It is so much better than wasting a ziploc bag for each loaf of bread I make. The little cutting board is very handy,
3	1383091200	I purchased a bread maker recently, it bakes 500gm to 1 kg loaves and I bought this bread keeper to keep my bread fresh but none of the loaves fit, it's too small!
4	1382659200	The bread keeper is good for keeping the bread fresh and letting me know when to bake more. I like the vent and handle holds. It slides open and closed easily. Easy to clean.
5	1382572800	This expandable keeper is excellent.  Keeps bread fresh and at your fingertips for slicing on the included board.  No more trying to cram tall loaves into gallon size plastic bags  - not to mention the cost savings of buying those bags.  I will order another so I can have two loaves to choose from.
5	1382572800	Although they state that it is not for refrigeration I use it for my sourdough bread and use it in the refrigerator and it keeps my bread fresh and keeps it from going moldy. I replaced a older style that was thinner with this robust thicker bread keeper and I am 100% satisfied with the product and fast delivery.
5	1382227200	I purchased this product to compliment my new bread maker.  Very easy to use, lite weight and portable for traveling to my vacation home
5	1382140800	I was a little skeptical that this would not keep my bread moist, I was very wrong. I live in an extremely dry climate and I had to open the vent up about half way or else my bread would have started to mold. It works way better than i Thought it would. It does seem a little flimsy, but I have put it in the dishwasher a few times and its help up so only time will tell.
5	1381968000	Really like the adjustable size and so far is keeping bread fresh.  The small cutting board that stores inside is very handy.  Since it is clear, takes up little visual space on the counter.
2	1381968000	I bake my own bread most of the time and I thought this would make it easier to keep crumbs contained when cutting a slice and also keep my bread fresher longer. It really doesn't and I'm not so sure I like the design. The cutting board inside is not long enough for a whole loaf and I think that is the main issue I have. Also don't like the the way the two halves of the box are connected in the middle. I find myself going back to storing my bread in a bag and just using a cutting board. I would not recommend this- especially for the price.
5	1381363200	Its not going to keep your bread completely air tight but close enough. Just make sure to read the directions on whether to leave the vents open or closed. This will increase the length of your breads softness by a few days.
4	1381363200	This bread keeper works well for keeping my bread fresh without having to store it in the refrigerator, where bread tends to dry out.
3	1381276800	I make nearly all of our bread & the gallon zipper bags can't cope with the large 2 pound loaf. This bread keeper does. The problem is the vent closing mechanism. It shifts around so if you want the vents closed/open you must remember to check after using the keeper. I now use the keeper when the loaf is too large for a bag then I bag & refrigerate the bread. The cutting board is useless & a nuisance.
4	1381104000	Keeps bread fresh longer.  Sliced bread falls over once the loaf is smaller than keeper space.  To solve this problem I place keeper on its end so the slices lay on top of each other with included cutting board on top to keep air away from top slice.
5	1380931200	After reading all of the wonderful reviews on this bread box, I decided to purchase it, and I absolutely agree with previous reviewers. It does indeed keep bread fresh, and it's incredibly convenient. In addition, it's top rack dishwasher safe, and the cutting board included is fantastic.As another reviewer mentioned, this is a must for those who frequently bake homemade bread.
5	1380844800	I use it every day now.  Very good product highly recommend it if you got a bread maker.  Get it if you are considering.
2	1380844800	This serves its storage purpose, but it can be a pain to clean. Also, the vent adjuster is useless. Your bread will stay overly-moist regardless of where you set it. It does not allow for enough air circulation to counter a humid environment. If you can eat the entire loaf in two or three days, though, you may enjoy this keeper (say you have a large family). However, my family of three (despite a little man who loves his PB&J), had to discard parts of multiple loaves because they molded quickly.
5	1380844800	This is the best bread keeper I have ever bought. Period. Well worth the price and I know you will love it as much as I do.
5	1380672000	Such a simple idea but it works incredibly well.  The vent on the side may make you go, hmmm, but it's necessary and when used how the instructions tell you to use it, works great.  It will extend the freshness of all of your bread, rolls, etc.  Looks nice sitting on the counter too.  Also makes a great gift.
3	1380672000	Only fits a loaf from the bread machine if you bake large oven loaf it is too small not long or wide enough.
3	1380672000	After reading the instructions and placing a home baked loaf of bread in it, it seemed to create its own moisture and even though stored as directed, the humidity level was unacceptable for the bread.  I readjusted the vent with no success
1	1380412800	We bought this because of all the good reviews and everyone saying how wonderful it is. Let me set the record straight this thing is not good. #1-I didn't notice much improvement in it keeping my bread fresh as opposed to stuffing it into a bag. #2- The container doesn't stay together very well and after the two sides falling apart numerous times we've tossed the thing.
4	1380153600	The Bread Keeper extends the life of a baked loaf of bread before it can be completely consumed. It has the ability to adjust the freshness and personal preference of the texture of your bread. The adjustment that allows you to conform to any size loaf is a great  feature.
5	1379894400	I bought this thinking that I was probably wasting my money. It turned out to be a great way to keep homemade bread fresh. I did put the cut side down on the cutting board. It adjusts and I made sure that my fresh bread gets just a little bit of air. I never put warm bread in the keeper. I let the bread come to room temperature. Kept my bread decent for a week. Nice little invention....
4	1379894400	I love to put my freshly baked bread into this bread keeper. Whenever the bread gets a little hard, I put a little glass hot warm water to &#34;soften&#34; it. It works :)
4	1379808000	I like this bread container but I do not like the clear color as I would if it were in a red or another color. I like the humiity adjuster that you usually do not get in other containers and the easy pull out drawer is quite handy. This is just the right size for the bread that comes out of my bread maker. It is also adjustable for size so you can use it for store bought bread as well. But for bread makers it is really quite handy and easy to clean up in the dishwasher
5	1379462400	I love this bread keeper! Since I started making homemade bread & rolls, I've had a difficult time keeping them from getting stale.  I was very skeptical that this inexpensive bread keeper would actually work, but it was worth the risk. Adjustable vents allow you to let air in (for humid climates or just-baked goods), or keep the air out (dry climates or day-old goods).  The bread keeper itself is adjustable in size, so if you have a loaf of bread machine bread (which doesn't require a lot of room), you can keep it contracted-- open it up for larger items. Great idea to have a little cutting board in there- I use it all the time.  My husband likes to keep his store-purchased doughnuts in here, as they stay much more fresh than in the container the store puts them in.  Super item, highly recommended, and you can't beat the price!
2	1378944000	I put a donut in for testing. When I came back, there were teeny bugs.  I tried a piece of fruit next and got a lot of action.
4	1378598400	Nice way to store the bread after it's made.  Compact and easy storage. Along with the cutting board that comes with it!
3	1378166400	This was a fine bread keeper and works great. I don't have any problems at all. It's easy to clean and has a built in cutting board
5	1378166400	I have recently started baking and was foolishly putting my loaves in the fridge. Of course they were going stale practically overnight. I stumbled upon this little gem and its worked amazingly well. Keeps the loaves soft and fresh for days, even after they have been cut.
4	1377820800	We've used it and it works. It does appear to keep breads longer and fresher and they don't seem to get damp and sticky or dry out, even with the vents.
3	1377648000	In terms of what can fit inside, you won't have to worry if your loaf is too big. Coming from a bread machine, it will nearly fit the whole loaf on the board. However, my issue with the vent. Though it doesn't say it is, it's not air tight. That is just how I thought it would be by looking at it, since you can see the knob cover the vents. I live in a dry area, so the vent is to be closed. After one day, my loaf was dry. I put a little bit of water inside, hopefully that will fix everything even though air is still coming in. So, I'm giving it 3 stars for the time being on feeling a bit fooled by the picture.
4	1377561600	my sister-in-law really likes the keeper.  She bakes her own bread and it keeps it very good.  I have not tried mine out yet.
4	1377561600	This bread keeper works but the only gripe I heard from my wife about it was that it is awkward to open and remove a slice of bread if the loaf is a bit longer.  I solved this by turning the keeper 90 degrees (on end) then opening it to remove a slice but that may not be most people's intuition.  Other that it seems to store our homemade bread well.
5	1377475200	Ever since I started baking our own bread at home I had trouble finding the right type of storage to keep it fresh. Everything I had tried before wasn't working. Either too dry or it would mold in a couple days. I should mention that I don't use preservatives, also.Finally I started looking around and stumbled across this prefect little bread keeper. This keeps my bread fresher than anything else I've tried. My bread is so tender and moist still even after being a week old! Love it!I highly recommend this for anyone who needs to store their bread easily!
5	1377388800	The Adjustable Bread Keeper with the moisture vent is exactly what I was looking for.  It holds loaf sizes.  Very useful on traveling with my homemade loaf of bread.
5	1377302400	I love this bread keeper, it is just right for the bread that my breadmaker makes. It is also nice to have the cutting board feature. I will enjoy this in years to come I am sure!!
5	1377216000	Looks really nice with the loaf showing through. Like that it only takes up the room of whatever size the loaf is. Extremely handy to have the cutting board handy since I like to cut the bread as we eat it.
5	1376956800	Keeps my homemade bread fresh far longer, love it! I used to just wrap the bread in a towel, but this works much better.
5	1376956800	I LOVE this bread keeper....my loaves fit great and it keeps our bread really nice and fresh for a long time.  Not like plastic bags which hold in moisture and promote mold.  I plan to buy another one soon!  I highly recommend it!
3	1376956800	My loaves of homemade bread (from bread machine) are too large to fit , have to shave off part of the loaf.  But the keeper seems to protect the loaf from mold.
4	1376784000	Works well. Easy to open and close.  Kept ants out at a beach house that we were staying at.  The bread stayed fresh.
3	1376697600	I feel it may be too soon to rate this product.  It has been hot and humid during the Virginia summer.  I believe that it kept bread fresher (a few days longer) than without.  I am still adjusting to the product so I may not have found the &#34;happy place&#34; for keeping in high humidity.  It is very good to cut the bread on and it is large enough for homemade loaves.
5	1376697600	Cheap price and keeps bread fresh. Much better than the hassle of keeping the bread wrapped in plastic wrap. Very satisfied
5	1376697600	Works great with all sizes of loaf baked in the bread machine. Bread stays fresh for a good week and maybe longer if needed.
4	1376352000	It's nice and big for the loafs of bread I make.  Bread did mold after a few days. maybe because loaf was so big.  I don't understand why it's not recommended for refrigerator.  If you eat a loaf in a couple days, it's great.
5	1376352000	It is worth every penny for me,since it keeps the bread fresh andfits the machine size breads, smaller tolarger with ease.
5	1376265600	I've only used it a couple of times so far but it definitely seems to keep homemade bread fresh longer.  Very easy to use when slicing your bread.  I would recommend to anyone doing a lot of homemade bread baking.
4	1375574400	This is really good for keeping the bread fresh and does prolong the life time of the bread with about 1 day. Im very picky with bread being fresh and still crispy. Only little thing is that you have to be care that the bread is very cool when you put it in there. It does not have to be fully cold, but if it is too warm then it creates condensation that the ventilation trap is not large enough to get out. But when you keep that in mind then it is perfect. I use it basically daily since I bake break 2-3 times a week in my wonderful bread machine.
5	1375574400	I also wrap mine in cling wrap and home made bread stay fresh for a week! If it last that long!
5	1375488000	THIS SAVES ON PLASTIC WRAP OR OTHER ITEMS TO KEEP BREAD FRESH. IT IS SO HANDY! IT IS A MONEY SAVER!
4	1375488000	Adjustable size is great! It takes up half the room for half a loaf. Clear view of the bread lets you know what you have left without opening it. The vents are especially good for homemade bread. You can put bread away with vents open while it is still hot and close them later when the bread has cooled.
4	1375315200	I cool and then store my homemade bread.  It stores it well, is adjustable and I use it every day.
5	1375315200	I made non-salt non-cholesterol breads by myself (using bread maker) and bought this product to store them. It looks cool and pretty good to keep breads fresh for 3-4 days in summer season. I love it.
4	1375056000	Simple to use and cheap. My only gripe is it's not tall enough for the largest loaf from my Panasonic SD-2501 bread maker, but I rarely make bread that size anyway.
5	1375056000	I was a little skeptical about how this bread box would work with my homemade breads, but decided to give it a try.  I am very please to report that it works great.  It keeps my bread fresh for a week, whereas before the bread would start to go stale after a couple of days (I had it wrapped in wax paper).  It is the right height, width and depth for the breads from my bread machine.  Right now I have 1/2 loaf of 9 grain and 1/2 loaf of banana bread in the box.  I have no complaints and would recommend this bread keeper.
5	1375056000	I love this gadget, and it's actually my second one. The first one got broken when we moved and I had not packed it securely. So, when discovered I ordered another immediately. I make my own bread so this sure helps keep it fresh longer.
3	1374796800	Glad I found this on Amazon for keeping my homemade bread.  Had previously used a large cake container.  Only fault I found, and it may just be me but the manufacurers packaging was extremely difficult for me with tendinitis and arthritis to unwrap.
1	1374796800	it spoils the bread! after a day! not good!waste of money for sure!i don't recommenced this at all!
5	1374624000	We got two of these to hold out freshly baked bread. these are the perfect item and comes with a little cutting board.The vent is especially handy when the bread is out of the bread machine, as even after cooling on a rack, the bread keeper need to vent out the moisture and heat.The only &#34;down&#34; side that I noticed is that after several washings in the top rack of the diswasher, the plastic gets a &#34;foggy&#34; look to it, but that is not a big deal.I do wish they would come out with ones that have a color tint to the plastic.still, a very handy item to have.
4	1374451200	I purchased this bread keeper when I bought my first bread machine.  It is nice in that it has adjustable air holes in it for different climates or for if your bread is still warm and you don't want to retain moisture.  It also has a cutting board, although it is a little small.  Not bad for the price.
4	1374364800	Pros: Its all plastic, easy to clean (unlike wooden breadbox).Cons: Its all plastic - can make your bread smell like plastic.I've used this product daily for nearly two years. Washing this is easy because all the parts are plastic and you can submerge the whole thing in soapy water when bread goes moldy. You really want to kill mold spores if they exist. However,  during the summer months (even after two years), I do notice a plastic smell that gets embedded into the breads - something that does alter the taste of the bread. The smell is less noticeable in the winter. While I love this product, I'm hunting for a glass or stainless container that performs as well, without the smell. Until then, I'm generally happy with the product.
5	1374364800	If I bought bread from the grocery store - you know, that chemical-laden, not-good-for-you stuff that's so over-priced as compared to any sort of health-value - this item would be perfect.  However, I make my own bread.  Often, the loaves are taller, often by an inch or even more, than what fits comfortably in the keeper, so I have to squish the loaf down to fit.What I've done to 'fix' the problem is once the bread has cooled, I slice it and pile the slices, with waxed paper separators, in such a way that the loaf fits without being squished, utilizing the expandable side to accommodate the height of the loaf.  It usually means eating a slice or two (never a problem in my house as super-fresh, warm bread is a favorite) before I finish the slicing, but it works better than squishing the loaf.
5	1374364800	i purchased this before and they are great to keep the bread from drying out to soon that why i bought this extra one
3	1374278400	I was hoping to find something I could store a loaf of sandwich bread in.  This is too short.  Also, there is no real &#34;seal&#34; between the two halves, so I'd worry that my bread would get stale, even if the vent weas closed.  It might also be awkward with pre-sliced bread.  You really would need to take the whole loaf out, cut a piece or two off, and then put it back in.
5	1374192000	I like it and it keeps bread fresh.  It also looks better than a plastic ziploc bag on the counter
5	1373846400	We live in the country and try as we might to keep critters like mice out of the house, they find a way.  These bread keepers keep the bread safe and the critters out!  They are quality and attractive.  I don't use them for homemade, just store bought bread. It will not fit one of those large Wonder Bread loaves but fits most!
5	1373673600	It keeps our homemade bread fresh and is a very compact unit. Great space saving idea for storage. Love it.
5	1373414400	I like the clear bread Keeper because I can see at a glance if I need more. It keeps my bread fresh and I do recommend it. It also keeps store bought bread products fresh longer. I wish it would hold more than one loaf at a time. A large sandwich loaf of bread from the store is too long before 3 slices are used.  A double batch of rolls is too large as well.
4	1373328000	The only problems (2) that I found with this is that the venting holes cannot be covered fully - close enough, but not totally.The 2nd problem is it slides on and off too easily and can result in breakage (slipping out of the hand).I bake bread several times a week and I was using the large rubbermaid containers, but you had to open them to see  how much bread was left.  This Keeper is fairly amazing and it keeps my bread just as fresh as my other containers.FOR THOSE WHO MAKE THEIR OWN BREAD:You should put your bread in the refrigerator (cheese drawer or lower shelf) during the Summer months, at least.  I do so all year and it helps the bread stay fresher longer.
5	1373068800	Goodbye plastic grocery bags! I have a new and much nicer place for my bread to stay. Works great and looks good. Nuff said!
5	1372809600	I took home some yeast rolls and cornbread from a meal at a local restaurant. I put the bag in the bread keeper and changed the setting to the halfway point. The rolls stayed soft and fresh and the cornbread was moist for 3 days. I'm sure they would have stayed fresh longer, but I couldn't resist snacking on them! I don't eat bread everyday, so the loaves tend to get moldy before I can finish them. I am looking forward to using this bread keeper to keep my bread fresh till the end.
5	1372809600	Good price, quick delivery, excellent condition, very functional, useful, sanitary and easy to clean and maintain. The adjustability is very useful. I would highly recommend this to anyone purchasing a home bread making machine.
4	1372723200	I often make bread and this keeps it fresh and handy and looks ok so it can be kept on the counter.
5	1372636800	I make bread every week for mine bring to work lunch and I used this bread keeper to keep my home made bread fresh for the whole week.
3	1372636800	With homemade bread you still have to eat it up rather quickly or it will mold. Does keep the bread better then in a refrigerator.
5	1372464000	We bought this as we are trying to use our bread maker more - 5 ingredients vs. ? We got tired of the big ziplock bag and as this suggested the bread needs to breath as it would mold fast in those bags or get stale and hard fast on the counter. It works great and we have no issue opening and closing it (for the reviewer that had trouble putting it together, maybe try looking at the feet or the vent and realize that the other side holds the bread and is the male half).It has increased the life and quality of our bread and made for easier storage.
5	1372377600	I love this bread saver.  It works perfectly.  The cutting board inside keeps the bread off of the floor of the container so moisture does not collect on under side of loaf.  The moisture control knob on the side is tightly sealed, no air gets in when you do not want it too.  Super easy to clean.  If we made more than 1 loaf at a time I would definitely buy another.
5	1372291200	This is a great size to leave on the counter and not take up too much space.  A bread maker loaf is smaller than a store-bought loaf and this is just right.
5	1372291200	keeps the bread moist, like the fact that it has the vent for when the bread is warm, i like it
5	1372291200	This thing works great. I had been keeping my bread cut side down on the cutting board. That got me four to five days. With this I have yet to have bread go bad. I can even let slices sit in the box and they stay fresh as the day they were cut. This is the best thirteen bucks I have spent.
3	1372204800	I ordered this at the same time I ordered my very first bread machine and didn't open it until I had my very first loaf of bread baking. Consequently, when I opened it up and saw huge and noticeable cracks in the clear plastic I was disappointed. I didn't bother returning it for another because I was soon to have freshly baked bread, and I didn't have anything else to store it in. Plus, the cracks didn't look like they would hinder the keeper's purpose in any way &#8212;it's a purely cosmetic issue with me, though it doesn't reflect well on the quality of the product. Not worth the time and effort to get it replaced.My only other criticism was that my first loaf of bread didn't quite fit. I got myself a machine that does 1-pound loaves, and the first recipe I tried was for French bread, which rose really, really high. I couldn't fit it in the adjustable bread keeper with the bread standing upright &#8212; not enough room, especially with the bread board inside. I had to lay the loaf on its side and kind of stuff it in there.Other than those two criticisms, the bread keeper works exactly as it should. Every loaf of bread I've made so far was kept fresh and soft, and the quality has been altogether better than store-bought bread. I've never had a loaf go bad on me yet. I keep the keeper in its &#34;open&#34; state the first day that a fresh loaf is stored (after cooling the loaf out in the open for maybe about an hour), so that any residual heat and moisture from the baking can escape, and after that I keep it partly open or closed, depending on the humidity or lack of it.So, all in all, a really good product &#8212; just needs to be a little taller and made with a more sturdy material. I'm keeping it for now, but if it ever breaks and I need to replace it, I'll probably try a similar but different product.
4	1372032000	I use a 12 inch bake pan and it does fit, but just barely. It is definitely large enough for your home baked breads in height and width though and I love that you can adjust the humidity. I make sourdough bread and it is inherent that with that kind of bread that the crust is kind of hard, at least too hard for the kids. This allows me to stop trying to make softer crust by adding oil or whatever to the top. Just close the air holes and the crust softens up. Then I am able to open them up a little and it still stays soft. I might buy another one for when I have a wheat bread in rotation along with the sourdough. And it's clear so it doesn't detract from the beauty of a home baked loaf of bread!
5	1371772800	I love the container and this helps me when I make my bread. I would definitely order from here again.
5	1371772800	this is ingenious in that it stores bread and has a slide out cutting board. good solution to homemade bread storage
1	1371600000	I found this to be useless. It did nothing for preserving my bread. I waited too long to send it back.
4	1371340800	actually the idea is very simple for this product. nothing more than just a adjustable &#34;vent&#34; but it works really well. one negative point is that the cutting board is easy to scratch.
2	1371254400	You're better off buying bread bags.  This thing helps keep the bread that I make nice and moldy.  It's still hanging out in my kitchen, waiting to see if I can repurpose it somehow.  Pretty soon it will go out in the recycling.
5	1371254400	I have had great success with this. It is easy to use and keeps bead fresh without molding which is important in Florida because of our humidity.
1	1371168000	I was originally attracted to the great idea of adjustable design and hurriedly bought it.  But , whoever invested this design has some wonderful brain that froze half way thru' his thinking process. Only if they considered how the user is going to access the bread and whether it is user friendly? and tried using this product themselves before launching the product would have improvised the design. I am sorry that a GREAT IDEA OF ADJUSTABLE BREAD KEEPER, WENT TO DRAINS ONLY BECAUSE OF POOR PRODUCT DESIGN. The one star is only for thinking about the adjustable bread box, other than that, the cutting board is utterly useless as we need to keep a longer cutting board to save the crumbs from falling down. Taking the bread out and putting it back is a chore.  Wish the next version of this product comes out with all the flaws fixed.
4	1370908800	This is the perfect bread keeper. It is made of strong material and very light weight. I keep home made bread and rolls and they do not dry out. Easy to use, well worth the purchase price.
5	1370822400	like it. keep bread fresh and moist. only one complaint is cannot cut bread in pieces good.  that's my only complaint.
4	1370563200	I purchased this item used through Amazon Warehouse.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I used it for a week storing freshly baked bread, and it really worked well.  The bread was fresh for days.  The crust stayed crisp, not soggy, and the bread lasted several days with no mold.  Then I noticed a fine crack had developed through the entire vent end of the bread keeper.  I called Amazon, and they sent a return shipping label.  Since this came from Amazon Warehouse, I could not simply get a replacement.  To get a refund, I needed to return the bread keeper and if I wished order another one from another vendor.  So far the crack had not prevented the bread keeper from working, so I began by ordering a new one.  It arrived from the seller with an almost identical crack in the vent end of the bread keeper.  Frustrated, I called the manufacturer and suggested to them there was a design flaw.  The manufacturer has sent replacements vent ends for both bread keeper, but they have not arrived.  Stay tuned . . .I received my replacement vent ends, one for each purchase, and used them extensively without further incident of cracking. I love them.
4	1370217600	a little cumbersome to use, but keeps bread fresh, we need to use it more, I think this will work well
3	1370217600	The design is awkward, but the size is right for the bread-machine sized loaves. I haven't really used it yet.
5	1370044800	I purchased two of these and really like using them.  Our fresh baked bread stays fresh and protected and the crust stays crispy, unlike when I put the bread in plastic bags.
5	1370044800	I have been making bread for a long time and had nothing but plastic bags which after a few days makes your bread stale.  After ordering this I have a great place to keep my bread and now it is fresher.  The only thing is after I got this I told so many people about it and they went on line to buy it and it had gone way way up in price.  So they say they will not be buying it until it comes back down a bit!!!!  like doubled in price?
5	1369872000	I almost bought bread bags for my bread but decided on this instead.  I'm glad I did.  This thing expands for plenty of room for your bread loaves, and I like the humidity control feature.  I'll be using this all the time for my homemade bread.
4	1369872000	This is a good container to keep your bread in.  I like the way it expands and contracts according to the size of the loaf.
5	1369872000	I MAKE OUR OWN BREAD AND WE LIVE IN FLORIDA WHICH IS ALWAYS HUMID.  THIS WILL BE WONDERFUL. I WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THE BREAD OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR WHICH JUST SUCKS THE FLAVORS OUT OF THE BREAD.
5	1369785600	My husband and I make a lot of bread, both by hand and in our machine.  I just ordered two more of these fabulous bread keepers for gifts because they are the best thing I've found to keep bread fresh and not moldy.I love that you can store the loaf right away in the keeper while still quite warm.  Just open the air holes for the steam to escape. Once the bread has cooled just close the vents.  We finished a loaf today made several days ago that was barely stale and still very enjoyable.An added feature is the little bread board that makes slicing quick and simple.I've tried a lot of bread keepers and this is the best, and at a great price.
5	1369526400	This keeps our bread fresh for much longer than normal. I figured something like this would work but I was suprised at how much longer it keeps it. This really seems to depend on the type of bread, up to a week longer isnt unheard of.
4	1369440000	It is working for us okay but it seems flimsy and I'm afraid I&#34;m going to break it. So just be aware, it is made of very thin plastic.
5	1369440000	I keep my bread I make in this and it keeps it fresh. I love it and I think I'll buy another for myself.
5	1369353600	My wife likes to prepare bread frequently and that container help us to keep soft and protected our bread due this container comes with a humidity screw that can be configured according the weather where I live.
3	1369353600	This is a great product. Unfortunately, this seller MyKitchCo sent this item so inexpertly packaged, that it arrived cracked. I will eat this expenditure, as I am not paying $10 to return a $20 item. The item came of course in its original box, but the shipping box it was in was so small and tight, that I had to cut it off of the product's box. I was so bummed that it was cracked. I'd been looking forward to it since I placed the order.
5	1369353600	Okay, so I was really, really skeptical about this keeping my bread fresh.  I figured with all that air around the bread how could it possibly be?  I have, for over a year, been baking my own bread and wrapping the loaf with a paper towel, putting wrapped loaf in a plastic gallon size zipper bag and crushing it in for it to fit.  Not only was my beautiful bread misshapen, but the bags kept breaking and wow, much money gone in bags and paper towel...  So here I see this little inexpensive box and after reading the reviews for over six months I finally reach my end with the bags, surrender and order the little box o' magic.I find it keeps the air out and the bread fresh.  My last loaf was in there for 2 1/2 days and the last slice was almost as good as the first.  There's nothing like that first slice :).  I will say, I did set aside the "cutting board" that was enclosed.  First, I didn't want to destroy the blade on my terrific bread knife, and second, when I did leave my first loaf on the cutting board, since the cutting board is small and only sat under half the loaf, the other half slumped over from being suspended in the air.  Not a nice look.I found the best way to keep the bread is to lay a folded paper towel under the bread and simply sit it on the floor of the plastic box.  It really does the job and now I can see exactly how much bread I have because it's no longer hidden while wrapped in the paper towel.To let you know how large a loaf it really can fit, I bake all my loaves in an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch cast iron loaf pan and it usually rised to between 5 and 6 inches in height when done.  The bread fits perfectly with a little wiggle room in all directions.I'm still giving it five stars instead of four because it really does the job well, but my only complaint would be that it's a bit of an annoyance to get the box open and closed (you need two hands) rather than one to just lift a lid.  I will now be looking for a new box with either a lid or a front "door" so that it's a one-handed job and I can use this box to hold my second loaf which I now realize I still have no place for.  It's a win-win as I see it.
5	1369094400	I bought a bread machine on amazon and it works great! I realized I wanted a place to store the bread and this was what I bought. I love it! It not only keeps my bread fresh but it also looks cool on my counter.
5	1369008000	Does exactly what it says. I love the fact that you are able to adjust how much air is being exchanged. The cutting board is a little bit of a joke (very small) but is nice if you need one in a pinch. Its adjustable size also allows for many different size breads.
5	1368921600	I love my new breadbox it is attractive  and keeps my baked goodies wonderfully fresh and handy.  it is very easy to use and clean.
1	1368662400	I give it one star because of the way it is packed with plastic inside and out, but no hint of how to get at it. Looks like a good item if you can get to it!
4	1368576000	At least for a day or so. Great container - makes storing and accessing small fresh bread loaves very easy.  Compact!
5	1368576000	I was looking for a way to store my home baked bread so it wouldn't go stale quickly.  This has worked out really well.  There is a lever that regulates the amount of air that goes into it.  Also, the cutting board is a nice feature.  It has guides to help you make uniform slices.I am very happy with this bread keeper.
5	1368403200	The bread usually dries out in a day or 2 in Los Angeles where I live, but with this bread keeper, I could actually extend the life of the bread to a week!  But please be sure to wash every component out for a fresh loaf of bread.  I've missed a few crumbs before and it made my bread moldy, but it's just something that's bound to happen when it's not cleaned well enough.Highly recommend!
3	1368316800	Make sure your bread is completely cooled. Maybe wrap it in a tea towel inside the container if you're not sure.
4	1368230400	This Bread keeper adjusts to fit loaf sizes and allows ventilation, which is handy for still warm, freshly baked loaves.
5	1368144000	Both my husband and I LOVE this product. The fact that it only takes up space the size of the loaf is wonderful and we love that it is see through and was so reasonably priced. My husband said &#34;Why has no one thought of this design for a bread keeper before??&#34;
3	1368144000	This box is okay, the first one arrived cracked but Amazon replaced it immediately. It would a perfect 10 in my book however if it had incorporated a slicing guide on the interior piece,
1	1368057600	broke the second day with a crack and the rubber feet kept falling off. it is now in the trash
1	1368057600	I bought this base on all the positive reviews. However, mine has a big crack at the box, and it is too small for round bread, it may fit half of loaf of wonder bread.
1	1368057600	I have had this container for just over 3 months and it has a huge crack in it from just sitting.  It was not dropped.  It is also way too short to hold a normal loaf of bread.
5	1368057600	What a great find and so glad that I took my time in researching out the different types available. For years I had been trying to find such an item to help keep my bread fresh and last a bit longer. Well, if you are like me--this it the one to buy. For you can see how much bread you have easily, you can adjust how much air you wish to enter or not enter the &#34;keeper&#34;. Its so simple, you'll love it after the first loaf and it will certainly put a smile on your face.
2	1368057600	I bought two of these hoping to replace the plastic bags in which I keep my homemade bread. I keep ALL bread in the refrigerator to reduce the possibility of mold and increase its useful life. Nowhere on the box (which you wouldn't see before you ordered anyway) or in the description here does it say what it does at the very end of the instruction booklet at the bottom of the box, which is: "Not recommended for use in the refrigerator."I called the company to ask why and was told that in their tests the boxes start to crack within weeks of being put in the refrigerator. I'm sure this is a symptom of our BPA-free-plastic world, but it would have been nice to know this BEFORE I ordered.
4	1367971200	Perfect size for homemade bread loaves.  The cutting board is a nice touch, but I think my Cutco knives are going to destroy it.  Mine came with a superficial crack in the acrylic, but I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of sending it back and getting a replacement.  It seems a little fragile, which is why I'm giving the 4/5, but I'd buy it again when mine breaks.  I am no longer wasting a lot of press n seal wrap on the bread, and that makes me happy.
4	1367971200	I have the canvas bread bag thing, and found this to keep my homemade bread longer and fresher than anything else. Mine cracked too, but still works. I recommend it.
2	1367971200	I put this in the dishwasher and the Perspex faded.  It no longer looks new. Also, the bread from my bread machine is often to big for the Keeper
5	1367798400	Access is easy, appearance good and it keeps the bread fresh for days. We will buy another for our home location.
5	1367625600	I bought this to store my homemade bread.  It works very well and since it also comes with a small cutting board it is very convenient.  I would really recommend this for bread storage.
5	1367625600	I make bread about once a week with my bread machine and its always been a struggle to use it before the bread gets too hard or  moldy - usually only a couple days. But then I found this thing and somehow it doubles the amount of time the bread remains good. I was worried about having something that took up space in the kitchen but make bread even more now that I don't have to worry. Having the mini cutting board is also nice for when the loaf is nearly done so I don't have to pull out another. The only downside is that a full 2 lb loaf is a bit too tall for the container. But standard 1.5 lb fits perfectly.
1	1367452800	They crammed this inside a box that was too small.  I believe that they cracked it before they even sent it.  They had to bend the box flaps because it wasn't large enough for it.  Then I had to pay over $10 to send them back the broken product.  Great.  I'm out over $10 and I got nothing but aggravation.  I hate these people.
3	1367366400	I like this breadbox but it's not as great as I had hoped and it really bugs my husband. The dial to open or close for airflow (based on if you live in a humid or dry climate) seems like a good idea. But it's far too easy to turn and so it gets knocked one way or the other all the time. I do like that this breadbox is tall enough to hold my 2 pound bread machine loaves though.
2	1367280000	The bread dries out quickly in it. My bread lasts longer in a sealed container.  I sometimes use this when I am transporting fresh hot bread.
5	1367280000	I am pleased with the performance of this breadbox. It allows me to open the vent in cases where the bread is still warm so it doesn't get soggy and it expands to accommodate most loaf sizes.
5	1367280000	We have recently started making all of our bread in a bread machine. Since I can only eat gluten free, it makes good sense, financially and from a quality control stand point. The problem was storing the odd shaped loaves. Then, we discovered these wonderful bread keepers. We ordered two, and stack one on top of the other. They look sleek and clean on the counter. The bonus is, there is also a cutting board in the keeper too. I highly recommend this product.
5	1367280000	This keeps bread machine bread fresh.  The bread machine loaves are very tall and oddly shaped, so it is nice to use rather than the jumbo plastic bag.
4	1366934400	Have had one of these before and dropped it and developed cracks and needed another one.  Got the same thing again, only problem is that moisture sometimes seeps in and moistens the bread.
4	1366848000	Nice product, well made and my husband said it keeps his bread fresh.  Pleased with purchase, would recommend to others
5	1366848000	I got this to store my bread after baking and it is great.  Keeps bread from getting mushy and you can cut on the board that is inside.
5	1366848000	I purchased two of these since starting to make my own homemade bread again. What I love is that I can place warm bread in here and open the vent all the way to allow the steam to escape without having it sit on my counter (which is easy access for my dog). I also don't have to pull out the cutting board every time I want a slice, since it has a removable tray that doubles as a cutting board. As long as you follow the instructions for what setting to place the air vent based on your environment, it should definitely lengthen the life of your bread.
5	1366675200	Finding a bread keeper for my 2 pound machine has been tough. Everything I looked at was too small or bread might go in but could not come out without damage. This keeper fits the bill. Loaf fits good, easy to adjust, clean and store. Good product. Happy with it.
3	1366588800	Although the Bread keeper is well made and very functional . It doesn't hold a full size loaf of bread.
5	1366502400	Works great!It does what it is supposed to do. It looks good in my kitchen and guests admire it, and it keeps my bread and rolls fresh for a few days.
5	1366502400	I have had this for over a month and it works well.  The reason I bought it is my mother has had one for many, many years and I think the design is great.  At the time I bought it, I read reviews that it was made of material that is too thin and other comments about difficulty getting the loaf in and closing the two halves. I bought it anyway.Well - it arrived well packaged and unscathed.  I guess if you buy a large loaf of sliced bread this may not be the bread bin for you but if you buy whole bread and cut it yourself, there is no problem putting the bread in the narrower half and sliding the other half with the feet on over it.  The material is just fine at the thickness they made it unless you are going to drop it on the floor a lot. I have not put it in the dishwasher and might only rarely.  I wipe it out with a damp cloth occasionally or simply shake any crumbs out - how many other bread boxes go in the dishwasher after all?  Not a lot - most don't fit or are made of unsuitable materials.I think the air holes with the adjustable closer are a nice idea, but in my experience this unit is still too tight to keep the crust on a crusty loaf from going soft even in the arid climate I live in.  The air holes could be bigger. Once I have eaten some and the loaf is short enough, I stand the bread on the cut end inside the box and spread the two halves apart a bit rather than closing it down around the bread - so there is more air around the loaf which helps.It will keep your bread fresh, looks attractive and is a relatively inexpensive bread box.
5	1366243200	The bar here was low - we were just sick of wrapping our bread in plastic wrap. This little bread box does the trick and is the perfect size for our homemade 2lb bread machine loaves. The vent provides flexibility to prevent staleness/mold and the unit overall appears to be well thought out.
3	1366156800	It is working, but I don't know how other people cut the bread with that small cutting board?  It still steams easily.
3	1366156800	Works well.  Takes some time getting  use to the dial on how much air to let through to keep the bread fresh.  But seems to do the job.
5	1365897600	The makers of this product got it right.  Space saving: as the loaf gets smaller, so does the container. Moisture control.  Cutting board. Money well spent
2	1365811200	I bought it for a gift for my sister-in-law. She opened it and it was cracked, even though both boxes were intact (the box it was shipped in and its packaged box. Now I had to mess around with getting a refund  and rebuying from another supplier. Hopefully it won't be cracked this time around. I love the idea of the box and hope it works as well as other reviews say it does.
3	1365811200	I got it at Walmart, it is good idea but it will not protect anything from sugar flies , as you know yeast baked stuff attract the sugar flies in summer as crazy, I could not left nothing they passing the window screen they are so little .  I did expected something different , I fixed it with a rubber band on one side and attached tight screen ring cut off from the big screen and now it works 100%  stupid right ?
2	1365638400	The container is smaller than advertised - it's 11" long only when both halves are touching, and it only stays together when they're overlapping at least 1", so the actual usable length is only 10" (and still it wants to fall apart). The sides are only 6.25" x 6.25 too, so there's no way you can cut a large loaf in half and make them fit side by side. It comfortably fits only standard-sized (square) loaves, and will not work for most artisan breads (French loaf or anything round will not fit no matter how good you used to be at Tetris).I usually have a couple of half-eaten loaves and one or two bagels kicking about, and was looking for an attractive and convenient way of storing those. This bread box promised a lot, and delivered nothing. If your bread is sliced or you have a few baked goodies you'd like to store, you will have to carefully pile them in one half of the box before trying not to knock it all over while sliding the other half on. You could open it without turning it onto its end, but unless all you have is a whole loaf, it will all fall over and out. The cutting board included with the box is a minuscule and therefore pretty much unusable gimmick. And you have to take everything out of the box to get at it, too.Overall, a very disappointing purchase. Might work for standard-sized unsliced loaves, otherwise useless.
4	1365638400	Bought two for homemade bread.  Seems to be keeping bread fairly fresh.  Bread doesn't mold as quickly as it seems to in the bags.  Bread still dries a little, but no worse than when it is in the fridge.  A little toasting or microwaving fixes it in a hurry!
2	1365465600	I've been making bread for a while and wanted something better than plastic bags to store it in. This got decent reviews, and it's sold on the King Arthur site as well, so I thought I'd try it. Overall I think it's a pretty good concept except if you have any kind of small bugs (like ants) in your kitchen as many of us in the south do this time of year, they are going to find their way into the bread box. So for that reason, I don't like it and if I hadn't thrown away the box already, I'd be sending it back.
4	1365465600	Great little bread box,the adjustment are automatic when placing bread and the adjustable air ducts are a nice fit, the cutting board is a plus.
2	1365292800	The concept is nice, but this product does not have a good enough seal. It lets in small fruit flies. Do not buy this product. It is a waste of money.
4	1365120000	I was looking for a box to store my home made bread and not have to use zip lock bags for every loaf I bake. I usually bake a 1lb bread but the box is adjustable so should fit a larger loaf well  too. the adjustable vent comes in handy too I also use the vent(all the way open) when for some reason i don't have enough time to cool the bread down all the way.The chopping board is not great. But that does not bother me. Just use my regular chopping board or mostly bread slicer(Norpro 370 Bread Slicer).
5	1364860800	This thing is fantastic!  I am a bread machine fanatic, and ever since I got my Rosewill Bread Machine, I have been baking a loaf or two every single week, and was sick and tired of trying to find ways to keep my bread soft and delicious.  Nothing we had on hand did the job very well at all, so I went to the web and found this beauty.  It arrived right on time and in great condition, and let me tell you this... it does it's job remarkably well!  I can even fit almost two whole loaves from my bread machine in there at the same time.  And the airflow controls?  Forget about it!  They are amazing, and keep my bread fresh and perfect for up to a week.  Honestly, I do not know how much longer it would last in there, as my family eats it all before it has a chance to go bad.To break it down: If you own a bread maker, and make a lot of home made bread, then I feel that this is definitely a worth-while purchase for you.  For the price, I was not, and still am not, disappointed in the least.  It was worth every cent, and does its job remarkably well.
4	1364860800	Unfortunately there was a crack emanating from the hole used for the aerator control, but it is just a crack, and the item does still keep bread fresh even in the dry Afghani air, so I think it is a worthwhile buy.
5	1364860800	Wow!I can't imagine this little tool can save my bread like just baked!If you are making your own bread, it is a must have item.
5	1364860800	Good product.  Were so impressed, this is our second purchase of this item.  The small cutting board is a nice feature as well.
4	1364515200	The finger tab is a bit small for larger hands to grasp. The ventilation isn't sufficient for hot bread, and large loaves as I get out of my Zojirushi bread machine are a wee bit too tall.
4	1364515200	This bread keeper is always full in our house. It's perfect and we've had to throw away (put in compost) less bread because it helps regulate how much moisture is inside. And since we love fresh bread (can't even buy a loaf anymore) this keeper has been a great addition to our kitchen. No more plastic storage bags going in the trash once a week!! One great addition to this would be a bread cutting guide... a friend gave us an old bread keeper she had, but we mostly use the bread cutting guide that goes with it.
4	1364515200	There must be something about the way it's packaged - there's parts of the design that stick out at each end, and when the whole box gets squeezed it cracks. It's not worth replacing considering the cost and hassle. And the crack doesn't degrade anything but the appearance.But overall a good product, worth about $15 IMHO.
2	1364428800	I had a similar bread keeper years ago that was quite a bit sturdier.  This one arrived cracked, UGH, despite its being in a box, wrapped with bubble wrap, and packed in a box with plenty of air bladders.  I'm too lazy to send it back, so will glue it up and make the best of it, but it is frustrating, so think about it when you order.
5	1364428800	Now that I make my own bread, I needed some sort of bread box big enough to store it in aside from using an XL Ziploc. This is great if you have a small kitchen with limited space. I love the idea of bread boxes, and some of them are real nice looking but not space efficient. This was a perfect solution, and can tuck it away in the pantry. Serves it purpose well for the price! Will be purchasing another one.
5	1364428800	This bread keeper adjusts to any loaf size and the varying needs of each loaf. I make my family's bread fresh and cut it myself, too, so this is ideal.
4	1364342400	This works pretty good, alot better than a bag. I got a bread machine for x-mas and I was storing the loaves in a zip lock. The problem was that if I didn't let the bread cool long enough I'd get condensation in the bad and then soggy bread. So if I didn't have an hour to hang around while it cooled, I'd have to leave it out for a long time and then it would get dried out. This bread keeper fixed the problem. It's easy to use, and easy to clean. I use it for muffins too. The cutting board is kind of a waste of time, but overall I am happy with this. I noticed some reviews mentioned the plastic cracking, but I have had this product for 4 months and haven't had any problems. It still slides open easy and works good. I haven't put it in the dishwasher so maybe that's where the problem comes from, high heat? It's simple to rinse out between uses so that's what I'll keep doing.
5	1364342400	This product does exactly what it says it does. I have found it to be sturdy and good quality and extends the life of my bread. If you leave a loaf out on the counter it turns into a rock overnight. In the breadkeeper the cut end will remain soft for a couple of days and the bread will be fresh for toast for up to a week or more depending on your recipe I guess, if your yummy bread lasts that long.It took me a couple of tries to dial in the optimum level of vent opening suitable for my home. I think those who gave this a negative review were not willing to read the information and figure out the vent process and why it is important.I have found that for warm bread, 3/4 open vent. Then when it cools 1/4 open. Some condensation on the inside is okay, and will keep the bread fresh. If bread is still not finished in a couple of days, I switch to full closed vent. If your home is more humid you will have better results if you leave your vent more open.
5	1364256000	This bread box is so small and lightweight and so far has kept a 2 lb. homemade loaf of bread fresh this week, plus it kept fresh bagels fresh and crusty for several days. I love how you can make it smaller as the loaf gets smaller. The &#34;crumb catcher&#34; on the little cutting board doesn't do a whole lot but having the little cutting board there is great and the fact that I don't have to keep pulling the loaf out of a plastic bag means the crumb situation has improved significantly! I'm very happy with this.
1	1364256000	I received it cracked!  I will be sending this back for a new one!  Just hope the next one doesn't come this way!
5	1364256000	Perfect holder for our household, just wait until bread cools down a bit before putting into holder to avoid moisture /condensation buildup
1	1364083200	We received the first one of these we had ordered and it was found to be broken in the shipping carton. There was no damage to the shipping cartons, it appears it was broken prior to shipping. We returned the first one that was broken and a second one was shipped to us. It was broken almost exactly the same as the first one in its shipping carton. This is not an Amazon issue it is a manufacturing issue. We returned the second one for a refund and chalked it up to this being a cheaply made product and not an item we would want.
3	1364083200	It's good in keeping the bread fresh but it does not have a quite good mechanism to open it to take bread out. It could have been better.
5	1364083200	I love this thing!  I bought a bread-maker several months ago, and don't buy the boughten "crap" anymore.  This bread-box is awesome!  So now I'm getting another, because sometimes I have two different kinds of bread in my kitchen at the same time.  I hate using any other storage system, so I'm ordering another one.
4	1363996800	I've always had a problem keeping bread fresh.  I usually just keep it in the refrigerator.  But then it's always cold and hard.  When I bought a bread machine, I thought I'd try this.  But one day after making my bread and storing it in here, it feels a bit hard.  I don't think it's the fault of the bread keeper... it's me and it's the weather here.But it's extremely easy to open and close.  I actually think it looks neat with bread inside, too.
3	1363996800	Ok, so i was tired of wrapping my bread in plastic bag and i didn't want one of those old bread boxes that look like kitchen furniture.  Came across this clear bread box and the price was in my range, I've  had it about 2 months and its pretty nice.it could  be a inch or two taller because my breads sometimes are taller than the bread box.  But you can just lay it on  its side with no issues. Has vent slide so you can let it dry out a bit then  close it to keep it moist after its done cooling..  for the price this is worth it.  Everyone says how eyes pleasing it is to see homemade bread in this nice looking clear plastic bread box.  I average 2 loafs a week so I'm pretty happy with it.
4	1363996800	I was relieved when it finally arrived and it was not a cheap product. Things look different sometimes on-line. Unfortnately, we havent had a chance to use it. My family eats all the bread at once before I even get a chance to store it. LOL
5	1363996800	Finally a bread box that adjusts its size to almost any kind of bread. The ventilation is adjustable and allows you to keep fresh bread fresh or make old bread softer if you sprinkle it with water and then keep it in the box. It will get soft again.
5	1363910400	I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  It keeps the homemade bread-machine breads soft and fresh for days and days.  Wish I had another one!
5	1363824000	I bought this at the same time I bought my bread machine, it's a great little tool to keep your breads fresh. I was a little skeptical at first but it does the job. You can put a loaf right out of your bread machine and just open the vent to let the steam out.
5	1363737600	This is one nifty liil gadget if you make homemade bread.... works really well... I just love it... and the bread...
5	1363651200	I recently started baking bread and needed something to keep it in...this bread keeper works great.  I like being able to regulate the air flow.  In fact, I like it so much, I ordered another one for the times I have two baked loaves on hand.  I recommend this product.
4	1363564800	We really like this box, as it can adjust to different sizes of loaves.  Very spacious, simple design  that works.
2	1363478400	This is definitely not made for households with children.  This broke in the first 2 days of use.  The pieces have not gone through to the point that they fall off.  I had to get packer's clear tape to use to keep it from falling completely apart.  There are now places that are re-enforced with the tape.  Very, very disappointed.
4	1363392000	Prompt shipment, nice product. Would give 5 stars if it had more comfortable handles on ends to make it easier to grip when opening and closing. May add my own.
5	1363392000	A little pricey, but it really keeps my home made bread fresh. I bought two and they work great!  I recommend highly.
5	1363219200	a one pound loaf of bread lasts us 5-7 days, so this keeps it fresh without having to use refrigerator space, highly recommended.
5	1362873600	This is a great way to store homemade breads, and allows you to adjust for humidity. It is nicely made, and has a piece you can use as a platform to cut your bread. Very please!
5	1362787200	Since I received my breadmaker as a gift, it was important to keep the bread fresh. This bread box has a &#34;vent hole dial&#34; on one side that helps you to regulate the amount of air in the box. Wonderful product.Only &#34;con&#34; is that when opening and closing the box, you may sometimes accidentally move the dial from the desired position. Now we just double check the dial. No problem.
5	1362700800	Much better than paper or plastic bags. This is the must have item if you are a home bread afficinado.
3	1362700800	I think bread keeps a *little* bit longer in this bread keeper but not by much. Despite making sure that the end holes were covered, I still found that bread and rolls got staler sooner than I thought. Also, the plastic piece that covers up the end holes is very light so it is easily moved. This can be a problem as I have inadvertently knocked the end pieces which exposed the holes and made my bread go VERY stalk VERY quickly...and by the time I realized what happened, it was too late. Bummer!
5	1362614400	My family and I started making our own bread recently. We were hoping to find something to help keep it fresh longer than just a few days. When I came across this breadbox, I figured that for the price we would give it a shot. We have been very pleased with the results. We typically make 2 pound loaves and they fit perfectly.
4	1362441600	My only problem with this is that if my bread bakes up extra high in my bread machine, it won't fit inside the container! Other than that, it keeps my bread fresh and comes with a convenient cutting board!
3	1362441600	Didn't know that bread had to be vetilated to prevent mold.  Good info with this item, but cutting the bread is awkward.  I have to lift the bread out with the small cutting board to cut.  I think that each touch provides more contamination.  This is better than having to wrap the loaf each time... maybe.  Expensive for what it is but Amazon is cheaper than other places that offer this item.
4	1362441600	Works great! The one adjustment I did was add a small cup of water inside the box to keep some moisture to the bread. This allows me to keep my bread fresh for a few extra days. Thanks!
5	1362355200	I must admit I was skeptical about this Progressive International Adjustable Bread Keeper before I bought it. I thought there is no way that this contraption could keep my home baked bread nice & fresh. I am glad I was wrong. This bread keeper is great at keeping my home baked bread products fresh. I used to keep my rolls and breads in a large Plastic container and every few days find mold on them & have to throw them out. But with this Bread keeper my rolls & bread last a lot longer than they used to so I am wasting less money. It is easy to adjust the air vent to keep everything fresh. I like the plastic bread board too, all I have to do is open the container & slice over the bread board, couldn't be easier. Everyone that bakes their own bread products should have one of these as far as I am concerned. This one is a true KEEPER.
5	1362355200	I like this very much.  there are just the two of us, so I only use 1/2 of a loaf and freeze the other half.  I think that 1/2 loaf fits more easily than a whole loaf would although a loaf would fit in as well.  It keeps the bread well in a humid climate(Florida)  It can be set for dry climates as well.
5	1362355200	I love to bake bread. That having been said, I HATE dried out bread. My family cannot manage to close any bread bag. Apparently, its just to difficult to figure out. This has saved them from a crazed baker! I also love the fact that its clear so you know what you are saving instantly. After all, every time you open it, you are letting air in. I think this would make a great gift for the baker in your life. I also purchased a cutting guide.
4	1362355200	I got sick and tired of trying to squeeze bread machine loaves into plastic bags that didn't fit, so I ordered this. it keeps the bread very fresh, however it's a little clumsy to work it. It slides out fine, but you have to pull all the pieces apart to cut, and the &#34;cutting board&#34; is tiny so it doesn't help that much to keep crmbs from going everywhere.Still, compared to pulling a loaf out of a bag and cutting it in a separate board, it's not that  much more of a pain to keep it fresh.
4	1362268800	I really like this product it does seem to keep our breads fresher for a longer period of time. We have a two pound bread machine that nicely makes pound and half loafs but if we make a two Pound loaf I don't know if the height of the bread will fit into the  bread keepers. I really like this product and would highly recommend it to friends who are bread makers.
5	1362268800	I have my children on a preservative, dye, and flavoring free diet. When I started this it was very clear that I was going to have to learn to make my own bread. I bought a breadmaker but couldn't keep a loaf fresh for more than 2 days before it would turn hard, crumble, or mold. I bought this and a loaf easily last a week with no issues.
5	1362096000	Great little gadget.  Has adjustable air flow to keep bread fresh and mold free.Certainly worth the money.Washes and stores easily.
5	1362009600	I previously would throw my bread in a baggie and into the fridge which was OK, but by the end of the loaf, it would get a little stale or less fresh let's say.  I make bread every week.  And as it's just me eating, this bread keeper definitely keeps it fresher longer!  I love that it's adjustable and has a small cutting board inside.  The handy little "feet" on the bottom are nice too.  The best part is the humidity regulator that lets you vent according to the seasons and humidity levels in your home.  Great product!
5	1362009600	perfect solution for keeping breads, very convenient and user-friendly and to top it all off elegant!! looks great on my marble counter.I am not using the cutting board, because its too small (if you keep it inside, it makes handling much too complicated, too), but the technology of adjusting the size of the box is fabulous!tip for usage, i flip the box over -  so that it lays on its back - then i pull the front (which is now the top) up - fill the bread - close the top - flip it back - done - messfreecongratulations on this inventionsi will order 4 more for my family!thanks!
5	1362009600	Recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their bread fresh.  I bought this to complement the bread maker we have as it would be a shame to spend the effort in making bread... and not giving it the care it needs to stay fresh.
5	1361923200	Nice little container to keep bread fresh, much better than plastic bags.  The adjustable air vent works great for crustier bread, and extends to fit a 2 lb. loaf.
1	1361750400	Was looking for a container to keep bread in, and this one seemed perfect until after I received it, I saw how it came apart in the middle and with no lock to keep it from completely seperating in half. It just doesn't work well as I had hoped it would.
4	1361664000	Ordered this bread keeper for our homemade bread.  It works very well.  The only negative is that the company took forever to get it to us.  I even had to contact them to see what happened.  They did answer my email though.
5	1361491200	Works great with the loaves that come out of my bread machine.  Looks good too, hand wash it (the cutting board can go in the dishwasher) carefully so you don't scratch it and it will look great for years!  (ours is 2 yrs old now but I wanted to review it because it works so well for us)
5	1361491200	I just got into baking my own bread and didn't like keeping it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.  This keeps fresh baked goods fresh much longer and no need to refrigerate it!
4	1361491200	This is a nice product the does keep the bread from either drying it out or making it soggy.  Would recommend this to anyone.
5	1361491200	We use this every time we make homemade bread.  It's a great little gadget and has earned its keep in the number of loaves it has kept fresh for the second or even third day.
5	1361404800	my bread machine bakes loaves that nothing else other then bags fit it.. this works perfect.. and keeps the bread nice.
5	1361404800	Excellent, a little apprehensive at first because of the unusual design, but when I started to use it any apprehension quickly fell away. Keeps the bread fresh and easy to use.
5	1361404800	Progressive International Adjustable Bread KeeperThis link will take you to an amazing product.  We live in an area where you cannot usually leave your bread out without it molding quickly.  This little product not only vents with enough air to prevent the molding it also keeps it fresh and with the see through advantage so you can see who has whittled your masterpiece down and be able to plan for the next bake.  We also use the cutting board that is included and is always available for it sits right inside the keeper...
5	1361318400	Keeps my homemade bread fresh for at least a week.  The cutting board allows you to slice without getting out another cutting board.  Money well spent.
5	1361318400	This is ammazing Bread keeper.  It keeps my breads fresh and doesn't take up a lot of space.  I have been storing my bread in the microrave because I have little counter space.  Now I don't have to brother moving the bread in and out of the microrave. Very reasonable price.
5	1361232000	I bought it with my Panasonic bread maker last month. Now my wife bakes and keeps the bread fresh in this keeper all the time. We are using it on daily basis. Good quality light polycoranobate material used to make it. Easy to clean. Nice design too.
4	1361232000	I started making my own bread and did not know where to keep it. This Bread Keeper does the job. The quality of the product is ok, and the size is perfect for a baked loaf of bread.
4	1361232000	It is a little awkward to open, but it does keep my bread fresh, and is better than wrapping it in plastic wrap.
4	1361145600	I have no real complaints about the bread keeper. It's durable, the included cutting board is useful and the bread stays fresh. It serves its purpose! I like it!
5	1361059200	I have a small kitchen and this bread keeper's as close to perfect as I have found to store and serve my homemade bread.The little cutting board inside is very nice and provides a visual to help you learn to slice bread - which is easy after you do it a few dozen times. The adjustable air venting works well and added several extra days of freshness to my homemade bread life. Usually Hubby and I finish a loaf of Oatmeal Sandwich Bread in about 5-6 days, and I've never had a loaf of bread mold since I bought this keeper in Sept '12.The plastic is sturdy for it's thickness, and it feels sturdy enough to last for years if treated well. It does scratch easily, but that's true of any shiny transparent plastic. I dropped the non-vent side on floor accidentally and it did not break or crack, so it's pretty hardy. I've always washed it by hand.To deal with crumbs from slicing, I place the keeper on a tea towel. I let the crumbs fall on it when slicing or getting a piece of bread out and after I'm finished I close the keeper, slip the tea towel out and flip crumbs into the trash. Works great for me!
5	1360972800	I bought this because it takes me a while to get through a loaf of bread by myself & it tends to start drying out.  I don't like the idea of freezing bread.  It really helps keep the bread fresh till I can get through it all.  I have also used it to keep blue berry muffins fresh for the better part of a week!It seems to be well designed.  I like the adjustable vent & the mini &#34;cutting board&#34;.  Super easy to use, just pop the bread in and press together till snug.  Started using this within 20 minutes after it was delivered (just gave it a quick wash & dry first) & it's been in use 24/7 since.
4	1360972800	Works well for the price, but I always leave the vent completely open as there is lots of moisture inside.
5	1360972800	fits bread machine loaves, especially with little white &#34;cutting board&#34; removed (don't use it anyway). Very easy to open/close, easy to clean.
5	1360886400	I had just purchased a bread machine and this proved to be a nice find.  I am pleased with it in particular because you can adjust it according to the amount of bread that you are storing and also it had the vent on the side.  I had one before, but this one is a much better product.. The other was not adjustable and this is a nice feature that keeps the bread in place as it is being used.  Good product..
5	1360800000	I don't bake my own bread and don't intend to. That said, I do freeze quality baked goods, like bagels, hoagie rolls and multi-grain breads, so taking select amounts out of the freezer and dumping them into the box, usually with humidity control set to very low, I get great results. Nicer than plastic bags and takes up a very small footprint on my limited counter space. Very happy with this purchase. Oh, the cutting board is barely functional, but so what? I've got boards and killer Zyliss bread knives so the box is only used for keeping fresh and of course, being able to see at a glance from across the kitchen what is in it. NOTE: I avoid the slight clumsiness that could ensue from handling two haves of a box that you pull apart or push together by putting the box on top of a small bamboo cutting board, with the board handle facing me on the counter. That way I'm not reaching for a box, I'm simply putting my finger on the handle tip, sliding the entire board and box over to me on the counter and then getting what I want out of it. Amazon, Amazin Stuff!.
4	1360713600	I really like this product, however, my bread machine makes loaves that sometimes are a little bit fatter than the keeper can hold. I don't notice that it keeps the bread any longer than it lasts in a plastic bag.
4	1360713600	So far this has done exactly what is suppose to do.  Your bread keeps much longer in one of these.
3	1360713600	Devolvi o produto pq nao chegou a tempo no meu hotel. Nao tenho como avaliar pois nao tive qualquer contato com o mesmo.
4	1360713600	I bought this for my gluten free bread when I make some in a machine.  The adjustable openings helps with the freshness and keeping the moisture from building up.
5	1360368000	this is a decent little bread box for homemade bread loaves. easy to open/close. has an adjuster knob to adjust the air flow in/out of box.
4	1360195200	This is fantastic. Really has helped increase the longevity of our homemade bread. I like the mini cutting board that comes with it as well.
5	1360108800	My husband bought me two of these for my homemade bread.  They really work!  Homemade bread stays nice and fresh for at least two weeks without making the keeper humid, which really surprised me.  I had a slice today from a loaf that was a week old, and it tasted like I just made it.  If you make more than a single loaf at a time (my favorite recipe makes 2 loaves), then I recommend getting two.  The keeper easily pays for itself.
5	1360022400	I bought this because my bread machine loaves do not fit in my other bread savers.  It seems to work very well.
5	1359849600	I had tried keeping my bread in an air tight snap top container.  This was not a good idea as the bread would begin to mold after a couple of days.  I ordered The Progressive International adjustable bread keeper from Amazon and was very please that it arrived in less than 48 hours with my Prime shipping.  The keeper is large enough to hold the large loaves which I bake in my bread machine.  So far I have put a 3 lb loaf inside the keeper, but I usually bake a 2.5 lb.  I like the adjustable air control.  I live in TX where it is humid so I adjust it with a few holes open.  So far no mold!  As the loaf gets smaller the keeper gets shorter.  It comes with a small plastic cutting block inside.  I liked this keeper so much that I purchased another one in case I have two loaves at the same time.  The keeper seems sturdy.  I do not put it in the dishwasher but wash by hand instead.  Overall I am very pleased with this produce and would recommend it.
4	1359590400	It is what it says it is.  The loaves from my bread machine fit into this with no problem.  If the loaf is still a bit warm, you can open the vents so that moisture doesn't condense inside and make the bread soggy.  I doesn't take up lots of room.  It fits into a bread drawer on or the counter without taking up too much precious counter space.  It is easy to clean and attractive.  Not overly designed.
5	1359504000	I will buy another as we make about 3 loaves of bread a week. I recommend this storage unit highly
5	1359417600	We just got a bread maker and needed something to store our freshly baked bread in.  This thing does the trick.  Easy to maintain, clean and store.  Couldn't be more happy with the purchase.  If this one ever breaks I'll be reordering right away.
3	1359331200	I bake own bread a lot. I stored my bread in ziploc bags and I was very happy to find this bread box for reusable purposes. Big disappointment.Delivery took forever. I ordered this bread keeper on January 9th and got it on 24th.Bread keeper itself very uncomfortable to use and seems like doesn't really serve it's purpose. I can't fit in this box bread bigger than 1,5 pounds. Smaller breads get dry out just in a couple hours even with completely closed vents.box made of thin cheap plastic and it is a mater of time when it will break. Also the cutting board is very small. U can't cut ur bread on that little piece of plastic. I end up with crumbs all over of place when i open or close  the box because air under pressure pushes them out. I would say it is a great idea but purr design.
2	1359331200	It's a great idea on paper but it just doesn't cut it. Took it to a picnic and because this does not seal and allowed gnats in. A plastic bag just for bread would have done nicely. Save your money and buy plain plastic bread bags.
5	1359244800	I bought a Panasonic bread-maker for New Year, and before I got this box, my bread would be dry after 3-4 days. Now I can eat it all the way to the end, 4-5 days in, and it is still deliciously soft and moist.
5	1359158400	Gave this to my wife for Christmas and I have been eating great bread ever since.  We highly recommend it.
5	1359072000	I use this bread keeper for storing loaves of bread that I make in my bread machine. It keeps the bread fresh for several days longer than putting it in a plastic bag. It is easy to control the moisture of your bread by adjusting the vent, so I don't have to worry about the bread molding before I use it.
4	1359072000	I love how this clear box looks in my kitchen, I usually put it in my pantry, but it look so pretty, I make my own sandwich bread, which I put it inside of this box, and my bread still good for a week, I also put some bolillos (mexican bread) in this container, and they also last!!
5	1359072000	This bread keeper has a robust design that keeps my children's gluten free bread intact. No more messy plastic ziplock bags strewn about in the fridge. This keeper has it's own space in the fridge which the kids can easily access. I stick it in the dishwasher, top rack & no heat, without difficulty. I can also admire my bread creation, with it's well-risen crumb and beautifully-browned crust, due to the keeper's transparency. For the nominal fee I paid for this product, it's well worth the money spent many times over. The product also shipped in time, and it was packaged very well.
5	1359072000	This is such an improvement over plastic bags for keeping our home-made bread.  Vendor was quick o deliver and it just what we needed.
2	1358985600	It's quite flimsy. The bread board is tiny & the crumbs get everywhere. It also doesn't keep the bread fresh for longer than one day. I was disappointed.
5	1358985600	I have had this bread box for about 6 months. My husband and I are both amazed at how fresh it keeps the bread!  We use it to store homemade bread as well as store bought loaves - works great!
5	1358985600	I had a different one of these similar design but smaller this one is a better design and larger plus it has a little cutting board
5	1358985600	Very amazed! So needed a good bread keeper for homemade bread and this one is great! I love the design, it doesn't take up much space on the island in my kitchen a big plus because I have a very small kitchen and not much counter space. The cutting board inside is nice, the bread sits nicely on top of it, a little difficult to pull out and use but maybe with a little practice? The humidity control is amazing, we put a fresh loaf in warm left the control open and bread is perfect, closed it when bread was cool. 2 days later that same loaf is still wonderful! Beats plastic wrap 200%! I live in Arizona where it is dry most of the year but do see high humidity during our stormy season in the summer and this keeper is going to save my bread! Highly recommend! Thanks so much for a great product! Ordering another for my gluten free loaves!
5	1358985600	I love having this handy bread keeper to keep all of our loaves fresh. It works great for a batch of muffins or cookies too!
5	1358899200	Excellent great holder for our square bread from our bread machine.  I love how it slides out and fits the bread as it gets eaten.  Great idea and product.
5	1358899200	I purchased this at Christmas.  We have been storing our bread in this keeper since then.  This works very well for our household.  It keeps bread fresher better than the fridge.  It holds the bread maker size loaves, but doesn't take up unnecessary space.  And you have a clear view of the loaf!  The only downside is I am afraid I will scratch or break the plastic - but it hasn't happened yet.  I am very happy with my purchase and would not hesitate to recommend it to others!
5	1358726400	I had been searching for a bread keeper that would fit a fat loaf of homemade bread and this one works great. I like that it adjust down pretty small. The vent helps keep the bread fresh.
3	1358640000	I was under the impression the bread could go from bread maker to bread keepr, but the keeper immediately filled with condensation, so I allow the bread to cool almost completely before putting it in the bread maker. I haven't noticed that the bread stays any fresher than putting it in a plastic bread, but it's a handy little container for the bread. I like the adjustable feature and the little cutting board--just about the right size for the shape of bread that comes out of my bread maker.
5	1358640000	This really keeps the bread fresh, and I love that I'm not wasting Ziplock bags anymore. I know I haven't handled it roughly, and there's already a crack in the top, but otherwise the quality is good, and I don't think the crack affects the preservation of the bread. I would purchase again.
5	1358467200	love this bread keeper for my homemade breads  fit in  great from my west bend high rise breadmaker. shows the bread nicely. tip don't put this item in the dishwasher  this will damage it.
5	1358467200	I was looking for a bread keeper that will allow me to keep my homemade bread soft for more than a day. So far, my bread is kept soft for days. I have a small family so I only make a 1.5 Ib per week and the bread stays fresh til the last slice. I absolutely love this keeper. Try it!
3	1358380800	it's good but I ended up storing most of my bread in the freezer pre-cut and sealed for freshness.  I would just find a cheap linen sack to store the bread in easier to clean up and doesn't take up as much counter space.
3	1358208000	I don't use this item and am unqualified to rate either its use or function.  The only reason that I have this item is because it came as part of a package along with the bread machine.
3	1358035200	This box does an excellent job in keeping bread fresh 4 to 5 times longer. However, it&#8217;s made very flimsy and is subject to slip out of one hands because the plastic is very smooth. Typically something dropped once might survive without even a scratch but not this thing. I dropped mine from a couple feet (which was clumsy of me) but the thing almost shattered. It was intact enough for me to use clear tape on the outside and still be able to use it but that makes it ugly. If you buy this you&#8217;d better not be accident prone because chances are you&#8217;ll trash it the 1st slip you have.By the way, my friend ordered one and it arrived crushed in the box. He got a replacement quickly and without hassle.
5	1357948800	Product exceeded my expectations. Constructed well and the ability to adjust to the size of your loaf is a plus. It looks nice sitting on the counter and you can see at a glance how much bread you have left. I have kept bread in it for up to 4 days and it still tastes fresh without drying out. I cannot attest to how it does after 4 days sense my bread never lasts longer than that due to hungry people who love fresh home baked bread. I have tile floors so I am careful not to drop it. It appears to be made of Lexan so it would probably survive the fall, but I would rather not test that right now. I live in Washington state and have a good deal of moisture in the air so I keep the adjustable vent open to one hole, this seems to be perfect for our humidity. A few times I have placed the whole unit in the microwave and zapped the bread for 30 - 45 seconds to warm it up and it works great for that purpose. I am getting another one to keep my bananas in to separate them from my other fruits so they will last longer. My friend has one and uses it for this reason and she is very happy with the results.
5	1357862400	I'd been thinking about buying this for a year, and finally decided to give it a try. I can't believe how well it works. I want it for my bread machine loaves, but am also using it for some store bought items. It doesn't quite hold a whole store bought loaf, but I just place what I can in it and eat the few slices that don't fit out of the bag first. I don't know if this is how the old bread boxes worked, but it really keeps the bread fresh for a long time. It was well worth the price, and I will be buying another for me and some for gifts.
5	1357776000	This is a wonderful bread keeper.  The bread stays fresh for a few days instead of being dried out the 2nd day.  I've tried plastic bags, storing the bread on the cut side, sealable plastic dishes and always had the same result, dried out bread.  I love that you can control the amount of moisture/air that goes into the container.  It was worth the price for me.
5	1357776000	I was so excited to purchase a bread machine, ran home, and made a batch immediately. Silly me, I totally forgot to consider what I would store the bread in.  I did a lot of reading a research to find out the best way to store bread machine bread.  There are so many opinions out there, it's hard to know which method actually works.  And I make bread to eat it, I don't want to freeze it for later.  I like to be able to grab a slice whenever I want to eat it plain, make a sandwich or toast.  I tried keeping the fresh bread cut side down on a cutting board and covering with a towel.  To get a soft piece I had to slice off the end and then slice the real piece...after just the first day!  So I ended up wasting a fourth to half a loaf of bread!  So when I received this bread keeper, I made a loaf of bread 6 days ago, let is cool, sliced it up, placed it directly into this bread keeper.  And today, on day 6, I was still able to grab a soft slice to enjoy for breakfast.  So simple, easy, and really works!  A great solution to storing bread machine bread.  Keep in mind, you don't have to use plastic wrap or paper, you just buy this box and that's it.  Much better for landfills if you ask me.  It is not nearly as bulky as an actual breadbox, which is a huge plus.  Bread boxes take up too much space on the counter.  This would make a great gift for anyone else that owns a bread machine!
5	1357689600	I just received the bread keeper and I am really impressed with it.  The packaging was perfect.  I received it in great shape, not damaged or anything and I really like the design.  I am really satisfied with it and I would recommend it to others.
5	1357689600	I purchased one a few months ago and am purchasing a second now to keep a second loaf of bread or bagels in.  For the first day after I make bread I leave the vents open, then after that I keep them closed and the bread stays fresh for about 5-7 days.  I have even sliced the whole loaf and kept the slices in the box and the slices stayed fresh and soft, not dry or moldy.  I love it!
5	1357603200	I already have one, bought somewhere else & paid a lot more.I live in a humid area & the adjustability is perfect for storingstorebought & homemade bread.If  I had room on my counter, I would buy 2 more.It stores bisquits , rolls & cookies as well as bagles & bread.
3	1357603200	we used to keep our bread for a long time in our refridgerator. So, we wanted to keep homemade bread fresh on the countertop. This did not really work but it does work when we keep it in the refridgerator. We wrap the beard in a paper towel to control the moisture. It works well but is very hard to handle taking it out of th refridgerator. Over all, it works well but difficult to handle.
5	1357516800	Holds two 1-lb loaves or larger 2-lb loaves easily.  Moisture control works well.  Like the fact that it adjusts to fit the size of the loaf.  Can easily tell when it's time to bake more bread.
5	1357430400	I've been looking for a bread box for a long time.  I didn't want to keep bread on my counter, and not in the fridge, and the bags were annoying.  I don't have a lot of counter space.  This keeps the bread on my counter and visually takes up very little space, clean looking, expandable, easy to access, no bags... perfect!
3	1357171200	So far I have only tried to store two loaves in this box since getting it for Christmas, but both have been rather disappointing.On Christmas morning I made a loaf of orange cinnamon bread. After storing it in the box, it was dried out by Dec. 27th and I threw the rest away on the 28th. Two-three days is not the shelf life I was expecting, since wrapping the bread in plastic wrap usually yields 4-6.Right now I have a loaf of ricotta chive bread in there, which came out with a wonderful crust. However, letting the bread cool in the box with the holes open turned my crispy crust to chewy toughness. Perhaps that was my mistake but it does say "for warm baked goods" on the holes open side. I can forgive that but last night, again on the third day after baking, I could tell the bread was getting too dry (holes still open).Next time I bake I will wrap in plastic and then contain it, but doesn't that defeat the purpose? So far it seems the best thing about this box is having a "dedicated" place for your bread to catch the crumbs, and the little cutting board that comes with it.
2	1356998400	Its inconvientent to have to pull apart to place or remove the bread. It doesn't keep an airtight seal, causing the bread to go stale. I would not recommend this product.
5	1356998400	I love this! My bread is soft for 5 or so days (wrapped in saran wrap it would last 2 days here in the dry Arizona weather). The crumb catcher doesn't work the greatest, but that wasn't why I bought it and the tray does at least help a little. If you make homemade bread this is a must item!
2	1356998400	We bought the whole deal, the bread machine, the books, the slicer, and the keeper.  We do not use this as it would be better to reuse an old bread bag.  Doesn't work.
4	1356912000	I've used this about a month now and I'm very happy with this bread keeper.  Our homemade bread lasts longer than it did in plastic bags.  The little cutting board is very convenient and stores right inside the bread keeper along with the bread.  It holds a 2lb loaf without any problem.  The vent allows you to select the appropriate air flow for ultimate storage.  It's low-tech but works well.
4	1356739200	I ve had this product for over a year now and I really love it. I normally bake bread twice or 3 times a week and it allows me to keep what remains of it fresh and well stored. My only complain is that the plastic board on the bottom keeps the smell of what is put on it and it is difficult to remove it, even after intense cleaning
5	1356739200	I bought this to store bread that I make in my bread machine. It is so useful I bought a second one to give to my mother as a Christmas gift.
5	1356739200	Works with all loaf sizes. Keeps bread fresh an mold free much longer. Simple to learn to use for bread and pastries.
5	1356566400	My 2 lb bread loaves fit perfectly, the little breadboard is small but useful. I like  the fact that you can shrink it down as the bread loaf gets smaller. I've had no problems with cracks and it keeps the bread fresh. Would buy again in a heartbeat.
5	1356566400	Amazing little product.  Ordered this for my parents for Christmas, as they use their bread machine every other day to make fresh bread.  Mom always likes to transport her bread, but hasn't found something that it fits well into.  This works great!  Able to vent the bread if desired.  Keeps it fresh, and the fact that bread maker loaves fit into it perfectly was the best part!  Would definitely order another one of these for the days when they make two loaves, one for home and one for take-a-long.
5	1356566400	the box kept my baked poppyseed leaf soft ad fresh for over 1 week.  very nice product.  I wish it was a bit smaller though.  takes up space on the counter.  but it does as promised.
4	1356480000	had one years ago,it was very good. I like the cutting board. you can  use this for other things as well.
4	1356480000	We picked up a zojirushi breqad maker and this keeper for the bread. It works well with a vent to control humidity and it slides to size with the bread as the loaf reduces.
5	1356480000	This box keeps my bread fresh without using a bag.  It has a knob that turns and allows a little air in or no air in.  I've had a loaf of bread in this box for nearly a week and its as fresh as it was when I made it (keeping it on no air coming in).  Very happy with this purchase and the price was great.
5	1356480000	Got this to go with a bread machine and who wouldn't want this to go with and store all the bread you make with a machine???  Great quality plastic - thick - rigid and solid - the ability to store without getting stale is the idea and this will do it.
4	1356393600	I use this to keep my bread and other food fresh. You can adjust the switch to maintain the mist level. Like it
1	1356220800	This product was very defective, with the slider missing and the vent with no  holes or a moveable  adjustment. As always got my money returned, but disappointed could not order a replacement.
5	1356220800	We were putting our bread in a zip lock bag, having to get the cutting board out every time we wanted to slice it & it seemed to get moldy fast in the bag, plus I didnt like the looks of a bag sitting on the counter either, so I researched amazon for bread keepers & I liked what I read about this one, price, style, etc.  It includes a cutting board & even though it seems like having a vent would dry it out, it actually keeps bread fresher. As you use bread the container closes up smaller so takes up less space, unlike other keepers. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1	1356220800	The packaging of the original product is not too bad. However, the shipping packaging was terrible. There is a crack on the item when received, which proves that the product not only looks cheap but is way to fragile!!! Very disappointed.
2	1356048000	Even tho this item was listed as a 'bought with' the bread maker I purchased, I highly doubt anyone was happy with it.  The bread maker in question makes three sizes, but only the smallest size will fit.  I have kept it because to send it back would have cost nearly $7 - I will keep it for the occasional fruit bread I make.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone unless you only make small loaves,
5	1355961600	Works well for home made bread. I also use it for loaf pan breads/cakes. Keeps all nice and moist, provide easy cutting of a sclice when needed.
5	1355961600	Really!  What could go wrong?  It's only a container....  The vent holes provide just the right amount of air to keep the bread fresh.
4	1355961600	It's a nice bread keeper, any loaf I'm making in my bread maker fits inside. Cutting board is useless for me because it's size even less than size of bread loaf, and if you will use it for slicing bread, you'll have tons of crumbs on your table. Ordering it I was concerned if bread will dry quickly in this box, because I always used zip-lock bags and this keeper can't be completely sealed. Well, it's not much worse than zip-lock bags, bread stays soft and fresh for couple of days, and I don't need longer - even in zip-lock bag bread is not really fresh on 3rd day anyway. I don't know why they made vent holes - I never need to open them because it makes bread dry faster, I even sealed them with scotch-tape. The one thing - I know this type of clear plastic bread keeper is made of, it's not sturdy and very easy breaks and cracks. I'm trying to be careful, but I'm pretty sure this bread keeper wouldn't survive if I would accidentally drop it on vinyl kitchen floor. For over $13 I would like to see better and more sturdy plastic. But overall, I satisfied and like this bread keeper. It's not as wasteful as throwing away dosens of gallon bags every year.
4	1355961600	I live in a humid climate. I have had chronic problems with bakery bread molding after 2-3 days. This little box with the vents open keeps the bread fresher and keeps longer. You close the ends if you are in a dry climate. Small footprint on counter, unlike other bread boxes.
5	1355875200	I bought this with the bread maker.  My daughter has used it and says it works well for her.  It's just the right size.
5	1355875200	Great strudy construction. I love this so much I have bought it for others for presents. I love how you can adjust the air intake as required for different kinds of bread and enviroments. Easy to clean and maintain. You can view your bread as you consume it and shrink it down to a smaller area to keep the air away from it. I use my all the time for fresh bread and even used it for store bought bread when I didn't have enough time to make more bread and bought some.
2	1355875200	The product came damaged. I wanted to exchange it for another one. I had it in my cart but it is not exchangeable for the exact item.
1	1355788800	It also turned dark and the knobs keep falling out. A more traditional bread keeper could be more practical long term.
5	1355702400	Quality matches the price. This Bread Keeper works and looks good. It is a bit silly to review a bread box but I have found this very useful and hope this review helps someone. It keeps break fresh much longer and in a household where bread is often thrown away after it goes bad this has saved us quite a bit of money I am sure
2	1355616000	I intend to use this to store 1/2 loaf of bread made from my bread machine. It doesn't seem to be able to keep the bread fresh. I get better result using saran warps. This is going back.
3	1355529600	There is a small, adjustable vent to manually regulate the moisture level. Perhaps I've never gotten it quite right, but a loaf never lasts longer than a week in my house.
4	1355529600	Easy to open, fits all sizes of loaves from 1lb to 2lbs plus  It's plenty durable too because I accidentally dropped it and it didn't even mark let alone break.  It's inexpensive and I'm going to get one for my Mom and another for my sister.
5	1355529600	We use this for our bread machine maker bread and it fits just right. use daily and very happy with price and quality of product!
5	1355356800	This breadbox is very convenient.  It's just the right size for the loaves I make in my bread machine, and it's been doing a great job of keeping my bread from going stale.  (I'm on my own so it can take a week for me to eat it all.)  The cutting board is handy too; now I just wish I had a bread knife that was small enough to fit inside.  I've only used this for a semester, but it's been nice and sturdy so far.  I'm going to give one of these to my little brother for Christmas : )
1	1355356800	I make breads - 1.5 - 2 lb loaves and it wasn't able to hold my bread, the container was not long enough. If you buy this make sure it's for a very skinny 1-lb loaf!
4	1355356800	I needed something to keep our homemade bread fresh and accessible. This does both. It lives on the kitchen counter next to the toaster. The cutting board that comes with it (the white square in the picture) is surprisingly useful although it seems to be too soft to last forever. Knives seem to make some nasty cuts in it. When it becomes too chewed up to use, I'll make a new cutting board out of some larger cheap cutting boards picked up at the local restaurant supply store.
5	1354924800	I would recommend this bread keeper because it works. It is compact enough not to take up much space and can be used for storing other baked goods. Also it is durable.
5	1354752000	The bread keeper does a good job of keeping bread fresh. It is a lot more convenient and economical than a bag. The included cutting board is a very nice feature.I would suggest this to anyone who likes to bake their own bread.
5	1354665600	I bought this for my daughter and she uses it all the time for the bread she makes in her bread machine.  She likes the adjustable feature for humidity control.
5	1354665600	Once you figure out how the parts fit together, this is a useful kitchen gadget. No longer any need to search the cupboards for baggies that will fit odd-sized bread loaves.
5	1354665600	bread stays fresh.........no stale...............no mold.  Just  nice bread. really nice bread that I eat. would reccomend to friend or foe.
5	1354579200	This is really a great bread keeper for bread baked in a bread machine.  It is easy to get together and keep the bread frest.  Would recommend this to anyone who uses a bread machine.
5	1354492800	I started baking my own breads recently and I didn't like putting them in storage bags on my counter. They didn't last as long as I would like and distorted the shape of the slices so I purchased this bread keeper in the hopes that it would work out better for my needs and it does. The only issue I can see is that it may not hold a whole loaf of bread but frankly since there is just the two of us I only keep out 1/2 loaf of bread so this product actually fits my needs perfectly. I like the vent in the back that helps keep my bread fresher in the climate I live. It looks a lot better then a plastic bag with slices of bread in it as well as being completely functional.
4	1354492800	I haven't used this as much as I thought I would... but I do try to remember to use it when I make bread in the bread maker. I do bake bread fairly often and it's great for the bread maker bread. However when I switch off to the round loaves or individual bread buns... I have to find something else to hold that shape of bread.
4	1354492800	Well, i bought this to try and keep our homemade bread fresh but was not successful. However, i have found it keeps bananas fresh for a long time if you keep all air holes closed. Love this accidental find!
5	1354320000	This item is fantastic! Not sure where the poor reviews come from but I think this is brilliant, it has kept my home cooked bread fresh for nearly a week!! Fantastic!
5	1354147200	Excellent item. Cute design, great size, fits in any place, protects the bread from moisture. Keeps bread fresh. Excellent choice, I recommend it.
5	1353974400	This is a great storage keeper for bread. It keeps bread fresh and easily fits a 2 pound loaf. I will definitely buy another one so we can have two different types of loaves at once. The bags are no longer any use for me after using this.
2	1353888000	I bought this when I first got our bread machine and I really tried to use it, but the bread doesn't stay fresh no matter how you adjust the air holes, and its really too bulky once half the loaf is gone.  I make 100% of our bread, and I ended up going with disposable plastic bread bags, even though I generally try not to use disposable plastic.
5	1353801600	I use it daily to keep my bread machine bread fresh.  It's easy to access and easy to clean.  Economical way to store bread without needing bags.
3	1353715200	Bread kinda fits, the sides kinda go together, the air vent kinda works. I do use it, not thrilled or anything.
5	1353628800	Love it so much!  Plastic bags made the crust all tough and rubbery.  Keeping out on the bench was fine but where I live flies and bugs are in abundance.  I pop the bread in this container with the dial set to open and there's plenty of air getting in to keep the crust crunchy but the holes are too small for bugs to get in. I looked at those traditional bread tins for ones that let air in but they all had gaps that would let an insect crawl through - yuk. Once I've cut into the loaf I put the cut side down on the board to keep the cut part soft.  Has a very cool modern look too and doesn't take up anywhere near the space of those big bread tins.
5	1353369600	This bread box totally fits the bill. First, I needed something smaller. Most bread boxes are way too large. This one neatly holds one loaf. It keeps the bread fresh for a long time without any mold growing. My husband and I don't seem to eat bread fast, so a breadbox has to do the job. I love being able to see the bread too, then I know when I need more. It looks nice on the counter too!
5	1353110400	We are totally happy.  The size is just right, as well as the adjustable air flow working effectively. As the unit is rejoined, the seal is apparent.
5	1352937600	Just started making my own bread a month ago. I have made 4 loaves & store in adjustable bread keeper in the refrigerator. Really like the bread keeper! Very easy to use: can adjust the vent according to humidity level, handle on one end allows for easy opening/closing & tray on the bottom is a cutting board. I have read that homemade bread will last about 3-4 days in refrigerator, but I'm finding that it lasts a week or even a few days more, if a little dry then we use for toast.Plus the bread maker loaves are bigger than store bought, I'm baking 1.5# loaf, but fit perfectly in bread keeper. Of course, it's easily washed & reusable, so your not contributing to landfill with plastic bags. Don't know if you could even find a cloth bag & that might take on odors from other food in refrigerator. Reasonably priced as well. HIGHLY recommend it!
5	1352851200	Keeps bread fresh! It adjusts to the size of the loaf and allows excess moisture to leave, keeping the bread from being soggy.
4	1352764800	This bread keeper is very nice.  Works well because of the vent.  Cutting board is a plus although it is small and crumbs get everywhere.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it is almost too small, vertically for my 1 1/2 pound loaf.  I could never use it for a two pound.
4	1352678400	This bread box works pretty well, but it is a little short.  Often my bread turns out taller than the bread box and then I either have to squish it down a little or lay it on its side to make it fit.  Otherwise, the vents are nice, the cutting board is useful, and it's easy to open and close.
5	1352419200	I just caved and bought the breadmaker to go along with this product. So far, I've made 3 loaves that have turned out fantastically. The best part is, I can just put them in these containers and they stay fresh for so long! After 5 days, my white bread loaf is just now beginning to get a little less than soft. I bought one on Amazon and another one at Ross because I just happened to see it there. They look nice on the counter and the little cutting board is cute.
5	1352332800	The first one I received was cracked. Sent it back and Amazon promptly sent out another. This is the perfect bread box for me. This product is advertised as a box for home baked breads. I'm sure this would be excellent for that but I don't bake bread. I was looking for a bread box that didn't take up much counter space and this fills the bill nicely. I like how the length is adjustable. It allows me to reduce the length as the bread loaf gets smaller . . . even less counter "real estate" :D The other bread boxes were much too large. This one is a great space saver and the price is right.
1	1351728000	I make homemade bread, the bread goes stale faster than when stored in a plastic grocery bag! even with the vents closed some how fruit flies got in the box! at least I have a nice cutting board
5	1351728000	I bought this bread keeper because my homemade bread retains too much moisture to keep in plastic bags. The bread keeper works great! It allows air in and the bread stays fresh for up to a week on the counter. I open the vent on the side all the way for a fresh loaf, and then gradually close it during the week.
4	1351641600	The plastic material is nice and it worked perfect for a loaf size bread.I'm giving a four star only because we thought the cut board on the bottom is somewhat connected to the clear plastic box so we can pull it out and push back while it sit still, while actually it is just a separate piece put inside.
2	1351209600	I was looking for a replacement for my Wanda's Bread Box, which I've had for years and which appears to be out of production.  This was the closest thing I found.  It appears to be of high-quality construction.  It arrived nicely packaged with plastic wrapped around both sides of the box, and it includes a small cutting board (that's the white thing you see in the bottom of the box in the product photos).  The design is not as good as the Wanda's box though - it's oriented horizontally so it requires two hands to open and when you do open it the bread flops onto the counter.  The Wanda's box was oriented vertically so you could lift off the top with one hand and the bread would remain in place in the lower half.  This box has little handles on each side which stick out a bit and prevent you from setting it in a vertical position.
5	1351209600	Better than the plastic Walmart bag it replaced.  Well-made, it's a keeper.Pros: Shaped like a bread loaf.Cons: Doesn't float in the air to save counter space.
5	1351123200	We've had this little bread box for a few years now and really like it.  The ventilation holes (which can be opened or closed) are a nice touch, and handy reminder that bread should not be kept in an airtight container.  I saw some people complaining about how it holds up in a dishwasher.  I don't know why anyone would feel a dishwasher was necessary for something that only held bread - we just use some warm soapy water and it has held up beautifully.  It's a not unattractive design that looks nice on the counter.  The cutting board that comes with it is still going strong (well scarred now, but in a good way).I will say, if I had to point to one (tiny) downside, that on rare occasion the box is a little small.  I never make more than a 1 1/2 pound loaf and there have been some tight squeezes with a few of my creations.  But, bread in our house never lasts long, so it hasn't presented a problem.
5	1350950400	I just ordered my second adjustable bread keeper.  I live in a very dry climate (northern Rockies) and it is always hard to keep my homemade bread fresh and soft without causing it to mold (which is what happens in plastic bags).  I usually bake once every 1 to 2 weeks and make 2 loaves (whole wheat and a cranberry cinnamon swirl whole wheat).  I have had loaves stay fresh and soft in this bread keeper for up to 3 weeks when I haven't had time to make bread.  I'm not sure how well this would work in a very humid climate (I had to keep even the preservative laden grocery store bread in the refrigerator when I lived in Alabama).  But it is fantastic here.  The cutting board makes it easy for my oldest son to cut fresh slices of bread when he comes home from school for a snack.
5	1350864000	This works great -- keeps the bread very fresh.  I like that I can choose the humidity setting as it helps keep the bread from drying out.
5	1350604800	Great plastic case, easy to use and not too complicated to clean. Though it might not be convenient with the opening and closing after slicing off the bread, but still, its a good choice for a simple bread keeper at home.
5	1350604800	My mother makes home made bread so I got this for her and she loves it.It is well worth the money and then some.
5	1349827200	This bread box is exactly as it is represented!  I love the clear look because it appears to take up less space. And of course as you use the bread, the bread box collapses so it actually takes up less space. Yet it is weighty enough to feel substantial-- not to mention it truly does the job it is supposed to do: the bread stays fresher fo a longer time!! So very glad I got it!
4	1349827200	This item has worked well for me. The bread stayed nice and soft and was as good after a week as it was out of the oven. It certainly won't keep bread for as long as the fridge, but for shorter term storage it works great. I kind of lost track of time, but I think it was about 8-10 days before I started seeing mold on the bread.
5	1349654400	Really it just works as it is designed to work, what more can you possibly expect or want from such a utility item?
5	1349308800	I have now purchased 2 of these containers and they are great for keeping 2-lb loaves of bread fresh for up to a week.  They fit nicely on the pantry shelve too.
4	1349049600	I love this bread box. The only complaint I have is that it slides open too easily. Like it needs some sort of clip to catch. I love the adjustable venting. It was very inexpensive but it works great. The only other complaint I have is I need 2 more :) I would recommend this for the avid bread maker.
5	1348790400	Only down side, not able to keep bread right side up. I use a cusinart bread machine and shape of loaf not condusive with bread keeper.  I have gotten around that by cutting one end off and sitting in keeper on its end. Keeps bread fresh and good till gone about a week and a half.
5	1348531200	Update:I contacted the company and they replaced my product. Great company who stand behind their product. Definitely recommend it!I thought it was a pretty good buy until last night. It came out of the dishwasher and the 2 ends don't fit in anymore. WHY DO YOU LABEL THE PRODUCT DISHWASHER SAFE WHEN IT ISN'T? I would have washed it by hand had it just been in the product specs. Now I have 2 useless pieces of plastic. I got it around July 4, 2012-1.5 months and it's already unusable!
3	1348531200	It is nice that is compacts, but it feels cheap and bread molds in it faster than a plastic bag.  I like the convenient access and cutting board.  The vent serves little purpose.  The best part, of course, is the price.
5	1348444800	Recently, I've begun baking my own bread for my family.  I wanted a clear container to put on the counter so the bread was easily visible and readily accessible.  This bread keeper is particularly nice because it adjusts from the size of a full loaf down to less than half a loaf.  The counter space in my galley style kitchen is extremely limited, so the fact that this bread keeper can reduce to a smaller footprint as the bread is eaten is a real plus for me.  I live in Phoenix and I also keep my bread in a twist-tied plastic bag, so I haven't really played with the "humidity" knob on the side.  Keeping it completely closed works for me, meaning that the bread doesn't get moldy, hard or taste stale in the 3-4 days that it takes for my family to go through the loaf.  I also haven't used the built-in cutting board, since I prefer to use my bread guide to slice my bread in uniform pieces before bagging and storing it.  I don't have the skill to "free-hand" slicing bread, and no one else in my family does, either, so if we did try to slice as we went, the bread would end up badly mangled.
5	1348185600	I make bread 2 to 3 times a week.  This cute little Bread Keeper is perfect for keeping bread fresh and not taking up extra space.  I love it.
5	1347494400	What a nifty idea.  I bake my own bread and found that it was hard to keep it fresh.  Plastic bags kept my bread too moist and caused premature mold.  Paper bags?  Well my bread got stale in those.  This little clear box on the counter is perfect.  My family can see the bread and are more apt to eat it.  It opens very easily.  I can open and close the vent as necessary.  I keep it on top of a big bread board with a knife beside it.  The "bread" board that comes with the box is nothing more than a little plastic square about the size of a pot holder.  I will not be slicing bread or anything else on it.  It does do a nice job of holding the bread in the box though. I don't plan on putting it in the dish washer.  I'm sure a little hand washing and drying will be fine once a week.  I find most acrylic gets ruined or cloudy in the dishwasher even if it is labeled dishwasher safe. The picture does somehow make it look bigger than it is but if you read the description you will know the exact dimensions.  I bake bread in a bread machine and find that even the tall loaves fit this box just fine.  As a matter of fact I think most family size store bought loaves would be too long for this box.
5	1346976000	Ordered this product the other day to go along with my new bread machine...was very pleased! Reasonable price and works just as described. Just remember that it is very important to pay attention to the vents on the side. Having the right balance of air vs moisture really does help improve the life of the bread. I would recommend this to anyone who makes fresh bread...I will be buying another!!UPDATE:I've had this bread box for 3 months now & we still love it. The only down side is that the cutting board it came with is looking very "used" & unfortunately the item did not come with the option to buy replacement cutting boards.
5	1346889600	this is so much better then using ziploc bags or reusing bread bags. as far as bread molding inside this I never had a problem with that happening, my home made bread isn't in there very long its eaten within a day or two. this bread keeper is easy to clean and use, plan on buying another one or two.
5	1346198400	My husband and I eat different types of bread. I keep mine in the refrigerator and he likes his kept in the cabinet. this has been a problem because his bread woulg get stale very quickly and would even get moldy in less than a week during the summer months. I viewed many bread keepers on Amazon and read many reviews. I took a chance and ordered this one. They should re-name this to "The Miraculous Bread Keeper" because it is pretty amazing. My husband's bread lasts for weeks now that we keep it in this little gem - even during the hot, hot summer months! Another benefit is that it's not bulky at all, so I am able to keep it in the cabinet and off of my counter, unlike other bread keepers/boxes. I give this 5 stars. My husband gives it 100 stars!
5	1345593600	This does a wonderful job of keeping homemade bread fresh. It is so much better than putting it in a plastic bag.
5	1345593600	Bread is always fresh. I thought nothing could beat a microwave as a bread keeper. I was wrong. I highly recommend it.
3	1345507200	The product was great for what I needed it for, but it didn't last very long. I purchased two to use with bread I had made in my bread machine. I really liked the venting feature so I could put bread in while it was still a little warm (rather than letting it sit on the counter to cool overnight). Unfortunately after a while, about 9 months, the bottom of the keeper cracked. Shortly after that, the second cracked as well.
5	1345248000	I intend this to be a short and to the point review. I've been using a bread machine for years and love making my own fantastic bread. After cooling the bread, I used to store it hidden in a large plastic shopping bag, because the storage bag didn't look very good. One main concern I had was the humidity controller on this bread keeper, which (at least) one reviewer wrote, works great but seems counter-intuitive.I've found that since using this bread keeper, the humidity controller (which seems counter-intuitive) works great. My bread stays fresh days longer than it did hidden in a plastic bag. Also, although the plastic isn't break-proof, the crystal clear design sort of looks like a mini-bakery showcase. It looks terrific on my counter, not to mention I'm reminded that I do have delicious fresh baked bread available anytime.This is an excellent product. If you're careful with handling the bread keeper, it should last for many years.
4	1345248000	This product did what it said it would and was easy to use. My bread remained fresh. When not in use, it stored well in my pantry.
5	1344643200	I have been really impressed with this product.  I bake a lot of homemade bread, and this product has worked perfect.  I figure it will pay for itself due to not needing to buy bags anymore, and the bread holds better.
2	1344384000	I have had this for about 8 months. This is the first bread box I've ever bought. I read the mixed review at the time I bought it and regret that I did not trust the other reviewers. The white plastic vent cover broke after just 1 month of use and I have been without it ever since. I have been storing the bread in a cool place. My husband and I pretty much finish a loaf of bread within 3 days. Somehow mold still started to grow. I will look for a better bread box.
5	1344211200	It stores the bread good. Perfect size for the bread made by the breadmaker. I just order another one yesterday after having the first one for a week.
5	1343520000	I have just ordered my second one.  It might not work in some climates, but except on really rare muggy days it loves Seattle.I too had trouble with the awkward opening process until I upended it, vent on top.  A couple of bits of furniture pads underneath to level it, and the top slides right up for easy access.
5	1343347200	I have been looking for a bread keeper for months, as I now have a Zojirushi breadmaker which has two large paddles, and produces a much bigger loaf than my old Sunbeam. I can get a loaf comfortably in there and I LOVE having the built-in bread board with crumb catcher. The vents are closed for my French bread but I leave them open for my "moister" loaves.. no problems with mold now..
4	1342742400	The bread keeper itself is very good and satisfied but as you can see the picture, the box is expendable but the cutting board is not so the bread bigger than cutting board sit on inclined, which is what I don't like. I hope they give two cutting boards or make it adjustable too.
4	1342742400	Although it looks unlikely, this bread box actually works. My artisan bread from Harris Teeter used to go moldy after a few days in the humid summer months. Now it lasts at least twice as long and stays fresher. My box had a slight crack in one corner, but this did not affect its use. Fresh bagels also kept very well in here. Easy to clean too. For the price, it's a real bargain.
4	1342742400	This bread keeper really works great and accommodates the larger bread sizes produced by bread machines, which is what I use it for. The only thing it is missing is a guide for slicing the bread. That would be nice, especially one that can be used with the larger sizes produced by bread machines.
5	1342742400	I come from the tin can bread box years...yes, I can hear you baby boomers groaning.  Those who remember know what I am talking about.THIS::BreadBox thing is pretty good.  I used to store bread in the Refrigerator...but now don't.  I store it on the kitchen table.  This thing rocks!  You can always see just how much bread you have left at a glance to know when to fire up the old breadmaker.There are holes in the side that can be closed up somewhat via a dial knob.The bread stays fresh.It expands...contracts...What's not to like?Cheers
3	1342310400	I've used this breadbox for about 1 year and overall it's a good product. The downside is that a freshly baked bread from my (standard) breadmachine does not fit in the box. I first need to slice a few slices off and then it fits. So overall it's good, but I wished it was a bit larger. I also find the plastic a bit fragile. I wish it was made from a different type of plastic that was a bit stronger/thicker. For the price that should be feasible, because I remember this box wasn't cheap.
5	1342224000	Prolongs and saves bread that we buy or bake. We used it in refrigerator as well and we washed it in dishwasher. It's all good.
1	1342051200	This bread holder is a waste of money. I bought it to store my bread machine bread because I didn't want to keep wasting the plastic bags I was putting it in. But even with the holes closed, the bread became stale quickly and after a few days started to grow mold.
4	1341878400	I love this; my bread stays fresher for a few more days when in the bread keeper than just sittingout by itself.  A very good product; I would buy it again.
5	1341878400	This bread keeper does the job just fine. I have put several homemade boules in there and they fit just fine, of course, after we take a couple of "tasting" slices off the end. Don't all home bread bakers do that anyway?Really like that it has a vent because I like to let a little air in to keep my crusts nice and snappy. The bread doesn't stay in there for more than 3-4 days anyway.I would love if they would make another version that is a little taller and longer for those really big, homemade loaves.---No more looking for plastic bags to store my breads.
5	1341532800	This was purchased as a 4 for 3 item, so it came free with the other 3 items I purchased.  I make my own bread and thought that I would give this item a try, especially being free.  I'm glad I did, and I can say that if it wasn't free, knowing what I know now, I would definitely buy it.The bread stays fresh for up to a week in this.  That of course is the most important part of a bread keeper, "keeping" the bread fresh.  It has a handy little dial that allows you to adjust how much air goes into the bread keeper.  So, if you just recently made your bread, and it is still warm and not sliced, you could put it in the keeper and open up the dial so that it allows more air in help it cool.  Once cooled, you can close it so that air doesn't get in.  It is more difficult to close with the dial closed, which to me means that it really creates an air-tight seal.The cutting board is really helpful and works well.  It does get stained from use and it is hard to clean the stains off.  However, it is still usable and helpful.Overall, a very good purchase.
5	1341360000	this is a product i would certainly recommend to anybody to get. especially for people who make their own bread.Well worth the price.
5	1341187200	I love this bread keeper, it is a keeper indeed! Its progressive sizejust makes it better, as it can easily adjust to different sizes and save space. It'slight and easy to clean, and the little board comes in handy when you are in a rush and just need a quick slice on the go. It is a KEEPER!
5	1341187200	I bake bread every week, and needed a means of storing it that didn't take up a lot of counter space. This bread keeper has been great! We've been using this for well over 6 months now, and have had no problems at all. Bread lasts longer, and the small cutting board that fits inside the unit is very convenient.
5	1340409600	Works. Keeps condensation off hot bread. Vents allow escape of moisture while not letting in enough air for the bread to go stale.
4	1340150400	When I started making my own bread at home I didn't have a good way to store it, so I used ziploc bags. My loaves were too big for one bag so I had to use two, and I knew it wasn't a permanent solution. I ordered this bread keeper and have been really pleased with it. I have not had a single moldy loaf of bread since, and with the adjustable air vent I can let in just the right amount of air to keep the bread fresh without drying out. It holds my 1 1/2 pound loaf that I bake in a standard loaf pan just fine, but I don't know that it would hold longer loaves very easily. The cutting board is useful, though I had to rinse and air it out when I first got it, it had a strong plastic smell that has since gone away. I do wish the bread keeper didn't open in the middle - it can make it a little tricky to get the bread out at first when there is a full loaf in there because you have to slide one side all the way off, but it's not a deal-breaker for me. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a bread keeper. In fact, I am considering purchasing another one myself.
3	1340064000	This box looks really good.I like the fact that you can make it smaller or bigger.It keeps the bread fresh!Only one thing i dont like - opening it is a pain. You have to use both hands, to pull on both sides, and there is no way you can cut the bread in there. At least not for me.But anyway i like it enough to keep it.
5	1339718400	I love fancy bread.  And whenever I purchase it, I get half a loaf eaten (if I rush) before it is hard as a rock.  This lovely little item is the absolute BEST.  The bread is fresh after almost a week, and still has a lovely crust.  Such a happy camper I bought two and may buy more for all my friends.
5	1339718400	This does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I'm a fan.  I found out late this spring that I am gluten and lactose intolerant.  So I am making almost all of my own food now.  I used to keep wheat bread in the fridge, especially in the summer, because it would mold in my house very quickly.  Well gluten free bread in the fridge is worse than wheat bread in the fridge.  But I didn't want a huge bread box.  For one, gluten free bread won't stay moist a week and a half for me to go through the whole loaf; and two, I don't have the space for it.  So I got this little box.  It's worked great!  I keep a four or five slices of bread in it, and maybe some dinner bread and a muffin.  Before it got really humid outside (I live in southeastern Virginia- the humidity will come!), I used the suggestion in the box about putting a little glass of water in the box to help keep the bread from drying out.  I don't know if this would have happened to regular sandwich bread, but my gluten free bread was pretty dry.  I did have to confront one mold issue because I forgot to take the water out when it got humid in the house and outside.  Now, I keep the bread in the box, with the vent open.  It's great.  I check it each day when I pull out a slice to see if it needs to be adjusted at all.  But given that the alternative was keeping all of my bread in the freezer all the time, and defrosting every day, this is a great alternative!!  And it's compact enough that it is easy to take along when I have to go on a road trip for a few days.
5	1339632000	I purchased this at the same time I bought the bread maker. I don't know what I'd do with the fresh baked bread if we didn't have something like this and it works great.
3	1339286400	I was very excited about this product,it looks sleek and expandable ,the major problem with it is that a plastic breadbox even with breathing holes causes bread products to get moldy very quickly !
4	1339113600	This is smaller than I had imagined. I have a Panasonic bread machine that makes XL loaves and they do not fit in this bread keeper. The medium loaves fit as long as I take out the cutting board in the bottom. I love how fresh my bread stays and how easy it is to get at. I was debating between this and a traditional bread box for my counter and I am actually very happy that I chose this. I like that I can see in and see how much bread is left, I like that it takes up hardly any room at all on my counter and that it is adjustable. I just wish I could adjust it to be a little taller to fit the bread from my machine. I believe this is the best way to store your freshly made bread and I am going to continue using it.
2	1338940800	I'm not really thrilled with this product.  It holds bread, which is half the job, but I feel that the bread gets stale pretty quickly if left in this box on the counter.  I've got the holes covered, so that shouldn't be an issue.  However, if you put your bread in here and put it in the fridge, it will keep it a little longer.  Would I buy this again?  Probably not.  It's just not worth the money.
5	1338854400	This is a good adjustable bread keeper. I've stuffed everything from bagels, to croissants, to yeast rolls, to bread baked in my breadmaker in this bread keeper. I like that it has a vent on the side if you need it. The only issue I have is that you cannot put it in the dishwasher--but most clear plastics don't go in the dishwasher, so I knew that when I bought it. It adjusts to twice the width you see in the picture, but the white base doesn't. It's exactly what I ordered, no surprises or disappointments. I like it, and would buy another.
5	1338249600	This item is nice with a cutting board in the bottom which wasn't mentioned in the description and is keeps my bread fresh for a long time.  The material is heavy not the least bit flimsy like some others.
3	1337990400	I bought this in hopes that we wouldn't have to Saran wrap the crap out of our bread. However, our bread loaf size is not compatible. We're forced to cut the bread down in order for it to fit.
1	1337731200	I bake specialty bread regularly since there are several members of my family with gluten allergies.  After fiddling with storage containers for months, I bought this due to the great reviews.  I wish I had read the negative reviews more carefully.This thing is extremely awkward to use.  When I saw that it slid together, I thought hey--great idea--it takes up less room on my counter.  In actually, what this means is that you have to jam the bread into one side and then hold half the container (with the bread) at an awkward angle to get the larger side of the container around the bread and aligned with the "interior" half of the container.  Add to that that the "convenient cutting board" is only half the size of the container, it isn't functional for a quick slice. Here is the process if you want a slice of bread.Get out a cutting board to open the container on.  Or have your loaf flop onto the counter--your choice.Open the container.  I hope you have big hands because it is hard to hold.Set down the "outer" half of the container.Grab the entire loaf and remove it from the "interior" half of the container.You can FINALLY get at the stupid little cutting board that rests inside the interior half.Slice your bread.Put the cutting board back in the interior halfBalance the bread on top of the cutting board, half hanging out of the interior side of the container.Grab the outer half of the container and slide it over the interior half while holding both in the air.  You can't put it down or the bread will flop out and you wont be able to get the outer half around the bottom of the bread.Oh, and you can forget about trying to keep the heel of the bread together with the loaf to keep the end from drying out.  You'll need a third arm to accomplish that.I gave up on mine and threw it out.  Now I just wrap my bread in a piece of parchment paper.  It keeps the outer crust dry and the inner bread moist.
3	1337212800	I think that this bread keeper works best if you keep your bread in a whole loaf and cut it one slice at a time. It seems to be designed for that purpose more so than for keeping sliced bread.PROS:- Roomy enough for oversized loaves of bread.- Adjustable vent really does help to control moisture.- Easy to clean.CONS:- The handles are small and difficult to grip when you try to open the keeper by pulling apart the two halves.- If you store your bread pre-sliced, you have to tip the keeper up on its end when you open it in order to keep bread slices from falling out. This problem is compounded by the fact that the handles stick out from the sides of the keeper so that it cannot rest flat on the counter or table when it is tipped on its end.
5	1337126400	Have been using this to store my bread machine bread.  I'd say I can keep my bread from molding and drying out for twice as long in another container or plastic bag!  Highly recommend.
2	1337126400	I agree with one of the other reviewers that this is "klunky" and awkward to open and close.  It's a nice idea, but it doesn't work for me. I haven't found anything better, however, besides an old-fashioned Wesco bread box.
5	1336608000	Bought this bread keeper to use for my homebaked bread and it keeps the bread fresh and tasty for days. Would recommend this to anybody who has had problems keeping their bread fresh.
4	1335830400	I've been making my own bread for the past two months with my Blendtec Blender and my own baking pans, no bread making machine.  I needed something to store breads easily that wouldn't cause breads to mold quickly since there are no preservatives in my mixture.  This is a great little product.  I love that it is adjustable so as your bread dwindles down, you can shorten the size of the box.  And you can adjust the humidity. Love that.  The only setback, however, is it opens from the center, which causes a mess when cutting, so you have to really clean up, remove any crumbs from counter and cutting board, and inside box, because of course, I don't want any other issues like ants on my counter.  I saw that other reviewers said the same thing about the center opening, but the price was so incredible, I wanted to try it for myself.As I bake my breads, once they cool, I put them in the new Reynolds Wrap product that is part foil, part parchment paper, foil side on the outside, then I wrap that in plastic wrap so I'm able to freeze them well.  When new bread is needed, once a loaf thaws on the counter, I take it and place it in the bread keeper.  As we need bread slices, I take off one end of the keeper, pull the cutting board out, pull the bread from its wrapping and place just enough of the bread on the cutting board so that we are not cutting on the paper it's wrapped in, wipe off the board, re-wrap the bread and place it back in the keeper.  This is working for us.  We've not had a problem with moldy bread. We just wish this opened from one side and not the center (which is why I gave it only 4 stars), and we wish that the cutting board was adjustable like the Bread Keeper, so that we could pull the whole thing out from one side, and push it back in.  The process would be much faster.  Other than that, the Bread Keeper is a keeper! LOLI suppose we could cut it all at one time, but I remember my grandmother not cutting all of her homemade bread at one time.  Not sure why she did it that way, but it works for us.
4	1335657600	I am a bit surprised by how lightweight this bread box is. I have told my children to be careful that they don't drop it on the floor because I am concerned that it will crack. Then I dropped it on the ground and it did not crack, but be careful! The small cutting board that came with it is not worth using! Too small. I like that I can see easily through the container to know how much bread I have left. Also easy reminder for the kids to see what we have in the way of bread in the house. Opens and closes easily. I will be interested to see how long it lasts with daily use.
3	1335225600	It's a good product for cooling bread down after baking or if you are going to use the entire loaf you made that day. It is not good for long term storage as my bread was dried out and stale every time I tried to use it for keeping bread longer than overnight. I was dissapointed overall.
5	1335052800	Love it! worth every penny! Keeps the bread how you want it and extends the life of it. No more stale bread.
5	1334966400	Some reviews made me worry this bread keeper would be a flimsy piece of junk but I decided to take the plunge anyway because of Amazon's liberal return policy. I ended up loving it and immediately purchased a second one because I usually keep two types of bread available at once. It certainly seems sturdy enough for every day use and it doesn't look bad sitting out on my kitchen counter.I like the transparency so I can see at a glance how much bread is left. The air holes are a feature I thought I wouldn't use, but I do. It lets me put bread away sooner after baking than I otherwise could.The included cutting board is an extra I don't use. I prefer a larger surface.
2	1334966400	The product arrived with a crack near one of the feet. This is a fairly brittle plastic. You need plenty of counter space to use this, as it is clumsy to open and close, and would be easy to drop if not sitting on a flat surface. If you drop it, it will probably crack. I was able to repair crack [ I hope] with some windshield repair glue.
5	1334880000	This is a great product! I make my own bread, and this box has significantly increased the length of time for which bread stays fresh. I hardly throw out stale bread since I've had it. The box is very easy to clean, and takes up very little counter space. It is adjustable, so it takes up even less counter space as your bread gets eaten. The box looks very pretty! An excellent way to show off a beautiful loaf of bread!
5	1334793600	I got this to go along with the breadmaker my neighbor gave me and it really does keep the bread fresh for longer. Then I tried it with a batch of "cakey" brownies just to see if it would work as well. It does! The brownies stayed nice and moist in the bread keeper where they would dry out on the counter or get all "gummy" in the fridge. I'm really glad that I got this!
2	1334534400	I figured it was hit and miss and for the price, I could afford to take a shot.  It missed the target.  It's is, like other negative reviews comment, fairly cheap.  If it drops, it's done for.  While it held bread from an Oster for a 1.5lb loaf just fine and the cutting board was a nice addition, I've tried a couple different dial sets for the bread, but they all molded within 2-3 days of baking - both the quick rise bread and the traditional 3hr white bread.  Worse than the traditional plastic grocery bag.  Alas, I'm still in search of a way to keep my bread without wrapping it up in the bag and unwrapping, wrapping and unwrapping.
2	1334534400	I bought this item almost a year ago.  After various washings in the dishwasher it is falling apart.  The plastic has clouded and appears to be weakening from being washed in the dishwasher and the end vent adjustment has finally broken off.  We are still using it with duct tape holding the vent adjustment to the body of the keeper.  I ran the keeper periodically through the dishwasher to sanitize it and prevent mold since home baked bread has no preservatives in it.  If you don't intend to use it very often then it works well.  The two sliding pieces are very easy to use.  If you use it all of the time (like we do) then don't plan on washing it in the dishwasher or it will fall to pieces.  I will be spending more money for a decent bread box that with last and will hold up to dishwasher washings.  I will not be buying any more of these.
5	1334448000	Works exactly as stated. My bread machine loaves fit perfectly and stay fresh days longer than in any other container. The vents are great. I put fresh baked bread in and open vents completely for about an hour until bread cools, then depending on type of bread I close completely or leave slightly open. Works perfectly.
4	1334188800	This was a nice idea but I make "homemade" bread and because of the bigger loaves of bread this bread box was TOO SMALL!!  It needs to be a little bigger as far as the height goes.  Other then that I would have kept it instead of sending it back and having nothing again to store my bread in.  If you just want it to put store bread and bakery items in then it might work for you.
3	1333843200	This box does ok.  A couple of small cracks from shipping.  The two sections are not very tight, however, we live in a very dry climate and it still keeps bread well up to a week.  I don't know that I would buy another after the cracks get too bad to put up with as I can see where just putting the two wections together could cause additional cracking...
4	1333670400	We purchased this bread box because we use a bread maker very often.  The quality is good and the perormance in keeping our fresh bread in edible condition is superb!  Very nice product.
5	1333584000	Very cool modern look.  Well made.  Easy to use.  Easy to clean.  Bread stays fresh for days.  Have purchased two.  Could not be happier.  Highly recommend!
5	1333497600	A recent diagnosis of celiac disease has lead to home baked bread.  I was having problems figuring out how to store it once it was made.  I would let it cool but then forget to put in a zip lock bag at night.  This has solved the problem.  Once cool to the touch you can put it in to finish cooling with the vent open to let moisture out and if you forget to adjust before bed your bread does not dry out by morning.  No more mold!  I have yet to try with other baked things like rolls.  I made rolls & bread the same day.... let's just say the bread is doing better for freshness than the rolls in a more tradition bag.
3	1333065600	Don't know what I was thinking when I bought this. I have OCD tendencies when it comes to what touches my food. With that being said, I'll use this box but I will not let my bread touch the plastic surfaces. I don't want chemicals leeching into my bread. The so called cutting board is almost the size of a slice of bread. It is practically useless. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is functional.
5	1332806400	I LOVE the adjustable bread keeper. My bread stays fresh for days and no more mold in two days as my other storage containers! The adjustable dial for moisture control works great. I even turned one on end and used it to store my fresh baked cookies. It is a 'must have' for any of your baked goods. I loved the first container I bought so I bought two more.
5	1332633600	It has been only a week since I got it, but every slice I've had is as fresh as the day the bread was baked.  You can't say anything better than that.
5	1332460800	I bake fresh no-knead bread several times a week.  The adjustable vent allows a still-warm loaf to remain fresh without the crust getting soggy-limp.  Turning the knob to reduce the air exchange rate lets the loaf stay fresh for two or three days, perhaps longer (it's always been eaten before then.)  Adjusting the size as the loaf is eaten keeps the air-volume ideal for maintaining freshness.  My only complaint is the width could be slightly more to fit a rounder loaf.
5	1332201600	We love this bread keeper. It is just the right size for those monster bread machine loafs and keep things moist and fresh. This is a much better alternative to the turkey size oven bags we were using before we purchased this!
3	1332115200	I purchased this because I've started baking bread again and needed something beside a plastic bag to store the bread.  Here's what I've found:- It works as advertised, the 'valve' does let you have some control over the moisture content inside the box.- The clear plastic lets you see exactly what is left inside.  That may be good or bad depending on the asthetics of your counter top.  You can also see any crumbs on the floor of the box.- the 'cutting board' bottom slides out and is OK since you always have it there.- The box is terribly inconvenient to use.  There are no handles to grab to slide it open when you want to get the bread out.  Additionally when you do slide the pieces apart you have to set the one piece aside then get the bread out to slice it.  If your counter space is at all limited, as mine is, this is frustrating.In short it works, looks pretty cool, but day to day use is inconvenient.
1	1331510400	i ordered two of these- Both arrived already cracked alon the vent side. i have no way of knowing if this happened during shipment or handling before packaging but either way these are WAY too fragile. it seems strange that both cracked in the exact same place which leads me to believe it is a poor design or badly made. it is a nice idea, they look good ,but they are essentially worthless. save your money and try and find them locally; you might stand a chance if they don't have to be shipped. doubt they'll last even then.
4	1331510400	I almost sent it back because I couldn't separate the two pieces.  I did set the vents so it wasn't airtight.  It took about 1.75 hours to get them apart.
5	1331337600	This bread storage box does a great job keeping my Fresh homemade bread fresh and soft.  I like the idea I can adjust the moisture in the box and it is easy to clean
5	1331337600	Prompt delivery. We have been using the bread box for about two months.  It works better than advertised, the bread stays soft and moist.  Great for bread machine bread, fits perfectly.
4	1330992000	I use a Zojirushi bread machine to bake fresh bread every week.  I wanted a bread keeper that would accommodate 2-lb bread loaves.  This one works very well for that purpose, and the bread stays fresh all week (I have had loaves hold up 2 or more weeks with no signs of mold).  I was skeptical about the little air vent, but it really does work to keep the bread from molding.  I also like the fact that the size of the bread keeper can be adjusted to fit the size of the bread loaf.  There are small feet on the bottom of the bread keeper that keep it from sliding around on the counter.The only criticisms I have about this bread keeper are minor.  The two sections fit together rather loosely, so you have to be careful when lifting it up or moving it so the two sections don't fall apart.  The included plastic cutting board is pretty small and not very useful.  I usually take the bread out and cut it on a larger, wooden cutting board.  The circular vent is attached very loosely.  Consequently, any movement of the bread keeper will usually cause the vent setting to change making it necessary to frequently adjust it.  The bread keeper would be much better if the vent fit more snugly.Overall, I'm very happy with this bread keeper and plan to buy another so I can bake extra loaves of bread.  It works very well for those using bread machines to make fresh bread at home and would work quite well for store-bought bread, too.
4	1330819200	It does what it's supposed to.  I previously put my homemade bread in a plastic bag, but that was not a good long-term solution.  This bread box extends the freshness of homemade bread.  The cutting board that comes with it is worthless though.  I don't know how anyone can cut anything on something so small.  This doesn't get 5 stars because the material does appear very fragile.  One slight (and I mean slight) bump against a faucet or the counter will crack it.  I don't know why it can't be made out of something sturdier (the clear plastic used for humidifier tanks would be a lot sturdier).  I've been extremely careful with it, but I don't know how long this will remain without cracks.  So far so good though.  I'm happy with this purchase.
4	1330819200	I have been using these bread keepers for about 6 months and have been very happy with how well they help to keep my bread fresh. They are easy to clean and look nice on the counter with my freshly baked bread in them.
4	1330473600	I have had this for 6 months, and I love the way it keeps my breads and pastries fresh.  It took a little experimentation to figure out which adjustments worked best for which items, but it didn't take long to figure out the best adjustments for the dial.The one problem I had with this little bread keeper was that when I was first using it, I kept noticing a nasty plastic odor when I opened the box, and the breads then absorbed that odor.  I can't believe that in all the reviews, no one else had this problem.  I had washed it before using it, but the first day I took bread out, I noticed the odor of plastic as soon as I opened the box, and the bread smelled of plastic, as well.  I washed the box and insert again.  This time I noticed that the clear plastic part has no odor, but the little white slide-out "cutting board" does have a strong odor.  I placed a fresh batch of bread in the box, and this time I left out the little board.  Problem solved.  No more plastic odor. The bread keeper works so well that I will order it again, but I will automatically toss the "cutting board" insert, because the odor cannot be washed away.  It doesn't serve as a decent cutting board, anyway, so no great loss.
5	1330128000	If you're starting out with making homemade bread, you need to find something to keep the bread in. Plastic bags don't work as well as you'd hope. Nothing really works as well as one would hope. Except this. I have no complaints. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and I love it. Keeps the bread fresh. Great buy.
4	1330041600	It's hard to get excited about a bread keeper, but this little item really works well. I try not to get over-analytical about these things, but this simple bread box probably costs about a dollar to manufacture and takes the place of a simple plastic bread wrapper. But when you make bread at home, it's challenging to find the right size plastic bag for your fresh-from-the-oven creation. Either the bag isn't the right size or it has a hole in it!I've started using a Cuisinart bread machine to make bread at home, now that store bought loaves are closing in on the price of a gallon of gas. I don't mind the effort and love the smell that home baked bread creates. Slicing it is another challenge, but then storing it is the present puzzle. This little plastic box does the trick. It is tall and wide enough to handle the loafs that I bake in my bread machine. Its length adjusts by sliding one side of the box into the other and the vents can be adjusted to fully closed or fully open. This seems counter-intuitive, but allowing some air in and out of the box keeps crusts crusty without drying out the loaf.There is a handy cutting board that can be removed which keeps crumbs from tumbling all over the place. The box is clear and looks nice on my counter top, but is a bit tall to fit under some of my cabinets. The box comes with spartan instructions, but heck, we're not talking about something that needs a lot of directions. Nice box, well made and sturdy, and an attractive price.
2	1329868800	Well it's hard to say how useful it is as it cracked in two places only after a few uses.It's still functional but it's increasingly harder to control how much moisture is getting in and out and it will also obviously fall apart.I decided just to buy a larger snap close container that can better hold and store larger bread.
5	1329609600	We use our bread maker regularly and used to have a hard time getting the loaves to stay fresh more than a few days. Thanks to this handy bread keeper our bread stays fresh for up to 10 days, depending on the recipe. Not bad for no preservatives!
5	1329004800	This bread keeper is excellent at keeping the bread fresh and soft.  You have to be sure that the new loaf of bread is thoroughly cooled before,putting it in this keeper or condensation will form inside the keeper and you will have to remove the loaf and dry the inside of the plastic keeper.  The fact that there is a small removable cutting board with the bread keeper is a nice touch and very convenient.  A great buy, reasonably priced.
5	1328486400	After I bought my breakmaker, I saw the need for a bread keeper or I was going to be spending a lot of money on foil and plastic bags. This keeper adjusts to any size loaf, short or tall, and also has a dial on the side to let air in or keep it out.  When my loaf is warm I open it up, and later I close it.  Very happy with this product!
5	1328227200	I bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely love it.  I love it so much I just ordered another one.  Someone who makes their own bread such as I,  found this to preserve the bread excellently.  The only thing to watch for is the side dial to open or close the air vent moves when you use the bread keeper, but really not a big deal.  I find it more convenient than a bread box.  The first one I received came cracked, but Amazon sent me a replacement within two days and that one was fine.  Amazon's reliability to replace an item is great.
5	1328140800	I make my own bread and hadn't found a container that worked with my loaf size.  This container is WONDERFUL!!  Keeps the bread soft and fresh for several days.  I will recommend it to my freinds who also bake their own bread.
2	1327795200	This bread box looked as if it might be an acceptable substitue for Wanda's Bread Box.  But, it takes up more room on the counter, sliced bread flops over when you open the box and attempt to remove a slice.  I think the vent is a useless feature.  If it wasn't there I cold set the box up on end, therefore using less counter space.
5	1327708800	I bake gluten free bread (2lb loaf) and normally end up putting it in a plastic bag which collects condensation and makes the bread a bit wet on the outside.  This bread keeper is a pretty good solution to that problem.  There is a vent that you can open or close, so if the bread is warm when you put it in you can just leave the vent open.  I usually put my bread in the fridge so that it keeps longer, the only downside to this is that this bread keeper takes up quite a bit of space in the fridge.A lot of people complain about the way this bread keeper comes apart, but I don't really have a problem with it.  I'm just happy that it's expandable, so you can minimize the amount of space that it takes up when your loaf is small.  The included cutting board is handy and well made (it has some weight to it). Overall I'm happy with the purchase (it beats the plastic bag) and I would highly recommend it, especially if you bake your own bread.
5	1327449600	I bought this as a gift for my husband who bakes bread on a regular basis. After using ziploc bags and cellophane wrap to store bread, I decided that a storage container was overdue. The Progressive Bread Keeper has lived up to our expectations and then some. The most practical aspect of the bread keeper is its expandability. It holds all shapes of loaves and keeps them fresh for longer. Especially useful is the ability to control the humidity via the air vents. The instructions explain how to use air vents and in what climates (dry and humid). A small cutting board is included. It is of limited use, but if you would like to cut a slice or two from a standard loaf of bread, then the small cutting board is adequate. I have noticed that bread definitely stays fresh longer using the Progressive Adjustable Bread Keeper.
4	1327190400	It's not amazing but it does work better than a ziploc bag.  It is small but perfect size for my loaves of bread from my little breadmaker (Zojirushi 1 lb loaf maker).  It should work for the bigger loaves too since it is expandable.  I would recommend it.
4	1327017600	Great for keeping bread - i use a bread machine and bake at least twice a week: this keeps it neat and i can see how much is left easily. Only drawback is the tiny 'included' bread board: not worth using. It marks so easily, one slice through the loaf and there's a memory left forever on the board. I have taken it out and use my good old wooden board to slice on.
4	1327017600	This item holds a large loaf and keeps my homemade bread reasonably fresh for a few days. Where there is bread there is surely some mold and being washable to remove mold is a big plus and this keeper certainly won't rust.The one drawback is that this bread box is made of a hard plastic that will crack or fracture if dropped or stressed.ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS for any item purchased from anyone anywhere:Examine all items thoroughly and at different angles after unpacking for cracks, leakage or any other damage.I say this because I discovered a fracture in mine after I started using the box and assumed that I had dropped the item but I was not sure.
5	1326844800	I got a bread machine for Christmas and after making one loaf (only to end up throwing half of it away) i realized i needed something to store future loaves, and fast. Some sites had suggested specially made, re-usable storage bags. After a quick search i came upon this box and decided to give it a chance. Well, I made my second loaf, whole wheat, this past Sunday (3 days ago) and it's still fresh and moist with no signs of molding. I'm so happy i bought this bread box. It works perfectly and for a fairly cheap price. Very very very pleased.
2	1326758400	I was quite pleased with this item.... it really does keep the bread a lot fresher than a bag.  In addition the concept is terrific.However the price is very high for a product that cracked after only a couple of weeks use.  It has always been handled carefully... wiped out with a damp paper towel rather than washed.  However, for no apparent reason.... this morning it has a long crack.  Hard and apparently brittle plastic was not a good choice for this product.  Love the concept, wish the product lived up to the idea.
5	1326758400	My counter space is too small for Grandma's bread box, this works nicely. A 2lb. bread maker loaf fits ok. I don't know if a 2.5lb would fit. The width and height are both 6 1/2" without the 1/2" cutting board. The adjustable length is 6 1/2" to 11".
1	1326672000	I just received this today and am disappointed. It feels very cheap. It's smaller than I thought it would be, and the worst part is how it increases in length - one half fits into the other; there is not an airtight seal that I expected, and if you pick it up by one end, it can fall apart. I was expecting one half to be detachable, but for there to at least be clasps of some sort to hold the box together when it's extended. At its full length, which is needed for regular loaves of bread, the box becomes unstable. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this and had gone with a more expensive, higher quality box.
5	1326672000	I've purchased several bread boxes from Amazon and I can objectively say that this has been the neatest one to arrive. I bought another stainless steel roll-top breadbox and that looked great. I have, however, received much more compliments regarding this piece. The price is much better as well, though I hoped it could have been bigger.
5	1326585600	I make my own bread twice a week.  Usually a bread for sandwiches and then something interesting for toast.  This bread box keeps my bread fresh much longer that anything else I have tried.  I was a little skeptical because I though it looked a little cheap.  Regardless of what it looks like, it does what it claims.  The cutting board inside the box makes slicing super convenient as well.  I would recommend this to anyone that makes there own bread and wants to maximize it's shelf life.
5	1326499200	This is a very good way to keep homemade bread.The vent helps manage steam or staleness and the cutting board is handy.
4	1326412800	This box works extemely well.  The price is right and the bread stays fresh for days...(not that my bread lasts that long) !!!
5	1325980800	This bread keeper is just perfect for our needs. It adjusts to the size of the loaf, has a tiny cutting board, and a vent for humidity. If you use bread machine, this is the product you want.
3	1325894400	This bread keeper is a good idea that should be made better.1) The plastic will craze over time (and no, it's never been in the dishwasher).2) Tall loaves do not always fit!3) Cutting board gouges easily.Typically I make bread once a week so it sees everyday use and overall, it does the job, but it's not going to last.
5	1325808000	It keeps the bread fresh and soft, no need to freez and reheat to tase better. I will order another one later for my parents kitchen.
5	1325635200	This is just what a small family needs to make the most of a new loaf of bread. It extends the life of bread!
1	1325548800	HAVENT GOT IT YET ..BEEN DEALAYED ...WILL REVIEW IT WHEN IT FINALLY GETS HERE .PURCHASED ON THE FIRST OF  DECEMBER 2011 SO ITS BEEN A MONTH NOW WAITING
5	1325376000	This is the only way to store freshly made bread -- in my case, from my new Zorijushi bread machine.  The only alternatives to this inexpensive product are: leaving your bread on the counter, uncovered (not good, bread will get stale and rot); putting it in a zip lock bag (which traps the moisture and will make the bread all soggy); or using a wooden or metal bread box.  I looked at an affordable bread box at Wal-Mart, and for about $20, you get a bamboo box with roll-up lid that has "cheap" written all over it.  This Bread Keeper, by contrast, costs less but is well-made out of heavy plastic.  The air vent is especially ingenious and it keeps the bread at an optimal moisture level.  For the price, this is a must-have accessory for all serious home bread bakers!
3	1325116800	It does a good job keeping the bread. I like that you can see the bread. There are vent holes to control the humidity and freshness. It is expandable for different lengths of bread. It is light and easy to move around.Progressive International Adjustable Bread Keeper
4	1324080000	Been making homemade bread for a few months (Celiac) and this works great for storing the loaf.  I wish it was a little longer when fully extended, A full loaf barely fits in.  I use the included cutting board when the loaf gets down to half.
5	1323475200	Simple in design and works very well. A little small for tall bread machine loaves so we turn the loaf cut side down. Overall I am very pleased with this product.
4	1323216000	I gave this product 4 stars because I really do like it and living in Colorado, stale bread is too common. I like how you can control the amount of air you let in so when I've put the bread in before it was cool for instance, I can open the vent until it finishes cooling.It works well for for a simple design but getting it open and slicing the bread could be easier. Overall for the price I'm satisfied.
5	1323129600	I was looking at all kinds of bread boxes, especially the pretty stainless steel ones, but I am so glad that I got this one.It is so smart and efficient.  It collapses so that as you consume the bread it minimizes the amount of air in the container.  It's the air that the bread is exposed to that increases the chances of it becoming stale (especially in our dry environment) so I appreciate that it does that.Also, it seems like we never have enough counter space, so it's great that it takes up such a small footprint.  I'm really happy with it.I was a bit hesitant since it is plastic and Made in China.  (After the melamine-baby food issue I'm wary of products, especially food products, made in China, but I'm happy with the quality of this and would recommend it.)
3	1322870400	The bread keeper was built well but what I didn't like was that you had to open it from the middle to get a slice of bread and the rest would fall over. Would have been great if the end opened up to remove desired slices.
5	1322438400	This adjustable case works great, it keeps my bread fresh and soft, i love the idea of be adjustable, and it made of great quality
5	1322179200	I make gluten free bread, which typically shouldn't last very long, but with this bread box it stays fresh in taste AND texture for up to 6 days! It is truly amazing and worth every penny!
4	1321488000	It was the largest I could find and indeed I can fit a extra large loaf in this box.  The bread is staying fresh for 5-6 days as it is usually gone in that time.  A good box with good size and the vent is invaluable as your bread needs some air to last.
4	1321142400	I haven't had any issues with fast molding, like some other reviewers.  My only issue is with the size of the cutting board.  It is convenient to be able to cut the bread while still keeping it in the case, but bread crumbs still go all over the place since the small indentations on the side are not big enough to hold all of the crumbs. Not as cool looking as a traditional bread box, but compact (save space) and easy to clean. Overall, I'm satisfied. I even bought one for my grandfather to use with his bread machine.
5	1320969600	I bought theProgressive International Adjustable Bread Keeperbecause I have been making bread and have only one container in which my bread fit (often awkwardly), and I generally make 2.  What had appealed to me was that it is large enough for breads from a bread maker (which I now infrequently use) as well as large hand made loaves, *and* it's adjustable so it doesn't take up as much space when it is not in use.I have to admit that I was skeptical about the air-flow feature.  I live on the wet side of the island of Oahu where we have humidity in the 90-100% range 9 months/ year, thinking it is as likely to let moisture in as out.  Few things last in this environment and consequently most go in the freezer.I came to write this review because I made 2 loaves of bread earlier this week, intending one to be frozen.  My husband put one in the progressive bead box & one in a zip lock to freeze it, but he forgot.  This morning I made breakfast for my son and saw that the loaf in the box looked good, while the loaf in the zip lock had mold on it! (you will be spared the comparative photos ;) )  Both loaves were cool and dry before being packed up, but I guess the zip lock trapped enough of the ambient moisture that it resulted in mold in just a couple of days while there was none on the bread in the box.I've contemplated the purchase of a second, but honestly we wouldn't eat 2 loaves fast enough to make that practical..One will still go in the freezer, but from now on I will be using this bread box in preference to that one storage container, and the nice wooden bread box w have sitting on the counter because I have seen proof of concept in my kitchen: it works!Heartily recommended.  It does keep your bread fresher!
4	1320796800	Very convenient and usable.  adjustable air vent works great.  allows air to circulate.  handles larger loaves with the adjustable sides.  Retains freshness of bread.
5	1320710400	Sure saves on plastic wrap and special bread bags. Easy to use and keeps bread just right, especially here in TX. I love it.
5	1319587200	This is a perfect little container for my bread.  I make a loaf once about every five days, and this keeps it nice and fresh the whole time.  Before this I was just using plastic wrap, and the bread would get a little stale after 3 days.  I have a bread machine which I make about a 1.5lb loaf at a time, and it fits perfectly when I close it all the way.  So glad I got this.
5	1318723200	This is one of the best kitchen items that I have bought in a long time.  I bake a lot of bread and finally a bread box that is a great keeper.  Everyone should have this little gem!
4	1318291200	I read the poor reviews here where people complained that the product cracked soon after receiving it. Mine did too. It arrived in good shape, but as I was pulling the two pieces apart the very first time, a crack appeared at the vented end. It doesn't look deep enough to cause immediate concern, so I opted not to return it. I suspect the replacement unit would crack, too. It's a nice bread keeper. My bread definitely stays "fresh" in it for a couple of days, but that back panel should probably have been made with thicker, more durable plastic.Update: I originally bought this product in Oct 2011, and it's now March 2012. The crack has not gotten any worse, and the bread keeps just fine. I'm raising the review from 3 stars to 4.
1	1318204800	I am not giving this product any negative rating because I dont find anything wrong with it. But I wish I had not bought it. It is nothing more than a box to store stuff. My bread lasts the same length of time it used to when I stored them in paper bags. So no point. The art of sliding one end of the box into another needs some skills that you will develop after 2 weeks of use. Not exactly a winning design.It is a fancy casing to show off a nice bread, but nothing more than that.10/22/2012- the air valve came apart a couple of months back and don't fit snugly back into its position. I would not recommend this plastic box.
4	1317945600	This really keeps homemade bread good for several days, without hardening.It's transparent, so you never forget about your bread. And the price is right.
5	1317686400	This item is a must have for keeping your bread fresh.  I have really used this product and find that you can store your items and have the option to allow air to circulate and is so helpful when you need to store something when it is still slightly warm.  Every home needs this for storage of any bread or cookie. Being clear and also having the option to close and compact your items is most helpful.
5	1317600000	I can't believe how much of a difference this makes in keeping my bread fresh. I am at how much longer my bread stays fresh!
5	1317513600	I love this thing! It is such an awesome way to store my freshly baked bread and it keeps the bread fresh for longer than a couple days.
5	1317427200	We make all our bread and have always used plastic bags(from grocery store to purchased bags, cloth and plastic from speciality stores). Pluses:  dont need another bread box, can see at a glance on your kitchen counter how much bread remains before next baking, strong and clear plastic resins have been used, excellent ventillation which really works, easily rinseable,  should last much longer than bags.  Cons:  sometimes my bread machine bread rises too high and i need to cut off a slice to fit, the cutting board is really better used as a slider in and out,  I purchased 2 (one for currently used bread and one for newly baked bread) and they stack easily with their rubber feet and both fit  stacked under the kitchen cabinet. I will buy 2 more for my 2nd home.
5	1316822400	I am a home bread maker for a short time. I learned that there are products to help keep your bread fresh for 2 or 3 days.  I am able to use my bread for 4 days because of this bread keeper, if I toast the bread. Read the "how to use" info and you will be pleasantly surprised of its effectiveness.  And the price is lower at Amazon than other on-line  sites I researched.
5	1315612800	Very happy with my purchase - bread definitely doesn't dry out as fast. After reading the other reviews i decided not to dishwash it.
5	1315008000	So I was purchasing a bread machine on Amazon and one of the suggested items to also purchase was this bread keeper.  I have never purchased a suggested product before, but this one looked like a very clever storage solution that would save numerous plastic zipper bags that tend to be an awkward fit and don't do anything for bread quality and just get thrown away in the end.  I love that this bread keeper is adjustable because it fits a wider variety of baked goods and you can shrink it as you consume bread.  I also love that you have the option to vent the bread so if you put it away a little warm (which I have done) there is no condensation.  I also love the little cutting board that comes with it, it's a really nice touch and saves subjecting my other cutting boards to electric and serrated slicing knives.  This a very high quality and practical product that I am so glad I purchased with my bread machine.  I do wish that it had some form of locking or latching mechanism to prevent the bread keeper from expanding or collapsing when you don't want it to like when you are carrying it or sliding it on the counter, but this isn't a big problem because the pieces fit together tightly enough that it doesn't slide too easily or too much.
4	1315008000	I will say this bread box is really good but keeps my bread fresh only 2 days before it starts to taste like store bought quality. The other thing, would recommend getting a screen where air vent is to keep fruit flies out. After I remove my bread from machine, I have to let it cool off completely or else I get condensation even with vent fully open. As far as cutting board, I don't use that at all because it is useless. I bought a cherry one from this site. For the price pretty decent and if I had to do it again I would buy it
5	1314662400	This was purchased as a Christmas Gift.  Purchase a breadmaker last year as a Christmas present.  This is an accessory.
5	1314576000	I love the choices you have with this bread keeper. The adjustable holes allow total control of humidity. Big loaf, small loaf, small loaf with muffins, everything is possible due to its adjustable size. Very easy to wash too. It is one of the best things I have ever owned and I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1314489600	I was a little nervous about the size but it this product fit a large loaf of homemade bread perfectly!
5	1314316800	HAVE BEEN USING THIS BREAD SAVER FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS PLUS.  WE LIVE IN FLA. AND KEEPING BREAD IS A BATTLE.  WE BUY FRESH BAKED BREAD (LOVE IT) AND SO FAR THE BREAD HAS KEPTS BEAUTIFULLY.  i LEAVE THE LITTLE HOLES SLIGHTLY OPEN, SLIGHTLY!IT SEEMS TO WORK AND WE ARE SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED.  IT DOES APPEAR FRAGILE, SO AM CAREFUL ABOUT USING IT AND WASH IT GENTLY BY HAND.  AT THIS PRICE IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH THE TRY.
1	1314144000	Maybe this works for white bread, but doesnt work for our 100% homemade whole wheat bread. bread molds. maybe we are not using it right. or maybe whole wheat goes bad faster than white, oh wait it does.
5	1313539200	I was looking for a way to store my homemade bread. It seemed that no matter what I tried, the "open" end of the bread would get dried out and hard - forcing me to cut off and discard a slice every time I wanted a piece of bread. Very wasteful. This product really works. Not only has it lengthened the amount of time that fresh bread remains viable, it also keeps the whole loaf, open ends and all, soft and wonderful. The built-in cutting board is a great plus too!
3	1313280000	This bread box can only accommodate small loaves of bread. While the air holes seemed like a good idea at first, I ended up having to let my bread cool on a rack anyway because they didn't let enough steam out. It's also rather awkward to open compared to a simple plastic bag.This bread box is now collecting dust at the bottom of a kitchen cabinet.
4	1313020800	I bought this breadbox last winter during the cold, wet winter season in western Oregon.  I've waited until late summer so I could test it in our dry late summer weather as well.  It certainly looks attractive to store a loaf of fresh home-baked bread in this box, much better than my previous sloppy plastic bag.  It works fairly well.  It keeps a loaf fresher than the airtight plastic will and prevents mold within reason.  BUT----you must be sure to clean it out thoroughly between loaves.  Careless crumbs will turn green and ruin the new loaf.As others have mentioned, the quality of the manufacture leaves something to be desired.  The dial is very loose and and the plastic feels like it could break easily. The cutting board is for decorative use only.  Too small to cut on. Still, I recommend it.  It's kept my home-baked bread fresher longer through three seasons, it looks attractive on the counter, and the price is right.
5	1312934400	This product looks like a rip-off, because it is plastic and seems like it should sell for about 98 cents.  However it works great and does everything it is claimed to do.  It keeps our bread fresh without a hint of soggy!
5	1312675200	I am very happy with my bread keeper. Obviously how much can I say about a bread keep except that it works very well. I have noticed that a lot of my home baked bread (I use store bought frozen)seems to last longer before I see any mold in the summer. This is a big problem with my bread. I like the adjustable air holes that lets you decide how much air to let in at different times of the year. Well made fits together perfect and I like the added cutting board that come with it. Very good product.
5	1312675200	I purchased this breadbox with some skepticism but needed something to put fresh bread in after baking.  The reviews were good so I tried it and have been very surprised by its ability to keep bread fresh and without mold for 4 days or more.  I live in FL so moldy bread is a regular occurrence if not refrigerated.  It works and is nice enough to keep on the counter and the board makes cutting a slice and sliding the bread right back in easy and neat.
2	1312502400	I bought this because I make my own bread, and I'd like to keep it as fresh as possible.Turns out this is NOT for that use:1. Forget trying to fit rolls or rustic-shaped loafs in here, much less several at a time (most recipes produce 2-3 loaves of bread, so you'll have to find somewhere else for the others).  The two fixed dimensions are pretty restrictive (basically to sandwich loaves), and the ability to change the length is not very useful. You can't add enough length to the box to make it hold any more than a standard-sized loaf. To get anything interesting (i.e. other than a sandwich loaf) to fit into this thing, I have to butcher it.2. The bread box is actually two open-ended boxes, one of which slides into the other. This makes getting to your bread a chore: you have to tip it over so that the bread slides into one of the boxes, remove the other box, take the bread out, do whatever you were going to do, put the bread back in, jostle the bread around so you can slide back in the other portion of the bread box, then untip the box. In the process, the air dial probably moved, so you have to remember to readjust it. Too much effort just to get to your bread!3. The included bread board is absurdly tiny. You can't even fit a standard loaf of bread on it.
5	1311897600	I have found this bread keeper to be a great asset to bread making. You can store the bread while it is still warm.  It keeps the loaf fresh.  The bottom piece serves as a cutting board. Glad I added it to the purchase of the bread machine.
5	1311897600	I've been baking my own bread for several months now, and I very quickly realized I needed good storage for the loaves.  This product is wonderful!  It holds any shape loaf and it maintains freshness.  I have not had a loaf spoil!  I am ordering another adjustable bread keeper for my sister.  I know she will like it as much as I do.
5	1311724800	So far I have use this item to store four loaves of homemade bread, some wheat, some sweet. My bread is definitely staying fresh longer with the vents. I wish that this came in another shape to store homemade rolls. I am thinking of ordering a second one.
5	1311292800	I bought this product on a lark because I was purchasing "stuff" for baking bread.  I did not truly believe it would be helpful.  Surprise!  It easily holds a 1-1/2 lb. loaf from my breadmaker ... and ... my bread stays fresh for days on the counter.  I highly recommend this product.
3	1310947200	The drawbacks are(1) It isn't well-built enough.  I have been very careful with it but I figure that if it drops, it could easily crack.  This is common in a made in China product.  They want to sell very large quantity and selling poor quality helps with that.(2) The air holes cannot easily be blocked off extremely well, to keep the bread a little better or to keep insects out.  Shifting to block them only blocks them a little.  It would be nice to be able to make the blockage a little more secure than sticking wobbly plastic over the holes.The advantages are(1) Convenient to have a well-sized cutting board to pull out and pull a little of the loaf on top of.(2) Nice to have friction points to prevent the bread keeper from shifting easily.(3) The size is about right for most breadmaker bread loaves.
5	1310515200	I really do appreciate this product.  My bread is protected and stays fresh longer.  I don't have to worry about smashed bread either!
5	1309478400	I love this bread keeper.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is expandable and keeps my breadmaker's bread fresh.  The size is perfect for stowing away inside a cabinet. Washes well.
5	1309305600	Wonderful product, convenient and effective.  The sliding case means you take up less counterspace and the box is never larger than the bread!
3	1309305600	Bread molds in it faster than when I keep it in its bag. The adjustable vents work fine but the last few slices eventually transpire, water drops accumulate in the back corners they're resting against, then mold appears on the back wall. This, in dry air and with vent open. A second adjustable vent or some other ventilation method might fix this. I may try drilling a few small holes around the back wall.Vent holes allow fruit flies access. They're probably attracted to the moisture that collects on the back wall.Taking bread out of the box involves a bit more work than it should. You have to pick the box up from where you keep it, lay it on its back and slide the top outwards to make sure no slices fall off. With unsliced bread you can probably just slide the inner (back) piece out with some care, without moving the entire bread keeper.I'm now keeping the bread in the toaster oven instead (when not in use). Works like a charm.
2	1309219200	This turned out to be quite the inconvenient item. It is adjustible to fit the size of the loaf, but you have to open it all the way to remove 1 slice of bread, and then the bread falls out. I do not recommend it. Thanks
5	1308873600	I love to make bread with my bread machine, but have always struggled to store it later. Plastic bread bags were either too small for the 1.5 loaf of bread or trapped all the moisture, which made the bread moldy only days after it was baked. I've tried all sorts of solutions until I finally got this bread keeper. My bread lasts over a week in this container,and it stays fresh that whole time. I adjust the moisture vent a couple times during the week to prevent it from drying out, and I keep it on the counter out of the sun. The cutting board is handy and the whole system is easy to clean by hand or by dropping it in the dishwasher. I'm very happy with this little investment!
5	1308528000	Can't ask for a better bread keeper, it easily handles most breadmaker's loaves and keeps them moist but not moldy. Good adjustable venting, good construction, scratches but not easily.
5	1307404800	A must have - before, I was wasting gallon sized ziploc bags with every loaf I baked. Now, I let the bread cool some, and then pop it inside this keeper with the vents open to store it. Keeps the bread fresh, not too moist, and protects it from drying out, dust, and critters.
4	1307318400	I purchased this about a month ago and have been very happy with it. I make bread about once a week and the bread stays very fresh. But given the fact that we do eat the bread within a week, I can't really tell you how long the bread would stay fresh. I usually let the bread cool down completely and then put it in the keeper with the vent shut. It works very well and my 2 lb. loaves fit just fine. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the vent is actually pretty loose so its very easy to knock it to a different air flow setting if you brush by it getting something out of the cabinet. Other than that a great product.
4	1306281600	This is great for storing my homemade bread, the only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is because my bread will not fit until I slice off the first few slices.  The adjustment for air keeps bread perfectly fresh
5	1306108800	I bake bread every week and this has made a world of difference, the loaves keep fresher for much longer.  It compact, but expands for larger items, it is well made and a good design.  I highly recommend this product.
4	1305676800	Works great for me living in the desert southwest.  Unique vent feature allows you to fine tune the perfect amount of air ventilation to prevent drying out while keeping bread fresher, longer.  Easily holds both 1.5 and 2 pound loafs from my vertical loaf bread machine.  Included cutting block is a nice feature.
5	1305417600	My wife bakes bread every week for our family and we store the sliced bread in one of these. We have found that this little vented plastic box work very well. The bread seems to last mush longer and stays fresher. Great product.
3	1304899200	Purchased this bread keeper July 2010 and have used it since.  It is well sized to hold a 2 lb. loaf of bread.  Purchasers should keep the following in mind:1)  It takes 2 hands to move about.  The two pieces slide apart easily, and the "handles" are too small to securely hold the bread keeper in one hand.2)  One of the "handles" is actually a rather flimsy plastic piece which snaps into one end of the keeper and allows you to cover or uncover a number of holes in the box so as to control the humidity inside the box and thus (theoretically) reduce mold.  The problem is that the little plastic piece which rotates around to cover or uncover the holes is flimsy and broke off after only 3 months of use.3)  The box itself is constructed out of heavy plastic, but drop it once and it will crack.I am shopping for another keeper now, but will not buy another one of these.
5	1304467200	I love the bread keeper.  It keeps the bread moist and fresh.  The fact that it is adjustable helps on counter space.
5	1304294400	I really like using this product because I no longer have to fool with plastic wrap and gallon bags to store my bread!  I like that it can get smaller as my loaf does, and I had no trouble fitting it in my cabinet (just measure your shelf height if you're unsure!).  The adjustable vent is nice.  I do leave it open if my bread is still a little warm, though there is still steam build-up if it's too warm.  I do recommend cooling the bread as much as possible, contrary to what the instructions say.  Overall, I love this bread keeper!
5	1303862400	I've been using this for several weeks now and it keeps bread fresh! Love how it expands to fit the larger loaves.
4	1303776000	Keeps all sizes of bread.  Also keeps it fresh longer.  Had a little trouble adjusting the vent to get the right moisture.I use it to defrost items from freezer also.
4	1303603200	Thanks for the prompt and professional service. It works as advertised EXCEPT that in warmer times, the bread becomes moldy if not used up quickly.
5	1303516800	This is really a good buy!  My bread stays fresh and the cutting board is perfect.  It isn't suitable for already sliced bread.  It is made to store the entire loaf and slice it off as needed.  It looks great next to my bread machine.  I would NOT hesitate to buy this!  I used zip lock type bags and this is FAR SUPERIOR!  You won't regret this purchase.
5	1303430400	After searching for a good, inexpensive bread box, I decided to order this Progressive International Adjustable Bread Keeper (what a name, huh?). It was a really good choice;the bread can be long or short, fat or skinny, any flavor.And you can control the humidity! We love it!
4	1303430400	We bought this not necessarily to keep bread fresh longer (since we go through it fairly quickly) but just to have something nice looking on the counter to hold the bread. It works well. We dropped one side of it before and it cracked a bit and the knob broke off, but we don't need that part anyways.
5	1302480000	The bread keeper is a great storage device, attactive enough to keep out on counter. The air vent allows for proper humidity levels to be maintained. Easy to keep clean.
5	1302307200	I was looking for a good way store and keep my homemade bread fresh. This was exactly what i needed. The loaf fits perfectly inside and it keeps for about a week and a half.
4	1301875200	I was looking for one of these for ages. They are used a lot in Europe where Organic/preservative free bread can be kept at it's optimal time, which admittedly is not long - but it helps. I could not find one in the USA and thought I would need to get one on my next trip to Europe, Amazon once again helped out. This is a clean & simple no fuss bread keeper. There is a humidity control so you can keep moisture locked in or let it out, depending on where you live or what type of heating you have.. I use it for croissants, brioche, scones, any baked goods you need to keep as fresh as you can for as long as you can, without adding preservatives. The white tray you can see in the bottom is apparently a little cutting board which I will never use, but I like this product a lot and would highly recommend it.
4	1301097600	Works as advertised. In AZ there is a need to keep a container of water with the bread. Still, the bread lasts no more than two or three days.
5	1300924800	I like this item. It keeps bread fresh for a long time and it looks great in my kitchen. Even though it's square, I keep regular loafs of bread in it too, it fits just fine.
5	1300752000	I love this product.  It works so well.  Our homemade bread it always soft now and it seems to not mold like it did when kept in a freezer bag.  I think this is just fantastic.
4	1300492800	Read all the reviews, this is truly a great little bread keeper.  It has a vent to let in as little or as much air as you want and it's much more convient than the plastic bread storage bags.  And best of all, it's supposed to be dishwasher safe....wait a minute then why did mine warp and melt even though it was on the top dish rack.  According to the company, "this can happen...it can be put in the dishwasher but it's better to hand wash".  I still love the bread keeper so Amazon is sending me another one, but I won't put this one in our dishwasher.  FYI, we have a brand new kitchen aid dishwash and our hotwater heater is only set to 120 degrees.
5	1300233600	We've had a similar bread keeper for years and it worked wonderfully, but it did not have the adjustable air vent.  It had a slice guide, which this unit doesn't have, but the slice guide was made of thin, hard plastic and it didn't take long before we had cut all the way through it.  I really don't care about the slice guide, but I like the thick cutting board in this bread keeper.  No way we will be cutting through this one!  We were really happy with the last one we had, but this one fixes the two most annoying problems of the last one, so, as I titled the review, this one is perfect!
5	1300233600	I started baking our own bread and this keeps the bread fresh for a very long time -- just what I was looking for.
5	1299715200	Excellent for fresh, homemade bread.  Vent allows the steam to escape so that bread does not get soggy, then closes to keep bread fresh and keeps it from drying out.
2	1299628800	I like some aspects of this bread keeper, but its plastic walls are not durable at all. Although it was never dropped or washed in the dish washer, it developed a crack all along one end, which of course affects how fresh it can keep the bread.
5	1299628800	This Bread Keeper is amazing.... I had one loaf in there for 12 days before it started to mould (it's hard to keep homemade bread fresh)! It also stays moist longer than using plastic bags, and saves on the environment too!  If I keep bread in the fridge, it dries out too quick.  This bread keeper is a keeper!  I plan on buying one for my neighbor who bakes also.  Great invention!!!
4	1299542400	It does what it is supposed to do.  It had a tiny stress crack in the corner, but not too bad and not returning a $10 item.  It is a little bigger than a 2lb bread loaf.  I envisioned it being bigger, but fits counter nicely.  Worth the price for what it is- no more ziplock freezer bags lying around the counter with bread.
5	1299369600	If you make your own bread, this bread keeper is a must.  Does everything you'd want a bread keeper to do.  It opens easily to slice the desired amount from your loaf and has a handy cutting board on the bottom.  There is an adjustable setting for dry to humid climate.  No negatives that I can see plus I love looking at the loaf sitting on the counter.
5	1298592000	This adjustable bread keeper is exactly what I needed for my bread machine loaves. It's easy to use, easy to clean and keeps my bread perfectly moist. I bought two and use them every single day. And I love the little cutting board inside! This is a very convenient, beautifully designed product.
3	1298332800	Unfortunately, the smallest this compresses is when I still have half a loaf left.  Because of that, there is an excess of air inside the product for half the time I use it, allowing the loaf to dry up.  Also, I have been using the dishwasher after each use, so after maybe 10 uses, the container has lost its clarity and is badly scratched up.  It is rather unsightly to have sitting on the counter top now.
5	1295308800	I make 2-3 loaves a weeks so mold is not a problem.  This item keeps your bread sealed from air and the bread does not go stale in that time frame.  A week is a reasonable time to keep bread fresh.  Highly reccommended for bread makers.
5	1294531200	i purchased the bread keeper as part of a 3 piece gift for my son and daughter in law for christmas. he is very pleased with the gift.
5	1294444800	I like this bread keeper better than others because it has the adjustable vent, easily adjusts to many sizes of breads, and has it's own cutting board.
5	1294099200	I liked this item more than I thought I would.I wanted to get away from using plastic bags and this did the trick. It is easy to use and easy to clean. More importantly it keeps the bread nice.
4	1293494400	I hunted for one for a long time. Very pleased with the Progressive Adjustable. It could be a little longer for my homemade long loaves. My husband is frustrated with its "only one way" to close and that it will not stand on end like our old, broken one. Not that those bother me much.
5	1292976000	Actually I bought this with some doubts in my mind wondering if it'd really work or not.  I'm a beginner bread baker and my first bread only stayed fresh for 1 day.  I had put it in an airtight container but it still went stale the next morning.  What a shame that my family had to eat stale breads!  That's why I decided to go for this bread keeper.  It's economical enough to give it a try, and most importantly, it has great reviews!  I really like the adjustable vents and this product really works!  Just make sure you don't put already sliced breads in it...it doesn't make sense to put already sliced breads in it anyways right?  Now my family can eat fresh breads and even if the crust becomes a little bit softer than before on the third day, it becomes just like freshly out of the oven after toasting it.All in all, this bread keeper is a great product with a great value!
5	1292716800	We bought this bread keeper along with a Zojirushi bread machine and was pleasantly surprised at how well it kept the bread. After nearly two weeks test we found no mold and still eatable product-although somewhat stiffer than when fresh. The adjustable feature allows the bread which is made with no preservatives, to be sheltered from outside air and counter space reduced as bread is used.
5	1291334400	I've just begun using my bread machine often and was getting sick of using large ziplock bags for storing the bread.  Decided that I needed a bread box... and the price & amazon reviews convinced me that this was the one to get.  I like that it's transparent, it seems to keep bread very fresh.  I'm on amazon right now to order another one! I've also taken to using it to store other baked goods.  It's a great place to keep muffins.  I only wish that they made a similarly designed product in a different shape, specifically for muffins!  They have a cupcake/cake carrier.. but it doesn't have the same neat vented design, so I'll just keep stacking my muffins in the bread box. :)
5	1290384000	This has worked great for the home made bread I make.  I like the adjustable loaf sizing and venting so that I get just the right amount of air circulation without making the bread stale and hard.  Truely a nice product.
5	1289865600	Got this Bread Keeper at the same time we bought a Bread machine, it keeps the bread moist and fresh.  Before we were wrapping the bread in plastic wrap to keep it fresh, this product is well worth the money.  Also has a nice little cutting board that comes with it. You can vary the air to keep the bread just to your liking.
2	1289865600	Looks like it works well enough, but the loaves coming out of my new bread machine are too large to fit! I'm annoyed with this since the bread machine was recommended on the page with the bread machine when I ordered it. For now, I'll just keep using the 2 1/2 gallon Jumbo Hefty zip bags.
3	1289088000	I bought this after seeing good reviews. I use it to store the bread that I bake with a bread making machine. My expectation was that when I wanted a slice of bread, I'd open the box, grab a slice from one end, and close it again. However, this box expands like an accordion and opens right in the middle. So, half the loaf is in one side of the box, the other half in the other, and the middle just drops out. So, I try to make it sit on the side so I can grab a slice from the other end. However, this is not easy since each end has the handle or the vent control valve...which means the box won't sit firm. This product is fine if you just want to keep bread before you want to use it...but it does not double up as a bread serving container. Ofcourse, there are no claims that it serves as a bread serving container so maybe this is a case of mismatched expectations from my side.
5	1289001600	This bread box/keeper really does its job of keeping bread fresh and tender(home-made in my case, with no preservatives)for 5 or 6 days. It has an adjustable vent in one end that allows you to open or close tiny vent holes according to the humidity in your home. The vent cover moved too easily every time the bread box was used, so I taped it where I wanted it to stay.And also, it comes with a handy, small cutting board that fits inside the box under the loaf.The only minus I found is, that this bread box/keeper is oversized, even for large home-made loaves and/or the largest store bought loaves. The length is fine, but the height makes it bulky, and over-sized. It would be much more attractive if not so "tall", and I think would still be very functional. I would recommend this box overall for keeping bread fresh for almost a week.
1	1288915200	I make homemade bread fairly often and thought it would be good idea to have convenient storage for it. This one has too low of a ceiling in order to provide room for high homemade bread. Store brands don't actually need any particular storage as they can stay fresh for weeks, so one wonders what the purpose of this bread keeper was. Perhaps only for those folks who buy freshly baked bread of a particular size.
1	1288915200	The title of this review says it. Within a week it had literally fallen apart. This meant that the knob on the front that is meant to control how open it is to outside air was useless.
5	1288656000	I am so pleased with how well this keeps bread.  I had my doubts when I ordered but it has turned out to be worth every penny.  I would really recommend this to people who bake their own bread.
5	1288569600	I've baked three loaves since getting this and put them in here just before they were room temperature and they have stayed fresh for several days - when I would expect after a day that the cut end would be hard and dry, its moist and soft just as it was when I cut it!I have now used this for several loaves of bread  - and find that it stays fresh until the loaf is gone, moist without getting mushy, I love it!
5	1286928000	We have had this bread keeper now for about a month and wonder how we ever did without it. We bake all of our own breads. Its sleek design sits nicely on our countertop without making the countertop look cluttered. Loaf after loaf we have not experienced any loss from mildew and we can't  figure out if its the vent adjustment or the design. It doesn't matter how it happens as long as it works. If you are into bread baking this dandy Keeper is an essential.
5	1286496000	This little box is truly a miracle.  Before I purchased it, my homemade bread wouldn't last 24 hours without getting hard as a brick.I was pretty skeptical that a small plastic box with a vent could offer much improvement.  However, my last loaf of bread lasted three days and still tasted as fresh as when I baked it.It's easy to use and looks nice on the counter.  A little bothersome to fumble with the loaf and cutting board, but I can't think of a better design.Note that it is NOT for pre-sliced bread (that's why it has a cutting board included).  Using it for storing sliced bread will just cause a lot of frustration.$11.75 to keep my homemade loaves fresh?  What a great deal!!
5	1286150400	I love this keeper. It has a modern and unusual look. Even though I have to slice a loaf to fit the keeper, I don't care. I definitely would recommend it to friends.
1	1285632000	Bad design: think about how you open it when you have a lot of sliced bread inside. You have to turn it vertical (when you have a lot of sliced bread), otherwise the bread will fall out of the box. Even turn it vertical, you still need to use one hand help the bread stay from falling.It is a smart idea to change the size of the box, but in fact it is very inconvenient to open the box, while trying to keep the sliced bread inside the box when you open it. No way to do it, especially when you have a lot of sliced bread in it. The bread will fall out of the box.In addition, the box is really big for bread.
4	1285372800	I really didn't have very high hopes for this product, but it has exceeded my expectations in keeping my freshly baked bread fresh for several days!  Since I bought a bread machine, I have been baking a loaf every few days.  This bread keeper not only keeps the loaf fresh, it makes it readily accessible.  The board on the inside that can be used for cutting the bread is a really nice addition.
4	1285027200	I am very happy with the quality and how well it keeps the bread.  The only problem that I have with it is when you open it - if you have a longer loaf in it, there is no easy way to open it without all of your slices falling out.  It basically opens in the middle of the loaf and is hard to close again and your slices are all messed up.  The best thing to do is to leave it unsliced, and just slice as you go.
5	1285027200	This little box is the perfect size for the bread from my new bread maker.  My husband wasn't too thrilled with the idea, he thinks tossing it in a drawer is just fine.  But even he has come around, mostly because of the cutting board that the bread sits on, that comes with the bread keeper.Great purchase, happy I bought it.Update after a year of use - still works great, still use it all the time, still very happy that I bought it.
5	1284768000	I purchased this from Amazon when I started making my own bread, and it has been indispensible.  The vent allows for condensation to happen without wilting the bread.  Also, I have had half a loaf in there for a week, and there is no mold, nothing but fresh bread.  And, I know I don't have preservatives in my bread!  I highly recommend this.
1	1284681600	This does not work if you keep it on the counter.  My bread turned green within a very short period of time.  Now I keep it in the refrigerator and it works fine.
1	1284249600	i purchased this for my bread machine bread several months ago.the plastic is that cheap brittle stuff that cracks easy but i thought perhaps its been improved since my younger years.the two halfs of the cube have rounded corners and within several days of use stress fractures or cracks appeared. i continued to use it for my bread because they didnt open up and i needed to keep my bread fresh. today several months down the road with this item there are many more stress cracks everywhere the rounded corners are and as i sat with my knitting this morning i could hear what sounded like ice falling from the roof in winter. i went in the kitchen to find the source there before my eyes the bread keeper cracked twice more in the middle under the vent area. this crack can be felt by the fingers as higher on one side than the other.now i have never dropped it do not have a dishwasher have cleaned it with a damp cloth and dried it. never put hot bread in it---in short i took great care since i bake all my own bread and was so happy to find something to keep it in.  i had planned on getting two more but now i say its thumbs down not on your nelly and ill wrap it in duct tape since ill be danged if ill throw it out. i spent the money too late to return it now. i will use it until it literally falls to bits. i do NOT recommend this project. the design is great but as with many things made in china the manufacturing is faulty and cheap
4	1284163200	This is perfect for a homemade loaf of bread.  I used to wrap it in foil and nobody would wrap it back up after taking a piece.  This keeps it fresh the longest.
5	1284163200	Good for storing homemade breads just like it says! Even in my dry climate sometimes leaving the vents open is not a bad idea.
5	1282953600	I can't believe how much of a difference this makes in keeping my bread fresh. I've always wrapped my home-made bread in a tea towel just like my grandmother taught me (cotton is breathable, so bread stays fresher than uncovered, but doesn't get soft and soggy like it would in air-tight container). I bought this keeper for the bread board -- I was tired of getting out and cleaning crumbs from a board every time I wanted a piece of toast --- this keeper keeps everything tidy -- and I like the humidity dial where you can control the breathability of the keeper. You can not imagine how surprised I am at how much longer my bread stays fresh! I placed the cut edge of the bread down on the board when I put it away and when I picked it up to cut it 3 days later, it was as soft as a new loaf! I am used to fresh loaves being stale by the 3rd day, so this is great! Now I can make one loaf a week instead of two. Very impressed. FYI, I have the humidity dial all the way closed except for a very tiny bit to let some moisture out to keep the crust firm.
4	1281916800	I needed a better way to store and keep my homemade bread fresh than zipper bags. This does just that. The vent is nice for when the loaf has not completely cooled, as long as you remember to close it soon enough. It works great for my needs and exceded my expectations. I do not use the mini cutting board that came with it for its intended purpose because I don't want to scratch it all up.
4	1281398400	I got this last week and really loved the design. It fits my breadmaker's 1lb loaves perfectly and would fit a standard sized loaf too as it expands. There's an air vent that can be adjusted but when it's closed, it's not perfectly closed. We thought we were rid of household ants but a day after storing bread in this breadbox, they came swarming back. So now, after cleaning out the ants and setting traps, etc., I use the breadbox along with a ziploc bag that's 1/4 open, with the opening of the bag facing opposite the vent. So it keeps the bread fresh and the ants at bay. The cutting board that comes with this breadbox is tiny and only marginally useful. I like cutting bread on a large wooden board because crumbs don't go all over the place . Still, it's a nice breadbox design and I like the clear plastic so you can see how much is left.
5	1281225600	I bought the bread keeper together with my zojurishi bread maker, it is fantastic for keeping the bread fresh, and last for a long time
5	1281225600	Bread keepers arrived well packed and in perfect condition, contrary to a few reviews I read prior to purchase. Items perform exactly as described regarding the venting system - be sure to read all directions. I found the included cutting trays to also be too small for the purpose, as some reviews had indicated.
5	1281139200	I ordered this bread keeper and noticed when I received it that it had several cracks on the side.  I notified the company about it and they sent out another one immediately.  It keeps breads/pastries fresh. It has vents on each side and slides in or out to accomodate the size of your bread.
1	1280880000	I ordered 2 of these since they had good reviews. Don't waste your money. One came completely all cracked up on one side. I did the return process with the Amazon return label and Amazon never received the returned item - lost in the mail? So now I've paid for three of them. They do not fit loaves made from a Panasonic bread machine unless they are cut in half first. I found these to be very flimsy. The small bread board easily stains. I think I'm better off continuing with my plastic bag storage.
5	1278979200	This product works very well for keeping bread fresh.  Living in a desert area with very low humidity makes it a challenge to keep baked goods fresh.  I place the loaves directly from the breadmaker into the keeper, and open the vent.  Once the initial moisture has evaporated from the keeper I close the vent completely and our bread stays fresh for days.
2	1278547200	I've had this bread box for a few months now and while it works fairly well, the construction does not hold up. I may have got a defective unit but my bread box already has hair lines cracks all near the edges. I've never dropped it or anything like that.
5	1278460800	I got a bread machine in May and have been making bread 3 or 4 times a week, usually take the bread to work to share with co-workers, this little bread keeper is perfect for homemade bread and transport.  Keeps bread fresh longer and even has a cutting board inside.  Holds even the extra large loaves.  Love it!  Want to get another one.
5	1278374400	We make a couple loaves of homemade bread each week. Previously, we'd take out a cutting board and then need to clean that off each time we cut a slice and the bread wouldn't stay fresh long since it has no preservatives.Putting it in the fridge dries it out, tupperware and ziplocs kept moisture in and make bread mold...This works perfect. The directions will tell you where to set the vent in the back due to the humidity in your area. For bread with no preservatives to last, many don't realize a bit of air is what it needs...but not so much that it hardens the crust too much.This opens to easily fit a 2 lb loaf with much room to spare.The great thing, too, is the cutting board inside. Just slide this open, cut your slice, and put it away...no more brushing crumbs off the counter or washing a big cutting board each time you cut a slice.I would buy this brand again if I ever needed another...it's truly keeping the bread fresh twice as long.Negatives: The plastic is a little light. That hasn't been an issue for us, but I could see it could possible crack if dropped or put in the bottom of the dishwasher (I haven't tested this theory; we do wash it in the top of our dishwasher) and the vent can turn a little too easily so that when we handle it, we need to make sure it remains in the right place when we are done.
5	1276732800	This really works very well!!  It has taken any loaf I've made in my bread machine thus far..  It does a good job of keeping breads fresh but... not indefinetly.  I (like some others) have been putting it in the refrig at times.. They say not to but I can't understand why..  I guess they feel if it's  cold it may crack??  Hasn't happened yet!  Bottom line-  Glad I got it!!!!
4	1276128000	I bought this bread keeper after I purchased a bread machine. If you are making your own bread, this is a useful tool and it's "greener" than using disposable bags. The recommendation was that bread does better in a bread keeper at room temperature than in a bag in the fridge. I find it keeps the bread fresh for about five days on my kitchen counter. The adjustable feature allows for different size loaves and keeping the loaf compact as you slice and use the bread. I like the vent feature as you can adjust air intake to the conditions of the bread and the room. My only criticism is I usually make medium size loaves and sometimes they end up too tall for the for the keeper. I have to slice off the heel and turn the loaf on its side to store it. I recommend this product.
5	1275955200	Bought this item with a Panasonic Bread Maker.  I had been using  plastic ziplock bags to store the loafs in.  I find that the bread keeps very well in it and will stay fresh for several days.  The only drawback is that the XL sized bread(2.5 lb) won't fit inside unless you cut some of it off. Any size smaller will easily fit. Since one does not typically bake bread to store it before eating it, it really is not an issue.  I like that the air control is adjustable.
4	1274227200	I like the functionality of the design and it looks okay sitting on my counters.  I've been using it for maybe a month and there are tiny little hairline fractures in the plastic, it still works fine, just a alittle disappointing.
5	1273622400	This breadkeeper really keeps the bread nice and fresh.  This is the first one I found that holds the bread well.  None other fits bread from the bread maker like this one.Easy to clean and looks nice sitting out on the counter.
4	1273449600	Its a bread box, it holds bread, and you can squish it down to a smaller size when you have less bread.  It easily holds a 2lb loaf of bread from my Zo breadmaker, and I liked it enough that I bought a second one.My only worry is the plastic has tiny striations in it, but no actual cracks yet.  Lets hope it holds up to the test of time.
5	1273017600	This product is great.  It keeps our home made bread soft and fresh.  I also like having it on the counter since you can put your loaf "on display".  It can change from big, or small and perfect for making fresh products.
5	1272758400	Despite some of the negative feedback I ordered this item, half-expecting it to be cracked or missing significant parts. The price was good so I thought I'd gamble. I was so happy with the item that I ordered a second one that arrived as perfect as the first. I've been using them for 2-3 weeks and am pleased with both the design and the function.
5	1272240000	I have only had the bread keeper for about a month but so far it is great.
5	1272153600	I really like this product...it keeps the bread fresh...gives me a convenient slicing board and just plain comes in handy for all my homemade bread machine breads!  I am happy with the purchase.
5	1271894400	We bake bread almost every week using whole grains to grind our own flour. The results are wonderful but no preservatives also means a shorter lifespan. Artisian breads are particularly prone to disruption given the high humidity (and constant air conditioning) used in Florida.After gasping over the prices of acrylic bread bins and metal bread boxes, this seemed like an inexpensive way to keep bread fresh. Ordered one via the 4/3 promotion and immediately came back to order a second one. Easy to use, easy to clean and very effective...best of all, the price is right!
5	1271548800	ok this has to be the best bread keeper I have ever owned. This to me is a must buy, the other bread keepers I have owned the bread went bad within days, this one, kept my bread fresh for over 6 days, and I have been making homemade breads for over 12 years and this is the first bread keeper that has really been a blessing to me. Thank you, I will recommend this product. sincerly Deanna Miller
5	1270771200	I like that this is adjustable.  I make my own breads, so having this thing rocks!  It allows you to keep it fresh whether the climate is dry or wet.  It's wonderful.  Someone sure was thinking when they made this.
4	1270425600	Does as described.  Great for fresh home made bread.  The white plastic bread board doesn't really get used and not ideal for cutting bread - a little small.  The vents keep the bread fresh longer over keeping fresh bread in a bread bag.
4	1270339200	After years of using bread bags and losing the twist ties, this is a welcome upgrade.It's a good size for small or large loaves.It's kind of nice to have your bread on display instead of hidden in a normal bread box.
4	1269475200	make bread 3x weekly....keeps it from going stale.  the moisture control knob is loose, so I tape it in place.
4	1268006400	As a bread machine user I bake about 2-3 loafs a week. This little gadget really helps to keep the bread fresh and the crumbs contained.
5	1266969600	This is a great product.  It keeps homemade breads fresher longer.  Love it.
2	1266105600	I love making bread and my goal was to find a way to store/transport the product of my addiction.  This is one of the attempts to satisfy that goal.  It is a bit small. The plastic cracked upon one accidental drop just 2ft from the ground. The two sides completely come apart and there is no way to lock together.  It could be improved greatly by some sort of ajustable slide lock mechanism. Overall this is a piece of crap.  I am still using it until I find something better.
5	1266105600	This bread box is perfect storage for home made bread.  It expands and/or contracts.  It breathes.  I really like it.
4	1265846400	Having a bread machine, which gets used a lot in the Winter months, I needed a good storage space for the bread. This fit the need perfectly and will be used all year. A good product.
5	1265846400	Love the size of this bread keeper! Great price and keeps our homemade bread fresh. Like the fact that it has a bread board inside.
4	1265414400	It is too small for a 2 lb. loaf of bread from my bread machine, otherwise I really like it.
5	1265414400	Bread keeps longer -- adaptable to different loaf sizes -- looks neat on the counter.  I highly recommend this product -- very much worth the money.
4	1264377600	Seems to be doing the job just as it says.  We've had no problem except the cutting board is a little useless with it being so small.
5	1264204800	I ordered two of the same items and they arrived safe and sound.  I use one for us while we consume our bread and the other while my in-laws are enjoying their latest gift of homemade bread.  When it comes back clean I know my next job as a good daughter-in-law of going on 35 years to make another loaf of their favorite bread.  I love keeping it filled for them to enjoy so that it brings back memories of everyday homemade bread.  Their grandchildren and now their great grandchildren have all all learned that the "grocery" items so easily purchased in stores not so long ago were produced at home by a team of kids as part of their chores,  and that was what they did before TV and video games and all the free fun time outside.  Of course my life is a lot easier.  Now, I use a bread maker.  However, at one time my job at home after homework and before I went off to college was to help my mother make the breads for our family.  Of course, in the modern time of the late fifties and the rocking sixties, we did have a home freezer in which to store our bounty.
3	1264118400	I bake lots of bread, I usually store my bread in ziploc bags. I wanted to have something that I could re-use. The bread box is good for storing bread, but I found that the bread does mold quicker in the bread box than it does in the ziploc bags.
5	1264032000	I didn't think it would keep the bread soft but all my home made breads seem to do well when stored in the bread keeper. I recommend it highly.
5	1263600000	My wife loves this for her home-made bread. Before, her bread was stale the next day. Now it lasts 3-5 days (she doesn't add any preservatives). Since things are humid in Georgia, we keep the vent fully open. This was cheap, is easy to use and clean, highly recommended.
5	1263081600	Good price, quick delivery, excellent condition, very functional, useful, sanitary and easy to clean and maintain.  Just started the home breadmaking thing - and this bread keeper is a must-have if you intend to do the same.  It may seem a little counter-intuitive to actually have an adjustment to let air into the storage space (although you can still close it 100% off), but believe it or not it's actually the humidity balance that will optimize the freshness of your home-baked bread (assuming you're not putting preservatives into your mix!).  The adjustability is very useful.  I would highly recommend this to anyone purchasing a home bread making machine.  It's probably very useful for optimizing the storage of store-bought baked goods as well.
2	1262736000	I bought this because of one review that said this item fits a 2lb loaf.  I don't know what type of bread machine that person uses, but I have a Breadman Ultimate and it doesn't even come close to fitting my loaf.  I'll keep the item and use it for rolls or something, since by the time I paid for shipping to return it, it won't be worth the effort.  Make one a bit taller please!!
1	1262131200	I placed this order as a Christmas present for my mother.  The problems I experienced with this company started just a few days later.When completing checkout it was stated that the shipping method would be UPS.  I have a different address for UPS vs. USPS so I am very careful to verify the method before providing the information.  A few days after my order was placed I received an email with a USPS tracking number.  I immediately contacted them to let them know they would need to change the address if they were going to use this shipping provider.  The response I got back was full of misspellings and poor grammar.  My guess is the customer service office is out of country, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but in this situation just compounded an already poor experience.  They did not acknowledge the change in shipping and just restated my USPS tracking number.I again contacted the company after the USPS website showed that the package was back at their facility.  The package had been with them since Dec. 23rd and it was now the 29th.  I inquired when they would be re-sending the item as I still wanted to give it to my mom even though Christmas was over.  The email I received back informed me that they would not be shipping it and were issuing me a refund minus shipping and a 20% restocking fee.  They also provided a portion of their refund agreement in the email which again stated that they ship using UPS.I have asked the company for a refund.  If they had provided me with the proper information to begin with this never would have happened.  Judging by their responses in the past and other peoples experience with their service I am certainly not holding my breath.  I have also opened a claim with Amazon.I have always had good experiences with Amazon and am hoping they will drop this vendor as they are operating far below normal standards.  Until then, I would recommend that everyone stay far away from LUCCA.*UPDATE* Today (01/12) I received the remainder of my money back from Amazon.  The seller never did respond to my emails.
5	1261872000	Nice size and handy features - like the vent and cutting board.  Good size and feet hold it in place on the counter - doesn't slide around when you open it.
5	1259539200	This product keeps my bread well, weather it is still slightly warm from making or not, it only takes up a small amount of bench space and is not garish.  The little chopping board comes in handy too.
5	1259193600	My homemade bread used to start to go stale almost immediately as I use no preservatives.With this little device, I slice my bread after it cookes (and cools) and put it into the Bread Keeper (I close off the holes)Two days later, my bread is still fresh. It would probably stay fresh longer, but all the bread is eaten by then.It sure beats using ziploc bags for every loaf!I do not use the cutting board of the keeper so I cannot comment on that.
1	1259107200	Ordered two from here - both arrived broken and had to be returned.  It wasn't a small crack - both ends were severely shattered.  I doubt that it happened during shipping as I found the same items in a local gourmet outlet (for a third less) and at a second store - also shattered.  Unless Amazon is willing to check the item before it ships, think twice about ordering.  The product packaging doesn't adequately protect the product, and as I've now come across 6 broken ones from 3 different sources I've given up on this product.  I'll just get bread bags from now on.
1	1259020800	Very handy accessory.  About 2 days is the limit, though.  The second day you should put the bread in a plastic bag.  Home made bread only lasts one day around here.  So, it serves us well.
4	1257292800	This bread keeper has served us well so far. It can handle a very large (2 lb) loaf and has kept them fresh at room temperature for days. I have only put it through light use so far but it is holding up to expectations.
5	1255392000	I really like my bread keeper. It is the perfect size for homemade loaves. Once a few slices have been cut and the loaf gets short enough, I store the loaf on the cut side to help keep it fresh. It is fairly air tight and keeps a loaf suitably fresh for a week. I wish it was a little longer, but even so, it's just big enough for a 9" loaf. It's too short for a loaf of bread you would buy at the store, but you probably wouldn't use it for that anyway. Nice product.
4	1251936000	Great for keeping my 2 lb. loaf. It doesn't recommend putting it in the frig, but I do anyway. My bread seems to keep just fine, although I haven't figured out the best adjustment to keep my bread as moist as I would like it.
3	1251590400	First of all it is too small to fit the loaves that come out of my bread machine. Second, you have to take it completely apart and slide out the little cutting board to cut the bread.  And third, the air holes are large enough to let fruit flies in so I don't suggest you leave them open if you have any fruit like bananas or grapes in the house.  So long as you make sure your family washes their hands thoroughly before touching the bread, it keeps the mold out fairly well.
2	1250985600	Hi! thanks for taking the time to read this review. I recently bought this bread box, which promised to be a good one, and it is. However, packaging and transportation caused a crack in the bread keeper which makes it not to deliver what the seller promised. The little board isn't so useful as well. Thanks again and buy a box directly from a not-internet store.
5	1249430400	This bread keeper has solved a problem we've had with bread mildew as bread stayed fresh twice as long.  It's saved us money. is easy to use and to clean.  We are very happy with the purchase.
4	1247011200	I use this to keep bread I make from going stale.  It's been pretty sturdy and I like the handles on the end they make it easier to open and close.  It also has a vent, so you can put in bread that's not quite cool and not end up with a steamy mess.  The idea that you can use the included cutting board and the end of the box as a guide for cutting slices sounds good, but does not work very well, but that's a minor quibble.
5	1245801600	Stop trying to jam that 2 lb. fresh (bread machine) loaf of bread in a plastic bag.  For some reason, grocery stores do not carry boxes of plastic bags that are large enough to store these 2 lb. loafs.  I've tried for months.  Finally I found this and the plastic bags are history.  Good for me and good for the environment too.  This is a great product.  I'm glad I found it and bought it.  You won't regret having this on hand to store that wonderful loaf of bread fresh from the bread machine or oven.
5	1234396800	don't see how any home bread baker can live without this adjustable bread keeper. I bought two.
5	1233878400	I ordered three of these and they work well to keep the bread fresh. What I liked about is the most is that I can clearly see the bread and it keeps the counter better organized. I ordered three of them and use it every day.
3	1233187200	It seems to be just as advertised, I find the adjustable air vent to be a great feature, as living in Florida where we have a high humidity and home made bread with no preservatives added, it must be vented or it will mold in just two or three days.  I had read reviews on how some customers received there order cracked or broken as it was not wraped for protection, but mine took me 10 minutes to unpack it from all the protection wrapping it came with and it did not have a scratch on it, so far I would say it seems to be a good item.
2	1229731200	Pros: reasonable priceCons: it does extend to hold larger bread, but there's no lock or any mechinism to keep the outer half in that extended state. As a result, it's inconvenient to move it around because it can fall apart and drop the bread easily. Good idea but bad design.My most complaint goes to the seller. This fragile item was sent WITHOUT ANY PADDING. The seller AsSeenOnTVGuys just put it in a large USPS document envelope and mailed it. It arrived with 3 cracks, the largest one runs through entire side of the outer half.  I have to fix it with a clear tape.Sent an email to AsSeenOnTVGuys 10 days ago, no response. From a previous user review, it happened before, yet AsSeenOnTVGuys continues to mail it without any packaging.
3	1226188800	This really is the sort of gizmo that  you see "advertised on tv" and it is a good idea, but poorly executed. Yes, it holds bread, and is adjustable, and has a little vent. And you can see through the plastic to see how much is left. The two halves are klutzy to pull apart and reassemble, easy enough to do but it requires lots of room and is sort of crude. Nothing elegant about this design.If you bake, be aware that fresh bread will fog up the plastic even after it has cooled for two hours, the bread loses its crunchy crust in a matter of a day or so, and the little white platform for the bread easily scars with use of the bread knife. You will probably choose to use a separate cutting board to avoid damaging it further.You can adjust the little dial to control the amount of air holes that are open, but I am not sure it really makes a difference. The two halves do not make an airtight seal and allow air in and out regardless of the setting on the dial.The question really is what is out there that is better. Like a nonstick broiling pan that can take the heat, this is cook's need that is still unmet. A bread box that keeps bread fresh and crispy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside.I continue to dream.
2	1220659200	Although I like the product and it arrived in a timely fashion, it came with a crack in item.  Honestly, I was too busy to bother returning it but I was disappointed about that.  Any chance of a credit toward another purchase?Thank you, Anita Glick
5	1211328000	What can you say about a bread keeper that would encourage people to purchase one?It works!We like home made breads and you are left with few options when you have left over fresh bread. Put it on a bag and let moisture build up or find a bread keeper.One of the better points of this keeper is that it has slotted sides that I can use as a guide when I cut fresh slices off my loaf. Being adjustable means that I don't need to have extra air in my container to hasten the process of drying out my bread.A great item for folks that like to make home made bread. Now if only someone would find a way to do the same thing for artisan breads....:)
3	1209686400	The breadkeeper (as  seen on TV) is plastic and originally arrived cracked. It wasn't very well packaged. I requested an received info to return it, and it was replaced within about 2 weeks, well packaged.  It's an OK breadkeeper/slicer guide, but I'm not thrilled with it.  I bake my own bread, no preservatives, and it doesn't keep it as fresh as my breadsack. I do use the slicer guide that came with it to slice more evenly, and not thin on top and thick at the bottom or vice versa. For the cost, it's an OK deal. And the service was good.
4	1209427200	With an electric knife it cuts the bread nice and evenly.  Anyone trying to get home made bread to be cut like store bread I'd recommend getting this product.
5	1204502400	This product is amazing. I can now slice all my bread loaves perfectly! The plastic container keeps the loaves fresh until it is sliced again. I am very happy to have it.
5	1168473600	I was looking for a regular guide when I decided to buy this, hoping that it would work okay. It is a lot better than I'd hoped. Well worth the price, and you don't have to look for something to keep the bread fresh in.
