4	1404864000	Enjoyable read
5	1404864000	Could hardly put the book down.  Love every thing about it.
5	1404691200	Good beach read
5	1404518400	Wonderful Summer Beach Read!
5	1404086400	What I most liked about this book was that all the characters were struggling with real life problems.  They all did not have perfect lives with perfect families and perfect marriages.  Characters like these can truly relate to the average reader.  I only wish there was a follow up book continuing on with the same people and their children.
4	1404000000	I read this based on a review.  I really enjoyed it and then realized to my horror it was a Harlequin Novel....hahaha!!!!!!  Well, I guess perhaps I shouldn't be so snooty about romance novels in the future...it was pretty realistic and humorous and pertinent even though the happy ending should have given it away as that's usually not the case in &#34;literature.&#34;
2	1403827200	was a cute chic bookbut really not very deep pretty predictable quick read good fornot having to think a lot about what you are reading
4	1403740800	Really enjoyed this book.  It was a great read and I have reserved the next in the series of the Blackberry Island books.
4	1403481600	Always enjoy her books. Wish there were less &#34;bedroom&#34; scenes. I wind up just skipping over them. It doesn't seem to me that they add much if anything to the story. She writes a good story, so why bother with these uninteresting, boring parts.
5	1403481600	I would highly recommend this bookIt kept my interest thru out the whole book,I would highly recommend it to my friends.Thank you.Lois Miller
4	1403481600	This story was nice and calm. The outcomes were kind of predictable but still enjoyable. I'm sure we all are in need of a happy ending book.
5	1403395200	I thought this was a great book, loved the contemporary issues that we face in todays world. A great summertime read.
4	1402963200	I enjoyed this book.  It was entertaining and interesting.  About three woemn going through different problems and manage to find a sisterhood with each other.
4	1402963200	This was a good book. I enjoyed it very much. It was a fun read. I love books by Susan Mallery.
4	1402876800	Loved this book. Kept me interested all thru out. Didn't want to put it down. Disappointed when it was done. On to the next Susan Mallery boon
5	1402704000	I thought this book was very enjoyable. The characters were fun and interesting to read about. It was great to see how the characters evolved in the book.  I would highly recommend this book. Once you start the book it is hard to put down!
4	1402444800	Easy read, fast moving, well written.  Would recommend to a friend.  Good book club book because of discussion questions that are included.
4	1402358400	I enjoyed reading this book. While I was on a beach vacation, it is fun, quick, easy reading, feel good book.
5	1402099200	Such an easy and enjoyable read. Reiterates the fact that often times our friends end up being our family. We all have a story and it is so refreshing when those who know it love us any way.
3	1402099200	Easy summer reading, 3women  and their problems with careers, men and marriages, growing up, and children.  Predictable in the end,but a fun read
5	1401840000	I loved this story of starting over...bonding with people that at first blush the lead character thought she didn't like and then getting through the mire together and coming out as best friends. We are all human and all have our foibles!  This book affirms how they can bring us together.
4	1401753600	I enjoyed reading Three Sisters.  It was the coming together of three ladies who had different problems in their lives.  With each others help they were able to overcome them.  I wish that this was a series and we could learn a little more about their lives.
4	1401667200	What a wonderful story.  This one just flowed for me, each character was relatable and touched my heart.  I shed some tears with this one as each lady overcame her struggle/problem.  Boston holds a special place in my mind for sure!  I will have a book hangover for weeks about these characters.  Well done Susan Mallery another winner in my book!
3	1401580800	Too much explicit sex. Not needed. Love the girls and how the women bonded. Liked the first book on Blackberry Inn better.
4	1401408000	The story was well written.  I really enjoyed the way the three different stories were merged into one and wanted each of the stories to continue.
4	1401321600	Interesting characters with common concerns, once they were willing to see past the surface of strangers. Another Blackberry Island winner.
4	1401235200	Really enjoyed another blackberry island story.  Great story line! Love the old hoses and the remodel, etc.  can't wait for the next book.
5	1401148800	She is a great author especially if you enjoy novels about friendships and how women support each other. Would like to visit BlackBerry Island some day!
5	1401148800	Susan Mallery does a great job of portraying true-to-life situations in a clean and heart-felt manner.  This is a great read!
4	1401062400	This is a fast read &#34;chick flick&#34;of a book. She developed her characters and their interaction with each other very well.
5	1400976000	Enjoyed seeing these characters stories unfold and am happy to recommend this book to others. I will most certainly be reading more books by this author.
5	1400976000	I love this Author!!!  Storyline is clever. Easy reading when you just want to be entertained.  Loved it.  Thank you
5	1400716800	These charachters are believable and flawed like most of us fightin our own demons.  Three strong women with three very diffeent stories create a bound of friendship that helps themall survive!
5	1400457600	Great stories, pacing and character building. I couldn't put it down, but it was a quietly, positive tugging. My first Susan Mallery book but I've already purchased Barefoot Season and can't wait to read it.
4	1400457600	Three Sisters was definitely chick lit. A good beach book,though it was very predictable. I did enjoy each of the characters
3	1400371200	This story is a little different from what I would normally read but I found the book very easy to read and enjoyable.I selected the 3 stars as I said I liked it but not a 5 star read. I would recommend this book to friends for light reading.
4	1400112000	Great tail of three woman who bond although personalities are so different. They truly become the same. I would recommend
5	1400025600	This is a great book! I couldn't put it down. The characters had you laughing and crying at the same time.
4	1399939200	Blackberry Island has a special charm that attracts new residents and offers sameness and solace to the long time residents.  All of the characters are interesting and have their own story to share....and how the three gals become involved in the others lives.  Remodeling, romance, and 're-discovering ' things about themselves makes a great read......plus a vacation on Blackberry Island...enjoy!
5	1399939200	I must say this is one of my most favorite books of all time. I don't think I have been as emotionally touched by a book in a long time. I was able to connect to each of the three main female characters. I really saw a small piece of me in each of them. This was one very touching book. I think I almost went through a whole box of tissues!
3	1399939200	I listened to this book on audio recording.  The story was enjoyable, but the woman who read the story was a horrible reader.  Her voice was breathy and annoying, and you couldn't hear or understand the last word of a sentence.  Trying to hear the book in a car was so frustrating.  She also deepened her voice for the male characters and it was terrible!Don't listen to this book.  Read it!
2	1399852800	It is fluff.  I read it on vacation, so I finished it by plane.  Too predictable and utterly unbelievable w/ a main character moving away from all she knew to an island.  Not harmful or offensive, just one I wouldn't bother to ever read again or recommend to friends.
4	1399852800	This was a good book - I felt like at times one of the characters was a total bad word but liked the other two characters. The resolution seemed pulled together rather quickly but left the reader satisfied with a happy ending.
5	1399852800	Loved this book!  Great read, fun summer reading with some good twists. Hoping to see if there are more books on these characters.
5	1399766400	I felt like I knew these characters. It kept my attention and I was anxious to see how things played out for these 3 neighbors.
4	1399680000	I found it was hard to put the book down.  I want to find out what was going to happen.
5	1399680000	This author keeps you entwined in the story line and makes it sooo exciting.  A great author and she kept me not wanting to put the book down.
5	1399507200	I loved this book.  If this how Susan Mallery writes.....I now have a new favorite author!!!Can't wait to read more if her books.
5	1399161600	Fantastic book...Great read!!!  I would highly recommend.  Read in about 4 days!  Beach  or vacation reading material for sure!  Awesome!
3	1399161600	I am no literary genius, but this book was a little to fluffy for me.  Not enough to it to keep me interested for long.
4	1398902400	I chose this book because I enjoy books about relationships. I like following the lives of women friends. I only gave it 4 stars because it ends a little too abruptly. Otherwise, it definitely kept my interest ( even though I realized I had read it quite a while ago)
5	1398816000	I have read all 3 books in the Blackberry Series and all 3 were very good.  I had never read Susan Mallery before, but her books are wonderful.
5	1398816000	Susan Mallery produces another great hit.  This series of books are truly great.  You can't wait to see what is going to happen next.
4	1398556800	It was ok but the story jumped all around and was hard to keep up with who was being portrayed.
5	1398297600	This is the 2nd book in the Blackberry Island trilogy.The three sisters are three victorian houses on a hilltop on Blackberry Island.  The folks who live in the houses are as different as night and day.  The three women in these houses slowly open up to each other and help each other find a way to become friends, almost as close as sisters.I loved the character development and felt like I knew these women and their men and wanted to become friends.I am anxious to read the final book.
5	1398297600	I really enjoyed this book because it gave you a look at 3 different women and what their families meant to them and how it ended up that they felt as sisters.  It was a hard book to put down.
5	1398124800	Very Good!  It was not what I expected.  It was better.  These three home owners who happen to be women and neighbors really was quite good.  They have very diverse lives from the trying to be happy homemaker and loving mother, to the depressed and mourning artist and finally the left at the altar pediatrician.  How they come together to save one of them, support the other and make the third feel at home is great.
5	1398124800	Susan Mallery is one of my favorite authors and she can't write new books quickly enough for me!  Love the 3 storylines and how the characters are entertwined with each other.  I don't want it to end!
5	1397779200	This is a series, not knowing I read them out of order. Love the book and didn't want to put it down!
4	1397779200	I loved that the main characters weren't perfect and were working towards healing themselves and each other. I also loved the authors descriptions of the characters and their surroundings, I could visualize everything so clearly.
3	1397606400	Blackberry Island must be possessed.  For a psychologist this would be fodder.  Most of the characters have major phobias or personal demons.  I don't mind an occasional nut, but all the characters seem strange.
4	1397606400	I enjoyed the psychological dilemas that the women in this book faced.  The ending was pretty predictable, but it held my interest because I was invested in the characters.  The setting sounded like a wonderful place to live.
5	1397347200	Awesome story...keep me interested start to finish! I also ordered the other two books in the series and will read more from Susan Mallory!
5	1397260800	I'm a huge Susan Mallery fan. I enjoy her books. This one was different but it was also a classic type of read. The &#34;Three Sister&#34; were actually the houses on the hill. Their owners were brought together by becoming the owners of these Victorian houses. All three, Deanna, Boston and Andi are very different. Their problems and their lives are very different. In the end, they have solved their &#34;problems&#34; and have their HAE. Lovely.
5	1397260800	Book 2 in the series of 3.  The 3 books in the series aren't tied very tightly together.  Each book is about different characters within the community.  It's an easy read to escape for a few hours.
5	1397088000	This was a light easy to read warm story about friendships.  Girl stories are always enjoyable. Great beach reading for the summer.
4	1397001600	I enjoyed this book.  I only gave 4 stars because at one point in the book I almost didn't finish it.  I thought I knew what would happen next.  However, I'm glad I gave it another shot and read the entire book.  There were some unexpected twists I didn't expect overall found the book a good read.
4	1397001600	Good story with three sisters houses being occupied by three women -- each with unique personalities.Setting is in Pacific northwest.
5	1396828800	I was recently introduced to Susan Mallery's writing in her first book in this series, &#34;Barefoot Season&#34;. I love Mallery's writing - it has emotional depth, humor and love. I'm a big fan of multiple story lines and Mallery wove together the journeys of three women seamlessly. Her characters were real and I had empathy for them as they faced their struggles.Overall, a definite great read for the beach, a vacation, or the bathtub....or anywhere else.
2	1396828800	I really enjoyed Barefoot Season so I thought I'd get the other 2 books in this series. This book was a tremendous disappointment in style, tone and content. Andi's past was reviewed so many times I thought there was an editing error. Colin was a completely flat one note character. Deanna was cast in a &#34;Mommy Dearest&#34; light which was simplistic and out of touch with how mental illness can be presented today. I disliked the constant focus on drinking alcohol. This was not a book for me and I was sorry I purchased it based upon Barefoot Season.
5	1396569600	Second one in the series, but can be read on it's one.  Characters were real and relatable.  I loved how Mallery writes about strong women.
3	1396569600	The second book in the Blackberry Island series and the crazy continues! But I did like this one better than the first.The title refers to three Victorian homes on a hill, the story is about the residents. The sad withdrawn artist who lost a baby, the uptight OCD afflicted perfectionist who only feels calm while washing the skin off her hands, and the new doctor, who has run away to rebuild her life after her douche boyfriend dumped her after ten years.Plenty of dysfunction to go around, but also some pretty heartfelt story telling.
5	1396483200	This is one of my favorites by Susan Mallery !! The story touches you right from the very beginning, it's the story of 3 woman who lives will bind them in a sisterhood of friendship. You will not want to put it down , love the Blackberry Island series.
5	1396396800	The characters were intriguing and entertaining and it was a really fun book to read. I really enjoyed this book and I'm already reading another Susan Mallery book.
4	1396396800	I enjoyed Three Sisters.  The 3 main characters were interesting and the problems each were experiencing rang true.  The development of their friendship was believable and engrossing.  Nice, easy read.
4	1396396800	I enjoyed reading this book.  The three women with their diverce lives was interesting to see how they were going to work together. The only drawback was the repetition of their backgrounds. I know it was important to establish,  but could have been less frequent.  The outcome was somewhat expected. I will read more books by this author.
3	1396310400	a good book but sexual parts unnecessary ... rather silly some of the conversations; i.e one of the characters saying she has condoms upstairs after she is kissed.
4	1396224000	Fun and easy read, reads pretty quickly.  Feels like summertime.  Good casual book to read, nothing crazy but good storyline.
4	1396224000	Susan Mallery has come through again - this book is a great story of friendship and overcoming difficulties.  I loved it
5	1396224000	To live with flaws or shortcomings is inevitable with the female gene. To watch how life transforms with awareness is amazing. A great story of the fallibility and strength of the feminine...great read!
5	1396137600	This book was truly captivating. It was about three women and their houses on the hill. None of them seemed to be a like only having the fact that their lives were falling apart. But when they start helping each other they nit only get a new outlook on life but become as close as sisters can be. It will break your heart but by the end the story will heal you and give you hope. Susan Mallery has done a beautiful job with this series looking forward to the next one.
4	1396137600	Three Sisters by Susan Mallery was a great addition to the Blackberry Island Books. I felt that Susan is trying to connect with her readers with very real situations that happen in every day life. One situations which happens with every marriage, or sometimes in dating, is fighting. Sometimes we choose to ignore our feelings, but unless we talk to each other, accept each other, and finally love each other, the relationship will go no where. In the book, it suggests subtly that married couples still need to date, even after they are married, they still need to communicate.This book starts out with three beautiful victorian homes, two of which were inherited and the last home was purchased between the pages of this book. All three of the Ladies who own each of these houses are very different. You have a artist on one side, a doctor in the middle, and an OCD mom on the other side. This story is about how these ladies with nothing in common, come together in a sisterhood and find friendship in each other, though they did not know one could exist.I liked this book, I liked this series, I look forward to reading more.
4	1395964800	Tells a story of redemption from the point of view of three women, predictable ending, but still an enjoyable read.
5	1395878400	I had read &#34;Evening Stars&#34; first and felt had to find the first book in this series to know the original characters better.  It was a wise decision. What a wonderful reading experience. This book has it all friendship, family and a love story  - angst, old relationship baggage,  judgment, understanding and acceptance.  This book made me laugh and made me cry. and waiting for book 3
5	1395878400	I love stories that ring true and this one definitely gets it right!!!!!  Although the three central women characters are VERY different people, their stories are all too real. Each one has her own issues and they are all different, and this book shows how we can all help each other through life and trauma despite tremendous differences. An absolutely great book I did not want to end!!!!!!
5	1395705600	The Blackberry Series has been very good.  Am on the third book now and they are hard to put down.  Hope there are some more in this series.
5	1395705600	A very enjoyable read  once I started couldnt put it down. Anyone who loves Susan Mallery will want to read this.
5	1395619200	Another great book by Susan Mallory.  Lots of emotions, learning to make families work, making new friends and finding a place in the community.
5	1395532800	I must officially declare myself a &#34;fan&#34; of Susan Mallery, as this is the second book of hers that I have read and enjoyed.  The first one, BAREFOOT SEASON, was previously reviewed by me.Ms. Mallery has truly mastered the art of writing about sisterhood and friendships among women.  It is not always easy for women to be true friends, and Ms. Mallery writes about the angst and struggle women sometimes have as they find out who they are - and who their true friends are.  In BAREFOOT SEASON, it was about a high school friendship gone wrong - in THREE SISTERS, it's about a small cul-de-sac of neighbors who have to get past their preconceived notions about the inhabitants of the other houses in order to come to a place of friendship, sisterhood and neighborhood joy.The title THREE SISTERS does not refer (initially) to the three women protagonists in the story.  It refers to the three houses that they live in, situated in a cul-de-sac, on a hill on Blackberry Island, a tourist spot not too far from Seattle, WA.  The houses reflect their owners - although you don't really realize that right off the bat.  There's Boston's house:  artsy, whimsical, colorful - just like Boston herself.  But Boston is suffering the tragic loss of her infant son, and possibly the loss of her marriage to her childhood sweetheart.  Andi's house, in the middle, is the fixer-upper that has been abandoned and is the &#34;eyesore&#34; of the neighborhood.  Neglected for decades, all the house needs is someone to invest the time, energy and money in it to restore it to its former glory.  Much like Andi - the youngest child of two accomplished medical professionals and sibling to two equally successful older siblings.  Not only did she just get jilted at the altar by her boyfriend of 10 years, she's left her life in Seattle behind to start all over - only this time, she is devoting herself to her pediatric practice and leaving love and men behind.  And then finally, there's Deanna's house: perfectly restored, everything in its place, immaculate and orderly.  Deanna would seem to have it all together, except her husband is threatening to leave her and her five daughters don't seem to like her at all and what's up with the constant scrubbing of her hands?Somehow, these three very different women find a way to live together - not only in the neighborhood - but in each other's hearts and lives as sisters of the heart.  I would not call this a &#34;feel good&#34; novel - there are some serious issues that are dealt with in this book:  OCD, loss of a child, parental disapproval - but all of the issues the characters face are dealt with compassionately and honestly.  This book will really make you think.I would recommend it to my friends who love stories about friendship and about overcoming the challenges that we face in life in order to reach a place of happiness for ourselves.  It is a quick, easy read and I look forward to reading more books by this author.
5	1395360000	I enjoyed reading this book.  The characters in this book sounded like friends I have known.  I 'm from a small town in NC.  I can relate to the small town scenario. . . .
5	1395273600	I could relate to all 3 women in this story. I empathized with them as my life had similar tragedies in it. I loved that you get pulled in to how broken they are and are right there with them as they struggle to overcome and break free of their passed baggage. It can be done and you can come out happy and a whole person again. The guys were hot too!!
4	1395187200	Good story and likeable characters provide an enjoyable read.  Haven't read a romance for in a while. Will read more Mallery.
4	1395100800	I enjoyed reading this book.  I loved the setting and it was satisfying to get to know the characters as their lives intertwined and they became friends.  Susan Mallery writes well, which I appreciate.  Her words and descriptions flow smoothly, so you can easily get a picture of the story in your mind.  When a book can take me away to another place, it's a good one.
5	1395014400	Susan Mallery always comes up with real characters with real emotions facing real issues in their lives. It so easy to become a part of the story. Her skills  are fabulously engaging. Family truely doesn't mean that you are blood relations. These relationships come from the heart.
5	1394928000	Another great Blackberry Island book. How the three women worked through tier emotional problems and learned to be friends with one another and also leaning how to make their personal relationships stronger and healthier.
3	1394928000	This particular book in the BlackBerry Island series started slow but picked up steam about halfway through and took off with a great second half of the book.
5	1394928000	Just finished the second book in the Blackberry Island series.  Couldn't put it down.  Was as good as the first.  Can't wait to start number three.  I think Susan Mallery is my newest favorite author.
5	1394496000	I loved this book.  I was fully entertained and fascinated by the sisterhood.  It really seemed like a true story, one anyone could relate to....fun and loving too.
5	1394323200	Three lives are intermingled with others of Blackberry Island. Seeing what happens to fortify and encourage each the other. Three Sisters is a very fulfilling read of such diversity.
5	1394236800	I couldn't put it down once I picked it up. Read it. You won't be sorry. Starting the last book now!!
5	1393891200	Chores to be done, food to be prepared. Oh well, I wonder what will happen on the next page. Great read!
5	1393804800	It was fast moving couldn't put it down,great author the kind of book you want to read again.thank you amazon
4	1393804800	A really good book. I love the way these three women put aside judgements and learn to love each other. And of course the HEAs are magic too.
5	1393718400	The story started out about 1 woman and gradually added in the stories about the neighbors. I enjoyed all of the stories and liked how the epilogue tied everything up nicely.
5	1393286400	I truly enjoyed this book. The ups and downs of the three women involved and their misconceptions of each other (initially) was very true to life, unfortunately. We could all take a lesson from what's written on these pages, and just maybe life would turn out more like the fiction in this book - what a grand idea!
5	1393027200	truly enjoyed this book...reminded me of Kristin Hannah. Love the way the characters developed. A wonderful afternoon of reading! You will love it!
4	1392940800	I liked the differences between the three women.  They all had problems (who doesn't), but managed to turn their lives into happy successes.  Boston may not have been able to cry, but I cried for her.
4	1392940800	Amazing book!  Enjoyed every word, cover to cover! A very good choice. Will recommed it to all my friends.  Will read another Susan Mallery book!!!!!
5	1392854400	I love Susan Mallery's books and this is no exception. She writes about three women from different backgrounds who find themselves drawing strength from each other and bonding in friendship because of their troubled pasts. This book has three storylines developing and intertwining into one single story. I recommend this book to anyone who believes in second chances at love and facing and getting past some emotional barriers.
4	1392681600	I like Susan Mallery's books for a fun light read.  It is a great read for sitting at the beach or beside the pool.
5	1392508800	I love the fact that there isn't a lot of fluff fill in this series. Can't wait for net book....
5	1391990400	Absolutely loved this book, can't wait to read more of the Blackberry Island books.Three women in three neighboring houses are portrayed in their 3D lives. Great story!
3	1391904000	Fast read with some interesting characters.  The location was idyllic and the men were perfect romance heroes. who doesn't like a story of renewal and new beginnings that include rehabilitating a lovely and beat up old Victorian?
5	1391904000	Real life stories- makes you want to read on. I'm concerned about the pricing for the remaining books.  If it's too high?
4	1391472000	I do not usually read this type of book. However, the story was good. The characters were excellent. It was fast reading. Did not learn much from it, but it was enjoyable.
5	1391299200	Loved the whole story! I like how all the house stories blended together! And topics came to life at the end
4	1390953600	Starts out slow. Turns into very good book with so much truths of three different lives. So many messages to take from this book, ended up loving it!!
4	1390867200	I thought Three Sisters was a very entertaining book and I really enjoyed it, although at times it was somewhat predictable.
5	1390694400	I have been reading many different types of contemporary books since I retired three years ago.  I get frustrated with some of the newer author ones that use sex as the story.  Nothing wrong with that unless that's all to the story.  I have many Susan Mallery books in my Kindle library so I thought I'd go with one of hers.  Let me just say that you can't go wrong reading one of her books!  No disappointment at all.  She always hits the mark of a book you don't want to put down until the end.  Reading about the lives of three very different women was refreshing:  control freak Deanne, artist Boston, and jilted bride Andi.  I was brought into their lives by the excellent storytelling of this author.  It was so real that I wanted to pull the hair of Deanne for the way she treated her husband and daughters.  I didn't feel an ounce of sorrow when they turned their backs on her.  I felt for the losing of a child and a marriage by Boston.  I couldn't understand the hesitation of Andi and Wade to continue a relationship.  I really, really enjoyed this book.  It even made me go back and revisit some of her others in my library!
4	1390435200	I really enjoyed this read, I couldn't wait to get back to my book!  Just enough happiness, sadness, laughter and love!
4	1390435200	What did I think? First off, I might be a little biased because I enjoy Susan Mallery's books IMMENSELY! I have fallen in love with her Fools Gold series and I have yet to come across any of her other books that I don't enjoy. Now, what did I think of Three Sisters? I enjoyed it, it was one of those types of books where you can totally feel the emotions the characters are feeling. I don't want to get into too much detail and give away parts of the book. I'm a firm believer in not spoiling the surprises but the characters each faced difficulties in their lives and the journey they took to get to their ending was heartwarming and I might have needed a tissue here and there.
4	1390003200	I enjoyed the emotional ups and downs of the three main characters. The book was a look into the complexities of how lifelong friendships are formed and how adversity can make you a stronger and more understanding individual.
5	1389916800	I'm so surprised at the bad reviews.  I loved the three main characters and I liked the men in their lives.  I agree, problems were wrapped up in the end of the book but aren't they supposed to be?  I think the center of this book was supposed to be the start of a very good friendship between these three women and the support they could offer each other.  On the outside their lives looked pretty good but each are dealing with their own set of issues and I liked how they became closer and were able to talk about their problems with each other and I liked how as they spent more time together you saw the progress of each woman.  To me Andie had the least of the problems but it was nice to see her understand Matt (and her mother) had been trying to change her and I liked that she realized she wasn't so bad the way she was.  I hope for a sequel because this is a great foundation for more story.
3	1389916800	Overall I enjoyed the book. True, the story lines had moments of improbability, but I liked the characters enough to forgive it. So that is my biggest complaint; you have to make some large allowances for these gaps in believability. But otherwise I engaged in each of the sub story lines and rooted for each of  them.
5	1389657600	A great read that draws you in and makes you feel your living on the Island. The three women have characteristics of us all that we can all relate to. I found myself analyzing my behavior to fit in with the &#34;sisters&#34; too.
4	1389657600	The three sisters are represented by the three houses, two of which are already restored. The houses match the personality of each of the women in the story. One house is perfect, and its owner is an uhappy perfectionist. One is an artist and her house reflects her artistic influence. The third women is a pediatrician. Her house is a fixer-upper. It is going to be her offices on the the first floor and she will live on the remaining floors. She hires a handsome, hunky contractor to do the work on the house. Slowly, but surely, the three women become friends. And as is predictable, they all change in positive ways. A great quick read with a feel-good ending.
3	1389398400	While This is not deep literature, this book has a lot to offer.  Woven into an engaging story are insightfully wrought solutions for common emotional hurts and crises that women (and men) face in life.  While the theaction happens too quickly and neatly, and the solutions are frequently far less grueling than real life, I am impressed that the issues and information about support options available to those who are hurt
4	1389312000	I enjoyed the lightness of the book.  I think at times it seemed to ramble on but it was fun.
5	1389052800	Loved the characters and how they grew and changed.I even saw a little of myself. Hated for book to end
3	1389052800	This was an interesting story.  It had a little too much description.It was somewhat depressing, but had a happy ending.
2	1388966400	it was too predictable.toomuch descriptive sex slightly boring. is it a cookbook or a romantic novel. recipes take up too much of the book
5	1388966400	This book is great. if you love beach reads this is it, Susan mallery really gets you interested in the characters' lives.
5	1388880000	Fun read!  Fast, feminine, and funny. Three Sisters will keep you guessing until the end. Susan Mallery has delivered again!
5	1388793600	Love Mallery.  Buy all books and have not been disappointed yet.  Love story and romance, easy read and always fun.
5	1388188800	I enjoyed reading.this book because it showed the different problems people have in their relationships and how they resolved them.
5	1387929600	A woman's story. A reader all the way through. You won't be able to put it down. I read it for book club and we all loved it.
4	1387756800	A great story of overcoming hardships, building lives and the necessity of friends to help us through the rough spots!
5	1387670400	Loved the book. It kept my interest throughout and since I have two sisters, I always enjoy books about other sisters.
3	1386806400	Pretty good book.  I didn't realize it was part of a trilogy, book #2, but it didn't matter.  I did wonder what the first book was like, but haven't read it yet.  After having a skype interview with the author during our book club at the library I learned that it was supposed to have a very different ending.  I'm pleased that it ended the way it did, that's for sure!  I've got to have my happily-ever-after, and this book delivers.  I loved how the relationship evolved for the three women, and I hope we hear at least a bit about them in the 3rd book.
5	1386460800	Loved the book loved the sisters Problems are meant to be solved with the help of sisters recommend this to all
4	1386028800	Light.  Enjoyable.  Reminder to not give up on love or the hope of love.  What life is meant to include.
5	1385424000	I truly enjoyed every minute of this book!  The characters were well developed and the storyline was compelling.  An enjoyable, easy read!
5	1385164800	what a fun read that touches secrets of the soul and the desires of the heart, I couldn't put it down.
3	1384214400	We read it for our book club and I usually prefer historical fiction but it was okat for something more modern.
3	1384041600	I might have been more critical in other circumstances, but I read this book when I needed an easy-to-read tale. Oh, two of the "sisters" certainly have serious problems, but in the end all is resolved.  Actually, resolved far too easily. I found Deanna's about-face (with her deep-seated neuroses) just too quick and easy. People with her kind of problem, in real life, need years to overcome it. There was a lot of repetition in the story, such as Boston's endless sketches of her dead baby and her husband's problems with that. But this book was not written to be a serious psychological study, and the romantic endings were to be expected. But all in all I quite enjoyed the book, the first Susan Mallery I've ever read.
5	1383523200	This is more than a light hearted romance.  Lots of stuff going on with the 3 women who are featured in this book.  Some of it is a little predictable but for the most part, this book is well written and I did not put it down till I finished reading it.  Looking forward to the next Blackberry Island book.
5	1383177600	love this book. How woman create real friendships. The author paints a picture of three woman going through trials that real woman go through.
5	1383177600	I have met these people before.  Great characters; people I root for all the way through.  Perhaps a little trite at the end, but I was hooked by then.
5	1383091200	Just finished reading Three Sisters by my fave author, Susan Mallery. It's the follow up to the first book of the Blackberry Island Trilogy, Barefoot Season. I definitely recommend this and any book by Mallery. She has a way with words that really touch the reader's heart and make the reader think. Interwoven in her characters are the feelings that many of us readers can identify with, and I believe that's what makes Mallery such a success.
5	1383091200	I love all of her books, I read everyone that comes out over and over.I am now starting all over with the Fools Gold books, so I can remember who is who.
4	1382918400	An easy read romance book about three home owners of varying degrees of differences in their Victorian Houses and how they become close friends and neighbors, especially over their &#34;men&#34;.
3	1382745600	If you are ready for a light read that is a feel good book, this will be enjoyable. I liked that each was able to find themselves in life
5	1382659200	I really enjoyed the interaction of the three women, Andi, Deanna and Boston and their friendship developed. I wanted to live on Blackberry Island. Very enjoyable.
4	1382572800	I am not much of a romance reader, so this book surprised me. I really liked the characters and their connection.
4	1382313600	I LOVED THESE  BOOKS....I seriously cannot rave enough about this set of booksfirst one was or should have been the second one, :)The first one in the series was just as interesting as this one.still an excellent read
5	1382140800	Susan Mallery puts you right on the island. . . Love the contrast of the three women.  Loving Three Sisters!
5	1382054400	Great great book. The book was very enjoyable. Once you start reading you are drawn in the homes of three different woman and their problems. The book was very enjoyable. By the end of the story you want to have a big group hug.
3	1381968000	it was light and fun a quick read with real characters in the story line. That part of the country must be lovely.
5	1381968000	This book is amazing, I read it cover to cover, couldn't put it down. I had never read another Susan Mallery book, but I intend to start!
5	1381449600	First time I have read a Susan Mallery book.  It was an easy read and flowed nicely.  I enjoyed how the characters intertwined together and became friends.
5	1381190400	Both books in the Blackberry Island series are just Fabulous! I would highly recommend them to anyone that enjoys reading.
5	1381104000	Nice, simple book with a good story line that is focused entirely on sex and violence; enjoyed the characters very much.
5	1380758400	I have read almost all of her books and love most of them.  I have enjoyed the Blackberry Islean one
4	1380672000	Good story will keep you reading to find out how it all ends. Makes one think how life would be living on a island. J Bernard
5	1380326400	Loved it!!!! Lots of dynamic personalities and relationships. Love the story of the three sisters and how they became to be.
3	1380067200	This was my first Susan Mallery book.  I decided to download it because it spent a few weeks on the NYTimes best seller list.It was a pretty good book, though I don't see myself looking for other books in this series.  I found the storyline predictable, but if you are looking to get lost in some chick-lit on the beach, this book is for you!
5	1380067200	Great book and fun reading for the summer. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it while I was on the beach! Reading another one of her books now.
3	1379462400	Sorry, it's too early to rate this book since I only recently purchased it.  Right now I am reading another book I bought through Amazon on my Kindle.
5	1379289600	Great light reading.  Interesting characters and description of area are beautiful.  Want to go there and live i one of the three sisters.
4	1379203200	Susan Mallery hit another home run!  This book read so fast!  The story of all three women were relatable and fast moving.  It was great to see each woman's story move forward in each chapter.  It made it seem more like real time.The intimate details of the romance  is my least favorite part, but at least each woman was with only one man.  They were real relationships with flaws and heart felt struggles.  As you read, you will want each woman to be happy at the end.  You can't help but route for them.I want more of the Blackberry Island books!  This may be my favorite Susan Mallery book to date.  So keep writing!opesopinions.com
4	1379030400	Great Characters and strong story line. I think I'll buy the next one. Susan Mallery is a pleasure to read.
2	1378944000	Honestly, this book is so depressing, I had to speed read thru the first twelve chapters. By chapter 24, seems as if things are somewhat hopeful... But this is going to be my last trip to this island.
5	1378512000	The characters are all so different, yet come to realize how much alike they are and learn from each other
5	1378425600	This is an amazing story about three women with everyday type problems and how they become friends. I loved this book so much that I purchased the kindle downloads for my sister and my mom. You will not be disappointed with this book and I would def recommend it to my reader friends.
5	1378339200	This is the first book that I read by Susan Mallery that takes place on "Blackberry Island" and now want to go back and purchaseBarefoot Season (Blackberry Island)which I understand is the first novel to take place in this setting.This novel has three main characters and deals with a whole host of issues.First, Andi Gordon, leaves Seattle to move to Blackberry Island after being left at the altar. Andi decides that she needs to get away from her family and bad memories and open up her own pediatrician practice.Second,  Deanna Phillips,  due to a horrible childhood strives to always be the perfect wife and mother. The problem is that Deanna's family finds her suffocating and she realizes that something has to give before she loses everything.Third, Boston King,  though she has perfect marriage is still dealing with a horrible loss that is slowly affecting her and her husband. The "three sisters" in the book title refer to three Queen Anne homes that are next to each other on Blackberry Island that Andi, Deanna, and Boston all live in.I have to say that I really did love this novel. However, I think when novels like this have so many interesting characters and plots you always end up liking other characters more. For me, I was less interested in Andi's story as much as I was interested in Deanna and Boston's personal stories. Deanna and Boston to me had serious issues that they needed to work through and though I did like Andi I found myself rushing through the novel anytime it shifted the focus back to her.I really do wish that Ms. Mallery had broken the novel into a trilogy that focused on one woman at a time in order for the reader to become completely immersed in each character. Due to the heavy issues that this novel dealt with I guess I don't know how realistic it is that Deanna and Boston's could have been fixed as fast as the timeline in the novel shows. I do want to say though that I am definitely looking forward to the next novel in this series!
5	1378339200	This book is a great summer reading. It is easy to read and once you pick it up you don't want to put it down.
5	1378339200	An easy read.  Good story of women and their friendships, new and old. Enjoyable ...I loved the ending.  Makes me want to redo a Victorian home.
5	1378166400	Loved this book.  Characters are great and would recommend to anyone.  Enjoy and pass along. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't!
5	1378080000	I couldn&#34;t put it down!!! Recommended by my daughter. I liked how they all became friends. Friends are true family:)
5	1377734400	I really enjoyed this book.  It shows how first impressions can be so wrong and may mean passing up on a great girlfriend relationship.  These relationships would be lasting if this was a real life story.  Great read!
4	1377475200	ENJOYED THE BOOK GOOD READING FOR ANYONE THAT HAS KNOWN DOUBT IN A RELATIONSHIP LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THEIR IS ALWAYS HOPE
5	1377216000	something new for me and very enjoyable.I will read other books by this writerI don't like to have to write so much, it is silly
4	1377129600	This story is not a romance it was Women's fiction.  It was about the relationship of 3 women living on Blackberry Island in homes near one another.  Each woman is going through something different and the story is about their friendship and how they make it through.  I would recommend this others looking for a good story.
5	1377043200	This book is a Pulse Racer. I couldn't put it down. Well written- intertwining three lives with heat, pain and repair.
3	1377043200	I am a sucker for stories about women's friendships and overcoming your past and really wanted to love this book, but they have to feel real - or at least plausible.  This book failed my ability to suspend disbelief on that point for me.  The friendship didn't feel genuine enough to me to overcome even mild emotional pain, much less the huge problems these women had.  All three of the women needed therapy, some more long-term than others.The titular Three Sisters are three Queen Anne houses on Blackberry Island and the three women lives in those houses.  At the beginning of the book, Deanna and Boston (who live in the end houses) don't like each other.  Andi Gordon buys the run-down middle house intending to renovate it for a pediatrician's office.  Within a few months, they supposedly become good friends and overcome their respective issues:  grief over the loss of a child, OCD and alcoholic parent issues, and being jilted by a long-term boyfriend and more parent issues.The book had possibilities and might have worked if this had been a three-part series with each women having her own book and the relationships growing over time.  But in one book taking place in such a short period there was too much going on for me to believe the various relationships and the personal changes, as much as I wanted to.If you love these kinds of books and are willing to go with the emotional flow without logic getting in the way, you will like this book more than I did.
3	1376956800	Although an easy read, much too predictable. Everyone ends up happily ever after.....really? most of the characters not credible. Would make a good hallmark film.
5	1376697600	I couldn't put it down! Read it in two days,! Highly recommend it. Very lively story and the characters just bring you into their world
4	1376611200	This book came to life because of how common the story line was. Could be any neighborhood and family anywhere.
5	1376524800	I have alsway enjoyed Sus Mallery books.  I have not read this yet, but expect hen it do to enjoy it.
4	1376524800	I really enjoy stories that have relationships in them. Girlfriends getting to know each other and encourage one another to become the best that they can be.
4	1376265600	What friends are for.  A truly delightful story of the three main characters who were so real.What problems people have and how wonderful friends can be when needed.  The author did a greatjob in her humor, description and relating all the dire circumstances.I must say the ending was predictable, but I wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way.I read this on my kindle and gave it four stars.
3	1376092800	More chick lit than romance, this novel isn't the story of three sisters, but of three women who live in similar Victorian houses and who come to know, support, and care for one another in exceptionally tough situations.  Andi has been left at the altar by her live-in boyfriend of ten years; Boston is haunted by guilt and grief after the death of her six-month-old son, and Deanna is battling obsessive-compulsive disorder that is destroying her family and her marriage.  The coincidence of the three women living next door to one another was a bit of a stretch for me: the grief and drama per acre was pretty high.While emotional chemistry is lightly sprinkled throughout the book, this story really centers on the women themselves and their struggles.Competently written, but not absorbing (no sentences to linger over), "Three Sisters" satisfies as a leisure read, but doesn't make the cut for my "keeper shelf." This was my first Susan Mallery novel, and while I won't avoid this author, I'm not in a hurry to pick up another of her books.  For my tastes, I prefer the writing and plots of Marion Keyes and Katherine Center, perhaps because I prefer to have my chick lit seasoned with a bit more humor.
5	1376006400	I enjoy her books so much because she takes the very real of who we are and gives an indepth characterization and development of her characters.  three women all with their own issues.  how women judge and are judged and how wrong we can be.  this is an excellent book, that I very much enjoyed.
3	1376006400	Three Sisters didn't really click with me. It was a quick read but at the end I felt dissatisfied. I thought the writing was alright and the storyline seemed interesting but I didn't connect with any of the characters. Of the three women, Deanna's was the only plight I could sympathize with. I disliked Andy and felt mostly indifferent towards Boston even though on paper her loss seems like the most gut-wrenching, but based on the writing I just didn't buy into it (to be fair to Ms. Mallery, I read The Light Between Oceans right before this book and almost anything else would seem inferior by comparison).
4	1376006400	Susan Mallery has a deep emotional writing style in this series, so it isn't a light hearted book, but you feel stronger emotionally after reading it. Understanding  more clearly that time, persistence and will can overcome whatever hardship you are facing or could face in the future.A book you'd want to keep on your shelf.
5	1376006400	This book was so full of the history of women, the Catholic Church, and social science,  that I couldn't put it down.The author claimed my interest in the first chapter, and I loved following every turn she took with her pen.I highly recommend it.
5	1375833600	Really enjoyed the Blackberry Island books.  Liked how it dealt with romance, life and friendships.  Anyone could related to one of these leading ladies.
1	1375747200	I usually like this author, what happened with this book. Hated the story, the characters were unlikeable and I never even finished it, because it was so BAD.
1	1375747200	I am not sure how this book got do many great reviews. For me it was horrible. Very unlikely story.
5	1375660800	Great book about relationships between women and how they have the power to help and heal us!!  Very positive and enjoyable story.
4	1375574400	I enjoyed this book.....relating the three homes with the three women in them.  All at a cross road in their lives; and how we must move on.  Pick ourselves up and decide we need change and do it.....Needing to accept where we are in our life and we have to control it.
3	1375488000	A bit too predicable for my taste. Feel good story, and that is a good thing, but prefer something with more meat to it.
4	1375401600	What an easy read,and very enjoyable book. It takes you through all emotions and makes you want to read on. An amazing author, with an amazing love story for all to read. Hope you enjoy And i, Deanna, and Boston as much as I did.
4	1375142400	Easy and fast reading. Good story line with interesting characters. I will read more stories about Blackberry Island by Susan Mallery.
5	1375056000	This was an easy read with great characters that will leave wanting more!  It is not a bad thing that this is a story in which one can lose themselves ~ a nice escape from the realities of life.
5	1375056000	Susan Mallery does a nice job at drawing in the reader and making you want to read more. She has a way of making the reader have empathy for the main characters.
5	1374969600	Generally I find myself on the fence about Susan Mallery's books. Some I really like and some are so slow moving with no 'action' or forward moving that it is a chore to finish them.At first I thought this book was going to be of the &#34;chore&#34; variety, but as I came to know the characters I really enjoyed the interactions, the developing of friendship between three dissimilar women and the secondary theme next to the friendships--that of romance and the intricacies of starting, maintaining or rediscovering love and relationships.Andi Gorden was jilted at the alter and makes a life changing decision to buy one of the Three Sisters Queen Anne houses on Blackberry Island. She has the worst of the trio. Long neglected, the house will need a lot of work to get it back to its former glory. Andi, a pediatrician, plans to live upstairs and have her practice downstairs.  Enter Wade King, the brother of Zeke King who lives in the house next door. Wade has a beautiful daughter, but no plans to ever fall in love again. Andi harbors a deep hurt and rejection over her ex-fiance's actions. Will these two wounded souls find their psyches being healed even as the house becomes healed?Deanna Phillips lives on the other side and she suspects her husband Colin is having an affair. She and Colin have five beautiful daughters and Deanna works hard at giving them the perfect childhood. Making sure the house is perfect, her meals are healthy and fabulous, and that the kids never know a minute of neglect, abuse or abandonment like she did in her childhood. Her relentless pursuit of perfection has caused her husband and children to pull away from her and she can't understand why. She has very few friends in town because they also can't stand being around her for long due to that pursuit of perfection.And finally on the other side of Andi lives the hippie or bohemian artist Boston King and her husband Zeke. Boston and Zeke have enjoyed a long loving relationship, but it is now fractured because of the death of their only child who died around six months. Boston has never cried for her baby daughter and Zeke and Boston have grown apart instead of together from the tragedy.These three very different women find their paths crisscrossing numerous times and from misunderstandings and conflict they form a bond and strong friendships.If you are a fan of women's literature that features strong women and strong friendships this book will be sure to please you.
5	1374969600	This was a delightful read, I devowered it over a weekend. I love happy endings, would recommend this author for a fun read
4	1374883200	FIrst Susan Mallory book I have read. Enjoyable, light reading. Will read another of her books as soon as I finish the B&ouml;&ouml;k I,m reading.
5	1374796800	Loved the cast of characters in this read.  Some parts could be a little trying with people drowning in their emotions.  I just kept wanting them to take control and get on with their lives, but all in all it was enjoyable.
3	1374710400	Neighbors who are thrown together by events in each of their lives learn to care for each other.,  Each live holds secrets that they begin to learn to share in order to help each other cope.
4	1374710400	Luckily I like a fluffy predictable romance and this fit the bill.I loved the title, being one of 3 sisters myself. Then I got the book and saw that the `sisters' aren't women - the `sisters' are three historical Queen Anne architecture homes on Blackberry Island, Washington State. *sigh*Deanna and her husband Colin have 5 daughters. She is one `sister' who is so OCD she is splitting the family apart. The 5 daughters is enough to make anyone OC.Boston and her husband Zeke. High school sweethearts, she is one `sister' and an artist. They recently suffered the loss of their baby and it is driving them apart.Into an empty dilapidated house moves Andi. A `sister' whose not only been jilted but her family treats like a college dropout because she is a pediatrician and not a specialist like a surgeon (family like that can spend the holidays without me). Possible Spoiler: My money is on the hunky contractor making it all better for her and the house.I took off one star for using the phrase `girl parts' - lol -who talks like that?
5	1374710400	What  a wonderfully written book.  I could not put it down.  The author really brought the characters to life.  I cannot wait to read another book from Susan Mallery
5	1374710400	enjoyed the story and enjoy her other books, keep them coming. Enjoy nw writers and we have some great ones.
5	1374624000	I liked how they got to know each other and how their lives evolved. I liked the entire story. No complaints. I would recommend the book to anyone, it was that good.
4	1374537600	Susan Mallery writes a book about 3 houses, on Blackberry Island, Washington State. In these 3 houses are 3 ladies, 2 are deeply troubled souls, one an obsessive compulsive driving her family away, another - an artist who has recently lost her baby boy and that is driving her and her husband apart. In the middle a dilapidated house which we are never told how it came to be so forgotten and run down. After all it has a fantastic view of the water. It seems strange that this part of the story goes missing. Into this house moves a woman, left at the altar and looked down upon by her over achieving family that she would become a mere pediatrician rather than a serious specialist.We know what will happen in these stories; love will be lost and then found. As soon as the remodeling contractor is described as a `hunk' who every woman would want, the reader knows where this storyline is headed. In some ways it all is a bit too saccharine for words and the friendships seem to come too quickly as well as the solutions for everything. Yet this is still what we can classify as a nice beach read or one to lay back in the hammock and turn the pages into another romance.
4	1374537600	The story of these three women is poignant and real. Although it seemed to take a while for the story to really get moving, once it did it was fantastic. The slow beginning was mainly due to the author trying to really get us in the heads of these characters, especially Deanna. She definitely accomplished this. Rather than hating the character, which would have been easy, due to her expert storytelling you pull for her as she fights her demons. Certainly a book I would recommend.
2	1374451200	After finishing Three Sisters, I'm still trying to remember why I ever wanted to read it to begin with. I usually don't waste time on predictable bodice-ripping romances but that is definitely how I would describe this one. It started out with great promise.  Andi is a beautiful accomplished pediatrician starting over after the humiliation of being left at the altar. She has a new home to remodel, a medical practice to establish, a community to explore. She's literally starting a new life for herself and the sky's the limit as to where this story could have gone!What happens is that the smart, funny, attractive doctor meets her building contractor with (surprise!) a great butt and is reduced instead to a stereotypical breathless female with the heaving bosom and quivering "girl parts" (a term so painful I hope never to hear it again). The cover on this book is deceiving as a more accurate illustration would have been the two of them in a sweaty embrace amidst the sawdust and roughed-in drywall. Then there are her two sappy neighbors: Deanna, an interesting but deeply flawed housewife, and Boston, a rather drippy artist whose persona and name I found highly annoying.  The three of them spend the rest of the story like giggling girls, getting tipsy and agonizing over how to please the men who intentionally ignore them. Naturally they end up with all their problems solved and bodices ripped because this is, after all, chick lit at its most basic level.
5	1374364800	In fact, I read the bulk of this 340 page book in our canoe as my husband fished.  As I get older, though I'm only 39, I find myself appreciating the simple love stories.  I enjoy a good thriller now and then, and I love my treasure hunting novels, but I'm finding that more and more when I'm in the mood for romance I don't need some sweeping tragedy to sustain my interest.  Susan Mallery has it down pat.  No, wild plotlines.  No assassin waiting in the bathroom closet, instead she writes simple love stories that anyone that has ever been in a relationship can relate too.This latest book takes us to Blackberry Island and introduces us to the "Three Sisters."  Not three actual sisters, but three beautiful Queen Anne houses. Here we meet:-Boston and her husband Zeke.  HIgh school sweethearts they are dealing with a tragedy that could tear any couple apart.-Deanna, her husband Colin and there 5 precocious girls.  Deanna's past is threatening to tear them apart, and she doesn't even realize it.-And Andi.  Jilted at the author she makes the snap decision to buy the house in the middle-the lonely house that needs love.  Can she let her herself love again?Each couple is dealing with serious issues, but Mallery weaves in enough lighthearted moments that I actually found myself laughing out loud occasionally.  Each of the three women is easy to relate to and I found myself enjoying the women's blossoming friendship as much as I enjoyed the romance.Any book I enjoy, I become invested in.  I enjoy the characters and am excited to see how things work out for them, and I appreciated the details Mallery weaves in the story.  I enjoyed each laugh I laughed and each tear I shed as I related to the three women and their lives on Blackberry Island.
5	1374364800	I enjoyed the way the author tells the story and the development of the characters. It's an easy read and a book that you cannot put down
4	1374105600	I have read most of Susan Mallery's books and this one is just like the others.  The story is good, the emotions are well written and it really shows the truth behind female relationships.  If you like her other books, you will like this one!
5	1374019200	I could not put this book down! It was a perfect girly beach read. You really begin to relate to each character in some way, and don't want the book to end. Definitely recommend!
4	1373932800	This was another new author for me, and I enjoyed the storyline. I would read more of her books. Amen.
4	1373932800	A girl jilted at the altar, it's always fun reading books that start this way.  Andi gets dumped at the altar after years of being with her fianc&eacute; and her way to cope was move away, buy a house, and start a pediatric practice in a new place.  She buys one of three coordinating houses in a neighborhood and her house is a complete fixer upper.  The story is about her finding piece and becoming friends with the two women in the other homes.  I enjoyed the three storylines, especially Deanna's, the perfect mother/wife.
5	1373932800	I wasn't sure, at first, how much I was going to like this book.  But it really did get going and get more interesting as it went on.  It's a unique story with good characters that change as they grow, so it's never boring.  I really enjoyed it and all of her Blackberry Island books.
4	1373846400	I have read many Susan Mallery books and find they are a great light read. Love affairs are a bit predicable but fun to follow.
4	1373846400	This is a well written book with interesting and well defined characters.  I found the characters and their lives very believable and an enjoyable read.
5	1373760000	3 soon to be friends work out their future together. It was a wonderful story and I am anxious to read more books by Susan...
5	1373673600	I guess this book club has made me like contemporary romances. I found the more we discussed the novel, the more I enjoyed reading it and finding things in it. I liked the way it had more characters and more going on than one relationship between just two people.
3	1373587200	If you are looking for a novel with depth and complex characters, this is not for you, otherwise okay summer reading.
5	1373587200	The way the women in this story weave their way into each others life is inspiring.  The hope and grace they give each other is a great story beginning to end.  I will recommend this story to me daughter and best friend that has been like a sister to me.
4	1373500800	I loved the book & the message that comes with reading it! I would highly recommend it to anyone to read.
5	1373414400	An easy read of love,loss and family.  This book will have you take a look at people you have passed judgement on.
4	1373414400	Enjoyabe light read. Can't find any fault with this book or the writting.  Don't pass this one up. Two more words
4	1373414400	For me, it is hard to review this book, in a sense. Part of me would say it was just so-so. It has three characters with some pretty heavy emotional problems to overcome, and yet you are guessing that the ending will tie them all up in a neat little bow with a happy ending. Spoiler alert -  -  -  -  - that is exactly what happens. So, in a really good literary sense, it's not spectacular in any way. It seems as though at least one of the characters could have not had their problem solved by the ending of this book. Maybe even continue it on to a sequal or something. But whatever.On the other hand, I did find myself flipping through the pages, wanting to find out what was going to happen next. I do like easy, light, "fluffy" chic lit. Life can be stressful enough and there are so few happy endings in the world (and in the news), so I enjoy fiction that gives me that happy ending. If you like that kind of novel too, then you probably would like this book.It deals with some intense issues, but wraps them all up in a very fictional, happy, almost easy way.This was not one of my favorite "happy-ending chic lit" books, but it was worth a read.
5	1373328000	Blackberry Island series is going to be great.  Can't wait for the rest of the series.  Mallery books are always a great read.
4	1373155200	I have not read a novel like this in a long time. Good clean entertaining romance was good for me
5	1373155200	I just thought the story was great and so were the characters.  The Island sounded beautiful. Wish I could have seen the house when it was finished.
4	1373155200	Excellent read. A little slow at first but once the storyline picked up, it was really great. Would strongly suggest
4	1372982400	Loved this book kept my interest all the way  if you like romance and happy endings enjoy three sisters great read
5	1372723200	I'd purchased this book but didn't start it for several months.  Once I started it, it was hard to put it down.  There were several instances where I laughed out loud, I put the book down and just laughed.  That is a good indication that it's a good read.
3	1372723200	This is the second book by Susan Mallery that I have read, and I found it a struggle to finish. It just didn't keep my interest over the long haul, and I felt in many ways as though I had read it before: so many books in the last five or so years (or maybe even longer) start with a woman being jilted, or divorced, or widowed, or suffered a tragedy of another sort, and somehow being able to come up with a pile of money to instantly start a new life in a totally different part of the country. The story is told from the point of view of three women, all under the age of 45, who live on Blackberry Island, near Seattle, and two of the three seemingly have perfect lives, until you start digging below the surface.Andi is a doctor who apparently has never had a practice of her own, but is able to buy a rundown Queen Anne house on the island where she can open her practice. She is the jilted one, who also is slightly estranged from her over-achieving Boomer parents. Boston is the artistic one who has suffered a true tragedy (it is not giving away anything to say that she and her husband lost their only child the year before the book opens, as that is made clear from the beginning)and who is having difficulties moving forward. Deanna is the unlikeable one, who, as the result of being raised by an alcoholic mother, has an OCD that makes her wash her hands endlessly and control her family so rigidly that she has driven a wedge between herself and her husband and children. I am sorry to say that while the book is fairly well written, the ending is very predictable.Ms Mallery's first book in the Blackberry Island series, "Barefoot Season," was in my opinion a much better book, dealing with post-tramatic stress suffered by a female veteran. "Three Sisters" is a stand alone book and can be read without having read "Barefoot Season."
5	1372636800	loved the diversity of the characters and how their stories were interwoven - really enjoyed the description of the period houses and the location - ready to pack my bags and move to Blackberry Island (Oh if only!).  My first read by Susan Mallery, but certainly not the last - will be looking at more of her books.  If you want to entertained with real life, love and happy endings this is definitely a go-to book - made me feel good to be able to escape the &#34;real world&#34; - I felt lighter and happier after reading this book and am looking forward to my next book from Susan Mallery on Blackberry Island.
4	1372550400	A nice read for vacation...nothing too deep or challenging but enough to keep you interested plus it finishes with a nice bow at the end.
3	1372291200	I enjoyed the story line of the book, but thought the writer's style was somewhat juvenile. Makes a good &#34;beach read.&#34;
5	1372204800	Great book.  A very interesting book, that was difficult to put down.  It would be a good beach read in the summer.
5	1372204800	Loved this book! Could not put it down.  The characters in the story think each have a picture perfect life, but find while making friendships that there lives are not so perfect. They all have things they are dealing with and through there friendship get each other through the hard times. A wonder story. I would recommend this book.
5	1372204800	A wonderful story about 3 women who come together and become friends through their circumstances. Very heartwarming and emotionally engaging
4	1372118400	This book is about three neighbors.  Two who have never bothered to get to know each other and really don't like each other and the one new neighbor who moves in between them and brings them all together.  It's about three women all who have been touched by some huge life changing event and are coping with moving on and healing.  It's about three women who on the surface don't really have anything in common, but once the layers are explored seem to have more in common than they thought but most importantly they understand each other.I admit that while I love Susan Mallery I put off reading this book due to the subject matter.  It just sounded depressing to me.  About 20 pages in, I knew the lives of the three women were indeed in turmoil... but it wasn't written in a `make you cry', `doom and gloom kind of way'.  Don't get me wrong, I shed a few tears, but I wasn't left feeling depressed or needing a drink afterword.Some of the content is really emotional and a lot of made me think about my own life and relationships and how we treat those in our lives.  It was really rather eye opening in a couple of areas.  I really enjoyed this book and how it was written.  I am glad I finally opened the pages and sorry that it took me so long.  It was well worth the read and wonderfully written.  Once I opened it, I couldn't put it down.This book is the second in a series, but can really be read as a stand alone.Cherise Everhard, June 2013
3	1372032000	It was just ok for me. It wasn't something that was hard to put down but it was terrible either. I would say read something else that's better instead.
5	1372032000	I was looking for a new easy summer read and stumbled across this one. I was immediately drawn to the characters and their stories. The romance was good, but the heart of the story is in the relationship between the women. I will definitely read more from this author.
3	1371945600	It is ok for a summer read. Predictable but enjoyable for a light summer read.  I would recommend to some of my friends who are look for an easy read.
2	1371945600	Just a waste of time unless you are sunburned and have fried most of your neurons.  Could have been intriguing, but simplistic and pat.
5	1371859200	I really enjoyed how it all came together. Friendship to sisters.  It went full circle. How one heals and becomes a better person. We enjoy reading.
5	1371772800	This is my first read from Susan Mallery and I was very impressed. I am not a big reader but once I find a good book I cannot put it down.I found this book to have the best of both worlds and I could deff relate to each character in its own diff way. I think the book was well written and I was able to put myself as if I was watching a movie and seeing everything unfold. I would love to find more books like this.
5	1371772800	I've been a fan of Susan for years now after reading several of her Buchanan family books. I've continued to read her old Silhouette Special Editions and her wonderful Fool's Gold books over the years because her romances are like Mac n' Cheese to me. I know when I open one I'm going to meet a friend. I'm going to laugh a little. I'm going to cry a little. And I'm going to close the book at the end feeling warm and fuzzy and probably smiling like a loon.With Three Sisters I got all of that and more.What shined most for me had to be the 3 women. Andi, Deanna and Boston are as real to me as my best friend. Hands down these women are some of the best characters Susan has ever created. She has an uncanny ability to write that one character who is a total witch no one (including yourself) can stand through a good portion of the book and turn them around in a way we readers cheer them on by the end. Oh yes, she certainly did that here. Totally made me want to drive my happy butt to Blackberry Island and give Deanna a hug!I'm really looking forward to reading more in the Blackberry Island series and I hope Susan continues on with them for a long time.
5	1371686400	Wow this book really caught me by surprise. I started reading this book because I had nothing better to read at the time. It ended up being fantastic! The author takes three woman from 3 different worlds and incorporates them. This book is truly inspiring.
5	1371686400	Another great story from Susan.  Recommend her books to anyone that loves to read.  Wonderful story line and again if you like to read the imagination is great but the every day life ones can be a great read and eye opening experience.
5	1371686400	What an awesome outcome for 3 different storylines.  I found this book creative by bringing the characters together and not forcing them together.  I became engulfed in this book from the beginning.  The different style of the each place the stories in each place made the book unpredictable.  The sorrow carried around the the joy of unexpected people coming together.  Great story.
4	1371600000	The whole three sisters theme is a dual term, referring to the three houses as well as the three women who own them.  The characters are believable, even if they aren't always all that likeable--real people aren't always totally likeable either.  The scenario is believable too--the story starts with one character being jilted at the altar (isn't that every bride's worst fear...to be standing there all dressed in white...only to have the groom never arrive?) and then buying a house to leave the scene of the crime behind by relocating both where she lives as well as where she works.All three women have issues, just like real women.  They don't always handle them perfectly, but hey, who does?  The characters seem very real--they aren't perfect, they have flaws, male & female alike.  I like the theme of the women being strong despite their issues, and bonding together as they become friends and work through the problems.Overall, it's great chick lit and perfect for summer reading.  It even takes place in the summer.
3	1371600000	This is a story of 3 neighbors who own Victorian masterpieces side by side ON Blackberry Island and become friends despite their differences.Susan Mallery develops likable but flawed characters that we wish would become our neighbors (and friends)who are at different crossroads in their lives.  Each of her characters need to address and conquer different issues. Her writing flows with descriptions that the reader can see, including some spicy love scenes.  My issues with the story is that it is very predictable, but still a fun, relaxing read.
4	1371427200	make it your summer lay on the beach and read book.  entertainment.  Not the great American novel, but a nice read for some relaxation.
5	1371427200	I read this book and really enjoyed how the characters melded together. Another great book from Susan Mallery and cannot wait for the next one!
5	1371427200	I absolutely loved the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, their personality development and the writer's style of writing. Very entertaining.
5	1371427200	I really enjoyed this book, kept me wanting more and more.....please keep them coming, I am going to read more of your books.
5	1371427200	Loved this book.  Loved getting to know the neighbors and how people can change Once you get to know them.
5	1371340800	It was enjoyable to read and I couldn't put it down. I would like to read another book by this author.
5	1371340800	A wonderful story of three women neighbors who develop a very unlikely friendship.  Three women who live together on a street meet up at a time when each is going through a very personal crisis and the bonds they form to help each other through is a pleasure to read.  What made this book so great was how completely different the women were.  It really worked.  I would have liked the author to capture a little bit more of the setting of Blackberry Island but maybe she did that in the first book in the series (which I have not read).The highest compliment to pay an author is to immediately go out and buy more of her books, which is exactly what I did after reading this story.
5	1371340800	Another great book by Susan Mallery. Wonderful story. Great story of the power of friendships and relationships. Always love her books.
2	1371254400	I read it to the end, which says a lot for a book like this--simple and unsophisticated, with characters who live happily ever after.  It's a relatively quick read, and it's a nice, feel-good way to waste time, if you have time to waste.  I wouldn't buy another book by this author.
4	1371168000	I would give this book a 4 1/2. It has romance but more than that it was a story about 3 women and how they become a support system for each other. It also shows how things aren't always as they seem. It's a slice of real life.
5	1371081600	Enjoyed reading this.  I like this part of the country (n the summer)  easy to relate with the characters .  She writes a good story, and will look forward to reading more of her writing.
4	1371081600	This was a good summer read, I could some how in my mind see Andi's house coming together. It was three very different woman becoming friends which normally would not happen. They had each others back as you would say through a lot.
4	1371081600	I particularly liked the backstory of a remodeling and mural painting. It made the storyline more interesting to me.  I would read more books by this author.
4	1370908800	This book deals with real life situations we all face. Everybody wants a hot life like in most romance stories but in reality these characters were definitely closer in being able to relate to their stories than just about any other book I've read lately.
5	1370908800	This story was the right mixture of issues and storms women can face and how once they stop judging each could be supportive of one another.  The focus on the similarites of the three houses being fundamental the same stucture but individual different was not lost in the description of the three female characters of this novel.  The story was sexy but not to the point it was the overpowering theme.  How the characters addressed their individual fears and loses while help each other was the strength of the novel.
5	1370822400	Nice, easy read.  Kept me interested. I couldn't put it down.  Great summer read! Love the Blackberry Island series. A must read.
4	1370822400	good read - liked it and found it a fairly quick read and like it a lot, recommend it for a beach read.
4	1370822400	nice and enjoyable summer reading. I liked the twists and turns the book took. the characters were very interesting with their secrets.
4	1370736000	I enjoyed this book.  It was a good read that explored how friendship is an essential element to happiness and contentment.
4	1370736000	I would have loved this book if the characters from the first book had been tied in more. Both books have carried a drinking character where the issue was easily dismissed as not a problem.
4	1370736000	Predictalbe.  The story line was not that believable.  But it kept me in the world of reading and my great place of excape.
5	1370649600	This author draws you into the characters lives and transport you as if you were there, totally enjoyable and would strongly recommend.
5	1370649600	This is a strong woman's book that mixes romance with family issues though the "family" is tied by circumstance rather than blood.  We have several perspectives here, not only those of the three women of the title (Actually, the title initially refers to three adjacent cottages and then to the three occupants) but also of a few secondery characters.  Definitely an intelligently told woman's story.
4	1370563200	Characters were flawed, human, quirky, and very like able. Setting was charming and made you want to pack your bag and head for Blackberry Island.  My first book of Susan Mallery's but will read more.
4	1370563200	Very good. Lots of romance, problems, problem solving and the forming of wonderful  relationships.  I would highly recommend this book. It's easy reading but interesting enough to want to keep on turning the pages.
3	1370476800	Easy enjoyable read;  predictable girly sass and easy to love characters.  THREE SISTERS is perfect for a for a vacation or weekend read .
4	1370390400	Great continuation of another character's life on Blackberry Island. These women are independent and this follows their development of friendships with each other.
5	1370390400	I really enjoyed reading the Blackberry Island series. The name of this book The Three sisters is not what you think, but I enjoyed reading it.
4	1370390400	Nice easy read about friendship between three women seeming with nothing in common at the beginning. I have already downloaded others by this author.
5	1370304000	Interesting to see how the story unfold. Readers will identify with one or all of these 3 women.  Read it !
5	1370304000	Who doesn't like a good book about 3 people who come in contact with each other and end up helping each other in this road of life.  I enjoyed it very much and would read more by this author.
5	1370304000	Loved it !  I simply couldn't put it down !  Excellent book !  I would recommend " Three Sisters "  to anyone that loves girlie books. It is a wonderful read!  I may have found a new author to enjoy!
5	1370217600	Good story line,  am about to read another one of Mallery's.  If you love reads in small towns you will love this one.  And by the water too.  AAA++++
5	1370217600	First book by this author that I've read and am very much impressed.  I literally couldn't put it down.  Would highly recommend.
3	1370217600	Three Sisters was entertaining. I did not care for the character Andi, who is pretty much the main character. She mentions being dumped at the altar about 3 times a day. And she says &#34;girlie parts&#34; way too many times. It reminded me of the poorly written Fifty Shades. I just have such a hard time with whiny, needy females. Every time the three women got together, Andi had to make it about her. One of those women who like drama. Yuck. However, the other two women, Deanna and Boston were inspiring. They pulled me in and I felt their emotions. I felt empathy for each of them as they made self discoveries. I cheered for them to overcome their struggles.
2	1370217600	There is no intrigue to this book, it turns out exactly as one would predict.  Shouldn't have wasted time reading it.
5	1370217600	this was a wonderful book about three very different women who formed a common bond.  A very hard book to put down.
5	1370131200	The Three Sisters story by Susan Mallery was a very enjoyable read. I would recommend it to all of my friends.
5	1370131200	Great to read a story that makes you feel good.  Holds your interest at all times.  Usually I read mysteries and this was a nice change.
3	1370044800	This book was just okay.  Nothing out of the ordinary, seemed so similar to other love story books and I personally get tired of the same old lines.  Very predictible, but an okay story.  I would probably read more from this author.
5	1370044800	I really enjoyed reading this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I really liked all the women....Deanna, Boston and Andi.  I enjoyed reading about their journey and the men in their lives.  It made me want to live there on Blackberry Island and see it for myself.  I'd definitely recommend this book for an afternoon of easy reading.
2	1370044800	Rather a boring book.  I really disliked the American jargon but maybe that's because I am British and don't relate to the differences in language.  Rather a juvenile story and the characters didn't gel with me.  A pity as the series looked interesting and I thought had potential.  As one reviewer said &#34;why keep mentioning the the fact that the poor girl had been left at the altar&#34;.  I am not giving away the story as it is revealed in the first sentence.  I'm afraid I won't be reading any more of Susn Mallory.  She obviously appeals to a certain audience so realise this review is being written by a 70 year old!  I would suggest reading the sample before buying.
3	1370044800	I can't remember the story. I read the book but I would rate it higher if I could still remember it.
3	1370044800	That's it. Nice and sweet.  This is not compelling in any way.  Very predictable.  You can find a better story.
5	1369958400	LOVED this book! heart warming, funny and realistic. Started reading and couldn't put it down. It was a great read and not as "silly" as some other romantic fictions.
4	1369958400	I really enjoyed this book--great for the bedside table.  No explosions, no murders, you don't have to be a computer expert to know what they are talking about--just mostly nice people navigating the bumps in the road and trying to make a decent life for themselves and those they care about.
2	1369872000	This was a very boring read! The author keeps repeating the same things over and over again -- I don't know how many times I read about Andi being dumped at the altar, about Boston being unable to cry over her baby's death, and about Deanne's OCD and family problems. The story is just too predictable, characters are flat. Not worth it.
4	1369872000	This is one of the better easier reads.  I really enjoyed the book.  I would refer to a friend if looking for a 1st book to read.
5	1369872000	couldnt put it down....want more of her books. This is an easy read and a great story. this is highly recommended.
5	1369872000	I enjoyed the story, fast read, interesting . Did not get boring and was not long and drawn out. Always enjoy  Susan Mallery books.
4	1369785600	Easy read novel about friendship and neighbors, working through emotional baggage and interesting historic houses on a fictional island near Seattle.
4	1369785600	Very entertaining and had me buying the second one, just as good. Keep writing more  Blackberry Island books Susan, I'm enjoying them!
3	1369785600	Although this book was an easy read it didn't hold my interest for long. Must say I was quite disappointed.
5	1369785600	I really enjoyed reading &#34;Three Sisters&#34;.  It kept my interest from the very first page.  I thought the three different personalities were different yet they were able to get along for the most part.  I would be interested in reading other books by Susan Mallery.C Bilberry
4	1369785600	Another good story by Susan Mallery.  Second in the Blackberry Island series but reading the first is not necessary to follow this story.
4	1369699200	Predictable but a good read!  Good beach book.  I'll be looking for more of Susan Mallery books.  Reminds me of Nora Roberts which I enjoy very much too!
4	1369699200	From beginning to end I felt like a sister to these ladies.  I loved it!  I want  more;  maybe Carrie"s story....
4	1369699200	This book was very charming. These could be issues in anyones lives. Susan Mallory shows you how any problem can be solved if you don't give up.
5	1369612800	Enjoyed this book very much. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I am looking forward to reading more books by Susan Mallery.
4	1369526400	Enjoyed book. A nice beach read for the summer. Probably works best for younger women. Nice characters and the way they learn about each other.
4	1369526400	This was a simple story that kept me wondering how it would turn out. The characters were well developed and I felt particularly interested in the mother of the 5 children who was struggling to be a better mother. I could relate to her challenges and it was intriguing to see how her relationships changed as she worked things out. I did not enjoy the x-rated scenes in the book that really detracted from the beauty of the book and I found them dis-tasteful. Beside that, I enjoyed this read.
4	1369526400	you think people, but then you find out something different. The complications and people interaction was very well displayed. I enjoyed it very much.
2	1369526400	Somewhat sappy read with not much depth within it's content.  Not much to learn in reading this book, which is why reading is a hobby of mine.
1	1369440000	I do not books with graphic sex scenes.  A little imagination goes a long way.  I have stopped ordering books called &#34;romantic&#34; as it seems to be a code word for porn.
4	1369440000	Took me awhile.  Enjoyed the plot but was not on the edge of my chair.  Liked the happy predictable ending.
4	1369440000	Well-written story about three strong women who face difficult life situations.  After hesitating to rely on each other for help, they realize that strength comes from supporting each other and things are not as they appear on the surface.
4	1369440000	Very compelling book with an interesting plot. Good study of different people and personalities and how the characters mesh together and ultimately help each other.
4	1369440000	I enjoyed the the storyline.  I had expected the story to be about 3 sisters but was pleasantly surprised that it involved sisterhouses instead and the relationships that were within each home
5	1369353600	I like the diverse characters...their problems and how they solved them.  Interesting.  Good, fast read.  This would be a great read for summer.
5	1369267200	I would recommend this bundle.  I have enjoyed all of Susan Mallery's books.  The first one was a little hard to get into, but once it grabbed me, couldn't let go.
4	1369267200	Very lite read it was enjoyable. Characters likeable and nice island novel. I liked it and have passed it on.
5	1369267200	I could relate to these women in the story and ended up envying them.  They were each so different and yet each one needed the other....wish I could find a friendship even remotely as wonderful.  Hard to do these days in the society of ME.
4	1369180800	Very enjoyable topic and an easy read.  I liked the bonding of the females..  I will purchase more of Susan Mallery books.
5	1369180800	I loved this book!  I loved the idea of a small town/island living and the closeness of good friends, along with relationships working out.  There wasn't anything that I didn't like about this book. Great writing!
4	1369180800	I didn't know what to expect from this book so I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The characters were relatable and they all felt like someone I knew by the end of the book. Although the ending was somewhat predictable, the women's journey along the way was captivating. I had a hard time putting the book down!
5	1369180800	I love to read about oceans, beaches, and I love houses with a history. This was a nice comfortable book, with an old house that needed fixing and two neighbors to get to know and understand. I really enjoyed.
4	1369180800	"Three Sisters" is a very enjoyable book to read.  It deals with three women who are at stopping points in their lives.  Each of them has to come to terms with dramatic events which have happened to them both recently and long term.  The Three Sisters referred to in the title is the name of the three houses these women live in.  By the end of the book, it comes to means something different.  The loss of a child was especially difficult for me to read as I have had that experience myself.  The author handled it beautiful sensitivity and I found myself crying for Boston when she could not do so herself.  The book has a lot of funny moments that were fun to read as well as the dramatic events that unfold for the reader.I enjoyed the book, would certainly recommend it to others and will also look for more books by Ms. Mallery in the future.
5	1368921600	Susan Mallory knows how to keep you intrigued. Can't put the book down for long. Great story lines every time.
3	1368921600	The book was rather simple and predictable for my taste.  Expectable happy ending.  Took me a long time to get through.I did like the background characterization details of Deanna and Boston.  That was spot on.
5	1368921600	Light  and great for the summer.  Can easily pick up and put down without having to re-read to figure out what just happen.  Especially good if you have a lot going on in life and just want want to escape for a while!
4	1368921600	Good beach read. Predictable ending, but the story line was engaging and thought provoking. I particularly liked the way the author dealt with not only the romances of the three women, but the darker side of the tragedy and heartache each woman faced, and their honest, sometimes difficult ways of dealing with it. Just goes to show, even the seemingly happiest people who have everything still deal with sorrow and loss like the rest of us.I would recommend this book.
4	1368921600	I enjoyed the story line and the cast of characters.  I look forward to follow up books with some of the same characters.
4	1368921600	Great book! Did not want to put it down. If you are looking for book to read on vacation or a trip this is it!
3	1368921600	IT WAS OKAY.....FINISHED IT BECAUSE I ALWAYS FINISH MY BOOKS EVEN IF I CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT OVER WITH.....KEPT WAITING FOR THAT &#34;PEAK&#34;, THAT CLIMAX.....NEVER CAME...
4	1368835200	This is a great read for a beach or vacation moment.  Easy to get into and keeps you turning the pages.  Definitely a mindless fling kind of book!  Fun and enjoyable...
5	1368835200	I absolutely loved this book.  I never knew which direction the lives of the characters were going to go.  I was a bit disappointed in the end, only that it came way too quickly and was a bit abrupt.  It was like the author HAD to finish it quickly so jumped what could have been a few more chapters.
3	1368835200	It is a romance only story.  For this I enjoyed it.  The setting was interesting as were the people.  I think she tried to put too much story into short form.  I would have liked much more about the characters.  Each women was a story in it self.
4	1368835200	A true chick book, but enjoyed it very much. It also showed the male perspective of marrying a woman with more education and how that conflict can hurt a relationship.
3	1368835200	Although I liked the concept of the three historic houses and the very different female occupants I thought it very quickly became just another romance novel with predictable characters. I wish there was more plot and less steamy scenes!
5	1368748800	I enjoyed this story of three different women who became friends and solving their issues in life. Enjoy this book.
5	1368748800	Three strangers become like sisters - helping each out with death, depression and love.  Andi Gordon is jilted at the altar and decides to move to Blackberry Island and starts falling for her contractor. Next door Boston King and her husband have been dealing with death -- which is heartbreaking. Deanna Phillips thinks her husband is having a affair but in reality she has to confront her mental health issues. The friendships that grow on this little street in Blackberry Island changes the 3 women for a life time.  LOVED it and could not put it down -- was up late finishing.If you enjoy this genre I would also suggest;Barefoot Season (Blackberry Island Novels),Love Irresistibly (FBI/U.S. Attorney)andAll He Ever Needed (Hqn).
5	1368748800	I love this book. I loved the story and how the characters were developed....easy and sophisticated read. I started reading it the first night I downloaded it and was up to 4am because I couldnt turn my kindle off!
4	1368748800	When I first saw this title available on NetGalley I hesitated before requesting it. Although I've read many books by Susan Mallery and have enjoyed most of them, I read Barefoot Season last year and was slightly disappointed because it was classified as a Romance, when it clearly wasn't. However, this time I took the time to read the blurp carefully and decided to give it a try.I am so glad that I did! I loved how Susan Mallery provided three different romantic stories within the book and brought it all together, not only to recount the romance but also to highlight the deep bond of friendship developed between Deanna, Andi and Boston. Although this is not a 'traditional' romance story it does provide the reader three different types of romances, where two center around an already married couple and another recounted the struggles of starting anew and learning to trust in new beginnings.As usual, Susan Mallery's writing was excellent. With great character development, relatable and real life characters that were easy to connect to and stories with struggles that tug at your heart stings, Three Sisters is a very enjoyable read about three completely different women finding each other and struggling to get their life in order. Not usually a fan of Chick-Lit or Women's Fiction, this was a surprising good read that I won't soon forget.Although Three Sisters is the second book in the Blackberry Island series it can be read as a stand alone. It does take place in the Blackberry Island universe, but the characters are new.I received this title from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange of my honest opinion.
3	1368748800	This book makes you stop and realize just how important friends are in your life. It wasn't a real page turner type of book but a nice read anyway.
2	1368748800	I was in love with barefoot season, so I thought I would like this book. Wow was I wrong. I really wanted to see some interaction with the people from blackberry island. The only character I liked was andi and the contractor.I felt that she gave me no reason to care about the other characters at all. I wish she had written about some of the charcters from her first book like the nerdy guy who never got loved. It will be a long time before I read another book by ms. mallery.
5	1368662400	I thought the book was great and an easy read. IT. COVERED so many issues.  They were all happy at the end.
4	1368662400	Three Sisters is a well written entertaining book, but right from thebeginning you know how it will surely end.
3	1368662400	This is a mildly entertaining book that is not well written.  Grammatically it is terrible, but the story line is nice, but predictable.
5	1368662400	Three true-to-life characters find healing and the sistership of all women facing life and its problems. Hard to turn off the light and stop reading at bedtime.
4	1368662400	Very good book easy to read just enough action to keep me interested. First book I've read by this author but will read more.
5	1368576000	This was a great book, I couldn't put it down, I have read allot of books and this was an awesome read!! It keeps your attention.  I would read this book again because I really thought it was well written.
5	1368576000	This is a great and easy read anytime.  Yeah, it's probably a girlie girl story, but I loved it because it's a light and breezy novel.
4	1368576000	I am halfway through and I love the storyline's characters and how they all have problems with men, love and pain in their lives
4	1368576000	An enjoyable &#34;beach&#34; read.  Really bonded with the characters and rooted for them.  Predictable but pleasant ending... what I hoped would occur.
5	1368576000	I really enjoyed this book!! It's very well written. Susan goes into depth with the characters and you really start to feel for them. It doesn't just end like how some books do! You feel satistifed with the outcome of this story! I definitely recommend this book!
5	1368489600	there and new these women so well.  There were parts of each one I felt I could relate to.  Will probably read this one again some day.
4	1368489600	It was easy. I won't continue to fill out your requests if you continue to force me how much I have to write.
5	1368489600	I really enjoyed this book! It had three story lines going on and how they all connected and blended together worked. They each had their own issues and yet found the common ground to prove we all need help in life! It showed the gift of female friends and how important those friendships are in our lives. Enjoy!
4	1368489600	I liked this book.  I liked the characters and the variety of personalities.  The story was sweet.  I would recommend this book for a vacation read.
4	1368403200	I really liked the characters in this story, but was disappointed in the predictable happy endings to each of the heroine's story lines. I was hoping at least one would not go the route of all romance novels. That said, I liked Susan Mallery's writing enough toread samples of her other novels, and was especially intrigued by the ones set on the same Pacific coast island.
2	1368403200	I enjoyed this book.  Recommend it to anyone wanting enjoyable easy read.Feel good at the end.quick and easy read,
4	1368403200	This was a light read that kept my attention and caused the shedding of a few tears along the way.
4	1368403200	I'd never read Susan Mallery before, and now I'll probably look for some of her other books. The situations in this book were very realistic and not too sugary.
4	1368403200	It was an enjoyable read ....real life type stories, I laughed and cried, would recommend the book to friends and family.
5	1368403200	I couldn't put the book down.  It is a must to read. It is a good book to read on a cold winter night.
5	1368403200	Would have others read and look additional work by the author as well. Thought it brought up some excellent points about friendship.
3	1368316800	This novel was an easy read.It would be a relaxing book to bring to a lake cabin while on vacation. Very low key.
4	1368316800	Overall, I found the book very pleasant and easy to read, a nice exploration of women's friendships and how quick pre-judgments often prove to be wrong. Some parts were a bit trite and I think there could be less detail regarding the sex scenes, but overall it held my attention. Ideal vacation book!
4	1368316800	The overall storyline was good.  Although somewhat predictable it kept my interest.  I would recommend to anyone looking for summer reading.
4	1368316800	I enjoyed this book.  The three historical homes and their stories. A nice enjoyable read.  A fun easy read for a vacationOr small escape into relaxation.
5	1368316800	I've read all of Susan Mallery's books and this one is her best by far. This rises to a higher level than a romance novel. The depth of the characters and the type of issues addressed makes this a much richer and deeper book. I really enjoy reading Elin Hilderbrand and Kristen Hannah and I felt like I was reading one of their novels.
5	1368230400	Great read. Made me 're-examine myself and understand some friends. Really liked the setting and the houses. Oh and the three sisters.
5	1368230400	Wonderful story and easy read you will enjoy!This is one of those books that you can't wait to get back to...
4	1368230400	first impressions formulated early relationships but times of need changed these women as their lives took a new direction. Whilst they struggled with personal issues they were strengthened by close friendship
3	1368144000	a bit predictable in terms of the story but still it was an enjoyable read. Good holiday book to read.
5	1368144000	i was drawn to this book because of Susan Mallery and I also have three sisters.  It was very well written and Susan Mallery has become one of my favorite authors.
4	1368144000	A fun read, and has  enough changes happening  to keep a person engrossed and want to keep reading  right to the end!
4	1368144000	The author captured the Islands atmosphere completely. The charactors were real and sympathetic.I enjoyed the book and found it fun
5	1368144000	I really enjoyed the first one in this series and the second one did not disappoint. Barefootseason was the first book and it was wonderful too.
5	1368144000	A pleasurable light read, this author kept my attention from the first page.I would recommend this book for all those romantics that enjoy a happy ending.
4	1368144000	Generally not the kind of book that I read but I loved it.  Light and enjoyable and for once, I really liked the characters -- I could identify with all of the women in some way.  Would highly recommend for a holiday read.
4	1368144000	I enjoyed this book a lot.  Out of all the books I was reading I came back to this one and finished in no time at all.  I usually have several books at a time I'm reading and this one kept my attention.  The characters were real and I loved the renovation of the house take shape.
5	1368144000	I loved this romantic novel with a bit of mystery.It was a good night time reading romance with island comfort.
3	1368144000	I enjoyed this book as I could relate to its content. It had some twists in the plot but I could still predict the typical ending
4	1368144000	Good book....very predictable....but a good read. Susan Mallery writes in a way that is easy and comfortable to read.  Good summer book on the beach!
5	1368144000	I could not put this book down. I have found a new Author .... Currently reading another one of her books.
5	1368144000	Very Very good, I enjoy anything Susan Mallory writes, this was a good example of one of her finest , I will keep reading her.
5	1368144000	This is the first Susan Mallery I've had the pleasure of reading. I read a lot of thrillers and this was such a nice change.I just loved it. It's about three house's, and the people who live there becoming friends. I recommend.
3	1368144000	Nice pleasant story but kind of same old, same old.  Girl sees handsome man and falls in love and then they have a few problems and then it is resolved.
5	1368057600	I always read books by Susan Mallery and this one did not disappoint.  It was both light and enjoyable reading!
5	1367971200	I loved the way Susan portrayed the three gals in the story! Each one had their own demons to deal with and how the came together to share and support each other reminded me so much of some of my own friendships. This is a great Summer read. One you will want to share with your girlfriends!
5	1367971200	This book makes you want to move to a place like blackberry. It felt very real and the three women became friends and sisters just as the three houses on that hill were. Looking forward to another book by Susan Mallory.
5	1367884800	I loved the story. It flowed from page to page and I couldn't put it down. I may be a prude, but I could have  down with less explicit sex.
5	1367884800	This story just unfolds page after page. There were no dry areas that made me think I'd chosen a bad book. Can't wait to read more by Susan Mallery.
4	1367884800	Women with three completely different personalities (born of hangups, traditions, fears, pain) discover mutual respect.  The very human behaviors are given explanation, and if we recognize that we all react as a result of our past experiences, we can become more empathetic and tolerant of others and ourselves, which is just what the characters do.  Throw in a little intrigue, a little lust, and warm hearts, this is is a nice, if rather implausible, read.  Just what I was looking for!
5	1367798400	What an excellent book.  I couldn't put it down  Good beach read! I'll be looking for more Susan Mallery books.
5	1367712000	This book was such an easy, pleasant read.  Fell in love with the characters and related to some of their issues of family and such.  Continuing on with Susan Mallery and the Blackberry Island.
5	1367712000	I would recommend this book to everyone that loves to read.  I loved this book and would probably read it again
5	1367712000	This is the second book that I have read by this author and I have enjoyed both.  They are somewhat predictable but sometimes that is okay.  I usually read mysteries, but thiswas a nice break.  A story about three women becoming close friends.
5	1367625600	This story was riveting from start to finish.  Each character came with her own set of problems and you end up rooting for each one of them.  How their lives interact was very interesting and very different from what you might think would happen.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in everyday people with everyday problems and how they work things out together~
4	1367625600	I enjoyed the story, it was light reading but engaging as well.  The sexually explicit details details added nothing to the story, and  prevents me from recommending it to my friends.  That is what determined it to be a 4-star rather than five for me.
4	1367625600	Well, it's not about three sisters. Its surprisingly enjoyable.  Not what I would have expected, buy very enjoyable.  The characters were believable and personable
3	1367625600	I enjoyed discovering each of the main characters and their issues but wasn't happy at the ending...too simple, too easy.
4	1367625600	This book was by no means an award winning novel that you get swept away with.  It was however a good story about friendship and the hurtles of life that many women go through.  The three ladies in the book are at varying stages of life with different types of obstacles to overcome which is made a little easier by their developing friendship.  This is probably a good, lazy beach or summer read to relax to.
3	1367625600	I chose this classification because it is a book that tells three different stories of love interesting for its strong human and psychological content and even there.I liked how the actor characterized in a very particular three personalities, one with a traumatic childhood and his life reacting to the writer describes them very experience we give. A second character with a self blame for the inevitable death of his young son, takes over a valley of sadness and hopeless despondency according to them until it meets this friend (third character in the book) who is a pediatrician who in you see with your own problem loading of neglect and deception on the part of her fianc&eacute;. Very interesting as these three characters with such different characters come to unite and'll help each other to leave their states of sadness, guilt, despair etc, for the pure treatment for them and help each other as a group without any of them take belligerence against the other two to be superior in preparation, education etc, but rely on the logic of everyday life until they can get ahead. Very interesting the way it treats the character is left at the altar by her fiance was not done this once this after a while you want to return to it, the protagonist acts and treats her ex-boyfriend with a calm and education I was not expected by the desperate situation she was cheated, she acba hope to finish with a dialog very tall and very appropriate to our times.What I would say it was not quite to my liking without being puritanical, descriptions of the intimate moments of the protagonists believe that something as sublime as the union of a man and a woman does not need to be so descriptive, it is better let each reader's mind take flight as it creates better within their sexual fantasies.In short it is a nice book and distracted to read where there is not much to think about.
5	1367625600	It was a good, quick read.  I liked the characters, the setting, and the fact that it didn't revolve around men making women happy.
3	1367625600	Easy to read but outcome very predictable. There were complicated situations with each protagonist and everything was wrapped up at the end abruptly with happy endings for all which is unlikely in real life. It was entertaining but not the kind of story I can get into.
4	1367539200	I enjoyed the growth in all the characters.  I loved the idea of the three houses on the hill.  A great story.
5	1367539200	Plenty of variety around the relationships of the three women -- married or still looking with the men in their lives -- and with each other.  Wholesome and believable -- true to life!!
4	1367539200	The story line probably wouldn't happen in real life, but I don't read many books for their realism.  If you want to get lost in fiction, this is probably a good way to go.  It's fast and predictable except when  Mallery throws us another curve to keep the reader guessing.  Don't question the plot or the likelihood of these three personalities ever becoming best friends, and you'll enjoy this read.
4	1367539200	To be a friend you don't have to be a like.  It's reaching out and being humble enough to know that everyone is working on something.  Three different people with three different stories, yet they became friends...Enjoy!
2	1367539200	I expected more from this book. It reminded me of a harlequin romance and that was not what I was looking for. It was an ok story and I did finish reading it, but it did not capture my imagination. Too predictable.
1	1367539200	I guess you would call this chick-lit. The characters were super obvious, the plot dragged along. Definitely not my taste. I haven't even finished the book entirely because I just kept waiting for something interesting to happen.
3	1367539200	Good book to cleanse your pallet, nice story, predictable ending.Written in first person for each main character, I liked that.My first book by this author, I would read her again.
5	1367539200	I recommended it for book club, I Loved how the three houses represented the three ladies, How they all had demons and how a  friendship developed .
3	1367539200	you could almost tell how the book will end but sometimes you just need some good things and happy endings
4	1367539200	The characters were very interesting. Except for one explicit sex scene, it was a book I would feel comfortable recommending to any of my friends.
4	1367539200	I liked it because it showed three very different women overcoming adversities in totally different ways.  Wasn't sure how it would turn out until the very end.
3	1367539200	I think the author was following a How to write a book outline.  You knew in advance everything that was going to happen.  Boring.
4	1367452800	I don't really like &#34;romance&#34; stories, but this one was good.  It wasn't too raunchy and even though the ending was predictable, it was a good.
5	1367452800	I highly recommend this book and want to read more books by Susan Mallery.  I believe there is at least 1 other Blackberry Island book and am looking forward to reading it.
2	1367452800	I&#8217;m sorry, to me this book is predictable. Like listening to a jilted bride dis a bad choice in bridegrooms. I want more from a book than to hash emotional baggage over.
5	1367452800	From the first page Three Sisters drew me right in and I didn't want to put it down! I was able to finish it in two short days. The book centers around three neighbors who are getting to know each other while working through some tough times. Susan Mallory was able to rite a wonderful story that flowed seamlessly between the three friends. Each character's story line stood out wonderfully on it's own but were even better when they were woven together. I can't wait to read the first book in the A Blackberry Island Novel series as well as the next one (I'm guessing and hoping there will be a third!?).
5	1367452800	I thoroughly enjoyed the three characters or &#34;sisters.&#34; I especially appreciated that they eventually worked together to help each other's relationships.
5	1367366400	I liked the book although I would not call it a romance.  It was more about friendship and understanding than finding true love. Deanna was my favorite. She was easy to relate to while not to the extreme of OCD but it is easy to get wrapped up in the daily tasks and forget the goal. I gave my girls a hug and set up a date with my husband after reading this book.
4	1367366400	I would recommend this book for summer reading!  Definitely a girlfriend type of story!  Enjoyed it all the way to the end!
5	1367366400	This would be  a great summer read but as I sit reading it, it's snowing outside. Still makes it feel like summer!
5	1367366400	Read the entire book on cross country flight.  Interesting characters and humor.  Humor of main character reminded me of humor in Fifty Shades.
5	1367366400	Three sisters. I loved the way this friends were toward each other. It is so much better when you can choose your own sisters,  l sure wouldn't choose my blood sister.
5	1367280000	The three sisters-the houses-reminded me of myself and my two sisters. I have recommended that they both read it. There is a part of each of us in the description of each house.
5	1367280000	I loved the book and all the relationships were sad at times but ended up happy with healthy life lessons.. I loved it....

5	1367193600	This was an easy, enjoyable read.  I found something in each of the women that reminded me of myself or someone else I know.  It had a happy, feel good ending!  A great book for the beach or poolside!
5	1367193600	this was a very good story of 3 women becoming friends.  Each is dealing with their own problems but manage to help and support each other

5	1367193600	Truly enjoyed reading Three Sisters.  The book had well developed characters and a plot that captured my attention causing me to not want to stop until I had finished it.
5	1367107200	Oh what a wonderful story of how life really is!  I would love to read more stories as good as this one.

5	1367107200	I loved this book.  The story is great.  I look forward to more stories about these characters from the author.
5	1367107200	I really enjoyed this book.  It was the first book that I had read by Susan Mallery.  It had a nice story, and it ended well.  Certainly, I look forward to reading another one of her books.  Nice, easy read.
5	1367107200	Great book about three individual persons and how they come together thru thick and thin and with totally individual personalities.
4	1367107200	Each of the three main characters offered some interest.  The easy transformation of the OCD neighbor was a bit overboard...they don't change overnight.  The everybody lives happily ever after ending was not as satisfying as it was when i was a kid.  Enjoyed the setting, the dialogue, and the people.
4	1367107200	I really enjoyed reading this book.  Three &#34;sisters&#34; and three different characters, personalities, with past and present life traumas to conquer in order to find peace and love.
5	1367107200	I was beginning to think I wasn't going to  be able to get into this book but that thinking went away quickly. This book was wonderful and so sincere. I fell totally in love  with the three sisters and cried my eyes out in a very good way at the end. This book was just fantabulous!!!:)  Just a really feel good innocent read!!  Love love loved it!!
5	1367020800	I found this book easy to read.  I would recommend it to all of my girlfriend's. Would be great for a book club.
5	1367020800	This story is about the houses loved by three very different people.  It held my interest during a very difficult timewhen my husband was in the hospital and made the hours and worry melt away.
4	1367020800	Though strangers with different personalities the  three women who  owned similar style houses, on an island in Washington, discovered they could become close friends.  They were not only close friends but helped each other solve their personal problems thus forming a deep personal bond.
5	1367020800	I really like  Susan Mallery stories.  I've never been disappointed in one of her books yet!I look forward to my next one.
5	1367020800	I have always loved Susan Mallery and I love books centered around friends, the beach and true love.  Susan  can bring all of this together in this great read.  You won't want to put the book down, you kind of want to savor it and make it last.  A real good book to carry to the beach or for you Kindle.  Relax and enjoy the funny parts and grab your tissues as these three women come together to bring an unforgetable story.
1	1367020800	boring and predictable just the old style harlequin rommance.  Her fiance dumps her, she moves away, gets the hots for the local contractor, all neightbors are in turmoil, then they all become friends and live happily ever after.  Yea and Yippie
5	1366934400	Hott Synopsis:Cross Roads.Three women. Three houses. The devestations.Each home in this tiny cul-de-sac needs to be gutted but each for different reasons.Andi's needs to by physically gutted. It may seem to the word that this pediatrician has it together but she's the family under-achiever and was just dumped at the alter by her 10-year boyfriend for his secretary. To try to get her life on track this thirty year old left city life to start her own practice and learn to live life alone.Boston looks as brittle as she feels.

Yes, it's got Ms. Mallery's wonderful sense of humor and three sweet romances but the portrayal of friendship is what really did it for me.I've never enjoyed books where emotion or friendship was the forefront of the plot but I can't say that I've never enjoyed a book more than this one. Oh, you so need to RUN out and grab this one!!More...Grade: A+Steam: AdultSeries: Blackberry Island, #2
5	1366934400	What a wonderful story about adopted sisters that truly brought out the best in each other.  I wish I had these ladies as my friend to keep me in line.  I love this book and highly recommend it to any woman.
4	1366934400	A light hearted,  fun quick read.  Susan Mallery takes us on an adventure of three women to find firm footing in life and love.
2	1366934400	I honestly thought this book was about 3 "sisters" but it's not, it's about 3 women who live next to each other, and their family dynamics, relationships, marriage, kids, etc. I'm shocked at all the 5 star ratings, for me the reasons I gave this book 2 stars are as follows:The characters were poorly developedThe redundancy was ridiculous,(without revealing too much for those of you that want to read this book) how many times does Boston have to tell Andi, that she's has a problem, how many times does Boston have to tell Deana that she has a problem, how many times does Andi have to tell Deana and Boston that she has a problem, and so on and so on then how many times do they all have to get together with a bottle of wine to discuss the "problems" that you just spent 50 pages reading about 3 times!Then without warning or "lead in" the conclusion just comes, everything is neatly tied up out of the blueFor me I say this book should filed under "young adult/teen" , I think an adult woman will find it boring, dull and childish-a man shouldn't even waste his time.Short Review:Boring story line + irritating redundancy + out-of-the-blue conclusion = not worth the $
5	1366934400	This is such a sweet and sexy book!  Loved it and all the characters! Would recommend this to all my girlfriends
4	1366848000	Predictable but entertaining. The author develops her characters slowly but thuroughly. Enjoyable light read. I have nothing else to say about this nove. KD
5	1366848000	This is a book you read every night, stay up too late-lost in the book!  I will recommend thisOne to my friends.
4	1366848000	A good book with interesting characters.  Susan Mallery has done a great job bringing every person to life in this book.  This story is an example of how important friendships are to each of us.  If your looking for an easy read .....great choice with good message!
4	1366848000	This is a good book for reading on a rainy day.  Well written, typical happy ever after ending. It was worth my time.
1	1366848000	very lame. I struggled to finish the book I was bored. Very unlikely story!Wil not read any of this writer's book!
4	1366848000	Loved this book could not put down...Just a reminder we all have things going on in life...Definately a recommendation.Loved it
5	1366848000	Very entertaining.  I read it four books ago, so don't remember all the details, just that I liked it.  Would recommend.
4	1366848000	Kind of  a summer fluff romance... but a good story about the strength of women who are challenged by life circumstances and relationships!
5	1366848000	This book has you interested from page one all the way to the end! Couldn't put it down! Excellent read!
5	1366848000	What a great story about friendship and healing. I couldn't put it down!!  Can't wait to read the next book by Susan Mallery.
4	1366761600	Wish i had read this one before BAREFOOT SEASON, but did not, so...it was a little off for me, but still good.  Light, easy reading...good vacation book.JCM Tennessee
5	1366761600	What a warm and compassionate read about three struggling women that come together and support one another. Love this story.
4	1366761600	It was really good to see how the girls with different background and problems could manage to become friends and take up for each other.
4	1366761600	I didn't know what to expect when I got this book but it had such great reviews I was intrigued.  I really enjoyed it.  The character development was excellent and the story lines of the three main characters well thought out and executed.  After I read this book, I immediately picked up the prior book (Barefoot Season) and enjoyed it just as much.  I'm looking forward to reading more of her books.
5	1366761600	It was easy to. become involved with the characters in this book.  Excellent storyline.  Have just finished &#34;Barefoot&#34; - I'mk still thinking about it - - -
5	1366761600	I had fun reading this book....great beach book or any time book. I have read quite a few of Susan's books and have enjoy all of them.........good writer.
5	1366761600	I feel like I know these women !  They are so wonderful !  Learning to trust each other is not easy when personalities are so very different.  Strength of character reigns !
5	1366761600	This was a great book, I liked the way the houses &#34;represented&#34; the three ladies lives as they grew and became like sisters!
5	1366761600	It was a sweet and fun book to start off the summer reading list....like finding new authors that have several books I haven't read.
4	1366761600	it kept my attention to keep reading, this is the type of book that i enjoy and keeps me involved with the characters
4	1366761600	I really enjoyed this book.  It showed how the seemingly unlikely connection of three women can come together to and change lives.
5	1366761600	Great read. Did not want it to end.  Can't wait for the next Blackberry Island.  Write it soon Susan Mallery!!!
5	1366761600	First time I heave read Susan Mallery book.  Always enjoy three different story lines that intertwine with each other.Definitely recommend this book
5	1366761600	Great interaction between the main characters.....it was a great read...Love the 3 women...each has a great story that unfolds.Would definitely recommend.
3	1366761600	This was a pleasant enough read but lacks substance. I bought this for a read at the beach and I expected light reading but this was fluff
5	1366761600	Susan Mallery did an amazing job with bringing the characters in this book to life! So real...so inspiring! Excellent Read.
3	1366761600	An easy read and a nice escape... it didn't leave me thinking about it during the day, but I did look forward to reading it each night.  Nice character development - I found myself identifying with each female.  Well written.
4	1366675200	Easy to read, engaging and heartwarming! Is a sweet kind of reading for girls and makes you want to know Blackberry Island.
5	1366675200	1st timer with this author & enjoyed every word! Each character was very relatable & the story had great life lesson moments to reflect on... I've bought 5 more books by Susan! Lol. This book has something for everyone.
4	1366588800	A really heartwarming story. We all put up walls to protect ourselves from further hurt. What so many people don't understand is it is those walls that prevent us from living life to its full potential, engaging in fulfilling relationships and helping our children reach their full potential.
5	1366588800	This was a first for me by Susan Mallery and I have to sayI really loved it...I have now ordered another titled Blackberry Island.So excited to have a new author to enjoy.
4	1366588800	This is a sweet, touching story with some spicy moments thrown in for romance. The three women use their new friendship to support themselves through all the twists and turns life throws at them. It was fun to see their relationships evolve  into something truly special. They were not just neighbors or even friends but became family. Predictable but enjoyable !
5	1366588800	Beautiful tale wonderfully rendered. This is a feel good story written for women who understand the world can be tough sometimes but can be tolerated with friends by our side.
4	1366588800	I would have liked more details into each &#34;sisters' life. It was an easy & enjoyable get away from the stress of work.
5	1366588800	Good book.  Kept my interest.  One of those books it is hard to lay down.  My kind of book for sure.
3	1366588800	it was predictable but it was fun to read.I really didn't put it down till it was done.could of had a little more action in it.
4	1366588800	This story was somewhat predictable but I still enjoyed it.  Three women, each having trouble with their relationships, become friends.  The characters are relatable and likable even though the story lines are similar to many other books I've read.  Good light summer read.
4	1366588800	I liked the idea of the &#34;Three Sisters&#34;.  Nothing like close friends.  But not quite a 5 star in my opinion.
3	1366588800	I choose this rating because I found it not the kind of reading I prefer at my age.  I am a &#34;avid reader&#34; over 65.It might be a better read for mid-30's age range.
5	1366588800	I enjoyed this easy read.  The characters and the story Line kept me intrigued.  I wish there was a sequel.
4	1366588800	Really enjoyed this book and one of Susan's best!  --First the setting on Blackberry Island, 3 historical homes (Three Sisters) and renovations, and three different characters, all with their own individual issues and stories.  Susan did a great job with the women -- as true to life issues of today living next door to one another.Deanne/Colin- married with OCD with five daughters), (Boston-cannot recover from the loss of her baby so she and her husband Zeke are drifting apart), and then (Andie-the main character-a pediatrician who moves from Seattle to Blackberry Island after being left at the alter-trying to find a new life with her new home, new practice, and of course meets her hunky contractor -Wade).It would be wonderful to have female friends and neighbors-who can be so different and bond. - A good ending!  A book of healing, loss, forgiveness, and love.
5	1366588800	If you love learning about relationships and the ins and outs of love this is the book for you! I highly recommend it!
4	1366588800	I enjoyed the writing style and the story kept my interest going until the end.  I recommend this book, especially to women.
4	1366588800	I enjoyed the development of each character and their relationships with their families and each other.  They seemed realistic with their flaws and differences and I would enjoy an afternoon or evening with these ladies.
5	1366588800	Susan Mallery does a great job of creating her characters and her plot without boring you with pages and pages of details.  I could easily imagine each character and the setting and loved how she developed both.  This is a great story of three very different people and the lives they live while living next door to each other.  Definitely a worthwhile read.
4	1366502400	This story was about 3 women with different problems. After they became friends, each one tried to help the other through their difficulties.  Having other women to share their problem with made them become close friends.  I enjoyed this book very much.
2	1366502400	If you want a light chic-lit book maybe you will like this.  It is very predictable and very unrealistic. It would make a good beach read for summer.  Don't buy it if you think it will have substance............you will be disappointed.
2	1366502400	Can't the author write without being so sexually explicit? The story can still be told and leave some room for our imagination. For me,it took something away from the story. The characters could have been a little more developed.
5	1366502400	I really enjoyed reading this story and will read again one day. I would recommend this book as a good fireside read..
3	1366502400	It was not exactly a cliffhanger, but it did hold my interest.  A good take on vacation to the beach book.
5	1366502400	I would recommend Susan Mallery books to anyone that likes to read. I have several of her books that I have read over a time period and are getting ready to share with other friends that like to read her books also.
5	1366502400	This was the first book by Susan Mallery I have read but won't be the last.  I enjoyed the story of a developing relationship between three very different women.  The author explored all the facets of the strengths and weakness of the three main characters and wove them into a lovely story that all women can identify with.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will read more from Susan Mallery.
5	1366502400	Very good and easy read.  The author was described the people and house so well you knew what everything looked like on the Island.
4	1366502400	A great book about three women all facing different problems and issues. I liked getting to know each character and their families and seeing how their problems resolved in the end. I really enjoyed this book and read it quickly. It is my first Susan Mallery book. I would like to read more from her!
5	1366502400	Loved this book!!!!This was an easy read. It was a story of friendship between three very different women. They each have serious issues that they are dealing with but help each other through by love and support.
4	1366502400	This was a nice story although at times a little depressing.  But you had to get into each of the three characters and their stories then read on to see the outcome.
5	1366502400	Great book about friendship and their differences. They learn to need and trust each other which makes a great story. Couldn't put it down.
4	1366502400	As we know in life we all have our own stories and issues.  If we all reached out for support just a little more instead of suffering in silence we would have a much easier time in life.  These women built a sisterhood.
5	1366416000	this book kept me fascinated to hte very last page.  I could picture all the women.  This woould make a great movie for Hallmark or other studio
4	1366416000	I enjoyed this book. It's the first I've read from this author.  I enjoyed the inter action of the three ladies.  Each different from the other, but also very much the same.
3	1366416000	I wouldn't recommend this for a great read.  If you are just looking for 'something' to read it's an okay book.
3	1366416000	This book is at best a beach read.  It is a predictable piece of fluff. It is a quick read but is quite forgettable.
5	1366416000	I absolutely loved this book.  Andi, Boston, and Deanna's stories were so real.  This book made me laugh out loud and shed a few tears.  Very well done, Susan Mallery!
4	1366416000	I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever been left behind by someone they are madly in love with.  It will give them hope for a happy ever after and a rainbow in the sky.  There's always someone more loving around the corner.
5	1366416000	I found my new favorite author!  All the characters are lovable and relatable!  I have read several other books by Susan Mallery and as I said before....I found a new favorite author!
5	1366416000	My husband and I have one Amazon account. He probably would have rolled his eyes at this book.  I felt it was really well written.  I connected almost immediately with the three main characters.  I read this book in two days.  Found I was just sitting there reading instead of doing many other things.  Well written, engaging, not preachy, and not much graphic sex.
4	1366416000	Great character building and relationship between the characters.  Could certainly relate to several of the women and they were each unique.
5	1366416000	I loved this book had not read this author before. Will be reading more of her books in the future
5	1366329600	It was a great story and very well written. Enjoyed every monute of it. Couldn.t put the book dwon once I statred reading it.
5	1366329600	love all the diffrenent plots involved with each house on teh hill.  real life drama involved in story!!! need a sequel
4	1366329600	I like the way the story was written.  The three stories combined made it more interesting and real.. Thx Susan
5	1366329600	A book that celebrates the true sisterhood of women. So readable that I didn't want it to end. Will read this author again.
5	1366329600	I highly recommend this book.  It was so good that I could not put it down and read it in one day.
5	1366329600	Each character was well fleshed out and had problems most can relate too. Loved the use of friendship as road to redemption.
4	1366329600	Much of what I read holds my attention because of the tight tension created in the plot;  while this book was not one about which  I would say &#34;I could scarcely put it down&#34;, it was entirely enjoyable due to its well developed characters and the interaction between them.  If this book were a movie my husband would classify it a &#34;chick flick&#34;;  I'd agree but I really loved the book!
4	1366329600	A fun read. The 3 main women in this story were a good example of how we are all struggling with our own demons and  how good friends can help.
5	1366329600	I loved this one too!  Barefoot Season opened the door for more great stories.  Loved how the women became friends despite their differences.  I love Susan Mallery's writing style, keep them coming.
5	1366329600	This was one of those hard to put down stories.  The island setting gave it a small town feeling where each character's private life is know by all.
3	1366329600	The story line is pretty good. I could do without the soft-porn scenes and juevenille inuendos used to describe them. Seriously, a doctor using the words &#34;lady parts&#34;?
5	1366329600	I have read several of Susan Mallery's books and have enjoyed each of them.  This book has a great plot and the &#34;Three Sisters&#34; are not what you are thinking initially.  I enjoyed it.  Great read in women's fiction.
5	1366329600	I can always count on Susan to give me an enjoyable read. Lots of laughs and good characters. This one was one of her best with more to the story. Enjoy
3	1366329600	I love Susan Mallery's books but when thinking back to other books that are part of series you read about the characters from previous books in the series.  The original characters were not mentioned until almost the end of the book even when in this book Andi went to the location of the first book once a week.  Loved the story line behind this book but would liked to have more of an update on the prior characters fromk book one.
3	1366329600	I enjoyed it - it is an easy read.  Three women, all different who find they have more in common than they think.A book girlfriend share or vacation read.
3	1366329600	Good book, got you interested right away and kept you there.  Happily ever after ending is always good for me.
5	1366329600	Susan Mallery Is always outstanding. She loves and understands people and wants the best for them, and it comes across in all her books.
4	1366243200	Easy relaxing reading that did not require a lot of mental activity. I get tired of always reading books that stimulate the mind.
5	1366156800	I enjoyed getting into each woman's life of love and pain.  Mostly, I was happy that all three women, by the end of the book, reached healing and love.
5	1366156800	I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Susan Mallery has a way of holding your interest in her storytelling. I will read more of her books.
4	1366156800	I had a difficult time putting it down.  Susan Mallery was great at describing the events with a colorful view.  It was not as predictable as I thought it could be.
4	1366156800	Most of the book was very interesting, the ending was almost predictable.  Enjoyed it! Would even re-read it, felt like I was on the island
3	1366156800	I gave this book 3 stars because I liked it enough to finish it.  It was quite predictable however and I knew early on exactly how it would end which was probably how I would have wanted it to end.
4	1366156800	Loved the premise of this story. Took a lot to get them together which is usually not the case. Love her writing.
2	1366156800	Surface reading and superficial.  Not much substance.  A quick read, the book keeps your interest but leaves a hollow feeling in your stomach.  Superficial.  Not for readers of literature.
4	1366156800	Recommend to anyone who likes character intertwining stories. Good romance and well developed characters. Three sisters, three painted ladies. Voila.
4	1366156800	Kept me interested from beginning to end. Love how the characters intertwine with one another. A great story of friendship. A nice, quick read.
5	1366156800	I enjoyed this book ....... Kind of a light read....... But once I started getting into it I finished in two days.......enjoy
4	1366156800	As always, Susan Mallery brings her characters to life, causing the reader to almost to feel as one with the town where the book takes place.  this was an utterly charming book.
4	1366070400	This was a very sweet book. This book is about three women who are neighbors on a small island outside of Seattle come together to help each other heal and work on their relationships with their mates. This was a very enjoyable read for me.
5	1366070400	This is my first Susan Mallery book and I am impressed.  I just bought it on a whim and from the first page, I was hooked.  Three different women inhabiting three Queen Anne houses on a row called the Three Sisters.  Each of their stories of grief and painful secrets are different, fleshed out, and depicted with depth and realism.  Mallery creates strong female characters and I loved spending time immersing myself in their compelling stories.
3	1366070400	Good beach book to read. Fast read.Everyone has baggage and is dealing with issues. Never judge a book by its cover.
4	1366070400	This is a  great story for women to read.  I found myself relating quite well to many of the circumstances these three women dealth with as they formed their lasting relationship with one another.
5	1365984000	I really enjoyed this book.  I love Susan Mallery.  The personalities of the sisters was nicely brought out.  Family life,difficulties, bonding,all of family life was interwoven.  Even romasnce thrown in.  You'll love this read.
2	1365984000	I bought this book based on the reviews and was quite disappointed.  Found it very predictable, nothing special here at all.
5	1365984000	A complex tale of three very diverse women and the relationships they forge while each facing their own demons barring the way to happiness and healthy relationships. Reaffirms that sometimes your true family comes from spirit, not blood.
4	1365984000	Loved this book, great reading very interesting.would buy again. my kind of book. I would advise people to get this one
5	1365984000	I have never read a Susan Mallery book before Three Sisters, A Blackberry Island Novel.  I am hooked!  This is a heartwarming,  story about three women who develop a deep friendship.  Each of the women has deep hidden problems of her own and unable to overcome the problems until they learn how to trust and confide in one another.  I could not put this book down and when I was finished I wanted more!  I highly recommend this book about friendship, trust, and love.
5	1365897600	A quick fun read, great vacation book.  Three different women, three different life choices.  Likeable characters even if you don't agree with their choices.
5	1365897600	Good book about the relationships between women and how they are able to come togetherand be there for one another in times of need.  Looking forward to reading some of Susan Mallery's books.
5	1365897600	Love any Susan Mallery book.Once you start, you don't want to quit until your done.The end comes to soon.Would definately recommend it to any one.
5	1365897600	Can't wait for the next book in the series. I really enjoyed reading this and I hope the next one is just as good.
4	1365897600	Quite predictable, and all 3 women have superficial sidelights into their other lives, but the primary definition for each of them is their relationship with a man.  A predicable light read that won't challenge anybody about anything.  Enjoy
4	1365811200	I recommend this book. It had enough suspense to hold my attention. The story was touching and so true to becoming friends.
4	1365811200	A good story about the three houses and the three women who owned themAn easy and fun story about the different lives of the three of themwould recommend it
4	1365811200	Interesting to learn a little bit about OCD even though it was a very small part. I enjoyed getting to know the 3 women in the story. It ALMOST made me want to renovate my house again but I'm not that crazy!
3	1365811200	Predictable storylines, with characters whom I feel like I've met in previous light fiction.  Not terrible, just not very good.
5	1365811200	Its the first I have read of Susan Mallory.  It kept my interest so much that I wanted it to go on!
5	1365811200	I would recommend this book to anyone .  Easy to read and great characters.  It is one of the books that you save to read again an again.
5	1365811200	Thanks to Susan Mallery I fell that I know the characters....so much so...I am now reading BAREFOOT SEASON.  :)  I'll let you know what happens!
5	1365811200	This book will pull you in from the beginning. Three totally different women..three totally different stories in one great book. Once again Susan has shown us what a great storyteller she is . Don't start this book unless you have time to finish it. You won't be able to put it down!
5	1365811200	Very predictable.  The women were very weak with no depth.  A lot of whining and nothing original in the story or dialogue
4	1365811200	I enjoyed this light read set in Washington. It had believable characters and an interesting storyline.  It was an enjoyable weekend read.
5	1365811200	What a wonderful new book Susan Mallery has written.  She took three completely different characters and made us care about all of them...and let me tell you - I started out not liking one of them!  Just like no one in the book did!A must read for the Romance Novel lover!
2	1365811200	It's a shame the author portrays women as NEEDING men.  Give me a break.  May be a nice choice for a pre-teen or the likes - but adult women know, or should know better.
5	1365811200	Enjoyable story of life's situations.  This book depicts so many issues women face that cause them to develop bonds. Great setting
5	1365811200	This is honestly one of the best books I have read. erver. And I've read hundreds of books. I absolutely loved the tale of building friendship amongst the three women in the book. Of love beeing repaired, it is realistic and wonderful. Wonderful book indeed.
5	1365724800	Nice and good FlowerA good book to read on your vacation. H&aacute;s a good flow and keeps one entertained
4	1365724800	Super reading book.  Had a great story, written well and I did not want to lay it down.  Had good romanance with real life stories wrapped in.
5	1365724800	I could not put this book down until I was finished.  It was humorous and heartwrenching at times. I loved the way three main characters were interwoven.
5	1365724800	Grabbed my attention from the first page and kept me interested until the last and wishing I knew how the future of these characters turned out.  I hated to see the last page of the book!!
4	1365638400	great book to relax with.  great story line.  enjoyed this book very much. always like to read susn mallery grat author
5	1365638400	I have decided I have to read all of Susan Mallery's books after reading &#34;Three Sisters&#34;. I loved her beautiful descriptions of each home and the families living in them. I can't wait to start another of her books.
4	1365638400	Reading this book was entertaining and kept me interested from start to finish.  The characters are well developed and the story line intriguing. I will look for more books by this author.
4	1365638400	This was a nice easy read. It kept me interested and helped me to stay awake while nursing my newborn in the middle of the night. I ejoyed the plot. Interesting characters. Good fluff book.
4	1365638400	I enjoyed it and would read more by this author.  A light read compared to what I am sometimes reading.
4	1365638400	I enjoyed the book, wasn't spectacular but a nice story with a happy ending for all. It was a light romance about 3 different women, and how they coped with life.I would recommend it!
5	1365638400	This was a very realistic view on the issues everyday women encounter.  Also, shows how women can form such strong bonds and rely on each other.  The whole story was enjoyable from beginning to end....great beach reading with a cool glass of wine!
4	1365638400	Add Susan Mallery to my list of recommended authors! I am more than halfway through this book and with every page, I'm more and more impressed with her story lines. The three leading ladies of the book have individual problems, yet bond together to support one another. Reading this book is a great way to unwind after a long day!
5	1365638400	Loved this book I recommend this book to anyone that are intrigued by three stories in one very interesting book.
5	1365638400	This book is really a good read.  I enjoyed all of it.  There was romance, friendship, and drama which made it enjoyable to read.  The characters were described well and brought to life on the pages.
5	1365638400	This was a great story of friendship and how everyone has their ups and downs in life and the friendships that can see you through the tough times. I really enjoyed the variety in characters in this book
5	1365638400	Although, at first I thought &#34;Is this author really going to tackle this many problems&#34;- I soon realized she has a wonderful style and the resolutions and journey, we as readers, get to take- to an end- were inspirational, believable and, truthfully, I love Susan Mallory endings because they are positive & HAPPY... love the HAPPY!!!
5	1365552000	As always Susan Mallery did a great job.  I initially thought the story was about 3 sisters, but ad it developed it was much more.  You'll have to reat to find out.
5	1365552000	Enjoyed every page and every character.  Three Sisters was predictable but sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered!  My first Mallery novel and certainly not my last!
5	1365552000	Three Sisters is a story about three women with three different situations who come together and help one another endure and overcome struggles within themselves. Susan Mallery remains a favorite of mine with her ability to draw buried emotions out of me. One of her most moving, touching stories that I have ever read, Three Sisters tells of strength in friendship, finding love, heartache and new beginnings. I felt the pain, love and triumph that her characters did. Most importantly, there is always a way I can relate. Nothing she writes is ever farfetched that I cannot help but feel my own experiences are brought to life through her writing.
5	1365552000	Broken hearts, broken lives, but they all get mended. We all love these kind of stories. They make us laugh and they make us cry. It's the characters that we can relate to that pulls us into the story. Very enjoyable read.
2	1365552000	This book is not horrible just SLOW and very predictable.  The characters are great and the author does a good job introducing them and making them like the "girls next door" but that is as far as it goes.  It is just another story of friendship with no surprises or room for imagination.  I was hoping for more.
5	1365552000	Easy fast read and enjoyed the whole book.  Entertaining throughout and wanted to keep reading. Worth the price to purchase.
4	1365552000	Great Summer reading.  This is truly a Good Neighbor book for anyone with close friends.  I would certainly recommend it.
5	1365552000	A romantic and light story!And a very relaxing reading. A wonderful way to take some time off, and enjoy.
3	1365465600	This is a very nice story and the book keeps you interested all the time...until you have read about 50% of it. Then sex becomes an obsession; I have nothing against sex, but when it is narrated in such an explicit way as in this book, then it becomes porn. Otherwise the book should have earned 5 stars.
4	1365465600	I totally enjoyed this book. It is great to read about 3 different women going on 3 different journeys. I recommend this book.
4	1365465600	I liked the book ,it kept me interested in finishing the book.The book is one that could definitly happen to women.
4	1365465600	This book kept me interested for hours.  I lost sleep because I wanted to see how it ended.  I will look for more books by Susan Mallery.
4	1365465600	Enjoyed reading this story about three women.  I found myself not wanting to put the book down be cause of the compelling stories of each sister.
5	1365465600	A Susan Mallery book is always an entertaining read. I never miss one of her books and this story is a very good example of what a reader can look forward to!
5	1365465600	I have enjoyed this author for several years. Was so happy to hear "Three Sisters" made the NY Times Best Seller list (Paperback).This is best book she has written so far in my opinion. Strong women, problems, and how valuable women's friendships are.
3	1365465600	This book has a nice plot and is fast reading. Very predictable ending but nicely written. Great for vacation or traveling reading.
5	1365465600	I enjoyed the book. It was hard to put down!!!! A good read!!!  sounds like a place I could live.
5	1365465600	Loved this book.Just read it at your leasure as I did..  It is about three homes and three wonderful young women whoget intertwined with each other's lives and loves.A must read book.Thank you Susan Mallery (author)
5	1365465600	it had a great story line. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a.
5	1365465600	I do not have sisters so loved the idea of adopting at least one.  Very good story of life and overcoming obstacles
3	1365465600	Pleasant, hopeful & entertaining.  Good friendships & women's real problems explained well.  Explication of the dynamics and origins of OCD well explained.
4	1365465600	I enjoyed this book and the characters. I hope there will be more about these women. It was interesting how they related to each other and supported each other.
4	1365465600	this book kept my attention and curiosity . i enjoyed the content and subjects . i feel as if i were ever in the area , i would want to see what the Blackberry Island is really like.
5	1365465600	Very easy read.  Light and enjoyable.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting something fun to read.  Good beach read.
4	1365465600	I quite liked this book.  It was a very enjoyable story and kept my interest throughout the book.  Great if you want a light read.
5	1365379200	This was a very enjoyable book. I wish there were other books with the same characters in them an Blackberry Island.
5	1365379200	I found this book a great read which explored many of life's family and social problems.  Neighbors became friends and solved many problems with themselves and their children while dealing with unfortunate backgrounds and family history.  Many issues resolved.
5	1365379200	Three Sisters isn't about sisters. It isn't even about brothers although there is a pair of brothers. The Three Sisters are three old houses that sit in a row. They are famous on Blackberry Island.This story deals with three couples but their stories weave together so nicely that I didn't even care. Normally I'm a one couple per book kind of girl. But Mallory nails this story with her signature style of humor, passion and pathos.I was really surprised at how much I disliked one of the heroines. Then as I learned more about her, she became the one that I pulled for the most. I wanted her to suceed. I needed her to conquer her own mistakes. Mallory didn't shy away from the dark in this book. She takes you down into the nitty-gritty of the cycle of abuse.The ending was neatly wrapped up to include the requisite bow of an epilogue. I closed this book feeling a bit sad that it was done, but hoping to learn more about a certain office manager and a doctor who will be on the island soon.So I guess you could say the author did her job. She gave me a satisfying, emotional read that left me happy for the three couples I'd just visited with and wanting more from the denizens of Blackberry Island.
4	1365379200	This book offers something different to the current top sellers on the kindle list (which seem to all be about love triangles and bad boys.)  I found the story line to be captivating and entertaining.  I could not put this book down.  The characters were real with the type of issues that most people can relate to.  Each of the main characters were also well defined with depth and well written.  The only negative I have is that the story ended in a very predictable way, although if it ended any other way, I probably would not have enjoyed the book as much.
3	1365379200	The story stays stuck with stories repeated a bit to much instead of adding new material, still a good light summer read about misconceptions changed and new friendships, and what summer read isn't good without a hot guy!?
5	1365292800	This was a very good read!  I really enjoyed the characters and how the story progressed!  Would like more like this!
4	1365292800	I have always loved Susan Mallery books and this was no exception.  In fact, this is one of the best I've read. It made me laugh and cry.  Someone mentioned the ending was wrapped up in a fake way.  I disagree.  The ending wasn't a happily ever after, but a continuation with hope added in.
4	1365292800	Susan makes you think through out this novel.  She brings out the truth that we all use our judgements before really knowing someone.  It also proves, we all have our issues to face and sometimes easier to face with a great friend.
3	1365292800	I hadn't read this author before, I like her writing style, but I think her character development is really shallow. Very predictable story line, and tied up in a bow ending.  No surprises here. I read it in &#60;1 day. It would be a good choice for a plane ride or sitting at the beach. Anywhere you wouldn't need to give your full attention to the book.  Not substantive enough for a book club discussion.
2	1365292800	I love Susan Mallery's stories because they take me away from the everyday pressures and stress.  Unfortunately, almost the whole book was about the depressing lives of these 3 women.  I was very disappointed.
5	1365292800	The relationships of the three main characters were very real and relatable.  This is not just a love story.  It is a beautifully written story about many types of relationships.  I loved it!
3	1365292800	This novel starts with a brilliant hook, when Andi is left standing at the altar, and you just have to read on... except that this fact is swept aside too quickly and no reference is made to it for a good while.The storyline takes us to Blackberry Island and three houses known as the three sisters. A play on words here as the three female occupants become the main focus of the story, and their relationship problems form the basic structure of the novel. Characterisation is good and develops throughout the plot, but on the whole I felt it was a little predictable, lacking in some drama and plot twists, and I would have liked more of a sense of the location. Dialogue was engaging with some funny one-liners and the author didn't hold back with the love scenes.I'm a little in two minds about this book. It held my interest, but there a little too much repetition and explanation, which was slightly irritating.A three and half star rating for me, and I would certainly look at other titles by this author.
5	1365206400	Its perfect for vacation or any time you can pick it up frequently.  You won't want to put it down for long!  Mallery brings each character to life making you want to come back for more! Excellent read!
4	1365206400	While I would definitely consider it light reading, I enjoyed this book. It was pleasant to spend a day escaping into the lives of the three female characters who were believable.
4	1365206400	Three Sisters moves along at a steady space that kept me very interested. I love the characters and the Island.
4	1365206400	Good story, written well.  Held my interest,..each of the three women's lives depicted today's reality, although the ending for the three women and men was predictable.... &#34;they lived happily thereafter.&#34;
5	1365206400	Wonderful book by Ms. Mallery. The lives of these three women made me laugh and made me cry. I felt like I just went on vacation to visit three of my dearest friends. I love everything Susan Mallery writes but this book touched me in so many ways.
4	1365206400	Interesting but predictable plot with 3 likeable main characters. A book for light reading, one that you can put down for a while and return to easily.
5	1365206400	I liked it and will read more of her books. Her characters are real and believable. I will recommend this book to others.
5	1365120000	I am really enjoying this book.  It's an easy read and the author does a great job diving into relationships and friendships.
4	1365120000	Would have liked it to be available in audible form so it could be played in the car .  My husband would enjoy it  that way also.
4	1365120000	It is the type of book that you will not want to put down once you start to read it.
4	1365120000	This is a book for all seasons and a book that will really get you involved in the characters lives.Deanna, Andi, and Boston were believable but Deanna's story was really special.  A woman who thought everything was perfect and found out otherwise.  I even liked her kids.
5	1365120000	This book was my first book in a long while. It was truly heart warming, a story about tragedy and coping friendships forming and family and love all in one well written story! It made smile cry and laugh and to me that's a good book!
4	1365120000	Took me a while to get involved in the book. I guess because of three storiesrunning together . At first had to keep on top of who was who and their story.
4	1365033600	Read this in two days. Three houses, three women, three problems. It held my interest and ooooh.... Watch out... there's a little sex. It's a good day-flipper.
5	1365033600	I loved reading it. It captured my interest on the first page and held it throughout the entire book. I loved the characters.
5	1365033600	The three female characters in this book bring real life to the novel.  The way it's written makes it very difficult for you to put the book down.  It's a start to finish book.  Great.
5	1365033600	These characters were so realistic and had the same problems that women everywhere face and the resolution of these were not without pain and sacrifice.  Just a wonderful book of the power of love and the human spirit.
5	1365033600	Loved this book. It was the kind of book that once I finished reading Three Sisters I could not start another book because Susan Mallery's story kept running thru my mind.
5	1365033600	This is a story of women who are nothing alike, but they find the best qualities in each other.  Too many times women judge by the cover and never find the essence of someone else.
4	1365033600	I enjoyed reading this. Nothing heavy, a little predictable but entertaining. You find yourself identifying with aspects of all three main characters. I would read more from this author.
5	1365033600	Susan Mallery never disappoints.  I love her books.  I have read all of them.  I look forward to the next Three sisters book.
5	1365033600	Loved the characters in this book.  Look forward to the next book in the Blackberry Island series.  Susan Mallery is a great author.
5	1365033600	This was an good easy read. It captures your attention and holds it. I had never read Susan Mallery before and I think I have found a new favorite author.
4	1365033600	This book was just as good as Barefoot Season! Mallery is great at capturing the way woman think and feel!
4	1364947200	Loved the storyline, was an easy read and didn't want to put it down . read the 340 pagees in 2 days!
5	1364860800	susan mallery has created some unique and compelling characters in Three Sisters.  We watch three diverse women grow and form strong bonds.  A very enjoyable book!
5	1364860800	When I say "Absolutely Impressed", I mean I absolutely loved this book. Which I should not be surprised, I haven't been disappointed with any of Susan's books! Each of the characters are relatable in one way or another. I guess I relate more to Deanna's character. She tries hard to be perfect, while jeopardizing her relationships with those she loves. I felt for Boston and her husband. I have no idea what it is like to have kids, but to lose a child has to be one of the hardest things in the world to deal with. I loved Andi's story from the beginning. And how she treated her ex-fiance was purely awesome. Like I said I absolutely loved this book!! Such a great read!!!
5	1364860800	enjoyed this as there were 3 very different characters who bonded.  shows that opposites attract and friendship comes in all shapes & sizes
5	1364860800	Susan Mallery is always a favorite of mine.  I always hate to put the book down.Looking forward to the next one!!!!
3	1364860800	I thought it would have been better with more background on the characters.  It was interesting to see how the lives of the women meshed and changed.
5	1364860800	I enjoy just carrying my I pad not tons of books.Love all that Ive read so far.I will keep em coming
5	1364860800	This book was a wonderful read! Great story about three women and families. Every chapter was something new, and you will want to keep reading. I laughed, cried, and smiled th throughout!
5	1364860800	Susan is a great author,each book I love, but this book was her best book ever. It was SO GOOD, very emotional. A book you can`t stop reading. I have been reading her books from her very first book and can`t get enough of them. Get the book and I know you will enjoy it too
5	1364860800	Each woman' story was compelling on their own and the combined story of friendship was wonderful and realistic.  I really enjoyed it!
5	1364774400	This was an enjoyable book.. take some time and read it wasn't a regular romance. I really don't need to say more except they are making me
5	1364774400	How I envy these women.  What I thought might be a story about houses was actually a story about how three women became sisters.  I really enjoyed this.
5	1364774400	I've loved Susan's books for some time but this is the first time that the words so truly moved me emotionally, especially Deanna's story. I loved Boston and Andi too and it made me so thankful for the strong women in my life and the friendships that I know will last forever. Thank you so much Susan!
4	1364774400	I enjoyed the story line and way that 3 significantly different individuals came together to create very interesting home town scenario.  Good read.
4	1364774400	It was a good book & I enjoyed but at times I thought it moved too slowly.In some ways it was very informative also.
5	1364774400	I love this book I would tell anybody I know that they should read this book. I amost think every man should read it.
4	1364688000	I don't have any sisters but I have friends that are sisters of my heart.This book is about the trials and tribulations of 3 women who beomesisters of the heart.  I loved how the three women evolved and howeach one was there for the other.Truly Sisters of The Heart
5	1364688000	Chose this book on a whim, not having read any works from this author. To my surprise, I got hooked. I found myself bummed to have to put it down and that much more excited to pick it back up.
5	1364688000	I do wish she would have tied in book one so we can see how they all are doing too.
5	1364688000	This is one book that once you start reading you want to finish before you put it down.  I love that the problems facing each women could be anyone you might know.  Looking forwarded to the next book
2	1364688000	I was on a long plane trip otherwise would not have finished this book. Very simple writing, predictable. What I dislike the most. The three main female characters seemed to have the same personality and vocabulary - NO DEPTH. Boring....will never buy another book from this author, sorry.
4	1364601600	When Andi Gordon is jilted at the altar on her wedding day, she escapes from Seattle to Blackberry Island.  There she buys a run-down Queen Anne house, where she plans to live and establish her new pediatric practice.  She soon finds that her new neighbors - Boston and Deanna - are also struggling with relationship problems.And then there's Wade - the construction superintendent for the extensive renovations Andi has planned for her new home.Three Sisters moves seamlessly between sorrow and laughter as the three women move forward, supporting and helping each other through their marital problems.  While Andi and Wade are the main protagonists, Boston's and Deanna's families play a major, well integrated role.Three Sisters has a natural feel.  Both their problems and the solutions are realistic; there are no contrived "coincidences" necessary to help the story along.  Any one of these women could be your neighbor - or new friend.
4	1364601600	It was like being there...beautiful scenery and wonderful relationships. I adored every character and was lost in their stories immediately.
5	1364601600	Very good book! I liked it so much I already downloaded another Susan Mallery book to read! You won't be disappointed.
4	1364601600	This book was very good reading;it's kind of a folksy book with no wild car chases or various murders happening.Perty much just a story about three family's with down to earth problems that just needed to be talked about.In doing so they found all people have close to the same problems that just need to have someone to talk with. Easy read
5	1364601600	I just loved how three people from different backgrounds were brought together.  I never read this author before and really enjoed the book.
5	1364601600	I loved this book.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  I loved the characters.  They were all women I could relate to and could emotionaly connect to.  There were really three stories in one, but they all tied together beautifully without any one outshining the others.  There were many times when I wanted to laugh and just as many times I wanted to cry.  I wasn't expecting a lot from this book thinking it would be a lot like the first book in the series, Barefoot Season, which was just so-so.  This book was much better.  Susan Mallery has become one of my favorite authors and this book just reconfirms that.
4	1364601600	Enjoyed reading this and learning about each of the characters...first impressions are not always the correct ones! As these women learn...a good escape
4	1364601600	I loved the characters and the ease of the story.  That I was never sure of the outcome made it even better.
4	1364515200	This has been another great read by Ms Mallery. I enjoyed being back on island and appreciated the complex characters.
2	1364515200	Somewhat disappointing but hey, not everyone sees the same thing. I'm sure there will be many who just love it! But me? I was hoping for awesome but find this book was just OK...
5	1364515200	Haven't read one of these fantasy romances for years - this one was a great, easy read - and of course you want their lives! A great novel to take you away from your life for a few hours.
5	1364515200	I've never read anything by Susan Mallery before. This was a great book. Right from the first chapter I was hooked. It's a great, easy read. Looking for more Susan Mallery books to read.
5	1364515200	Giving hope to real people that change is possible and sometimes rock bottom is the best start. Characters could easily have been people I know !
5	1364515200	There are three Queen Anne Victorian houses in need of renovation on BlackBerry Island, and three very different women who face conflicts in their lives. They are three friends walking separate paths which intersect. All face life experiences, occurrences that threaten to rip apart their lives. Emotional turmoil must erupt before healing can take place. The reader can easily relate to, and care for these women. This is a totally engaging book. Compelling and unforgettable.
5	1364515200	I like Susan Mallery's writing style very much.  There was a lot going on but she made it easy to follow.
5	1364428800	Loved this book. Great story and learned from it. Identified with one of the characters. Changed my personel life from what I learned in this book.
2	1364428800	Enjoy reading a more realistic story.  This  began with three women whose lives weren't close to  one you would envy, but by the end of the story you couldn't find a single detail that wasn't absolutely perfect  for not just one, but all three!
2	1364428800	Was it necessary to mention in every third chapter that Matt left her at the alter after 10 years together?  I think we all got it after the third time it was mentioned.  Matt was a jerk---he dumped her---she's trying to move on---we got it!Also, it didn't take long at all to see how this book was going to end.  I kept hoping there was going to be some twist and turn to add interest, but, just as I thought, the last chapter ended just like a movie of the week.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for Wade.
4	1364428800	I really enjoyed the characters in this book and the way their three houses were woven into the story. I really was rooting for all of these ladies to have a happy ending.  Couldn't wait to finish the book to see how things turned out for each of them.
4	1364428800	Great &#34;escape&#34; reading.  Started it on vacation and finished it tonight.  Kind of steamy in sections.  Easy to pick up.
5	1364428800	Loved this, excellent writing!  Would recommend to anyone who has ever had an issue bigger than themselves. Can hardly wait to read another of her books!
5	1364342400	This book was a very emotional read and touched me in a special way. For me the book hit home about real life problems that people have everyday. You never know what is going on in their home life and what problems they are dealing with unless you are willing to befriend them. Susan got the friendship right in this book along it wasn't to much and it wasn't not enough. Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who loves to read Susan's work.
5	1364342400	I loved "Three Sisters"! Deanna, Andi and Boston pulled at my heartstrings. I rooted for them, cried with them, laughed with them and wanted to be their friend. In spite of all if their problems and flaws you loved them. They were so Human with such raw emotion at times, fear, love, heartbreak. . I didn't want it to end. Thanks for the epilogue Susan.
5	1364342400	Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, it made me feel like I was there with the characters. Susan Mallery is one of my favorite author's even though I have only been reading her for a short time I haven't had one book that I didn't love and this one was not any different!!
5	1364342400	great book about 3 women and how they all deal with life and sadness an loss together as best friends

5	1364256000	I cannot waite for the next book to come outLove all of Susan Mallery's books.Romantic Island booksMakes one want to be apart of the story.
5	1364256000	Simply put this book is exceptional, it was a real surprise to find the twists in the final third of the book. I found the book to be very enjoyable and had great pacing and the story never seemed to lag.Susan has asked people to supply a list of actors to play the characters in a movie, I am still considereing my list.Way to go Susan.
5	1364256000	I loved this so much I just bought another Blackberry Island book. It shows us how vulnerable we can all be and how real friends can get us through it
4	1364256000	Enjoyable and fun.  Great characters with believable situations.  Not sire which one I liked best. Delightful, thought provoking and keep you interested until the end.
5	1364256000	Could read this over and over!! wanted more, LOved this book!!! Will read more of her work in the future!!!  Thank You!!!
5	1364256000	Each woman deserved her own book!  Great stories for all three women, but each story felt too rushed.  Very happy I read it but wishes there could of been more.
5	1364256000	I loved it and it really shows maturity in Ms Mallery writing .  I am one who does not give away plots lines but these three women are as different as they come but to overcome thier obstacles and forge and come together as friends and work through abuse loss and rejection and so much more.....
5	1364256000	I loved this latest by Susan Mallery. Great plot and characters. If you have enjoyed Ms. Mallery in the past, you will be very happy you got this book!
5	1364169600	A very heartwarming story. Loved the connection the three ladies had and the friendship they built. Can't wait for the next book in this series !
5	1364169600	I loved the characters and the setting.  Each woman had different personalities and their own problems to deal with but they came together to support each other like sisters.
4	1364169600	This is a story of three women from different background but all are dealing with the story of love and friendship and loss and recovery.  Heart break and recovery is a theme for each.  Susan Mallery always engages me and keeps me reading.
4	1364169600	Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales.Quick & Dirty: A cute contemporary romance about friendships between three women walking different paths of life.Opening Sentence: Being left at the altar is not for sissies.The Review:There are certain authors that I know will write strong women with realistic scenarios. This case, my go-to author was Susan Mallery. In the second book of the Blackberry Island series, Three Sisters captures the essence and differences of three women, while celebrating strength through their femininity. It isn't about "girl power" by any means, but instead Mallery tells the story about the different stages in someone's life. Mallery has always shown me the positive and negative sides of a women, and does it in a way that is enjoyable.Three Sisters is about three women who each have their own problems and hidden secrets. Andi was left jilted at the altar and moves to a town to start anew. In renovating a house into her new practice and her home, she has met Wade, who may be trouble for her heart. Boston has suffered a tragic loss, one a mother never should have to endure. She has not been able to move on, and for that her marriage is suffering. Deanna is misunderstood. Where she thinks life should be about perfection and assurance, her family thinks is cold and unloving. Her tragic past has caused an OCD that is unhealthy and may cause her to lose her family.Three different women, three different lives, but each one gravitates towards each other. Together, the help heal each other. Together, they laugh and love.Andi is the first character you meet, and is the strongest out of the bunch. She becomes the backbone of the story, in my opinion. She is easy to relate to; not only her life story, but mostly her newly found independence while slowly craving a companion. There's a shift in her life that happens when she meets Boston, allowing her to open herself up for love and friendship.Boston's story is the saddest. Being a new mother, I found the loss of her son to be devastating. Boston's outlet for coping is to recapture her son's face on an art canvas, over and over again. There's a stalemate that she can't get beyond, and it causes friction in her otherwise perfect marriage. There's a vivaciousness in Boston that is subdued by cloud grey's, and it's truly heartbreaking. To see her open up to anything else was tear-jerking.Deanna's story was the one that I didn't fully relate to. She grew up in a very unprivileged way, never having enough to eat or never having a clean place to sleep. She was removed from that situation, but with emotional scars. As she became an adult, she became OCD to many things, all habits from her adolescent life. Her family and herself do not understand each other, nor do they understand her as a person. Deanna hides her fears, always wanting to have the perfect picture family. I just couldn't connect to her, and I found myself skimming over her scenes.Mallery always tells a fluid story. I lose all sense of time when I read any of her stories, and I think that's genius. I was able to get lost in the details of the characters, the plot, and everything in between. Mallery makes connections to her readers, always knowing what we want to read. She adds moments of sadness, enough so to make me cry. But on the other side, she'll know when to balance that with happiness, giving you moments of relief through laughter.Mallery's Three Sisters is a perfect weekend read. With the warmer weather coming along, this is the perfect read to take with you on your weekend getaway. Love is a huge theme for Three Sisters, and I think you will feel the same way about it, too.FTC Advisory: Harlequin MIRA provided me with a copy of Three Sisters.  No goody bags, sponsorships, "material connections," or bribes were exchanged for my review.

5	1364083200	I'm never disappointed with a book from Susan Mallery.  Three Sisters was no exception.  From the first pages I felt connected to the characters and really didn't want to get to the end of the story.
5	1364083200	As all her books this too was terrific held your interest from the first page to the last. Susan has a gift of bringing the character and places  in her books to life. I always feel like I know everyone and could go there for a visit anytime. Can't wait for another book in this series or any she writes.

5	1364083200	It was inspiring and full of hope. Watching the characters evolve and overcome their obstacles was true to form. Loved
5	1364083200	4 1/2 stars - Enjoyed the corollation between the houses and their occupants.  Also enjoyed seeing them make changes to improve themselves and their families.
5	1364083200	Couldn't put it down.  Love Blackberry Island books.Story reaches out and grabs you.  People that you really want to find happiness.
4	1363996800	I really enjoyed this book - actually, had a hard time putting it down!  I had just finished reading three books by another author... much less substantial in character development/plot etc. than this one, making Mallery's story that much more enjoyable.I do have a criticism: the author was a bit repetitive in the use of certain phrases.  One example is referring to Wade's daughter Carrie as "the pre-teen".  There are a lot other terms she could have used - the general caliber of her writing style is quite good - why did she get stuck on that one term?  She could have said youngster, child, girl, etc. etc.  In a like vein, some of the self-musings of the main characters (about 4 or 5 times) sounded like Mallery had almost cut-and-pasted them from one section of the book to another.  I'm sure she's capable of better.  Or maybe some of the blame can be put on a not-so-competent editor??Really though, I did enjoy it, related to the main characters and felt sympathy for their problems.  Wanted to stand up and cheer when Deanna finally revealed herself to Boston and Andi.  Loved it as her relationship with her children improved!!  Gave a cheer when Andi rejected Matt's attempt to reconcile, and cried with Boston when she was finally able to.  A great story~~  :-)
5	1363910400	I really liked this book some unexpected scenes that made passion and longing a semi erotic read would read over again
4	1363910400	One of Susan Mallery's best books. Great mix of story lines. Loved the diversified group of characters. Delightful and enjoyable.reading.
5	1363824000	I loved this story as it let you into the lives and imperfections of each of the women in this story. A great book about &#34;feelings&#34;
5	1363824000	I just finished Three Sisters, I loved it!  I like it so much I took my time to read it and it was still over too soon.The characters are outstanding, well developed. Each with unique traits, and each strives to conquer the negative and shine with the positive.The three sisters are Victorian Homes that are on a hill by themselves, two are beautiful and one has been empty for some time and is in need of some love.  And love it shall receive when Andee buys it to get away from the city and a relationship gone bad and parents who fill she has not fulfilled her professional ability.The three owners are women, each very different, each with their own uniqueness and each has heart breaking events in their past they must overcome.Boston has lived on the Island her entire life and married her childhood sweetheart, her soul mate.  She has a beauty that shines and appreciated wisdom for those who surround her, she also has a very special gift of being able to make a canvas come to life and is able to put colors together that bring that life to any given surface. She is a very artsy person and her life and home exemplify this gift.  I should add she has a hunky hubby and equally hunky brother-in-law and an adorable niece.Deanna is, well perfect.  She is the kind of person that always has the perfect outfit on, every hair in place does the right things goes to the right places, has the perfect house, the handsome hubby and five yep, five children.  Deanna has rules strict rules, she expects everyone and I do mean everyone to be perfect.It's wonderful to see how these owners bring perfection, artistic appreciation and professional expertise together.  It also shows how each personality can contribute to a friendship if only given a chance.I have enjoyed Susan Mallery books, I love the Blackberry Island Novels.  Susan Mallery definitely has a gift to write and must say each time I read one of her books I like her more!
5	1363824000	I read this in three days... did not want to put it down. Can't wait for the next installment. Keep writing.
5	1363737600	Susan Mallory has shown again that her novels are full of reality and the people hiding behind the doors of the houses in our neighbourhood. You think you know all about them by what you see and how they act. But Susan shows us, excuse the pun, don't judge a book by it's cover. I suggest you read it and find out why.
5	1363737600	This book is chuck full of everything!!!  Love the three stories-so different but yet come together to help work things through and made friends along the way, ones that will last a lifetime. Hated for it to end and was soooo glad it ended the way it did. It could have gone three ways to Sunday! Loved watching the Dr. grow into her own, acually all three of the woman now that I think about it!! Susan yet again did not let me done. Great book to read at any time. Can't wait for the next book in this series of the Island. Also cant wait for more of her Fool's Gold Series.  I reread all her books.
5	1363737600	The author brings out the real problems in today's women, lets us know we are not perfect, but that is OK.  I loved the way the author took three different ladies and shown they all had the same problems.
5	1363737600	This book definitely met my expectations.  It's a story of the triumphs of three women with each other and with their families.  I loved the way the author brought the whole story together.  This book made me cry and laugh and I felt for each of the women.  Once I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
5	1363737600	Loved it and hope Susan writes more like this.  The Fools Gold series is ok but this is at a whole different level.  I enjoy stories that cover women's friendships and overcoming issues in their lives.  If you enjoy Wendy Wax and Kristan Higgins this one is for you.  The tissues came out a few times.
5	1363737600	This book by Susan Mallery is amazing!! She knows how to spin a story so that you can't put the book down until you are finished! You find yourself attached to her characters and wanting to see them all have a happy ending! You will keep coming back for more and you will not be disappointed! I highly recommend this book.
5	1363737600	This was an excellent book!  Fast moving, great characters and an excellenty story.  Susan Mallery writes excellent book - one you can't put down!
4	1363651200	REVIEWED BY LIZWe first meet Andi Gordon. She's just moved to Blackberry Island after being jilted at the altar by her fianc&eacute;. After paying all of the bills for the wedding that never happened, she's purchased one of the historic Three Sisters Queen Anne homes. OK, right there, I already like Andi. A girl who pays for her own wedding? And doesn't murder someone when the wedding doesn't happen? She's a better person than I am! Anyway, unfortunately for Andi, the house has been uninhabited for quite a while and it shows. Andi decides that by buying and rehabbing the house, she can also "rehab" herself. So she needs a contractor. That's where Wade King comes in, for BOTH rehabs! But Wade has his own baggage to deal with.Then there's Boston King. She's a very popular artist and is married to Zeke King, Wade's brother. They've been in love since high school and are still in love. But about six months ago, they had this horrible tragedy. Boston can't get past it, can't move on, can't do anything other than paint, draw or sketch pictures of her son, as a sort of therapy. Although I've never had an experience like Boston's, it isn't difficult to understand that the pain she's going through is unimaginable. The sections of the book that dealt with Boston and how she copes were not fun to read. And that shouldn't be interpreted as a negative thing because it's just THAT well written. The author gets you sympathizing with Boston (which is good) but how she's feeling is awful (which is where the not-so-fun part comes in). Her fixation on her drawings are awful as well, and it made me want to shake her, as if it would help somehow. Of course, it wouldn't help, but all of Boston's coping mechanisms are driving this huge wedge between her and her husband.Lastly, Deanna Phillips and her husband have their own problems. Deanna believes he's having an affair. Her daughter hates her, and she feels like she's losing the rest of her kids to her endless rules and perfection. But aren't rules good and don't they keep your loved ones safe? That's what Deanna is wondering. It's hard for her to be objective about all of this because she had a rough childhood where perfection was a requirement. She has grown up believing that she'll be loved and cared for if she's perfect. Clearly not a healthy way for a child to grow up. But Deanna doesn't see that she's doing the exact same thing to her own kids! Man, Deanna is really tough to like at first. She's so damn rigid and clueless! I think, though, that's why Deanna had such a great story arc in this book. Sheesh, by the end of the book, I loved her crazy butt! And even crazier? I loved her distant, jerk of a husband! I think Deanna had the furthest to go in her journey of self-discovery, because it feels like she honestly, truly does not see herself clearly and doesn't see that, in a way, she's recreating her own childhood. I loved her story. Just the sheer amount that this woman ends up changing is breathtaking. The best part? It may seem like she's doing it for her man or for her family, but really, she's doing it for herself. How can you not love that and root for her? I know I did, and Deanna was one of my favorites because of it.This book eventually won me over. At first, I thought I wouldn't finish it because it was so depressing. These three women are having all of these problems in their lives and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. But the last 40% of the story really made up for what felt like a dragging pace and unremarkable characters. Plus, it was pretty great to "watch" the friendship between Andi, Boston and Deanna grow and to see these women learn to not judge a book by its cover (ha, ha! Did you see what I did there? A book pun!).BOTTOM LINEAlthough I've realized that I don't love women's fiction, I still thought THREE SISTERS was really good. It's chock-full of drama, laughter and tears. There's not a ton of romance in it (which is why it isn't really my cup of tea - I love Sexy Time!), but the friendship that develops between the female characters is just awesome. And it's just a really well-written book. I would certainly read another one by the author, regardless of genre. If you like stories about healing and self-discovery, this book is for you.RATING: BNote: I received a review copy of this title courtesy of the publisher via NetGalley.
5	1363651200	For readers looking for a book of depth and emotion, Susan Mallery's Three Sisters is not to be missed.  Full review available at BookTrib or RomanticReadsandSuch.
4	1363651200	I love Susan and her books. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is because it took me a while to warm up to the story. I am glad i didn't give up, the story was totally wonderful and heartwarming.
5	1363564800	I loved the way the Three Sisters come together to be best friends/sisters, help each other heal & get their lives back together.
5	1363564800	This book by this author was truly a excellent book to the point you honestly felt you were there through the ups as well as the down, onto the next Blackberry Island book now.
3	1363564800	If you like romances, you would probably give this a higher rating than I did. That's about all this book is, a romance novel.
4	1363564800	This was my first Susan Mallery novel, and overall, I enjoyed it very much.  Following three women at different stages in their lives ensures the story moves forward while giving readers the chance to see the characters from different points of view.My few quibbles mainly concern Andi's storyline. She was left at the altar by her boyfriend of 10 years, something we hear about again and again and again as she oh-so-slowly gains perspective on that relationship.  She has, rather predictably, sworn off men.  Enter Wade King who makes her "girly bits" tingle. (Yes, it's a phrase we read often -- and in my case, at least, with less amusement each time.)  Andi's a pediatrician, though, and Wade's a contractor so misunderstandings ensue because apparently there's some kind of class structure on Blackberry Island that prevents them from having their happily-ever-after without some prerequisite conflict, drama and tension.Deanna and Boston's stories had more depth and tension.  Both characters grew through the course of the book.  I wouldn't have minded Andi's quite so much if it hadn't been the primary focus of the three.  While Andi buying the house was the catalyst for the book, there was nothing fresh about her story.I'll be reading more Susan Mallery in the future.  Her writing is fluid, and it's easy to get lost in the characters and the setting. I wish I'd seen a little more of Blackberry Island, but I look forward to my next visit.
3	1363564800	It was an easy read.  A good summer by the pool or beach read.  I liked and cared about the characters.  The storyline was predictable, but who doesn't like a happy ending?
5	1363478400	When I first purchased this book I thought wow three sisters living next door to each other that's got to be chaotic.  As I continued to read the story I understood how it is about three different women that are in different stages of their lives.  One is an married artist that has recently lost her son and has yet been able to talk about the tragedy with anyone not even her husband.  The other character is a pediatrician whom was recently stood up on the way to the alter and so embarrassed fleas the only home that she has ever known to start a new life.  As the story moves forward you realize that the reason she is able to move on so quickly is because she was so busy trying to be the person her mom wanted her to be that she didn't even know who she was so she wasn't even able to have a healthy relationship.  The last sister of the bunch I must say is the one I related to the most.  She is the one  I understand.  She grew up rough with an alcoholic, abusive single mother.Who took great pleasure in controlling and tormenting her as a child and now from the grave as an adult.  She is so busy trying not to be her mother that she doesn't realize that her five children can't stand her or that her husband doesn't even know if he even likes her let alone love her.  Throughout the course of the book you realize she makes it hard for people to love her because she has put up so many walls to keep herself protected that she doesn't understand that she doesn't have to hide anymore.  Will she break down those walls before every one she loves leaves or will she die alone, bitter and angry like her mother?As you might have figured these three women become friends and confidants to each other.  You learn throughout the story that their is never the perfect relationship, wife, friend, or husband.  All these relationships take work and you have to be willing to put in the work.  So readers put in the work and read this amazing story.  About love, tragedy, courage and friendship then tell me which side of the cul-de-sac do you reside on.
4	1363478400	I love Susan Mallery, but I think this book is a little bit of a change from her typical romance books.  There is romance here, but a lot more than that.  I was nearly in tears numerous times while reading this book, but it was still worth it.  The three main characters are great and I really enjoyed their stories.  I hope we can get another story from Blackberry Island soon.
2	1363478400	I'm usually a big fan of Mallery but this book disappointed me. Each of the three women in this story had some serious issues to work through and they were all conveniently solved by the enf the book. Don't get me wrong, I love happy endings but their issues seemed to need a more realistic timeline than the book allowed.
5	1363478400	This book was a very engaging page-turner for me. I stayed up way too late because I couldn't quit reading until I knew how everything was going to work out.Andi Gordon is jilted at the altar by a guy she had a relationship with for ten years. She decides to give her life a fresh start. She moves to Blackberry Island, buys a very run-down Victorian, and is having it remodeled to start her pediatric medical practice. After her previous fianc&eacute;'s behavior, she has decided to give up on love. But one of the contractors&mdash;Wade King&mdash; with his sense of humor and sexy body, could change her mind.Her neighbors in the other two Victorians on the top of the hill are Boston King and Deanna Price. Boston and her husband Zeke are having marriage issues because they lost their six month old baby to sudden heart failure and both are so lost in grief that they have lost each other too. Boston is an artist but all she can draw right now are black and white images of her baby son Liam.Deanna Price is going through marriage troubles too. Her OCD and her need to have complete control of her life have gotten so severe that she has damaged her relationship with her husband and her five young daughters.The stories of these three women and the men in their lives are intertwined in this poignant and funny story of love and friendship and loss and recovery. While I have never had any of the issues that the three women face, I could easily identify with and empathize with each one of them. My favorite character was Andi though. I liked her impulsiveness and her willingness to take a risk on love. I liked that she had learned to cope with never meeting her parent's high expectations for her.Engaging characters and compelling story lines give readers lots to think about. The book club questions in the end would lead to some very interesting discussions. I recommend this one highly.
5	1363478400	I am just amazed right now. I was iffy about the book but I love Susan Mallery, so I bought it. Wow!! I was drawn into each woman's story and emotions. I laughed and cried. I got mad and worried about how things would work out. This book is wonderful and I am so glad I got it.
5	1363478400	I just finished this book, and was sad to leave these characters. I will read this book again.  It's a book about women in crisis and how friendship helps each get through.  New friends, not life long friends. Friends who were very different.  A great story about the power of friendship.
5	1363392000	I loved this book. It drew me in from the very beginning, I couldn't put it down. The issues these women faced are so relatable, their pain so real, and I love that the solutions didn't come quickly or easily but gradually and painfully with setbacks along the way, just like real life. Another great read from Ms Mallery. I hope we'll see more of Blackberry Island in the near future.
5	1363392000	I read this just today, and loved it.  I actually was rooting for all three women at the beginning of the book.  I thought Deanna was a bitch, like the other girls thought until I realized why she was acting like she was.  It was a great ending to the book, how you were rooting for all these women and then you found out the news of why the women were acting like they were.  I liked that Susan wrapped up all the characters in the book, and even let us see Michelle from the first novel of the series, and how Deanna went to work for her, so that was good.  I really enjoy Susan's novels, I have read almost all of them and I an anxiously waiting for more novels from Susan.  She makes the characters lovable and relateable to all of us normal women out her in the world.  Keep it up Susan !
5	1363392000	I loved, loved, loved the second Blackberry Island book!  All three women were so lifelike, they jumped off the page. Even though I've not been through what they had, I felt their pain, as well as their joy.Susan Mallery, you knocked this one out of the Park!
5	1363392000	I'm a bookaholic, but I also have a full-time job, children, and other obligations. It has been a LONG time since I've read a book straight through in one day...until Three Sisters. I also usually have more than one book going at once. Either that, or I know the next three books I'm going to read (in order). With Three Sisters, it was different. I had a "book hangover"...where the book is so good you can't decide what to read next. It took a full day to recover and start a new book. Reading Tree Sisters and the recovery was an amazing experience!
4	1363392000	I love this novel and read it in one afternoon. Susan Mallery creates real characters with real life problems. These women and the men in their lives could be your neighbors. It helps to remind us that things aren't always as they appear and not to judge others. Also a great shout out to Maureen Child with the 'Kings of California' reference.
2	1363305600	The first sentence was a shock to my values. I read a little more but I was offended by pretty much the whole story line that I deleted it. I try to keep my mind from being defiled. Garbage in... garbage out.
5	1363305600	Easily one of the best books I have read in a long time. Even though parts of it are predictable - girl meets boy, etc. the background stories of the three main characters living in the three houses called Three Sisters, are most intriguing and keep you involved. The story shows us that we do not know what goes on in other people's homes even if we think we do and once you see yourself through other's eyes, you know there is always room for change. The three women living in the houses have very different lives, but soon find out that even if you live differently, there are a lot of things that are the same and they soon become fast friends and are there through thick and thin.
4	1363219200	I just finished reading Three Sisters, and really enjoyed getting lost in the story.While not really a deep story, it talks about moving from being strangers to friends, to sisters.  Women are that way, we all have friends, who we would defend like sisters.Each of the women have the baggage they carry from life, each has been "damaged" or hurt by living life, and has pulled back from relationships because of the pain.  As they get to know one another, they help heal the pain that life has inflicted on them, they become sisters by choice.It is a worthy book to read.  I hope you all enjoy it.
5	1363219200	A wonderful story of three women who live in three old Victorian homes on the top of a hill on an island outside of Seattle. Deanna owns and lives in one home. The nicest and most well kept. She is the mother of five girls and suspects her husband of having an affair. Boston owns the another of the three houses. She is an artist who has recently suffered through the death of her six month old son. She and her husband are both having difficulties dealing with their loss and are losing each other in the process. The third home and the one in the middle is in terrible condition. It been vacant for years. Andi Gordon was recently left at the alter by her boyfriend of ten years. She has bought the third house and plans on using the first floor for her Pediatric practice. The story revolves around all three women, their budding friendships, and their personal lives. The books is well written, with great characterization, family interactions, and romance. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from this author.
5	1363219200	I have read approx. 95% of the books Susan Mallery has written and this is the best so far. The characters are well developed and and suitable background info is provided to explain each characters foibles, also supportings characters that the main characters interact. She explains the effects these foibles have on other characters, sometimes with unusual consequences. A thoroughly compelling story that I couldn't put down! Can't wait until her next book!!!
2	1363219200	I wanted to like this book, but it annoyed me more than anything. The majority of the story is about Andi, and she was my least favorite character. She moves to get away from her relationship troubles and swears off men, and yet, the entire story is consumed by her obsessing over a man.Deanna is the most interesting character. She shows the most growth and real emotion, and yet, we hear the least about her.Boston does the same two things during the entire story- talk about painting a mural and defending herself to her husband.The most annoying thing is how the author keeps repeating information and situations. How many times do we have to hear the story of Andi being rejected? How many times will Boston's husband discover that she keeps painting Liam andthen walk out on her?There's not much dialogue in the story, so you would expect the limited amount to be profound and poignant, but it is just the opposite-cold and ordinary.I wasn't impressed.
5	1363219200	This is the second book in the BLACKBERRY ISLAND series by one of my very favorite, and prolific authors, Susan Mallery.This is a departure from her romances -- I would say it aligns more with women's fiction. I admit I hesitated reading her first in this genre, Already Home, because I associated many women's fiction books to be Oprah-esque. Frankly, I read too many very depressing books in this genre. But, I am so happy I gave Already Home a chance as well as the first BLACKBERRY ISLAND book, Barefoot Season.I thoroughly enjoyed THREE SISTERSIt's a fast read, with short chapters. I like this style of "pacing" in a book. The story weaves seamlessly through the lives of three women- Andi, Deanna and Boston, who live in the Three Sisters Queen Anne houses on Blackberry Island.I finished THREE SISTERS late last night. When I turned out the light and lay in bed thinking about the story and what I would say in my review...what adjectives I could use...I came up with the following; rich, poignant, heartbreaking, hopeful, moving, well-written, sweet, heart-warming, and eloquent. The list could actually go on but you get the idea, I'm sure.The characters each have "baggage" and the reader is quickly immersed in each of their stories. I didn't want to put the book down. The only negative thing I can say is the book is too short. At 340 pages, I doubt a publisher would agree, but when I am really enjoying a story, I become invested in it and I don't want it to come to an end. However, as with all books, this one had to end also.I usually HAVE to read books in the order in which they are written. (I'm odd that way.) In this case, while I did read them in order, I don't think it adds to the enjoyment. There is a brief mention of a couple characters from Barefoot Season in Three Sisters but it's subtle and not key to the story.I highly recommend this book. I have included the Amazon book description below.Barefoot Season (Blackberry Island Novels)Already Home
5	1363219200	Fantastic book, make sure you have time to read because you won't want to put it down.  Loved the character, can't wait for this series to continue.
5	1363219200	Susan Mallery is one of my favorites. I have never been disappointed in any of her books.  Timely topics and enduring characters.
5	1363219200	Amazon recommended this book and it was an excellent recommendation.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the story and how it is written.  Once I started it I found it hard to set down.  I highly recommend this book.  My thanks to Amazon for an excellent recommendation.
5	1363219200	It was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Susan Mallery did a good job of keeping your interest up.  I loved the romance and the friendship of the three women.
5	1363219200	Gives the reader an appreciation of the lives of three totally different women and how youcan learn through friendship you can overcome almost any obstacles in life
5	1363219200	A wonderful book about friendship, trust and dealing with so many everyday issues.  Ms Mallery does a great job with all these issues including some romance.This is a great series and I hope one that she will continue.
5	1363132800	Three Sisters by Susan Mallery is an amazing book. It tells the story of 3 women who are neighbors.  I loved their stories as they intertwined with each other. I laughed and cried and couldn't put this book down! If you want a story about relationships between man and woman, between women, with ourselves read this book.  I think that Susan is just getting better and better and this book is certainly one of her best yet.
5	1363132800	Curl up for a good read.  This book is perfect for  relaxing and getting lost in the lives of the three female characters.  They each grow, learn from each other and become friends. There are just enough chunky men to spice it up.
4	1363132800	Susan Mallery's Three Sisters, A Blackberry Island Novel, was such a pleasure to read. It started out a tad unfortunately (a bride abandoned at the altar) but it soon switched into a voyage of personal discovery for three women - Andi Gordon, the abandoned bride and pediatrician, artist Boston King, and Deanna Phillips, a "perfect" wife and mother whose life disintegrates before our eyes.The women all live in Queen Anne houses on Blackberry Island, in the Pacific NW - Andi buys the ugly duckling house in the middle, in desperate need of renovation and repair and yes, it's a metaphor for her life. She decides to set up a pediatric practice on the ground floor and live above the shop.The reader gets to know Boston and Deanna's husbands and Wade, Andi's contractor and new love. What I liked about Three Sisters is that each woman has reached a crisis point in her life: it takes internal strength to face up to problems but, as the phrase goes, it takes a village (or in this case, a sisterhood) to risk reaching for something more, even if the prize is not foreordained. With or without the men in their lives, these "Three Sisters" of the heart all arrive at a satisfying, hard-fought  place by the time the last page is read.
5	1363132800	Susan Mallery is one of my favorite writers. She reaches deep and gives emotional, relationship driven stories that are a cut above other contemporary books.  Three Sisters (and any other Mallery book) is well worth your time and money!
5	1363132800	Three SistersAnother compelling, cannot put down book.  This one touched my heart I think more than the first one because it was three lost souls who found more than their mates.  Each woman had a different issue that was so real I think everyone can relate in someway.  Change is never easy and I found myself rooting each of them on throughout the entire book!  Fantastic new series and cannot wait until the next one comes out!
5	1363132800	An excellent book. The story covers 3 woman and their current struggles. At first, I was frustrated because there was so much grief, but then the ladies became friends and started healing. Mallery covers lots of different topics in a clear, interesting way. This book made me appreciate my life a whole lot more.
5	1363132800	I have loved all the Susan Mallery books I have read and Three Sisters is no different.  Three Sisters is an emotional, heart warming story.  I look forward to reading more in the Blackberry Island series.
5	1363046400	This book captured my attention from page 1 and held it the whole day until I finished the book .... An amazing story which brings together 3 women who have nothing in common yet become "sisters" .... just goes to show that you do not have to be born sisters to share your heart.
5	1363046400	I started reading Susan Mallery's books back when she was writing Silhouette Special Editions, and once I got started I had to have everything she'd ever written. I continue to automatically purchase all of her books, but I have noticed that her style has changed over the years.  Now her books more closely resemble those by Debbie Macomber, what with the knitting and the female relationships.  I'm not a huge fan of female relationship stories - just give me a straightforward romance - so I nearly put Three Sisters down when I first started reading it.  It was so depressing!  But then I checked the reviews on Amazon and figured that because so many people gave it 5 stars there must be something redeeming about it.  So I persevered and plowed my way through the first third of the book.  Soon I was totally caught up in the story and couldn't stop reading until I had reached the end!  And then I wanted to start it all over again!  Susan takes the time to flesh out her characters and descriptions and really puts the reader into the story.  I felt like the ending was rushed, but perhaps that was just me not wanting the story to end.  I rarely give a book 5 stars, but I really feel like I got my money's worth out of Three Sisters.  Read it!
5	1363046400	I have read both of the Books in the Blackberry Island series and have really enjoyed both of them.I hope she is planning on continuing the series....I also like the included recipes using Blackberries.
5	1363046400	What can you say about a Susan Mallery book that hasn't already been said, but for a change, I listened to this book and it was just as good as reading it.  The book started out a little slow for me, but I wasn't quite sure if it was the book or the narrator.  However, about a fourth of the way through it, I was hooked, as my husband will attest.  I walked around with headphones on from my  iPhone for about 2 days.  Great woman's fiction with just enough romance and by the way, I identified more with Andi, rather that Boston or Dianna.  Susan asked that on FB last week.  Another great read from Susan Mallery
5	1363046400	Three Sisters (and the other book in the series Barefoot Season) has a slightly different feel from most Susan Mallery books.  The issues encountered seem a little more grounded in reality than most traditional romance novels.  I really like having the different voices/narrators through out the book, it feels like almost getting three books for the price of one.  The three heroines all have gone through personal tragedies (loss of a baby, marital problems and OCD, and the break up of a long term relationship and starting over in a new town) and are trying to learn how to deal with their new normal.  Mallery does a good job of mixing the dramatic and sad with humor and romance.  Very good read, but have some tissue around, its a tear-jerker.
5	1363046400	I fell in love with Blackberry Island in Barefoot Season .. Susan writes of the community spirit in locales that I find particularly interesting.  While I always like her books, I find Blackberry Island very intriguing.  The description of Three Sisters (the houses) and the women who became three sisters in spirit is well developed.  I kept thinking that I'd heard of Zeke and Wade King, the contractors, in previous novels.  Three Sisters is independent of Barefoot Season yet nicely brings together characters and locales into both books.  There is a little catch up on what people in the previous book are doing.  I like that.  I very much like this book and highly recommend it for a good read.  And after a bumpy start, Andi grew up and asserted herself; Deanna became a real person much to the delight of her family and Boston found her inner strength and retained her marriage.  Well done!
5	1363046400	I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I love SM's writing style. The emotional connection and character development in this book are inspirational. I liked that Deanna, Boston, and And I were such different people yet still found enough in common to build on. I loved how positive the flow was,even though you knew they were hurting and struggling, they never let it hold them back. This will go o my re-read list.
5	1363046400	This was such a heart warming story by Susan Mallery. The book will make you laugh and it will make you cry, but it's not your typical romance story. It is about the bonding of 3 women who you would never expect to bond, each woman battling her own personal demons and of course, romance.  It was an amazing story that teaches you, "to never judge a book by it's cover" and to fight for what you want!  A must read.  Susan Mallery is such an incredible author...I loved this book!
5	1363046400	Susan's books are always a delight and this one is the best so far.  It shows that true sisterhood is not limited by bloodlines.  It touches the heart and brings a smile to your face.  Just don't plan on getting anything done until you've read the last page.
5	1363046400	Three Sisters (Blackberry Island)I loved this book as I do all of Susan Mallery's books.  I usually buy the books in the store so that I can pass them on, but took advantage of the Kindle offering this time.  Could not put it down once I got started.I identified with Andi the most, as I am not perfect in my home life(like Deanna)at all, although others think I am because of how I am at work. I am a nurse, so that puts me in the medical field like Andi.  I am not at all creative like Boston, but am crafty.
5	1363046400	This is my second Susan Mallery book and like Barefoot Season it was great. It made me wish I had friends like this.
4	1363046400	I am a huge fan of Susan Mallery and thoroughly enjoyed this new title, which is book two in the Blackberry Island series.  I admit that though I did not particularly like all three of the main characters, I did care about them and the journeys that they faced.  To me, that proves what a talented storyteller Ms. Mallery is.  I would highly recommend this book and in fact have now hooked one of my best friends, who is currently reading her way through the backlisted titles, with the ultimate goal of reading this wonderful story.  I know she is thoroughly enjoying her journey as you will too once you start reading Ms. Mallery's titles.
5	1363046400	This is yet another wonderful book by the talented author, Susan Mallery. While I love all of her books, this one had more "depth" to the storyline, in part because three women are all going through a difficult time in their lives. They don't start out as friends, but by the end of the book they are great friends and have helped each other through their difficulties. Ms. Mallery made me laugh, she made me cry...I loved this book!
4	1363046400	I enjoyed the women in the story but was a little disappointed when I realized that only a few weeks had passed from start to finish. It seemed Deanna made an awfully quick recovery from all of her problems.
5	1363046400	There was nothing I did not like about this book.  Read it cover to cover as soon as I opened it.  I am never disappointed with Susan's books.  Always look forward to her new books!
5	1363046400	Didn't quite know what to expect but got pulled into the stories of the 3 women very quickly. I thought this would just build on the previous book (Barefoot season) but it simply mentions the two characters, which is fine.
5	1363046400	Absolutely loved this book.  I actually thought it would be about three women who were sisters, but not really.  However, it ended too soon.
4	1363046400	Interesting characters that support each other and confirm the need and importance of good friends in our life. Easy read.
5	1363046400	i am in the middle of the book and cant put it down. so far im loving it.i cant wait to finish it.
5	1363046400	Always a fan of Susan Mallery and she didn't disappoint with "Three Sisters"!!  I was crying one moment and laughing the next!!  All I can say is AWESOME and  I cannot wait for her next book in the Blackberry Island series and all others as well!!  You ROCK, Susan Mallery!!
5	1363046400	Character development is a particular talent of Susan Mallery.  One would think that Three Sisters refers to siblings but Susan's story is about three historic houses and the real people who own and live in these homes.  The owners include real women, Andi, Deanna and Boston.  They come from very different backgrounds and each with their own need for a more clear insight in how to live after the crises they face.  Andi is new to the neighborhood.  Her home is situated between two women; the bohemian Boston and the 'patrician' Deanna who barely acknowledge the existence of one another.  As Andi's home is rehabbed, so are the three women and I shall not say more because this is a MUST READ!
5	1363046400	This book is a shining example of why Susan Mallery is a master at her craft.  Each of the three women in this story were unique and captivating.  By the first chapter I had my mind made up about which character was my favorite. however as the story began to unfold and in the process revealing layers upon layers of the make up of each of the charachters i had fallen in love with all three of the women.  I don't believe in spoilers so I won't get into specifics but I will say each storyline is interwoven seamlessly with each other it is impossible not feel the emotions the characters feel.  A beautifully written tale of three women each on their own journey yet so connected to each other you feel as if you have been accepted into their family.
5	1363046400	I was not sure when I read the description if this really was a book I would enjoy. I wanted to give it a shot and had a long train ride ahead of me.I am THRILLED that I did.  How many times do we not take that moment to scratch beneath the surface of the people that we are associate with daily? This book hit home for me.I got to know each woman and understand her struggles. For me it all ended too quickly and I wanted more. That is a good thing...I wanted to know what happened 10 years down the road.Thanks for a great book.
3	1362960000	Normally I love Susan Mallery's books, her lighthearted romances are something I look forward to for my summer reading.  This is not one of those lighthearted romances, it follows the growth of the 3 main characters who are all at different crossroads in their lives.  Like usual it is a well written book, but if you are like me and a fan of the lighthearted romances more than the more serious women's fiction, this book may not be for you.
4	1362960000	First of all, I LOVE Susan Mallery and am always looking forward to her new releases. I have read every book in her Fools Gold series and thought I should try this series as well. These are more about everyday events that happen to ordinary people. There are times when I just want to slap the characters for the choices that they make, but then, that is what makes them realistic. This is an awesome read for a rainy day in.
5	1362960000	Loved the new novel Three Sisters A Blackberry Novel by Susan Mallery.  She has done it again.  A story about three diffrent women who take a second look at there life and decide that in order to have it all they need to change or risk loosing everything.
5	1362960000	A great read that made me laugh and cry! The story unfolds around the lives of three heroines, Deanna, Andi and Boston.  Each women is going through their own struggles in life; the support and friendship that each woman provides  reminds me of the joy and power of true friendship. This novel is a must read and make sure you read it with your friends!
5	1362960000	Susan Mallery has done it again!  Put three women together with three houses in a row, and what do you get?  An emotional read that you will not be able to put down.  The main characters: Andi, Deanna and Boston are experiencing various difficulties in their lives and trying to stay sane.  Grief, pain from the past, and ditched at the alter is only the beginning.  Will these women survive and become sisters of the heart?
4	1362960000	The book was a nice read and kept me intrigued. Great vacation novel. I want to read more about the sisters.
5	1362960000	I loved this book. It was a heartfelt story that made me feel like I was really there. I laughed and cried while reading this book.
5	1362960000	I have read every book she has written!  I love her writing style and how she brings all of her characters to life!  This is one of her best!!
5	1362960000	I've read other Susan Mallery's books but this is the first of book of the Blackberry Island series that I've read. I totally loved it! I'm going to go back and read the first book in the series soon. Don't want to give anything away but at its heart this is a story about friendship. I'm going to be recommending this book to all my friends! If you haven't read it be sure to get your copy now!
5	1362873600	This book couldn't have come at a better time for me.  The three women in the story are very realistic- they could be any woman who has found herself "starting over" whether by choice or circumstances.  Susan wrote a powerful story about friendships that are forged between the unlikeliest women.  I felt inspired after reading this book and have passed it on to several friends.
5	1362873600	Wonderful story of friendship between three women, all at different stages in life, encountering different situations. This story will have you laughing, crying, and examining your own friendships with the women you consider sisters.
5	1362873600	I loved reading Three Sisters by Susan Mallery, what I hope will be the second book of a new and exciting series of Blackberry Island. Like all of Susan Mallery books, I can relate to the characters and how they deal with family, friends and love.  Susan shows us that not all relationships work all the time and how they can get back on track with the help and dedication of friends.  I envyed some of the get togethers that Andi, Boston and Deanna had whether they were having wine and cheese or chocolate, a bond was formed between them that will last.  By adding the Blackberry Inn to this story, I'm hoping we can look forward to Susan's next book on the island soon.ThrThree Sisters (Blackberry Island)
5	1362873600	Susan Mallery did it again. She wrote another great story. I get so involved in her books, I don't want them to end.
5	1362873600	This is another best seller by Susan MalleryWhen you start reading the book, you find Boston King, Deanna Phillips + Andi Gordon in different stages of their lives.Each one dealing with different types of pains.  As you continue to read, you suffer along with each of these characters.You start to see their inner demons + their inner strenght as well.  You start pulling for them.  There must be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.Then everything start to come together.  Andi finds love w/ Wade King.  Deanna reconnect w/ her husband, Colin.  They reconcile.  Boston is able to finally move away from the pain of losing her son.  Boston + Zeke are able to hold on to each other after all.Boston, Deanna and Andi also find strengh in their friendship.  Through it all, they supported each other no matter what.  They were not born sistes, but in their hearts they were sisters.
5	1362873600	I chose to review this book because of the author, Susan Mallery.  She is an author who never disappoints.  I can read anything by her!  I wasn't as enthusiastic to read a "chick lit" book, but I said, "Hey, it's Susan Mallery, so it's bound to be good."  I'm so glad that I did, as I absolutely loved the book!  I did go back and read the first book in the Blackberry Island series first, and it was really good too.  I liked that although the books are related by geography, and the two main characters from the first book made a brief cameo in the second, the books can stand alone completely by themselves.Three Sisters refer to the three Victorian houses which stand on the highest hill on Blackberry Island.  Two of the homes have been in families for generations, while the middle home has fallen to neglect and disrepair.  At the beginning of the book, new comer to the island, Andi has purchased the middle home, which she plans to renovate into a doctor's office and living space.  Andi is a pediatrician from a family of overachieving doctors, who consider her a "slacker."  To make matters worse, she was recently left at the altar by her boyfriend of ten years!Andi meets her neighbors Zeke and Boston King first, as Zeke and his brother Wade own King Construction that is doing the renovation of Andi's house.  We soon learn that Boston and Zeke have lost their son of 6 months to a heart defect and are still trying to recover from the loss.  Boston is an artist who can't produce any new art, except for pictures of her precious lost son, and Zeke has turned to drink.On the other side of Andi are Deanna and Colin Phillips and their five daughters, the youngest two being twins.  Deanna seems to be the epitome of the perfect wife and mother, and she is, if all that entailed was feeding your children only homemade organic food and making sure that their clothes are clean, tidy and matching.  On day Deanna comes across a photo on her husband's phone which leads her to believe that he's having an affair.  It's not true, but the confrontation allows Colin to express his unhappiness in their marriage.  This unhappiness stems from Deanna's OCD as a result of an abusive childhood.  Deanna is not very well liked by others, but I believe this is because she doesn't realize that she has OCD, so she sees everyone else as having the problem, not her.  After all, she's perfect...What I liked most about this book is the way Susan Mallery took three completely different women and brought them together by finding common ground.  I liked the fact that at the beginning of the book these women really had no history between them.  Boston and Deanna are neighbors, but didn't really know each other.  As a matter of fact, they had no desire to get to know each other!  Each had their own thoughts and misconceptions about the other.  I think the coming of Andi really bridged the literal space between their homes.  It was like that run down house in the middle really kept them apart.I recently suggested Three Sisters as a book club read to the group of gals with whom I meet.  I told them about how there are even suggested discussion questions at the end of the book!  Susan Mallery never fails to pull a plethora of emotions with her stories, and this book was no exception.  I laughed; I cried; I got mad.  I LOVED IT!
5	1362873600	Yet another great story by Susan Mallery. Once again Susan has created a story that pulled me in, with great characters and a great location. The title refers to three houses known as the Three Sisters, located on Blackberry Island, and centers on the occupants of those homes - Andi Gordon, Deanna Phillips, and Boston King. After being a messy end to her engagement Andi moves from Seattle to Blackberry Island and buys the middle 'Sister' - which is in need of much TLC, just as Andi is. Susan takes us (the readers) through not only the renovation of Andi's house, but also the renovation of Andi, Deanna and Boston.Be sure to read Susan's first book set on Blackberry IslandBarefoot Season (Blackberry Island Novels)Another not to be missed example of Susan's storytelling genius.
5	1362873600	This is the first time i have ever written review. I really like the easy flow in which Susan Mallory writes her stories and this one was no different. I  enjoyed how she took three women with issues women face Every day and showed us how amazing and strong they are.
5	1362787200	Three different women from three different walks of life are brought together into a sisterhood in this very compelling book.  I absolutely loved this book.  I loved it so much that I read it in one afternoon sitting.  Susan Mallery has a way of drawing her readers in and keeping them captivated in the character of her books.  All three women are at different stages in their career, love and life.  They are brought together by being neighbors and develop a wonderful sisterhood to help each other during this time.  It remind me of my friends who are more than just friends, they are my sisters.  I laughed, cried and was very happy with the way the the book ended.  There is an inner dialogue that Andi (one of the women) has at the end the book that just spoke to my heart: &#34;A house she's bought impulsively, with the idea that if she could fix the house, she could fix herself.  From that day to this she had figured out how to let go of the past, she'd fallen in love, learned that maybe she didn't need as much fixing as she'd first thought and discovered that sometimes sisters were made, not born.&#34;  I would highly recommend this book.
3	1362787200	I love the premise of three old historic homes and three different lives playing out in each, but the story and character development was unlikely. I think Ms. Mallery is a talented writer, though, I kept reading even after I was impatient with how things were developing.
5	1362787200	Amazing reminder of the power of friendship!  Girlpower and an ecosystem of the forces that try to bring us to our knees!
4	1362787200	This is a true story of friendship and redemption. Three women at different places but all struggling to get a grip on life.  I expected a continuation of the first novel but the characters from the last Blackberry Island book were only mentioned in passing. Maybe we'll catch up more with them later.  It wasn't my favorite book that Susan has written but I was still unable to put it down once I started.
5	1362787200	This book certainly put a new spin on the meaning of &#34;sisters&#34;.  I liked the development of the characters individually and then how they affected each other.  Wonderful story lines and in particular how Deanna and Boston overcome their seemingly impossible situations.
5	1362787200	Wow!  This book was amazing.  I loved it.  I have been reading Susan Mallery books for years, always enjoying the light, fun romances with the happy endings.  This isn't one of those.  This book deals with real life, serious issues.  It makes you laugh and makes you cry.  It makes you think.  You want to cheer for the three main characters as their friendship evolves and they support each other through some very tough issues.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to the third book in the Blackberry Island series.
5	1362787200	Susan Mallery has outdone herself in her latest novel! The story is wonderfully written and draws you in, until you don't know what hit you. It makes you feel like you are right there with the characters, and with each one struggling with their own issues, it's hard not to find a relatable issue to two. Amazing story, concept, and execution! A must read for all!!!
4	1362787200	Three Sisters, the latest novel by Susan Mallery is about three women who live next door to each other in three side by side Queen Anne style homes on Blackberry Island in Washington state.Andi is a pediatrician who has just survived the humiliation of being left at the alter. She puchases the vacant &#34;Sister&#34;, a run-down, ranshackle affair that she plans to fix up to use as a combination home and office. Deanna and Boston live in the other two &#34;Sisters&#34;; beautiful old homes that they have lived in them since childhood and now occupy with their families.This book has a &#34;you can't judge a book (or in this case, occupant) by it's cover&#34; theme. From the outside, all three women seem to be happy and have it all together but in reality, they are each on the verge of their own emotional collapse and are fighting to stay sane and hold on to the lives they want to live. How they come together and save each other by being there for one another proves that in the end, the women are the &#34;Three Sisters&#34; of the title, not their homes.Mallery does a great job revealing the depth of each character and how each woman's circumstances in life have contrived to become her own personal hell -- and the strength and support it takes to survive, overcome and eventually triumph.This story truly illustrates the blessing of good friends. Three Sisters is a testament to what people can do for each other when they are willing to face their demons, bare their souls and find the love and help they need.In the spirit of full disclosure, I received this book free from the author in return for reviewing it, however this review is completely honest and entirely my opinion and no one else's.
5	1362787200	I rated Three Sisters a 5 star because of subject matter and the fact that I could not put it down!  Three Sisters is a well written story of betrayal, loss and healing.  Friendship can sometimes be more meaningful than bloodline sisterhood with Andi, Deanna and Boston truly fortunate to  find a special bond more enduring than if they had been siblings.  Each character had her own demons to face and each woman came out on the other side with a wonderful understanding of true friendship.  Enjoy!!!BarbaraSoCal
4	1362700800	Characters were flawed as we all are but very loveable.  While it was sort of about the houses, it showed that what is seen from the outside is not always the way it really is.  Wonderful humor.  I have found out it is so healing to laugh at yourself!
5	1362700800	I really enjoyed this book and can just envision how beautiful Blackberry Island is.  The 3 houses which are referred to as 3 sisters are so differently decorated and cared for as are the people who live in those houses.  It is a great example of always thinking someone else's life is better than yours.  The 3 women who seem very different from each other are pulled together by circumstances in their life and discover how they are really similar and help each other grow.  It starts out slow but once I got into it, I wanted to get home from work to read.  You know everything will work out in the end but it is the process of getting there that is interesting as everyone needs to continue to grow and change in life.  The story reinforces how important friendships are in our life.
5	1362700800	This book had all the wonderful elements that I look for in a great women's fiction book - believable female characters, romance, conflicts and resolutions that all ring true.  I immediately got sucked into this story and had a hard time putting the book down.  I especially liked that we got to meet the three characters on their own and had their stories developed before the friendships came into play.  I love that it's part of a trilogy and we got to briefly revisit characters from Barefoot Season too.  Can't wait for book #3!
5	1362700800	Three Sisters is the second book in the Blackberry Island trilogy, but could also stand on its own.Once again Susan Mallery has pulled together an incredible novel with the interconnected storylines of the three main characters.  It is story of friendship, hope and healing while exploring issues that the reader can relate to.  I think I saw a little bit of myself in Andi, Deanna, and Boston.An absolutely brilliant novel that will inspire laughter and tears!
5	1362700800	Characters so real they admit their dislike for a neighbor, so humane they set aside their own problems to help a person they didn't like, and compassionate enough to get to know the real person behind the facade and learn to care about them and learn more about themselves!
5	1362700800	Another five star reading! From the first page to the last page it kept you going. A well written story of new friendships,lost love,new love and starting over. It made me smile and see a little of myself and my "sisters" in the story. But dont forget the tissue you will need it! A must read!
5	1362614400	I am a big fan of Susan Mallery, so I know I have to adjust my calendar when a new book comes out.  I simply cannot put down her books! This wonderful story of three women, their homes, and their lives is truly amazing.  Susan has created a thoughtful tale involving love, dysfunction, loss and forgiveness.  As you read Three Sisters, you somehow feel you are right next to the characters, and cheering them on tofind their way.  As i finished the last page, I thought it can't be over.  Pick up this book and  plan to lose track of time as you meet the Three Sisters.
5	1362614400	When I start a new Susan Mallery book, I make sure I have plenty of time to read, since I often lose track of time.  Once I started Three Sisters I just fell into the story and time flew by.  The characters could be people I know, facing real life problems and I can't wait to see how the story ends.  Three Sisters celebrates friendship between women, even when it appears in the most unlikely of places.
5	1362614400	I really enjoyed Susan Mallery's newest series!!  Each of the three main characters have real life issues to deal with.  Each came from a place where they wanted to make changes in their lives to make themselves happier.  Finding new friends right next door was a bonus none of them thought would happen. I love the romance in their relationships and small town feel of where they live.  I am looking forward to seeing where Susan goes with this new and exciting series.
3	1362614400	It's always a little awkward for me when I give a review that goes against the mainstream of the majority of other reviews. It makes you wonder "am I missing something here?" But you have to call them as you see them and while Three Sisters was good, it didn't live up to the hype for me.First, what I did like:  Susan Mallery is a great author and really, she can get you inside the head of a character better than almost any other author I know. She did a great job with this in Barefoot Season with Michelle who suffered from PTSD and she does it again here with Deanna and her OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and with the very intense feelings (or lack of them actually) Boston has after the death of her infant son.  I think Andi, Deanna and Boston are all accurately and thoughtfully portrayed and I can always appreciate a well drawn character. The setting is gorgeous and the kids are a great addition to the story.Now, what I didn't like:  The real meat and potatoes of this story is when the three women finally come together to make this small, supportive circle of friends but this doesn't occur until slightly more than half way through the book. Every time the three women got together to discuss their problems, I felt like the author glossed over the issues instead of having real, in depth conversations that could have been rich and rewarding for the reader. I fully expected Andi, Boston and Deanna to build a stronger bond than they did, as if they were sisters. They appreciated each other for the opportunities they had to get together, drink wine and vent their frustrations, but I never sensed that this moved to the level of true affection and commitment that the title of the book implies. I was hoping they would be sisters of the heart, but it felt more like they were sisters of convenience. Also I have to agree with another reviewer who said the ending wrapped up a little too quickly and cleanly, especially for Deanna.Three Sisters is a good book written by a great author but it just didn't move me as I had hoped it would. Maybe you will fall under the majority of people who were thrilled with the book, or maybe not, either way I think it's worth your time to discover its value for yourself. And I'll just continue to call 'em as I see 'em and hope that this review helps somebody out there...somewhere...
5	1362614400	I loved this book. I couldn't read it fast enough! I loved all three women and couldn't wait to discover what was at the root of their problems and how they would fix them. I saw a little of myself in all three women. Very well written, but I didn't expect anything less from Susan!
4	1362614400	I love Susan Mallery and I always gravitate to her books.  Although Three Sisters is not the type of book I normally read, I was really pleased with it. The characters were interesting, complex, and believable.  A Must Read!  I highly recommend it!
5	1362614400	Three Sisters by Susan Mallery will take you on a journey of self discovery as three women realize that the things that make them so different from each other is what draws them together. The second book in the Blackberry Island saga is even more moving than the first. Can these three women let go of the ghosts from their past and find their way to the happiness that they deserve? This book brings out the full spectrum of emotions as you get to know these wonderful strong women and share in their daily lives on Blackberry Island. While, this is the second book in the series, it is not necessary to read the first in order to fully enjoy this one, but I do recommend it! So pick up Three Sisters and a good hot cup of coffee and settle in, because once you start you won't want to put it down! I can't wait to see what is next in store for Blackberry Island!
5	1362528000	I really enjoyed the Three Sisters.  Great story about friends and becoming "family".  I would highly recommend this book.  Thanks Susan Mallery!
5	1362528000	Even though the story is emotional and heartrending, it is a story of hope and renewal. In this departure from her usual wonderful stories, Ms. Mallery takes us on a journey of loss, growth, and identity between three very different women. I cried and laughed. 5 stars!
5	1362528000	Absolutely couldn't put this book down....so real and believable in a 'been there, done that' sort of way. Sisters of the heart are the only sisters I will ever have and Susan Mallery has put into words exactly what that means and how that feels!!!!  Have already recommended this book to all of my reading friends!!!!!
4	1362528000	This book is not like her Fool's Gold Series- Susan has written this book based on reality! I really like how she has incorporated issues that some of her readers may relate to ( e.g. lack of communication in the relationship, mistrust, finding out who "you" are/want to be, etc) while also incorporating her trademark "romance". I highly recommend this book!
4	1362528000	I like that Susan Mallery has taken her books to a different level. With Almost Home and Barefoot Season, she has moved out of a strictly romance genre and into fiction. Her characters have flaws that make them seem more real.  I think I identified most with Deanna.  Keeping up a facade that everything is cool to the rest of the world while inside you are falling apart...I'm sure so many women can relate because we try to be supermom. I couldn't put the book down and finished it in two days...which is kind of sad because I know it is a while before her next book comes out:(
5	1362528000	What can I say, Susan Mallery doesn't disappoint ever!  This series is just as good if not better than her Fools Gold series.  I enjoyed this book so much that I went back and re-read the first book in the series.  Her characters are well rounded and the story line has enough twists that the reader isn't bored.  Needless to say I am a fan of her work and will continue to buy everything she writes.
5	1362528000	This is the first Susan Mallery book I have read, and if her others are anywhere near as satisfying, then I'll be a fan for life. Her characters had depth, flaws and personalities that made me like them, pity them, envy them, at times hate them, but in the end admire then as they sorted out their problems. From the moment I started reading I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down and to be honest I was a bit disappointed to find myself suddenly at the end as I'd so much enjoyed watching their journey. Overall an immensely satisfying read and one I'm happy to recommend!
4	1362528000	I am a fan of Susan Mallery.  When ever a new title is released it is on my must by list.  Her books are always filled with warmth, laughter, and sometimes tears but they are always worth the read.  Three Sisters is no different.  This is the story of three friends who support each other through their various struggles.  The characters are written in such a way that you are drawn into the story and care about each of these women.  These are women who you could picture as your own friends and/or neighbors.  This is not a book that you should start reading unless you have some time to devote.  Once you start, you will be drawn into the story and become involved in the lives of each of the characters.  As with all Susan Mallery novels, I usually don't start them until Friday so I know I will have the weekend to finish.
5	1362528000	I anxiously awaited the release of this book, as I do most of Susan Mallery's books. I was not disappointed!!  Read it in two days as I keep wanting to see the friendships, relationships and love evolve. Very worthwhile read. Now I have to be patient and wait for her next book!
5	1362441600	After just finishing Barefoot Season, I was quite skeptical and even a little upset when I found out that this book was only continuing about Blackberry Island and didn't include Michelle and Carly, the main characters of the first book in this series. I was also a little aloof reading the description wondering what could possibly be so great about a book about three houses called the Three Sisters. Let me be the first to say that I was sorely WRONG about everything!Immediately upon beginning the story, I found myself excited to learn about Andi, Boston, and Deanna. I think that Susan Mallery has such a wonderful gift when it comes to opening up a story and just being able to draw the reading in from the first few words!I have read some complaints about the layout of the story, but I am actually quite fond and think I would almost rather read a book in the layout such as the one Mallery chose for this book. I find that it keeps my interest peaked more so than just reading one whole book about one or two characters. For those of you that may not know what I mean, Mallery chose to break this story down into three sets of relationships/couples. There seems to be a bit about each set of characters in each chapter, and I loved that! I thought that this writing technique kept the book flowing smoothly.I found that the characters were so real and in depth, with true life problems and situations that many readers may identify with, and I truly admired that about this book. That is mostly what kept me reading, was the fact that even though it was a story, I felt like it could be a real story. Of course everybody wants a fairytale life, but the reality is, that most of the time, such a life doesn't exist, and I truly believe that Mallery depicts that with her writing. I felt myself being able to identify and empathize with the characters, all the while each of them growing on me more and more with each page that I turned.Once I had forgotten about the characters of the first book and began becoming entralled with the characters of this book, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mallery nonchalently reintroduces the first books characters and provides a quick little update on the progress of their lives. I look forward to see what's going to happen next on Blackberry Island and also look forward to continuing to get a glimpse in the lives of each character that Mallery has built in Blackberry Island.This book did deal with real-life intense issues and I felt that Mallery wrote about them beautifully. I like the fact that even though she provides you with romance, it is real and heartfelt, not something cheesy that you could never dream of happening! I have certainly found a new favorite author of mine.I have to give Ms. Mallery and her publishing team the greatest thanks for allowing me to be a part of her Review Crew and providing me with an advance copy of this amazingly spectacular book in return for my honest and unbiased review!Bring on some more Blackberry Island!!
5	1362441600	I loved Three Sisters (book #2) in the Blackberry Island Series! It was heart warming, compelling and true to the way I've come to love Susan Mallery's writing. The "Three Sisters" were so different yet so alike that made me want to read more of them. It was hard to put the book down. I found myself thinking of the characters while doing other things wondering what was going to happen next. I know when I pick up a Susan Mallery book I won't be disappointed and this is no exception. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!
5	1362441600	I really loved this book and read it as soon as I received it. It's about friendship, relationships and family and it shows the struggles that people go through to make things work. If you've never read a Susan Mallery book before I'd recommend it...if you have I'd recommend it! It's different then her straight romances but it still has her style of writing that makes you want to read more.
5	1362441600	The three sisters are Victorian houses.  But, in a very real sense, three very different women become sisters of the heart, in this well-written book.  I laughed, cried, sighed and learned to love each of these woman.  You will find great depth and detail in this lovely book.  I've loved all her books, but, I think this may be my favorite.  There was a character I thought I could never relate to, that I learned so much from.  A recommended read!
5	1362441600	Susan Mallery has done it again! This is a great book about starting over, making changes for the better, and making lasting relationships! The three sisters all find their perfect love story at different stages in life! Highly Reccommend! :)
5	1362441600	Loved this book! I got sucked right into the story from page one and could not put it down!As with most of Susan Mallery&#8217;s books, I laughed, I cried and could not wait to see what happened next.The relationships that were built between these three women and each one&#8217;s personal story was captivating! My heart just clenched for each woman with every heartbreaking moment through this book.Don&#8217;t miss out on reading this great story!
5	1362441600	I had to keep reading through. Couldn't "put" it down ( or whatever you say about Kindle editions). Love all of Susan's books. Not everyone can make me laugh & cry while reading!
5	1362441600	I love this book. I was chosen to read and review this book. I was pleasantly surprised to find my name as the name of one of the main characters. Each of the women that own the houses has her own demons to tame. As with any good book this is accomplished in record time. Interesting that the characters each judge the other before they actually get to know each other. This is a life story book with a happy ending. I have to say this book will become a permanent part of my library. I will read it again.
5	1362441600	I really liked this book.  It makes you laugh and it also makes you cry. The three  women are very different, but they form a tight bond and help each other overcome difficult situations in their lives.  Susan Mallery's books are always a must read for me.
5	1362441600	Once I started reading this book I could not put it down!! I love Susan Mallery books and this is one of my Favorites!! I love how the book takes you through 3 different women lives and their life struggles. Not only are finding who they are but they also find true friendship! I can not wait for her next book!!  Great Job Susan Mallory on another fabulous book!!
5	1362441600	This book was WONDERFUL!!!  The story is amazing and tells how people really can change and over come almost anything given the power of friendship and love.
5	1362441600	Three Sisters had me hooked from the start and as the story blossomed I found myself turning pages faster and faster.  This story brings together three women who even though they are not related they become sisters of the heart.  We are given the privilege of getting to know three women and their struggle to grow and to learn to love and live happily ever after.  I applaud Susan Mallery for once again taking me to Blackberry Island and look forward to visiting again in the future.
5	1362441600	I could totally relate to so many parts of this book! I couldn't wait for the release and as always Susan came through! This was one of those books that when I knew I should put it down and go to sleep, I would say just one more chapter, then it was the first thing I picked up in the morning!Susan's books never let me down! Thank you for sharing your creativity with all of us!
5	1362441600	Three Sisters has to be one of the best novels by Susan Mallery by far. It's not what I'm used to reading from her (romance), but that's what makes it so much better. She's able to capture so many emotions and experiences in this one novel and draw the reader into the lives of these three very human characters. I can't wait for Mallery's next books!
4	1362441600	I enjoyed this book immensely.  It starts out slowly, but soon immerses the reader into the lives of  three diverse women living in three equally different Queen Anne houses (The Three Sisters) perched on the highest point of Blackberry Island.  The only reason I didn't award it 5 stars was I didn't feel the characterizations were as rich as I usually find in Ms. Mallery's bppks.  That being said, it's a great read and I highly recommend it.
5	1362355200	I preordered this book but had to wait to read it. I'm so glad I did. It was one I just couldn't put down! It seemed as though there is something everyone can relate to within this story. It makes you laugh, cry and just feel good!Its a book I would hughly recomend...and it really does deserve those 5  Stars!  Susan always delivers a great read!
5	1362355200	Once again Susan Mallery has woven a wonderful story about 3 strangers who are neighbors who are different in many ways but come to rely on each other to solve problems - these women become the best of friends who share their lives with each other and with the reader.  I'd love to see a continuation of the lives of these three.
5	1362355200	What a fantastic book! I absolutely love the blend of humor and heartache. Every character in this book came alive for me. Each character had issues of some sort to work out, yet it was done in a way that wasn't cheap or cheesy. Kudos, Susan Mallery excellent job!
5	1362355200	Three Sisters is the book that makes me wish there were more than 5 stars to give.  There hasn't  been a book that  Susan Mallery has written that I didn't like but I alsolutely love this one.  The charaters feel so real and you feel a kinship with them almost from the start.  I love seeing this serious side of Ms. Mallery and can't wait for book 3.  If you are looking for a story that grabs you, feels real and has you rooting for charaters don't hesitate to get this book.
5	1362355200	Another great book by Susan Mallery.  Romance, heartache, a few tears and lots of wonderment about the outcome.  All characters trying to get over one demon or another and all facing different problems.  A MUST read for those who love romance stories.
3	1362355200	Overall I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others. At different times I did not like the main characters. They all took turns making decisions that made me want to reach in and slap them. If they get that kind of a rise out of me then I guess it would have been a boring book. I also liked the subtle ties to the first book in this series. Each book is almost a standalone but then a character will appear from a previous book. I really like series like that...when basically the town is the main character not a person. The person will change with each book.
5	1362355200	What has Andi gotten herself into!  After getting left  at the alter by a boyfriend of 10 years,  she buys an old house that needs to be gutted to be livable, finds out one neighbor draws pictures of her dead baby and the other neighbor grows her own food and doesn&#8217;t let her kids watch tv! But the contractor &#8211; oh-la-la is he a hottie, but is commitment phob!All this on one street in Blackberry Island! As the &#8220;neighbor ladies&#8221; cross paths, they find out they are all broken and need each other to keep moving forward.I liked this book because it wasn&#8217;t as predictable as I thought. There are issues of loss and mental illness that I never really considered- like &#34;Is there a standard grieving process?&#34; And when do you know you need professional help if you don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re in trouble? The story also shows how friendships are built and grown and not automatically assumed.
4	1362355200	I finally got &#34;Three Sisters&#34; yesterday and started it immediately. It started out slow, but quickly picked up and I didn't want to put it down when it was time for sleep.  I can't wait to finish it tonight after work.
4	1362355200	This is a book about the growth of three women after experiencing tragedy. This books is a testimony to friendship and each character's ability to come through tragedy. Like other reviewers, I would label this book as a more serious chick lit/women's fiction read vice a fluffy romance. There are serious issues, difficult choices and tearful exchanges that will tug at the heart. In the end the reader is uplifted by the unfailing resolve of the human spirit to not only continue moving forward but to ultimately triumph.
5	1362355200	I really loved this book. It makes you feel as if you are part of these ladies lives. The story line is really great. I loved how all three ladies had a problem and they all helped each other over come their problems. I just love this book. I think it is one of my favorites.
5	1362355200	First, I want to mention that I received an early copy of this book as part of Susan Mallery's Review Crew; however, this does not influence my review.I absolutely LOVED this book! Such an amazing book!! I wasn't sure at first if it would even compare with the first book (Barefoot Season - LOVED it too!) in the series, but it was even better! The beginning is a little slow as it sets up the plot and describes the characters, but after that it really takes off. For me, the book was very emotional as each of the 3 main female characters dealt with their struggles. Very emotional, very sweet, & very real. There is some romance in the book, but that isn't the main focus as it digs deeper & showcases several different types of relationships. A very lovely book.I really think this would be a great book for book clubs because there are so many points to discuss. Whether you're a fan or not of Susan Mallery, I definitely recommend this book - you'll love it!
5	1362355200	Three Sisters had me hooked from the first page. These are women with whom I'd like to be friends. Each overcame adversity to find love, friendship and most importantly, herself.  I can't wait for the next Blackberry Island novel!
5	1362355200	I loved this story-it made me cry and cheer as I followed along in the lives of  Andi, Deanna and Boston. It is a story of the ability of people to overcome challenges through friendship. And it shows that just because you think a person's life is perfect by your standards and what you see, it doesn't mean they aren't struggling with something. I can't wait for more Blackberry Island stories from Susan Mallerthey will definitely be on my to-be-read list.
5	1362355200	I just loved this book.  I picked this book up to read one evening and could not put it down.  I read straight through to the end.  This is not a romance book.  It is a story of friendship and finding your sisters at heart.  I found my self wishing I lived on this street with these three.  This book will make you laugh out loud and shed tears with the three heroines of the book.  They have all encountered troubles in their lives and are all at different stages of the healing process.  This book takes you through the emotional up and downs as they all begin to form their friendship and heal.  It also shows you that you never know what a person is truly like until you get to know them.  I did enjoy the romance in the book because I am a hopeless romantic but the best part of the book was the bond and friendship that these three formed.  All the characters in this book were so real.  It was amazing how human and flawed all the characters were in this book.  This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  I have recommended it to my book friends and I will be re-reading this book soon.I was sent this book give an honest review on by Susan Mallery as part of her Review CrewThree Sisters
4	1362268800	I love to really get into a book.  This was one of those stories that make you feel like you are reading about good friends, sharing their joys and sorrows.
5	1362268800	This book was absolutely heart touching.  A perfect story of what happens behind closed doors that nobody knows about.  The perfect on the outside image and shattered on the inside.  Some of the moments are very sad, but it sends a powerful message!  Great work Susan!
5	1362268800	This book is simply awesome.  It has depth and character development and a happy ending.  The three main characters are all very different and each one forces you to look at yourself to see if you fall into any of the same traps.  I loved the romance, because I'm a hopeless romantic, but I loved the relationship between the three women and how it develops.  Just like in real life, their relationships were messy and complicated.  I started this book thinking that it might not be my cup of tea but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  I read this book straight through and at the end, I wished that there was a sequel so that I could keep reading about these characters and their lives.  This book is definitely going on my to be re-read shelf.In the interest of full disclosure, I am a member of Susan Mallery's review crew.
5	1362268800	I loved these flawed characters and how they finally were able to work through it all. This book has got to be the best one Susan has written. I laughed, I cried and couldn't put it down until I finished it. Didn't want to see it end. This book left me feeling good, satisfied and optimistic that we humans can conquer anything as long as we want to and do the work to achieve it. Love, love, loved it!
5	1362268800	This is an awesome book, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down!!The Three Sisters in the title refers to three Victorian homes on Blackberry Island, but by the end of the book the ThreeSisters refers to Andi, DeAnna and Boston, who are the main characters that live in the houses. All three of these ladies carry emotional baggage and are going through difficult times in their lives. Friendship between the three develop slowly but all are there for each other other when they need a friend.This story had me laughing and teary and made me realize how blessed I am to have wonderful "women" friends in my life.But this book you won't be disappointed!!
5	1362268800	Susan Mallery has done it again, she writes a loving, heartwrenching got to get them type of book all the time.  Her Black Berry Island books are sure to leave foot prints on your heart and longing and desire running thru you.  Next up in her line of happiness and love Fool's Gold series this year.
5	1362268800	Three houses. Three women. Three stories that sizzle with emotional intensity and come alive on the pages. Andi, Deanna and Boston are as different as their houses, but Mallery creates rich stories in THREE SISTERS for each that took me on an emotional roller coaster. There are no easy outs for any of these women, but the friendship they forge is unforgettable, as the next steps each takes in her life journey. There's a quality about this book that is both dark and magical--there are plenty of unhappy moments, but how the women respond will have you rooting and pulling for them. The love, laughter and tears reminds me of Anton Chekhov's play by the same name, but Mallery's heroines are able to grow and change, finding their way to happily-ever-after in a book that's definitely going on my keeper shelf.
5	1362268800	Loved this book! This series is so different than Susan's others, but just as beautifully written.  In the beginning i was judging the characters as much as they were judging each other.  I ended up loving all the characters and feeling for them as much as one could.  They are all such normal people with normal real life issues that when written about in such a way that Susan has done has made it seem that anything can be overcome.  You will love these characters and learn something about yourself in the process. Great book
5	1362268800	Loved this book! Am now ordering the first book in series and cant wait for the third!!! Have most of Susans books and cant wait for more!
5	1362268800	My rating: 5 of 5 starsThree Sisters by Susan Mallery is women's fiction/romance novel. This book is scheduled for release in early February and is published by Harlequin Mira. Three Sisters - the beautiful, Queen Anne style Victorian homes on Blackberry Island house, three completely different women and families at various stages in their lives. As the story opens all three residents are going through very rough periods of their lives. Andi had her life all mapped out. She lived in Seattle, had her career as a doctor and was about to marry Matt, the man she had spent the last decade with. Then Matt jilts her at the alter in front of 300 friends and family, and leaves her to deal with the aftermath. Andi also has to deal with her over achieving family when she suddenly leaves Seattle and buys a two hundred year old Victorian home that will have be completely renovated. But, Andi needs a fresh start. She wants to be a pediatrician and the island is in desperate need of one. So, Andi is determined to put men, sex, and romance out of her life forever and focus on helping kids. But, her sexy contractor,Wade, keeps distracting her from her "no more men" policy. The home on Andi's right was beautifully restored, with a perfect garden and landscape. Deanna and Colin live here with their five daughters. On the outside it looks like the perfect home and the perfect family. But, looks can be deceiving. Deanna believes her husband has been having an affair. When she confronts him, Colin takes the opportunity to let loose on Deanna about how unhappy he is with their marriage and how miserable she makes their children. How dare he? Deanna works hard to be the perfect mother. No regular TV- PBS only, no sugar, no seconds at dinner, etc.  Her rules are strangling her marriage and her children. Suddenly, Deanna feels like the outsider in her own home. Not to mention the fact that she has put off most of people on the island and has no friends or family to turn to for a shoulder to cry on. The house on on the left is also restored. Zeke and Boston have lived on the island all their lives. It was love at first sight for Zeke and Boston. They had been in love and very happy until a horribly sad tragedy upended their lives. Now the once strong and happy home is crumbling rapidly and it looks like it may implode permanently unless they can both find a way to cope with, then accept what has happened and move forward with their lives. This is an emotional story of how three women are coping with difficult and overwhelming situations. It is also a story of how these women forge a friendship despite their differences and first impressions. Some of the women bonded from the start, but other got off to a very rocky start. As they began to confide in each other, they learned to lean on each other and support each other through the good moments and the bad. The subject matter was hard to deal with at times, especially with one of the stories being so very, very sad. In each of the stories the men were often a bit too selfish or not supportive enough. One obviously could have helped more by addressing the need for medical intervention, but these men were also suffering as well and were doing what they could to cope, even if it wasn't always the right way to cope. None of these characters were without their flaws, which is of course what makes the story real and believable.The only weak story line, for me personally, was with Andi's guy, Wade. Wade had some reason to feel like he did, but I thought he took it way too far and wouldn't listen to Andi when I thought she was being quite honest about everything. He was too cautious and too sensitive about their differences. Even though the situations these women faced were monumental, in the end we are filled with hope and encouragement. We feel the power of love and friendship and community and come away with the knowledge that these three couples are on their way to the next chapter of their lives with the worst behind them and bright future in the front of them. Adult subject matter, sexual situations/content, mild language. Overall this one gets an A.I got this book from Edelweiss for an honest review.
5	1362182400	Ever stayed up all night because you were reading a book you could not put down?  Three Sisters was a book like that!  The relationships shared by Andi, Boston and Deanna were very true to real life.  Sometimes you meet or hear about someone and just dislike them without having met them.  Susan Mallery brings real life experiences into her books and connects them to her characters.  The stories of each woman were what made the book hard to put down.  I laughed, cried and turned each page in anticipation of what would happen next.  I can't wait for the next book in the series!
5	1362182400	I can always count on Susan Mallery for the best books.  Thank you!!  I will be recommending this to my friends.
5	1362182400	I love this book!  It embraces women, their life struggles, and the value of friendship.  Susan Mallery has once again written another series that allows you to feel like you know her characters personally.  I finished it in one day, since I wanted to see where the characters lives would end up.  Cannot wait until the next part of the this series is published.  I wait for her next book to come out with anticipation.
5	1362182400	i loved this book. it was hard to put down. it is the story of 3 women whome become friends and learn nothing is as it seems. through there friendship they learn to work the the problems they are having. i felt like i really understood each person and what they were going through
5	1362182400	I read a lot of books and have most of the books by this author. This one is definitely one of my favorites.  Great themes and I enjoyed the evolution of the characters throughout the book. The characters made a lot of changes from beginning to end and I enjoyed reading about the challenges they went through. It's fun to not like a character at the beginning and realize that they are not what they appear and end up rooting for them.  Good life lesson as well.  A great read about family and making friends that help create supporting family when there doesn't seem to be any. If  you like Susan's books, you'll love this one.
5	1362182400	I absolutely loved Three Sisters! Susan Mallery has done it again! When I started reading this book, I was pulled into it immediately! The three women of the Three Sisters are so realistic I felt like I was right there with them. The true to life struggles that each is going through that seems to be tearing at them becomes what pulls each of them together. They learn to let the past go; laugh, to begin to live and make their way towards the future with new friendships, as special as sisters. I could feel right along with them laughing, crying and feeling a joy of newness! So emotionally touching! This book is one I will most certainly be reading again! Thank you again for a job well done Susan Mallery!!
5	1362182400	I love Susan Mallery's books and this one reminds me of me and my friends so much. Never a day goes by that I don't wish my best friend and I didn't leave right next door to each other. The bond of friends is powerful and seeing the relationships on this book grow along with Andi's new life was a joy to read.
5	1362182400	I am an avid reader and count Susan Mallery as one of my favorite authors.  Although this book is not as light as some of her other work, I found it to be engrossing from the first page and read it in one sitting. I anxiously await her next book.
5	1362182400	Another fantastic book by Susan Mallery. I have never been disappointed with any of her books. Reading Ms. Mallery's books is like going back home.  Her characters and writing style make it very easy to loose yourself in the world she has created. I hope that she continues the Blackberry Island books as a long term series and not just a trilogy. Look forward to reading Ms. Mallery's next release in May-have to love preorders.
5	1362182400	What a wonderful story of friendship and healing.  The three main characters were well developed and their stories interesting.  I didn't want the story to end.  If you haven't read the first book in the series, Barefoot Season, you will find it equally inspiring.
5	1362096000	I think Susan Mallery did a remarkable job with Three Sisters. Once I started reading, I couldn&#8217;t put it down-even into the late hours of the night.  I was definitely impressed with the development of the characters throughout the novel, captivated by the story line and touched by the women and their individual struggles.  When I reached the end of the book, I was a bit sad that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to tag along as Deanna, Andi and Boston continued their journey and their healing.  The relationships between these three women certainly reminded me of the wonderful women I surround myself with today, how we met, became &#8220;sisters&#8221; and how much I appreciate them every single day.  One of Mallery&#8217;s best books yet!  I highly recommend Three Sisters!
5	1362096000	This is a great book.  I loved all three stories about the 3 women. It was great how they all became friends even though they each had different issues.  Highly recommend this book.  It was a quick read for me.  I love all of Susan Mallery's books.  Can't wait for the next one!
5	1362096000	Once again Ms Mallery has brought us a wonderful escape to Blackberry Island.  This book was definitely one to lose sleep over.
4	1362096000	Such a wonderful read! I was captivated by the characters and pulled in right away! I didn't want to put the book down, but unfortunately I need a pay check! I loved that it wasn't a book centered on romance but there was still some in there. Seeing the mistakes and fortunes of these newly found three sisters is so realistic, and I found myself relating to a lot. I was laughing, crying, and screaming at the characters. One of my favorite books I've read so far this year. The only reason I give it a 4 is due to the ending. It was a great ending but I feel that it all came together too quickly. I probably just didn't want the book to end yet, but it just seemed like everything fell into place too fast. I would have liked to have a little more time with everyone! I suppose I'll have to wait until the next release! I have a feeling I will be reading this series again year after year!
5	1362096000	Another homerun for Susan Mallery, Three Sisters is great.  It's amazing how three women with different interests can come together and form such a strong bond with each other. Can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.
5	1362096000	Three Sisters by Susan MalleryThis book is about family and friendship and exposes the reader to the struggles/efforts to maintain both.While the story starts a bit slow...the pace picked up and suddenly I was hooked...I read this book in one day.I was so involved with the characters...I laughed when they laughed..and cried when they cried. There aren't many authors/books making me feel that way.I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a feel-good,  pick me up book :-)I was sent this book to Review by Susan Mallery as part of her Review Crew.
5	1362096000	This will go down as one of my favorite Susan Mallery books.  I love the way Susan can tell a story and create characters that I get to know in just 340 pages.  I read the book in 2 days, she pulled on all my emotions, and when I layed the book down I was sad the story was over.  A GREAT read!
5	1362096000	Review featured on [...]5+ StarsLIVE ~ LOVE ~ LAUGHThese are the best words to describe the ladies of the houses known as the Three Sister. One friend needs to learn to live again after the death of her baby. One friend needs to learn to love and trust again after a relationship ends. And one just needs to learn how to laugh and not take life so seriously.This is not a story of romance (but of course there is some). However this is a story about love. Learning to love yourself and the women who have become your friends. Each story is told only from the female point of view with three different yet intertwined stories. They are heartbreaking and emotional. The stories leave you sad, angry, happy and renewed. The women that Susan Mallery has given us are so different that at first I thought I wonder which one of these women I will relate to and I found I somehow related to all of them in some way. I was the woman left with a broken heart wondering if I should or could love again, I was the woman who had lost something so incredibly special I wondered if I could be whole again and I was the woman who had done everything to be the woman I was supposed to be and was not sure if it was enough. I think every woman has been these women at some point in their lives. No, not all at once but over time and years.These women were so poignant that it was hard not to feel the emotions of each as I read their stories and finally decided to just stop trying to fight the feelings and embrace them. I cried, I smiled, I wanted to be at their table having wine and giving them my opinion of what they needed to do.This is not Fool's Gold. This is real life encompassed in one single book. How Susan Mallery got through the writing of this book with all the emotions she poured into it I will never know but I am glad she did. I am a better person for "knowing" these three women because I see myself in each of them and realize every woman should spend more time LIVING ~ LOVING ~ AND LAUGHING.Disclaimer:I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
5	1362096000	I have read lots of Susan Mallery's books, and enjoyed them.  I think this is the best of hers that I have read.  Her books are usually light-hearted and humorous, though never (happily, for me) silly or slapstick.  This book is deeper, with characters you don't think you'll like.  Ms. Mallery shows them, explains them, and the reader watches them grow and change.  There are still chuckle-out-loud moments, and you are left with the feeling of, &#34;Wow!  What a great story!&#34;
4	1362096000	Going in, I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.The story is told from the viewpoints of three women, at varying stages in their lives, each dealing with their own emotional baggage.I felt that the characters were well written - in the beginning I was annoyed and frustrated by one of the characters, but as the book went on and she began to grow and change my feelings regarding her also did.This book is part of Susan Mallery's new series, but this book can be read independently, which I liked.  Too often it feels like characters are thrown in books just so you know it's a continuation of a series, but not with this one.  The brief mention of characters from the first book in the series felt real.
5	1362009600	I loved this book. It was a fast read, but with the depth and feeling of a great story. It was easy to become quickly invested in the characters and hard to step away. Although the women had been through and continued to go through a lot, it was not depressing, because often, as things got worse, the women got closer to each other and closer to finding themselves, so as a reader, you were happy for their journey. Definitely recommended.
5	1362009600	This book is not a typical Susan Mallery story.  Instead of focusing on a romantic relationship between two people, this book focuses on a sister-like bond that forms between three women.  There are romantic aspects to the story, but they are not the main focus of the book.  Overall, the was a great story and I would encourage others to read it.
5	1362009600	If you love the dynamics between women who have nothing in common on the surface but are sister in their hearts you will love Three Sisters.  Andi, a pediatrician, was left at the alter after a 10 year relationship, Boston, an artist, is suffering from the loss of a child and Deanne,a full time mother and part time craft store employee, is seeing her family move move away from her.  Andi comes to Blackberry Island to open her own pediatrics clinic in one of the Three Sisters, a trio of Victorian houses.  Her house, along with her life, needs a total rehab.  While Boston's house is restored to a funky, artistic version of a Victorian she is dealing with artist block. Deanne's house is perfect but can anything truly be perfect?  See how these three woman come together in friendship to help each other overcome obstacles they never thought they would deal with.
5	1362009600	When I got this book, I thought I would read a few pages before going to bed.  Needless to say, I didn't put it down until three hours later when I had finished the book :).  This book covers some difficult issues, and I love how the characters' lives start out so different and end up so entwined.  I also like how the emotions in this book are real (both the humor and and sorrow), and Susan Mallery doesn't gloss over the healing that these women go through, which makes the book seem very realistic.  This story will pull you in at the beginning as you explore the relationship these three strangers form through the book, with each other ... and their significant others ;).  If you are looking for a gripping emotional story with enough humor and love included to keep it lively, I suggest you pick this book up....but make sure you have time to finish it before bed, or get ready to lose some sleep finishing it!
4	1362009600	Any book that Susan Mallery writes I have to read. She is a fantastic author, with the ability to draw you into the story and it's heartfelt. This time, in Three Sisters, there were 3 stories, about 3 amazing women, perfectly woven together to creating an emotional ride. I don't like to give spoilers in my reviews, so all I will tell you is that I highly recommend you read this book. You can't go wrong with a Susan Mallery story, they are pretty much perfect every single time!
5	1362009600	As a reader who has only read Susan Mallery's Fool's Gold Series I didn't know what to expect with Three Sisters. I started Three Sisters  after dinner and couldn't put it down. The story was engrossing and had me laughing, crying, and celebrating with the character's and left me excited for the next book in the Blackberry Island series. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a feel good read.
2	1362009600	I was very disappointed in this book. The first half was somewhat depressing given all the significant problems the three women were experiencing and then the second half saw the problems all being resolved relatively quickly with everything tied up in a bow.  I'm normally a fan, but not this time.
5	1362009600	This is a book that every woman can relate to in one way or another.  It's a story of three women who each seem to have it all together but all are dealing with their own personal struggles.  Andi, a pediatrician, just uprooted her whole life because she was left at the altar.  Deanna seems to have the perfect home, husband and children but is really a broken soul.  Boston is struggling with the loss of a child and almost loses her marriage in the process.  It just shows that looks can be deceiving.  These three friends come together and find the healing that friendship and acceptance can bring.  I highly recommend it.  Susan Mallery does it again!
4	1362009600	Discovered Susan Mallery last year. Have enjoyed all the books I've read. This book was a little longer but the three different story lines made it interesting. Some humor, some sadness makes you take a look at life. Friendship is such an important part of our lives and we sometimes take it too much for granted.
5	1362009600	Susan Mallery writes with insight and truth about women's friendships in today's world.  She portrays very accurately the masks we adorn trying to survive and measure up to our standards imposed by society or ourselves while giving up peeks behind the whys of the masks.  In &#34;Three Sisters,&#34; Susan allows us to see behind these masks as the masks are crumbling to reveal the real person with all of her strengths and weakness.  As these masks dissolve, friendships are formed between the neighbors who previously wanted nothing to do with each other.  This book is written with humor and we share in the joy of these women's friendships as they begin, grown, and cement.  I am looking forward to Susan Mallery's next book.
5	1362009600	Totally loved this book!  I really like her new series of Blackberry island.  The three women, Andi, Deanna and Boston, are incredible.  I like how Susan uses the three houses (how they look and feel) as metaphors for the three women.  It was a great read! I would highly recommend this book.
5	1362009600	I absolutely could not put this book down!  I have read all of Susan Mallery's books and love them all, but Three Sisters is by far my favorite.  If you have never read a Susan Mallery book, this one is a great introduction to a wonderful author. Susan introduces us to Deanna, Boston and Andi and the struggles they are each going through.  Each character is on her own journey of healing, but their journeys bring them closer to each other.  Three Sisters is a book I will reread many times!!!
5	1362009600	I have to say, I loved this book.  I knew I was going to love it within the first few pages.  I had a hard time putting it down as I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next for each of the women.  They each had their own problems and were all very different, yet found a way to be friends although not necessarily right away.  While each woman had their own weaknesses and faults, they were women who found the strength and determination to overcome their obstacles.  They dug deep and found who they really were.  This book made me laugh, cry and have hope.  It was very well written and I look forward to more books in this series.  Three Sisters is very different from Mallery's other books, but in a very good way.
4	1362009600	Although I have loved all the Susan Mallery books especially the "Fool's Gold series", it took several chapters before I could begin to get excited about this book. I found the jumping from character to character to character within the same chapter confusing and hard to follow in the begining and wished that the author would have spent a whole chapter on just one character. Don't get me wrong......as usual Susan's characters come to life and you start to feel as if you know them and are living through their stories with them. Believe me I went through a lot of tissues reading this book and once I finally got into the story I didn't want to put it down. Although there is romance in each of the lives of the threemain characters, romance is not the main focus in this book which deals with three old Victorian houses sitting near each other on the top of the hill on Blackberry Island and the three women who live in them and become like "sisters" as they help each other live through the joys and sorrows of their lives. It is a beautiful reminder of what true friendship is all about.I would urge you to start to read this book when you have several hours available to allow you to get into the story before taking a break. Be warned that you might not want to put it down until you finish.
5	1362009600	This was a wonderful book.  Three different women, three different houses.  The women get to know each other and become fiends.The ladies all have problems with men and together are able to bring their lives together.  The women bring different things into their friendships and discover that even though they are different they are alike also.  It was so nice to read how women can come together and work things out.  I could even see the images of their homes. As always Susan Mallery did a good job with this book and can't wait to read the next in this series.
5	1362009600	Three sisters is the story about 3 Victorian houses with 3 very different woman living in them.  They are each going through their own emotional whirlwind and seem like such an unlikely group to form a friendship.  The pain and uncertainty they each feel helps them get through such difficult times in their lives. The character's story brought so many emotions to the surface that I felt like I was part of their group.  They made me laugh and cry.  This was yet another beautiful book from Susan.  I would highly recommed it
4	1362009600	This was a feel good novel and sometimes that's just what you need. I really liked the characters. They weren't constantly misinterpreting one another's it some books. These were strong female characters so dealt with their problems the best way they knew how and with the help of each other. Also, it was set on an island in WA where I live, so I'm biased. Recommend to any woman who could benefit from this type of book.
5	1361923200	I rated this book 5 stars bc it was hard to put it down. It wasnt all romance but it definitely has a great story line. Cant wait for the next one!! Keep up the great work!
5	1361923200	Liked the first book in this series.  Really enjoyed this one. Nice characters, interesting issues, good character development and, of course, a nice little romance
5	1361923200	I loved this story about three women who each had challenges in their lives.  Each woman different, each with different issues. Yet they overcame their pasts/issues with the help of the others and the men they loved. It's about sisterhood between friends and I loved them, laughed with them, cried with them and identified with each of them. Ms. Mallory wove a heartwarming story of love and friendship.
5	1361923200	Last night after I picked up my copy of "Three Sisters" it literally never left my hand until the very last page had been read. As with others who have read and reviewed this very fine tale of life on Blackberry Island, I laughed and cried and loved right along with Andi and Boston and Deanna . Deanna's character was, the hardest for me to sympathize with  as I have someone in my real life a lot like her though not fortunate enough to have 5 wonderful little girls but I loved the way Susan enabled her to break the cycle and come out on the other side of the crisis much stronger and a lot more loving. I've never had to go through what Boston did but it was and still is ,my worst nightmare to lose one of my three precious daughters and again, Susan nailed it I believe . Now Andi was simply wonderful and isn't it amazing that sometimes  some parents, when they become grandparents, finally learn to  relax and just enjoy the true joy of children. So, should you buy  the book, and I believe you will, you will fall in love with the citizens of Blackberry Island just as I have and "Three Sisters" will become a treasured tome in your house  as well!
5	1361923200	Wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down.  Finely drawn characters.  I think this may be Susan Mallery's best work yet.Can't wait for the next Susan Mallery book.
5	1361923200	I love the saying &#34;I smile because we're sisters, I laugh because there's nothing you can do about it!&#34; I never imagined seeing that saying come to life as vividly as it does in Three Sisters. Andi, Boston, and Deanna, three women who form the bond of sisterhood, not by blood, but by discovering they are stronger than they think by helping each other survive some of the darkest moments of their lives. They are much like the three old homes, The Three Sisters, in which they reside. Works in progress, made stronger and brought back to life with a little love and support. In one of the deepest stories and most realistic characters by Susan Mallery I've read, you quickly learn, some sisters are born and some are made. You'll enjoy every moment of the story!
5	1361923200	Another awesome Susan Mallery book.I loved the way Susan intertwined the three separate heroines lives.There stories are believable which makes you want to laugh and cry with them.This will be a re-read for me.
5	1361923200	Susan Mallery once again brings us characters who are dealing with serious, life changing issues.  It was a joy to follow them discovering they could be whole, once again. She melds hardship, friendship, love and a great location as few others can.  I truly enjoyed this book.  It's a keeper!
5	1361923200	Heartwarming story of three strangers who, through life's struggles and challenges learn to lean on eaach other and build life-long friendships along the way.  I laughed and cried along with the main characters and even personally connected with Deanna in the book.  A MUST READ!!  I guarentee you will not be able to put this book down until you have read it all!
5	1361923200	Three Sisters was an excellent book. Once I started the book, I was unable to put it down. I felt that I was there on Blackberry Island watching how everything turned out. Three Sisters has become my favorite book by Susan. I was emotionally moved by the trials the three women were going through-it all felt so real. This book by far is Susan's best written!! I can't wait for the next book!
5	1361923200	"Three Sisters" reaffirms that Susan Mallery is an auto-buy for me. I loved this book. It is more of a Women's Fiction novel than a Romance but it still has that happily-ever-after that I need. It is the story of three very different women in different stages of their lives and their loves. The three main characters live in three houses next door to each other. The state of their houses reflect the state of their lives. I admit that one of the women was very hard for me to like in the beginning of the book but by half way through, she had snuck into my heart and I was rooting for her.If you like novels that delve a little deeper into the characters and their friendship but still has that romantic touch, you, too will love this book.
5	1361923200	Such a great story to remind us that there are times in life when you need girlfriends to help you get through the tough times...and to remind us going it alone is never the answer...everyone needs help at one time or another along life's journey!  So touching you won't want to put it down!
4	1361923200	This isn't a romance novel, it's a becoming friends novel. Two of the women are in marriages already, and all three women have come to a point in their lives where their relationships have hit either a low point or ended. The beginning of of the book was a little confusing, and at times I would have liked a little more detail about how the two couples got to that point. But, it's a good book. Interesting read, it's the second in it's series but it stands alone.
5	1361923200	Every once in a while you pick up a book expecting one thing and experiencing another.  That's what Susan Mallery delivers in Three Sisters.  Three Sisters is a story about Friendship and Love.  Actually, it's three stories woven together; three stories of healing, friendship and love.  The book centers on three very different women, each "broken" and seeking healing.  Through their friendship, they begin to recover; and through love, they become whole.As always, Ms Mallery has created characters of great depth.  They are more than "realistic"...The six main characters somehow blend the best and least desirable of us; those we are, those we know, and those we love.  Real people with hopes, dreams, fears, imperfections and tragedies...somehow they're wonderfully and compassionately represented in a superb work of fiction.
4	1361923200	Three Sisters was a wonderful and easy read!  It was an inspirational story about everyday life and how things aren't alway as they seem.  It was very intriguing how the book was written starting with three seperate stories that were blended into one at the end.  This book pulled you in like you were part of the story and I didn't want to put it down!  It is a must read if you want something fun, light, inspiring, with a little bit of sexy put in!
5	1361923200	I loved this story even better than the first Blackberry book. It took me a while to warm up to Michelle, but I just dove in with these three characters/situations. This time you follow three different women through their conflicts with their significant others/ kids/ family members. I loved how the unrelated three women came together in friendship and became sisters. Can't wait to see where Susan Mallery takes this series next!!
5	1361923200	Susan Mallery's Three Sisters is a must read.  Loved the emotional, real life situations that really happen to us everyday and through those struggles friendships are born.
5	1361923200	I reciecved this book from the author for an honest review. I really loved this book. Andi, Deanna and Boston are strong women who had to overcome different things in their lives. I like the fact that  they had and could be truthful with each other and be there for each other at the same time. Everyone deals with things in their own way and time but these three friends were there for each other when they needed friends, SISTERS, the most. This book drawed me in from the beginning and I couldn't put the book down. I have recommand this book to my SISTERS and others as a must read. It's a wonderful, well written book with a little of everything.
5	1361923200	I love every book Susan writes, but this one is just fantastic!  The relationship between Andi, Deanna and Boston is just so true to life! I laughed so hard when Boston presents her portrait of the evil queen to Deanna and I cried with both Deanna and Boston during their trials.  This book makes me want to be a better wife, mother, friend and sister!
5	1361923200	I love all of Susan Mallery's books but this is one of her best.  I read the complete book in one evening as I wanted to see how the stories turned out - would all 3 families find the strength and happiness that they searched for.The friendships developed slowly as true friendships do -I truly loved the story - I want to visit Blackberry Island.
4	1361923200	Reading Three Sisters makes you want to do one or more of the following:#1. Buy a run down house, hire a hot contractor, and fall in love (if you're single),#2 Reconnect with your children &/or husband/significant other (if you're attached),#3 Make new friends who can pull you up and draw you out of anything you're going through (for anyone!).I was drawn to the characters immediately. I even checked what chapter I was on (four), amazed that Iwas completely involved in them.Each easy to identify with, plus the added chemistry between the couplesmakes Three Sisters a great read. I found myself somewhat identifying with the least liked character,though not to her extreme. As such, I've stepped back and looked at how I do things and want to make someminor changes. When a story does that...it's good. A story that you can learn and grow from, is good.The only negative thing is, as always with SM books, I wished the last page of the book was actuallythe ending of the first half of a novel. I wanted MORE.
5	1361923200	I love this story.  Can't wait for the next Blackberry Island book.  Keep up the good work Susan. I look forward to all of your books.
5	1361923200	I've been waiting since last fall when I read Barefoot Season for this book to come out, and it didn't disappoint me.  I haven't read any of Susan Mallery's books yet that I didn't like.  I especially liked the friendship the three women developed and how they supported each other.  Good work Susan!  Can't wait for the next Fool's Gold book to come out!
5	1361923200	Great book! Made me laugh and cry. Couldn't put it down, read the whole book in one day.  I have a 3 year old so that should tell you how busy I am and I still finished it.  Can't wait for the next book!
5	1361923200	This was an amazing book.  Unfortunately, I was not taken in by the cover and was worried the book would be the same.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I was hooked by the first chapter and could not put it down.  I finished the book that night, and immediately started looking for more Blackberry Island books.  It is definitely a book I will reread.  I laughed, I cried and I argued with the characters , that is how real they felt.  Susan Mallery's books are always a treat and this one did not disappoint.  Thank Susan, sometimes you need to lose yourself in another world and you make them worth visiting.  PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.  You will not be disappointed.
5	1361923200	This book was amazing!  Three woman, three REAL LIFE issues. I could feel more, relate more and even, yes, cry more with the second of the Blackberry Island series. The first book was good but this one was even better! I absolutely could not put this down. Great job Susan !
5	1361923200	The three couples are simply amazing and stole my heart completely. This is such a tender, carefully thought out and touching story. Blackberry Island is the kind of place you'd love to move to, and these characters are people I could be friends with. Three very different women, yet I felt that I could relate to all of them. It's rare that an author can make me laugh and cry in the same book, but this was just that kind of a story. I highly recommend it.
5	1361923200	Andi, Boston and Deanna are  each going through a difficult period. Circumstances and their homes the Three Sisters bring them together,  This book develops each women sense of self as well as their drive to come out whole. The friendships are slowly developed, they rely on each other for moral support and come out stronger than ever.  A great read I couldn't put it down. This book is far more intense than Susan's series romances (which are also good). Great characters a great story I can't wait for the next one.  WELL DONE
5	1361923200	In Susan Mallery's latest novel Three Sisters we meet three women who seem to have nothing in common except they all live on the same street. This is a novel of relationships, like all of Susan's books but romance is just a side story. This novel shows how three woman with seemingly "perfect", although very different lives are more alike under their surfaces than they'd ever imagine. The story makes you think of how important our "girlfriends" are to us than we realise. All three women are facing life changing situations and throughout the story we see how important friendships are for helping them get to know each other and themselves better.
5	1361923200	When I picked up Three Sisters to start reading, it was right before bed. I planned to maybe read two or three chapters before calling it a night. Instead, I found myself drawn into the book, and before long I found myself on page 100. Then I told myself I'd just read another fifty pages before turning in. Well, this went on and on until I found myself on the last page.Needless to say, Three Sisters was an excellent read. It tackles some tough, real life situations through some really great characters. The story follows three very different women who are neighbors who become unlikely friends. My emotions ran the gambit as each of their stories unfolded, but I finished the book feeling thoroughly satisfied.
5	1361923200	I started the book one evening, reading a few chapters. The next day I literally read the book through without putting it down! This was a departure from the other Susan Mallery books I've read, but it was such an emotionally compelling story. My emotions ran the gamut while reading and ended with tears of joy. Three women who are polar opposites find an unlikely friendship. They crash and burn in their families and find honesty, hope and redemption as they traverse life's rocky roads together.
5	1361923200	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters made me laugh and cry.  I could identify with each of them and was so happy with the ending.
5	1361923200	Wonderful!! This really opens your eyes as to how you handle your relationships with family and friends. Hoping that you do treat them with the respect they deserve. Great read Susan.
5	1361923200	As a reader who likes books that are character driven, I have found a gold mine in Susan Mallery's works. Her just released THREE SISTERS - the second in her Blackberry Island series brings to life three women anyone would want to be best friends with. Mallery makes me laugh and cry as I follow her "people." Without giving too much away, I'll just say I read this book straight through and was sad to reach the end because I know it will be a while before she has another released. Yes, It is that good!For those of you who do not first look to the characters, you will like the her wonderfully descriptive settings.This could be a stand alone novel so don't worry if you have not read the first book in this series, BAREFOOT SEASON, you will probably want to read it after reading THREE SISTERS.
5	1361923200	I was already addicted to Susan Mallery's books...but Barefoot Season wasn't my favorite (Blackberry Island #1).  I am now hooked on Blackberry Island thanks to Three Sisters!  LOVE the characters...they are REAL!  I cried when Boston cried...cheered for Andi...and truly hoped Deanna would figure it out.  I felt like they were becoming my new friends as they became friends.  Can't wait to see what else will happen in this series...kind of hoping Nina may play a bigger part in the next book.  She was a character that stuck with me!  Thank you, Susan Mallery!  You have another amazing book and series on your hands!
5	1361923200	A really wonderful and emotional book from Susan Mallery!  I connected to Andi and Boston from the start, but it took awhile to like Deanna.  All three women overcome personal issues as their friendship grows.  There are quite a few sad moments and one of the funniest is the wine tour that Andi takes.  I can't wait for Susan's next book!
4	1361923200	Happy, sad, little mad - what you'll feel while reading this warm and fuzzy book!  Don't miss reading this one.
4	1361836800	The title Three Sisters is not refering to the main characters, but to the houses they live in. This was an amazing story of the three women who live in the houses and the men in their lives. Mostly though its about the women, their relationships and how they overcome their personal problems and life's trials and tribulations.  I couldn't put this book down. It was started and finished in a day and I would probably be able to say less if it hadn't been for pesky work and life getting in the way. I laughed with these ladies, I cried, and best yet I could relate. We females are a tricky lot, as are our thoughts and friendships and Susan Mallery nailed it to a tee.
4	1361836800	The Blackberry Island books are definitely my favorites by Susan Mallery. The characters have so much depth to them, seem so real, so flawed; and yet somehow you can't help but want everything for them....Just like the first book in the series, it took a bit for me to get into this one. Once I did, though, it was hard to put it down! It's definitely more of a relationship book than a romance, but that's okay. The central relationship of the novel is between the three woman--who coincidentally own the three houses known as the &#34;Three Sisters&#34;--and it develops slowly as the story unfolds. A lot of the early part of the book deals with Andi, Boston, and Deanna as individuals, because we really need to understand them separately before we can see how they'll eventually fit together. Each of them have major issues in their lives--two are having serious problems in their marriages and one was jilted at the altar and is starting over--and each on their own is heartbreaking. Parts were hard to read--two of the characters' issues were just screaming &#34;therapy!&#34; to me, and thank goodness one of them did decide to go that route--but it all felt so real. I loved their journey, and cannot wait to see what Mallery has in store next in this series.Hopefully she'll write fast. ;)
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is a beautiful story about the lives and loves of three women.  The trials and tribulations of their lives bring Andi, Deanna, and Boston together as unlikely friends.  This is a well written, inspiring story.  I felt as if I were right there,  sitting at the table with these women.  Thank you Susan Mallery!  I can't wait to visit Blackberry Island again.
5	1361836800	I will admit Blackberry Island book 1 wasn't one of my favorotes. Three Sisters I couldn't put down I loved every bit of it. It really makes you think of your self and close friends. I liked how she put some of her romance into it like the Fools Gold and how the women unite together and work their lives out. Love Love Love it!!!!
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery is one of my favorite authors and I alway wait in anticipation of each book.  Three Sister did not disappoint. This book is about love, sorry, disappointment and redemption.  A very good read.
5	1361836800	An emotional,  soul-searching novel that defines and shows the true meaning of sisterhood.  I did not want to put this book down and if I could have read it in the shower I would have!  You will find yourself intwined in the lives of three very different but very real women, the three sisters, are someone you have met in your lifetime.  5 stars plus!
5	1361836800	Such a rewarding story.  Three women with nothing except location in common become friends through shared sorrows, fears and triumphs.  It wouldn't be a Susan Mallery story without a romance and there is some.  However, the true "love" story is the one which develops between Andi, Deanna and Boston.  I wanted it to go on forever as I felt I knew these women.  Great read.
5	1361836800	Left at the altar and determined to make a fresh start, Dr. Andi buys one of the famed Three Sisters Queen Anne houses on Blackberry Island. Neglected for years, the house requires a major renovation before Andi will be able to open her pediatric office on the first floor. Deanne Phillips' house and marriage appear to be perfect, but in her quest for perfection Deanne has lost herself and is close to losing her family. Next door, artist Boston King thought she and her college sweetheart would be married forever, but a tragedy threatens to tear them apart. The relationship that develops between these three women is the primarily focus of this book. Each must come to terms with their lives before they can develop or rediscover a romantic relationship. The developing friendship between the three women makes this is compelling read. Misconceptions abound and are slowly exposed and, while each discovers (or rediscovers) love, it is the developing friendship between the three women which make this a must read. Fans of Susan Mallory (I confess to being an avid fan) will love this book.
5	1361836800	Andi Gordon was left at the altar by her fianc&eacute; after a 10 year relationship.  She purchases a run-down Victorian on Blackberry Island and hires a contractor, Wade King, to begin its transformation to her pediatrician's office with living accommodations upstairs.  It is time for renewal for Andi  and her new home.Next door, very artistic Boston King and her husband Kyle are having difficulties after the death of their infant son Liam, six months earlier.Finally her other neighbors, Deanna and Colin Phillips, find their marriage and family falling apart due to Deanna's abusive childhood and the perfection she now demands of herself and others.  These three women forge a friendship of trust, laughter, and tears.I loved this story and rarely put it down in the 24 hours since I received it.  What I liked most was the fact that despite problems, there really were six wonderful people doing the very best they could in difficult situations.  Most had baggage and they didn't give up or stop trying to make their relationship work.
4	1361836800	I enjoyed this only slightly less than 'Barefoot Season'.I think the characters in 'Three Sisters' weren't quite as real to me in the second of the Blackberry Island books, but it's difficult for me to dislike anything by Susan Mallery.I received an ARC, and I was incredibly excited to read it early. I don't hesitate to recommend *anything* written by this author, and this book is no exception.Well written, strong characters, vivid details in regards to the setting - all-in-all, well worth picking up. I advise reading 'Barefoot Season' first, although they aren't dependent upon each other. They're just good.
4	1361836800	First note that "Three Sisters" refers to a group of three houses on Blackberry Island. I initially read the first 75 pages, put the book down and considered not picking it back up. The three main characters were WIP (works in progress), and I figured I could guess how the ending would come together. I was right about the ending, but the journey to get there was well worth the read.Another reason I think I had issues with the book was because I saw too much of myself in Deanna. Deanna was clearly unstable, but the OCD and need for rules struck too close to home. Of course, it took awhile for me to care about Deanna, but she eventually, seing Deanna's journey, Andi's restart on life, and Boston's struggles, brought a smile to my face and had me rooting for each of women and their families.So can you guess what happened when I picked up the book to continue reading past around page 75? You got it, I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning finishing the entire book.Susan Mallery has a way of making you care about every story thrown into the mix. Often times, the side stories can be skimmed over and the reader doesn't become truly interested in the side stories. Not Mallery - the reader had a vested interest in very plot, winding and weaving together on the small island of Blackberry Island, and I wanted to be involved in the development of each.Don't miss out on another heartfelt and intriguing Susan Mallery book. When all of the pieces fall into place at the end, I immediately went to look up when the next Mallery book is to be released.Final thought:  I have yet to read the first book in the Blackberry Island series, but that was no problem.Happy Reading!
4	1361836800	I absolutely loved this book!!  From the first chapter I was hooked.  This is the story of 3 women.  Three woman with very different lives and struggles  who start out as neighbors and end up as friends.  From the first chapter I couldn't put it down.  You would at first think that the book would be about sisters, but those &quot;sisters&quot; are actually houses - the three houses owned by the main characters.  Andi is the newest neighbor, a pediatrician recently left at the altar, who is trying to begin again.  Then we have Boston, the artist, who is struggling with the recent death of her baby.  Lastly, we have Deanna, the perfectionist, who has five daughters, a beautiful home, and a past that she can't escape from.  I truly loved the characters (well, except Deanna - at first), and I think any woman that reads it will enjoy it too.  Susan Mallery has a way of making the characters come alive - I could picture these women as being my own neighbors. I have already passed my copy on to my friends at work.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is an amazing story that I am sure I will read over and over!Three completely different women, each at a sort of crossroads, come together as friends and help each other to overcome their hurdles and begin to heal. This beautifully written story really grabbed me from the first. I saw a piece of myself in each of the women so I was able to really feel what they were going through. Susan Mallerys humor is great, as always. I laughed, had more than a few tears and at times I felt a part of myself heal also. This book did a lot more for me than a trip to see a therapist. ;)I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a deeply emotional story, with a little pain and a little love thrown in. It also touches on the characters from the first book in the series, albeit briefly. I eagerly await her next offering in this series.
5	1361836800	This is book #2 in the Blackberry Island series. The title is pertaining to 3 Queen Anne style houses on Blackberry Island.....or is it??The 3 main characters in this book - Andi, Deanna and Boston - each have their own struggles.  The author does an amazing job bringing them all to life. It's exciting to read aned see how all 3 intertwine and how they all help one another. By the end of the book, The title "Three Sisters" takes on a whole new meaning.This book is such an enjoyable read and leaves me anxiously awaiting for the next Susan Mallery book! You won't be disappointed!Enjoy!
5	1361836800	This is the 2nd book in the Blackberry Island series and I loved it. The three main characters faced real life problems and had real life struggles. I loved watching the characters grow and over come there problems. I also loved watching the three &#8220;sisters&#8221; become friends. I would highly recommend both books in the series.
4	1361836800	I couldn't put it down.I was given an advanced copy and I couldn't put it down! Seriously I kept saying to myself "You have to stop reading and get to work".As can be expected from Susan Mallery this book is a definite must read. It flows so well that you'll be halfway through it before you come up for air.  The characters are so well defined you'll think that you've always known them.  Most of all, the storyline is interesting.  It is written in such a way that there were multiple possibilities for an ending. Not so clear cut that you definitely know what to expect. I can't imagine how it could have been improved. It's one of those books you finish and still think about the days later.This book is a women's fiction novel with romance in the story.  It's about 3 women who are neighbors, that become close friends, who come together to help each other overcome devastating circumstances.This is book 2 of A Blackberry Island Series however reading book one is not required. The characters of Barefoot Season receive only a mere mention, so knowing their story is not critical to the Three Sisters storyline.I would prefer to give this book 4 stars but this rating system doesn't allow for it.  (I reserve 5 for the best book I've read this year).
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is an excellent read! The storyline and characters were so moving, with the focus on relationships and real-life situations, that it had me thinking of and grateful for my own circle friends. It still has that hint of romance that I need, and being a series reader, I also liked that there was an update on the characters from the first book in the Blackberry Island series, Barefoot Season.  Must read...you won't be disappointed!
5	1361836800	Just finished reading this book and loved it. Susan Mallery has such a way of writing characters and making them real by showing they are less than perfect. The story deals with three women at different stages in their life, and how they deal with their personal relationships....those with a mate, parents, their children, lose of a loved one, and friends. While there is romance involved the story is more about getting rid of emotional baggage so they can fully enjoy the love of their lives. This one pulled at the heart strings and I found myself laughing, and even crying a few times with the characters, but I knew with Susan writing it there would be a happy ending when all was said and done. While very different from Susan's Fool's Gold Series, Three Sisters is a must read.
5	1361836800	I love all of Susan Mallery&#8217;s books but Three Sisters is my absolute favorite of all of Susan Mallery&#8217;s works. I can honestly say that this is the first time I can say that, only because I&#8217;ve never been able to choose. Three Sisters is unlike many of her other mainly because it is Women&#8217;s Lit (not Romance) so it deals with a slightly deeper content. Three Sisters was well written with believable characters dealing with real life issues such as failed romances, death, and mental health. I found myself totally sucked into the story right along with the ladies. I identified with different parts of them, I laughed with them, I cried with them, I bonded. Of course, per her usual, Three Sisters has a happy ending and yet I&#8217;ve still found myself in book hangover wanting more!
4	1361836800	The only reason this book got four stars instead of five is because it took me about... 75 pages to really like the other characters in this book. I immediately loved Andi, but it took a while, for me, to get to know Deanna and Boston. But once you hit that mark, forget it! You are so into the book you forget that it had a little bit of a slow start!I didn't read the first book in this series and I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to follow along with this book. That was SOOOO not the case! This book is its own novel and there is no need at all to read the first book. Only if you want to.I loved this book. Period. It was so..inspiring. As a mom I have many of the fears that Deanna has. It was nice to know that even though she is a fictional character, that she has some of the same problems that I have.My heart wept for Deanna.My soul screamed for BostonMy fist's raged for Andi.I loved these women and how they found a friendship in each other that went even farther and made them sisters.Read this book! Now!* for my full review on this book check me out at [...]  *
5	1361836800	I think it's a rare author that can move me to tears and make me laugh out loud all in the same book but that's what Susan Mallery has done in Three Sisters!  The three women in this book, all neighbors, have encountered some emotional turmoil and the book takes you through the healing process with them.  There's also just enough romance thrown in to spice things up!  I was amazed at how "human" and "flawed" the characters seemed yet how likable they were.  By the end of the book I wanted to move in next to them.  In my opninion...and I've read a lot of her books...it's Mallery's best book yet!
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is a wonderful story about three very different women. Their stories will make you laugh and make you cry.  Once again, the Blackberry Island series in not a typical Mallery romance, but it won't disappoint her many fans and it should broaden her audience!  ENJOY!!!
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is a beautiful story about three women who found out they had more in common than they thought. I loved how once they really got to know each other, they were able to open up and let each other in. Susan Mallery has written another fantastic book!
5	1361836800	Another terrific book by Ms. Mallory. As always, her characters were well drawn and interesting. Deanna was the least sympathetic character to me initially, but I ultimately really enjoyed her storyline, as she struggled with OCD. I also enjoyed the growth shown by the 3 women, learning something from each other as their friendship progressed.I loved how each of the Three Sisters houses reflected the personalities of the three women, and how Andi, Deanna & Boston went from strangers to sisters of the heart.I highly recommend this book & thank the author for allowing me to read it prior to publication.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters, like Barefoot Season, is not your typical romance novel.  It is about creating friendships, rekindling relationships, and starting over.  I enjoyed the intensity that I felt while reading the book.  It drew many emotions: sadness, loneliness, grief, happiness, pleasure, and joy.I especially enjoyed the relationships among the three friends and how their friendships evolved from each of their personal relationship problems.  Three Sisters taught you that not everyone is as strong on the inside as they appear on the outside and that sometimes it takes really getting to know someone to understand who they are.  It also was a good example of how three different personalities can overcome their lifestyle differences and become the best of friends.  This book is a true testimonial of not only how important relationships can be but, more importantly how true friendships can be a healing factor when all else seems to be wrong.Three Sisters was a great story.  I enjoyed the subtle links to Barefoot Season, and I look forward to the next book in the series.
4	1361836800	Susan has done it again!!!  This is a great story about 3 woman who find comfort from each other and healing of their hearts.  As always I couldn't put the book down.
4	1361836800	Susan Mallery writes about such beautiful places, by the time I finished Three Sisters I wanted to move to Blackberry Island! I loved how different all three women were but they still had so much in common. They were able to depend on and learn from each other. Three Sisters is a great women's ficiton read.
5	1361836800	I love this book! The blackberry island books are a departure from Susan Mallery's normal romance books. Even though I love those books too, I think Three Sisters is my new favorite book. You get a great story of friendship, and you get 3 love stories in 1 great book!  The story never gets old and moves right along. I never wanted to put it down. If I had to change one thing, it would be to add  more of the characters from Barefoot Season.  I love getting hear their stories continue.
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery has been one of my favorites since I came across my first Fool's Gold novel.  I have really enjoyed the new Blackberry Island series.  This latest book was fantastic, I couldn't put it down.  Although this book has several love stories happening at the same time, it wasn't necessarily the main focus of the book. To me, it seemed to be more about how we sometimes choose our "family" and how the development of these special friendships can change lives. If you are looking for a good story that is all about relationships of different kinds, you won't want to miss this book.  I loved it!!!
4	1361836800	Three Sisters (book 2 in the Blackberry Island series) by Susan Mallery was just as I expected...a fantastic read! I thought it was better than the first in the series, Barefoot Season. The three women were wonderfully unique and seemed to be made for each other.  I felt each woman's heartache, along with their rewards.  Out of the three women, I think I felt the most connected to Boston and her struggles. My gosh, my heart still hurts for her suffering.I loved Three Sisters! I rate it 4 out of 5 stars, only because it took me a little while to get fully invested in the book.
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery has hit it out of the ballpark with this highly emotional and wonderful story. I expected something special and she certainly delivered. I won't go into the plot details as it has been outlined in other reviews. I will say instead that it's a book not to be missed. I was hooked from the first page and to see how a relationship develops between these 3 very different ladies was so real. I highly recommend this book for those who love deep stories that are true to what really happens in the world today. I read this book in two days.  Couldn't put it down! Loved it....Jane M.
5	1361836800	This is an excellent book by Susan Mallery.  I can't wait till the next book comes out.  Once I started reading the book I could not put it down.  I loved the characters - Andi, Boston and Deanne.  They were just like real people in your own neighborhood. where you live.  Mallery has done an excellent job of writing keeping you wondering as you read..  I would laugh out loud and my husband at times thought I was crazy till he realized I was reading my book.  Don't miss this one or any of her other books.  I love the way she writes.  She really draws you in and I can't put down the book till I have finished!!!
5	1361836800	I first started reading Susan Mallery simply by chance.  I found one of her books at a used book store when I was in college and have been hooked ever since.  &#34;Three Sisters&#34; is an amazing book about loss, picking yourself back up (with the help of friends), and moving on.  Andi, Deanna, and Boston will draw you in and make you feel like a part of their neighborhood.  Susan Mallery makes you feel as though you are emotionally connected to these three women.  Susan Mallery captures the hard times people go through and the importance of friends to get you through them alive.  Not the typical Mallery book but an amazing book I couldn't put down!
5	1361836800	I fell in love, sisterly love, with our 3 heroines. Andi, the pediatrician, who buys the ugly duckling middle house of the 3 Sisters-a Queen Anne style built around 1900. She has left Seattle after being "left at the altar" and wants the house remodeled for her practice, the first floor will be her office and she'll live upstairs. Deanna Phillips lives in the fully restored house and everything is perfect in her life with 5 daughters and a husband-not really as we find out. Last is Boston King whose home is a well taken care but not perfectly restored. Boston's marriage is weathering a big storm she thinks but it is really?The 3 houses are called the 3 Sisters and the three women are as close as 3 sisters by the end of the book!The 3 women are so diverse but do manage to get close even though they each have problems knowing and telling what they need. Andi is alone even though she has her parents, a brother and a sister, all of whom are driven and very well though of in their own medical field, they just can't understand how Andi can be happy being a lowly pediatrician.Deanna's finds her live is not perfect and she ends up telling Andi and Boston of her personal demons and it's so hard to do. Her house may be lovely, her children and husband look perfect but poor Deanna needs help but most of all she needs good friends.Boston is an artist and her husband a contractor so their house is comfortable with personal touches not fussy at all. They've had a big blow to their lives and are just not healing like the other thinks they should. They have been in love since high school and married young but don't have that same feeling as they did before. Boston finds comfort in her friendship with Andi and Deanna. She learns to talk of her personal nightmare.All three women help each other and through that friendship they are able to make their lives better. Ms Mallery created Andi, Deanna & Boston so very real I'd love to have friends like that and own a house like any one of the Three Sisters lolI've enjoyed the Blackberry Island novels and hope there are many more!! Ms Mallery writes wonderful books!
5	1361836800	The book is about 3 women who are at different places in their lives but still find a way to form a bond that ends up helping each of them.  There was a lot of  laughing while reading this but also some tears.  This book will grab you and suck you in. I had a hard time putting this book down.  Was sad when I read the last page because I wasn't ready for the story to be over.
5	1361836800	Three neighbors become friends and then become like sisters. Each has problems and they help each other. They learn to accept each other as they are and I felt like I knew each of them personally and cheered them on.
5	1361836800	This is one of my most favorite books ,loved the story line and this book touched home in myself .
5	1361836800	I loved this  book and I  could not stop reading it.  I quickly became involved  with the 3  main characters. I don't always need hot  romances. I enjoyed this comtemporary novel, because its about friendship,starting over and second chances. Its flows easy with understanding  the characters and plot lines. The  story is about 3 newly developing friendships giving love and support for each other as they each go thru  life struggles. I laughed,cried and cheered the 3 ladies on,as I read. This novel follows 3 women Andi,Boston and Deanna, who live in  large victorian houses side by side on an island. They eventually become friends and  very involved with each others life giving support to each other when problems arise. Its  beautifully written,as you are drawn into their lives. Each has a different personality and career, but they reach to one another  for support in a very loving way. I enjoyed being the outsider looking in....I'm new to Susan Mallerys books,but I'm quickly becoming a huge fan of her novels.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is definitely a keeper to reread again & again. I laughed with the characters, cried with the characters & was even angry at some of the characters. From the beginning the book captivated my interest with real life characters,  wonderful friendships & well developed story lines that flowed together for an emotional ending. Wonderful & Well written book Susan Mallery.
4	1361836800	What can I say, Susan Mallery knows how tell a story.  I really enjoyed this book.  I like that the three main characters are completely different yet in spite of their differences they form a friendship that you know will last.  I especially enjoyed this book because it shows real life problems and how they coped with them.  This is very good read.  I highly recommend.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters takes you through a whole gamut of emotions; at least it did for me, from sympathy, to sadness and grief, to understanding, triumph, and that oh-so-wonderful happy-ever-after.  Each character has flaws and faces very true to life struggles.  One of the hallmarks of a Susan Mallery book is the way in which she takes her character's flaws, imperfections and all, through life and into the most satisfying outcome possible.  And this book is one of her finest.  When I love a book, I always wish that I lived in that town, with those characters as friends.  And, let me tell you, I wish that I lived on Blackberry Island, on top of a hill, as the 4th Sister.
5	1361836800	I found this book utterly addictive. The story was rich in drama, humour, tragedy, healing, love and above all, friendship. There is a depth to the three title characters that draws you into their lives and finds you laughing and crying with them. In fact, all the characters are interesting and endearing, including Pickles the &#34;long-suffering cat&#34; who had me grinning frequently as I read. Do yourself a favor....pour yourself a glass of something - open a box of bon-bons....put your feet up ...get settled...and read this book!
4	1361836800	Three Sisters (Blackberry Island) by Susan Mallery4 STARSThree Sister started out slowly and confusing for me. It kept switching telling three story lines at once. It was a while before they merged and it was a lot better. At first I was thinking that I would rather read a seperate book for each couple at a time.Thier are some love scenes and dealing with hard issues that people have in thier lives.Andi Gordon was left at the alter after being with him for ten years before he proposes. Then after that two weeks later he runs off and marrys his receptionist.Andie is the child that is a disappointment to her parents. She has not lived up too her potential. Andie is only a children's doctor.Andie decides to make some changes in her life. She has moved to Blackberry Island bought a big old house. She plans to have the bottom floor gutted and make her office and live above in the two stories. Andie plans to live in her attic while the remolding is done. She will work with the local doctor till her practice is ready for her to open.Deanna Phillips is a perfectionist. Not very likeable. She lives in one of the Three Sisters Queen Anne houses. Her house and yard are perfectly restored. She has five girls. Deanna thinks her husband is having an affair. Her daughters are not close to her especially the oldest. Her husband travels in his job and he is gone most of the week. Deanna makes all her food from scratch. Only lets her girls have desert once a week.Boston King is a artist and owns the third of the three sisters houses. Her house is more whimscal in design. Boston baby died at only 6 months old. She has been only able to draw him. Boston has not been able to cry over his death. Her husband has started drinking. They have always been close but now are far apart.The story builds slowly till they are all connected and start working together on thier problems and relying on each other. Thier are no easy answers for what each women is facing but with each other they start to heal each other and help them to face thier trials.I wanted the three new friends to all have happy endings or beginings. The more you got to know about the problems they each face instead of only seeing the front they hide behind the more I liked them.I was given this ebook to read in exchange of honest review from Netgalley. This is the second Blackberry Island book that I have read. I look forward to reading more books set on Blackberry Island.Publisher: Harlequin MIRA; Original edition (February 26, 2013) 352 pages ISBN-10: 0778314340
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is an amazing read. Susan Mallery has a wonderful gift for bringing her characters to life with such depth that you feel like they are family or lifelong friends. I felt sympathy right away for Andi and then we met Boston and I wanted curl up in her comfy sofa and enjoy the art of her home. I was not happy with Deanna. In the end I came to love her and feel such compassion for her. Three Sisters is another book to laugh over and cry over and delight in the special relationships that we women can be blessed with if we just open our hearts to each other.Three Sisters
5	1361836800	I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the relationship between the three women.  This book was classic Susan Mallery , her characters came alive for me.
5	1361836800	Another great book by Susan Mallery.  Once I started reading it I couldn't stop.  It's not one of Susan's pure romance books, but I liked the strong friendships as the main story with romance second.  Susan makes you feel emotionally connected to these three women.  I definitely recommend this book.
5	1361836800	I had a hard time caring about the characters and it took quite a few pages to start rooting for them.  The novel really grabbed me when the women got close.  The love stories were both tragic and up to Mallery's high standards.Eagerly awaiting the next Blackberry Island book.
5	1361836800	A very good read, I couldn't put it down.  I had to find out how these 3 women overcame their life trials and learned from them.  It did not disappoint.  Very true-to-life and enjoyable.  Highly recommended!
5	1361836800	The Three Sisters are three Queen Ann style houses built high on a hill overlooking Blackberry Island and Puget Sound.  After being left at the altar, pediatrician Andi Gordon left Seattle and purchased the middle house, the one in terrible shape, with plans to remodel and run her practice out of it.  She hopes by bringing new life to the house she can also start a new life for herself.Deanna Phillips, a perfectionist, and Boston King, an artist, own the other two houses.  Both are married, but are also at crossroads in their lives.  Though the women are very different, the three eventually become friends and support each other through tough times.I loved this book!  It was beautifully written with great characters.  I became emotionally invested in their lives and laughed and cried with each of them.  This was a moving story and will remain with me long after THE END.
5	1361836800	I have long been a fan of romance -- especially paranormal (eg time travel, shape shifters, etc.) romance.  I am also a fan of excellent writing -- which is how Susan Mallery hooked me as a fan when I read the 1st Fool's Gold book.  I've not read all of her many books (I am only up to about 43 of them, although I am methodically working on that; but not all of them are e-books, yet -- hint, hint).I do NOT typically write reviews.HOWEVER -- in the process of reading her books, I came across Already Home -- and now the two Blackberry Island books.I am blown away!!!For the first time, at least that I can remember, a romance has been paired with "real life" issues that are well developed into the story line by the writer (as opposed to just the personal, relationship issues experienced by the hero & heroine).I am a former educator, a budding therapist, and a potential author.  I love that with this book we are given a glimpse of tough situations and a story showing ways to heal issues that are not typically presented in romance books.Susan Mallery has not only (once again) brilliantly written a book with in-depth characterization -- but combined with her story line she has created a venue to allow us, the readers, to feel a depth of compassion about the characters not typically felt when reading a romance based on hero/heroine issues.  Yes, all issues are (potentially) resolved -- just like in most romances.  But the "HOW" they are resolved in this book (as well as with the 1st Blackberry Island book "Barefoot Season" and another book "Already Home") is beautiful -- and provides a glimpse of what is sometimes behind a person's behavior. (As an educator, etc., I can't help but be thrilled at the potential of developing understanding and compassion via reading a good book.)If you want a great read -- read this book!If you want to cry (and you will) -- and laugh -- read this book!If you want a glimpse into someone else's life (albeit fictional) -- and maybe become a better person because of it -- read this book!If you are having a tough day and want to feel better -- read this book!In fact, if you just like to read -- read this book!
5	1361836800	This book was so good, that by the time I was finished I wanted to live in one of the houses,and live on Blackberry Island. I loved Andi and Boston from the start. Had a harder time with Deanna, but came to understand her also. Really great read!
5	1361836800	There are few things more difficult to deal with than physical and emotional abuse, the loss of a child, and being jilted at the alter by your fiance. The three women in Susan Mallery&#8217;s second Blackberry Island novel, Three Sisters, must contend with these issues while life goes on busily around them. Mallery takes the reader on an emotional ride while still infusing humor throughout the entire read.  At the beginning of the book, the &#8220;three sisters,&#8221; refers to three Victorian houses that sit side by side on the island.  When you close the book after the final page, the bond formed by these women also reflects the title. Your reward is a front row seat as Susan Mallery intertwines the lives of these three very different women as they work through different yet difficult circumstances. You will admire the fortitude of these three women as they rebuild and reshape their lives and you will admire the talent of Mallery to do it with humor and compassion. Three Sisters is a fabulous read.
5	1361836800	richly rewarding tale of hope, redemption, sorrow and love. I could not put this book down.  I found all three women to be fascinating character studies that were realistic and touching.  Yes, it is a romace with a hea ending but the road there was wonderfully complex and deliciously entertaining.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters by Susan MalleryThe three sisters houses each one owned by a different person.Andi has just moved to the island to set up her pediatrician office, working at the local doctor office til her practice opens after renovating her house/office space.Boston and Zeke are on one side of Andi. She is a textile artist with many medias, and he is a contractor, along with his brother Wade who lives on the island with his teen daughter.On the other side of Andi is Colin and Deanna. He is a sales man traveling during the week, spends time with the 5 daughters they have. She works part-time at the craft shop, quilting, scrapbooking, knitting, etc.Love the set up of the town as they have a yoga studio and a farmers market. Just sounds like the place one could just drop into and feel right at home. Love scenes are passionate.Each of them have troubles to work through and with help from one another they might achieve just the peace they need inside.Joy, pain, happy, sad you get to experience it all from different points of view. Love scenes are just right. Menu from the Inn and a recipe are included! There are quite a few characters and they are easy to keep straight because of the way they are introduced into the story.The Three Sisters Houses to me symbolize the three women that live in the houses and how they become sisters due to communication and faith that you can fix anything...
5	1361836800	Loved the friendship between the women. They helped each other overcome hardships. Also has romance, children and some well written sex scenes. She really makes you think about things that could happen in a person's life. It made me happy. I stayed up until 4:00 reading this book, then had to go out & buy some of her books I had missed.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters by Susan MalleryPlease forgive me for starting this review in this manner but I need to be clear ----> this is NOT a romance novel.  The Blackberry Island books are more Fiction or Women's Fiction with one of the characters finding her male Happily Ever After!SPOILERISH---->And this book is even different yet again since each woman finds a HEA, but two of them do it with the men they have already been married to.END OF SPOILER------>Briefly - You have a book about three different neighbors - one  a single woman, a pediatrician who was left at the altar and is going to redo a crumbling Victorian house. The second woman has lost her infant son and has not grieved. She is showing some very irrational behavior, but keeps it well hidden.  The third woman is the most complicated. She is sort of being accused of being a poor mother and wife by her husband. She is strict and seeks perfection in everything and from everyone. .As usual, Ms Mallery has written intricate and very believable characters. Characters that are easy for us to put ourselves inside of to walk a mile in their shoes. Her descriptions are vividly drawn, the secondary characters are as fully fleshed as her main characters, even the tertiary characters have been well thought out and portrayed.The story is rich and rewarding. I had hoped this story would never end.  I just wanted to keep reading to see how their lives are working out. However, unfortunately for me, the book did end. So I guess I'll just have to wait for the next Blackberry Island novel.*ARC supplied by publisher*
5	1361836800	I was so sorry when this book was over.  I was so engrossed in the lives of these women. They seemed real, and their friendship seemed real.  These are the kind of women I would like to know and share my problems with and laugh with. None of them are perfect.  Just like me!  And each is at a turning point in her life.  It reminded me that I shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we all have problems in our lives. Best of all, it made me laugh, as Susan Mallery's books always do.  She may be dealing with some of life's challenges here, but she has such a deft, seemingly-effortless (Hah! As if!) style and that wonderful, quirky humor of hers.  I'm going to want to reread this before too long.
5	1361836800	Wow this is one of the best stories I have read. Love the characters! They engaged me right from the start.  I found myself cheering for them and crying with them. So real and so in tune with today, this is well worth a read. Enjoy!!
5	1361836800	Loved this one! What I thought was really great about this book was that it was different than previous books by Mallery. The characters were more broken and in trouble than is typical of Mallery's trilogies or series books.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is Susan Mallery at her best!  The book takes you in and you can't put it down.  The women in the book were so interesting and lived with me for a few days, I didn't want the book to end.  Loved the book!
4	1361836800	I absolutely loved the three characters in this novel.  Each character reminded me of people in my life &#8211; good & bad.  Each woman has insecurities and personal issues that they have to work through.  I enjoyed their developing friendship, their ability to laugh at each other and  their ability to laugh at themselves.Overall I loved the book but was very frustrated with the ending.  I hate when an ending is rushed.  I&#8217;m not sure how three very intense relationships can be tidied up in 40 pages or less.  If not for the disappointment in the ending this book would have rated 5 stars.
5	1361836800	Fans of Susan Mallery have come to expect family to play a large role in her books. Her series romance, such as the titles set in fictional Fools Gold, Calif., often feature families as the foundational characters who tie the different stories together.Her newer, women&#8217;s fiction titles &#8220;Almost Home,&#8221; &#8220;Blackberry Island&#8221; and this newest &#8212; &#8220;Three Sisters&#8221; &#8212; instead look at the families we make through circumstance and choice.The Three Sisters of the title refer to three Victorian homes set alone on the highest point of Blackberry Island. By the end of the book, however, Three Sisters also refers to our three heroines, Deanna, Boston and Andi, who live in the houses and find themselves sisters of the heart.&#8220;Three Sisters&#8221; is Mallery&#8217;s best work to date. Her descriptions of Deanna, Boston and Andi; the situations they face in their lives and even the thoughts of other loved ones in their lives are written with a rich nuance. The book takes place over several months, not the typical few weeks of a series romance. The paths the three women walk are realistic. It&#8217;s easy to celebrate their successes and sympathize with their setbacks.A key to keeping the stories moving along is switching among each woman&#8217;s viewpoint &#8212; and also throwing in some perspectives of secondary characters. Although I haven&#8217;t faced everything the three women were dealing with, I still saw pieces of myself in their stories.&#8220;Three Sisters&#8221; is Book 2 of Mallery&#8217;s new Blackberry Island series, but it easily can be read independently. The setting and main characters of &#8220;Barefoot Season&#8221; (Blackberry Island Book 1) make a minor appearance toward the end of the book. Rather than what often seems like a gratuitous way to catch up from a previous title, their placement moves the plot of &#8220;Three Sisters&#8221; along with no additional background needed.Fans of Susan Mallery will enjoy &#8220;Three Sisters.&#8221; For readers new to this author, &#8220;Three Sisters&#8221; is a great book to introduce you.
5	1361836800	A beautiful story of 3 women who find each other and themselves on Blackberry Island.  Couldn't put it down! A wonderful read from Susan Mallery!
4	1361836800	I'm a newcomer to Susan Mallery's books but that just gives me more of her backlist to look forward to reading.Andi Gordon was jilted at the altar and in response she did the first impulsive thing in her life: she picked up stakes and moved to Blackberry Island off the coast of Seattle. She buys a worn down house on a cul-de-sac. Her house sits between two others. A perfectly restored home and one with more whimsy.Artist Boston King thought she and her high school sweetheart husband were going to be together forever. They probably would be, except for the heartbreak that has torn them apart. Each is so wounded they may never find their way through the grief, much less back to each other.Deanna Phillips confronts her husband about an assumed affair. She discovers that her marriage is in much more trouble than she ever suspected. And it has nothing to do with another woman. Deanna has worked hard to have the perfect family, the perfect marriage, and the perfect home. How will she survive if anyone finds out her life is a sham?Each of the three women on the street needs a new beginning. Along the way they find each other and the life they are meant to live.I really enjoyed Three Sisters. It was more women's fiction that romance, although there's plenty of that too. In fact, I need to caution my blog readers, there was a bit more sex than in the books I usually recommend, just FYI. Not a lot, but it was there and fairly graphic, although nowhere near pornographic. Okay? Okay.Anyway, there was humor, heart, and real life. I believed these women could be living on an island, making margaritas, and encouraging each other. None of them pretend to have all the answers. Or any answers. But that's what made them likeable and made me root for them.I loved this one. My mountain of To Be Read books is so massive, I'll likely never see the bottom of it, but I'll definitely seek out another Blackberry Island novel by Susan Mallery. Anyone who enjoys Kristan Higgins, Jill Shalvis, or Susan Wigg's Lakeshore Chronicles series will love this one.
5	1361836800	I loved this book!  It has three romantic story lines, with both very emotional moments (I actually cried in a few places) and some very funny moments.  I found something in each woman's struggles that touched me in some way.  When Andi goes on a wine tour is now one of my favorite humorous moments often found in her books.  Although there is a previous Blackberry Island book, Barefoot Season (also a good read), this book can certainly stand on its own.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters by Susan Mallery is a wonderful story about friendship and healing. Each of these unlikely three friends, sisters of the heart, help each other overcome issues that prevent them from moving forward with their lives. Their struggles are handled with honesty, laughter and tears. I would highly recommend this "real" read.Three Sisters

5	1361836800	Susan Mallery has taken her writing to new heights with this emotional story of three women, their unlikely friendship, and the challenges they face as they seek a second chance in life. You will love every page of this book.
5	1361836800	With her Blackberry Island series, Susan Mallery brings her readers stories about realistic characters whose lives are far from perfect. The second installment, Three Sisters, is a touching and heartfelt novel that is deeply compelling and full of emotion. The main characters are three very different women who form an unlikely friendship as they cope with some serious challenges in their private lives.Following the breakup of her ten year relationship, Andi Gordon purchases a run down and decrepit Victorian home on Blackberry Island. Desperate for a new beginning, Andi is renovating more than her house; she is making over her entire life. A fresh start in a new place is just what she needs to recover from her broken heart and she has a strict no dating policy firmly in place. That is until she meets Wade King, the sexy contractor in charge of her renovations.The homes on either side of Andi are beautifully restored and Andi is a little envious of her seemingly perfect neighbors. But as she gets to know each of the women living next door to her, Andi soon discovers that each of the women are dealing with some very painful issues.Deanna Phillips is married with five beautiful daughters. Her husband, Colin, is a traveling salesmen who is away more often than he is home. When she discovers what she thinks is incriminating evidence of an affair, her accusations force Colin to reveal his growing dissatisfaction with their marriage. His angry allegations shake Deanna to the core and she will have to come to terms with her ugly and dysfunctional past in order to save her marriage.Boston King and her husband Zeke are high school sweethearts who have been married for a long time. A devastating and traumatic loss has driven a wedge between this once devoted couple. Their once strong marriage is disintegrating and they have fallen into a very destructive pattern as they try to accept their unbearable loss and move forward.The three women's stories unfold separately then slowly converge as their lives begin to fall apart. In the beginning, Deanna is difficult to like but as her self-awareness grows and her past is revealed the more likeable she becomes. Of the three, she has the most to lose and overcome. Boston's story is the most heartbreaking and her recovery takes the longest to achieve. Andi is the most optimistic and despite her reservations about getting involved with Wade, she is willing to open her heart to love again.While Three Sisters is mainly a novel about overcoming life's obstacles, there are romantic elements. Both Deanna and Boston's marriages are rocky and it is incredibly uplifting watching them fight to save their respective marriages and rediscover their love for their spouses. Andi's new relationship with Wade is incredibly sensual and while their road to happily ever after is a bit rocky, it is emotionally satisfying when they finally figure out their future.Susan Mallery's Blackberry Island series is definitely more serious than her more light-hearted and romantic Fool's Gold series. She tackles some of life's more serious moments head on and provides readers with thought-provoking and emotional storylines that will make you laugh and cry as each of the characters triumph over adversity.Three Sisters is a captivating novel about friendship, facing fears, overcoming tragedy and finding the courage to love again. This installment of the Blackberry Island series can be read as a standalone story, but you won't want to miss a single book in this delightfully heartwarming series.I received a complimentary copy for review.
5	1361836800	This book really moved me so much and I couldnt put it down once I started reading it.  The Three Sisters Victorian homes are symbolic of the three women that live in them.  They are very different but yet so much alike. These three women have different life struggles but come together and help each other thru these struggles without realizing how close they are becoming. I loved how they were so honest with each other and respected each other's opinions. Always love a happy ending and each one found romance or got it back in their lives.  I love Susan's books but this is the best one yet.  She makes you want to come to Blackberry Island and live on that hill in one of those beautiful old houses.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters was great! I laughed and cried through the whole book.  Each of the main characters are going through their own real life struggles that people face all of the time.  Very emotional book!!  I highly recommend this book!
5	1361836800	This is the best book I have read in a very long time!!!!I read this book in 2 days.  I'm a long time Susan Mallery fan and this is one of her best books if not her best book!  The story is very strong with 3 main characters, all having their own story and then their stories are woven into each other beautifully.  I highly recommend this book.
5	1361836800	Make a cup of whatever it is you like to drink, curl up in your favorite chair with your throw over legs and settle in to read in whatever form you like a really great book.  Three Sisters pulled me in from the very first page.  I originally thought it would be a spin off from her first book Barefoot Season and I was in for a very delightful surprise when it wasn't.  It is a very well written story with a strong plot.  What blew me away though was that I thought I would hate Deanna and she was the character I empathized with the most.  Susan Mallery has a true talent of pulling you in, making you care about characters that I would easily become friends with and not let go of the book until I read the last word.  Trust me you want to read this.  If I could give it a higher rating I would because as much as I liked Barefoot Season I just loved Three Sisters and so will you.  I read this book in less than two days and can't wait for the next book.
5	1361836800	This is my first review ever so here it goes! I have been a Susan Mallery fan for a long time! I will say when I first started this book I really wasn't feeling it( well mainly one charcter), but after the &#34;coming out&#34;, I could not put it down!! Susan,  really know hows to draw a person in and keep them til the end! Don't miss this book!
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery has written another 5 star book.  Excellent Women's Fiction with a touch of romance.  I loved the interaction between Andi, Boston and Deanna.  I also enjoyed the reference of the &#34;Three Sisters&#34; to their Victorian houses and how each house reflected upon its owner.  This book shows how three strangers become neighbors and then become very close friends or 'sisters'.  I also felt like a friend as I cried along with Deanna and Boston during their meltdowns, but understood them better because of it.  Susan Mallery's characters are our friends and neighbors.  She does and excellent job of letting us see ourselves in them.
5	1361836800	Another fantastic book by Susan Mallery. Her books draw you in from the first page & keep you riveted until the final paragraph. I love the emotions & the real life feelings that she has her characters display.
5	1361836800	I loved this book. I love all Susan Mallery's books but this one about a friendship and the bond these women made; was just written beautifully . This is my favorite book of hers to date. It is a must read. My kids saw me start reading it ;saw the authors name and told my husband we will not be eating dinner tonight mom is reading another Susan book!
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery's books never cease to amaze me! This time she managed to touch on multiple topics, and yet it seemed as if she was writing directly to me throughout the entire book. This book dealt with friendships being born, relationships being restored, the loss of a precious life, and a serious mental health issue. In the end it renewed my hope in life. Mallery never fails to amaze me!
5	1361836800	After being jilted at the altar, Andi Gordon moves from Seattle to Blackberry Island and buys one of the Three Sisters--a neglected Victorian set between two well-preserved others.Her neighbors are two very different women. One is Deanna Phillips, married with children who seems as obsessive compulsive as anyone and who crumbles when she suspects her husband of having an affair. The other is  artist Boston King. She and her college sweetheart have been married many years and have always felt their marriage is indestructible, however, when a family tragedy strikes, neither are able to move forward.Andi is as damaged as her neighbors, and each of these women can only begin the healing process by confronting some painful memories. As their friendship deepens, they begin to discover their authentic selves.A delightful story of the value of friendship by the inimitable Ms. Mallery. Three Sisters is a wonderful page-turner.
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery takes my breath away. She gets us so deep into the characters' heads in Three Sisters. I could relate with each of the three heroines, although they're very different from each other. Somehow, Susan tapped into universal truths with each of them that made me recognize myself. I teared up many times while reading this book, but the ending was so happy and satisfying that the feeling that sticks with me is contentment.A great read!
4	1361836800	Besides humiliation and pain of standing alone at the altar in front of 300 friends and family including both moms, Andi Gordon is also left paying the bills and returning the gifts.  Thus three months later, Andi decides she needs a major makeover so buys one of the Queen Anne historical "Three Sisters" houses on Blackberry Island in Puget Sound with plans to open up a pediatric practice in her new home.She meets her neighbor artist Boston King, whose husband Zeke she already met.  Boston and Zeke struggle to move on after the death of their baby, but increasingly they appear to be moving on separately.Also residing in one of the Three Sisters' homes are Deanna Phillips, her husband Colin and their five daughters.  Deanna fears Colin is having an affair.  When she confronts him, he confesses but blames her; sadly she agrees with him.The return to Blackberry Island (see Barefoot Season) focuses on three women with emotional issues bonding like the Three Musketeers.  Each believes in "All for one, one for all" mantra; as the trio knows they have "sisters" who have their back during their personal crisis.  The ensemble cast is fully developed due in part to the rotating storyline and mostly because of the "Three Sisters" sharing their tsuris with each other and readers.Harriet Klausner
5	1361836800	Three Sisters--like a tasty main course in a meal--is filled with different flavors.  Some moments are spicy, some bitter, some sweet, some sour.  Mix all of the flavors together and a good story is created.  Like the houses they live in, the lives of the three women in this novel reflect the joys and turmoils of their lives.  Like any good meal, the reader should relax and savor each bite--maybe with a glass of blackberry wine!
5	1361836800	The story begins with Andi Gordon buying one of the famed Three Sisters Queen Anne houses on top of a hill on Blackberry Island. The other two houses are owned by Deanna Phillips and Boston King&#8230;who have lived in their houses most of their lives. Little does Andi know, by running away from her problems to Blackberry Island, she will forge a strong friendship with these women and their families and together, they will discover what they are really made of: laughter, tears, love, and a little heartache.This story has some real life issues and as I read more and more&#8230;I really formed a connection to Susan Mallery&#8217;s characters. It isn&#8217;t all happy and fun&#8230;but more relatable and feeling what these characters are going through. I found myself not wanting to put the book down because I wanted to know what would happen next. In the end&#8230;you are rooting for all three women to have their happy ending and Susan definitely keeps you reading on the edge of your seat to find that out.As with Suasn Mallery&#8217;s other books&#8230;this one was well written and enjoyable to read from the first page to the last. I look forward to reading &#8220;Just One Kiss&#8221;&#8230;her next novel to come out this summer.
5	1361836800	Three Sisters is the follow up book to Barefoot Season, the first book in the Blackberry Island series. The story centers on Andi, a pediatrician who buys one of the three Queen Anne houses known as the Three Sisters. The other two are owned by Boston, a free spirited artist and her husband and the last by Deanna, a perfectionist housewife with five daughters and an unhappy husband.Andi comes to the island after being left at the altar and buys a rundown house that she plans to rehab to use as offices and living quarters. What is interesting is that the house is a mess and so is her life. Aside from the fact of her disappointing love life, Andi would seem to have it pretty good.  She is a doctor after all and can afford to redo the house and start a new life. In reality, she comes from a family of super doctors who look down on her for &#8220;bandaging kid&#8217;s knees&#8221;. She has no trust in a man being able to commit to her or even in her finding another man after wasting ten years on her previous guy. She meets Wade, who is the brother of her contractor Zeke.  Sparks fly but he has trust issues as well from his previous marriage and a 12 year old daughter to protect from being hurt. He and Andi keep letting their past rule their present.Boston is another who seems to have it all with a career she loves and a handsome loving husband in Zeke.  Zeke is Wade&#8217;s brother.  But behind her eclectically artistic house, she is trapped in a cycle of sadness and loss that she can&#8217;t break.  Her marriage is at a breaking point and both parties are unable to reach out to the other.Deanna has the perfect house and sees herself as the perfect mother by cooking organically, not allowing sweets or regular TV.  She rigidly controls her whole life but it is like balancing plates on a pole and they are starting to drop. Her husband has reached his point of no return and wants to see her make some changes. Deanna can&#8217;t see why she needs to change except to pacify her husband, not because she needs to for herself.I think that Ms. Mallery has shown a great deal of insight into the issues of low self-esteem, loss of a child, and the devastating long term effects of being a child of an alcoholic. She doesn&#8217;t gloss over the negative aspects of the three women&#8217;s emotional makeup but even at their worst, they are sympathetic. Their friendship has a natural progression. The two spouses behave badly on some level but it is understandable.  Even Wade has reasons for his negative behavior. All six people need to grow emotionally and Ms. Mallery doesn&#8217;t make it look easy, going as far as including the fact that professional help is sometimes the only answer. The ending is totally believable and satisfying.Just a note, I totally loved the &#8220;shout out&#8221; to the series The Kings of California by Maureen Child.
5	1361836800	Andi Gordon was left at the altar.  Boston King and her husband suffered a tragedy.  Deanna Phillips sought to control every aspect of her family's life.These are the stories behind the residents of Blackberry Island's "Three Sisters", three Victorian homes that are on the same street on this little tourist area outside of Seattle.  In Susan Mallery's novel "Three Sisters", these three very different women face their past and make strides toward making a future for themselves and their families as they become friends.This is a more serious book than Mallery's "Fool's Gold" romance series.  "Fool's Gold" is a light and frothy read.  "Three Sisters" delves into issues like grief, mental illness and dysfunctional families.  These may be heavy topics, but Mallery is able to interject humor and develop her characters in a way that is more uplifting than depressing.  Susan Mallery books usually have a happy ending, and "Three Sisters" follows that trend.  However, it's a realistic happy ending.  The reader knows that Andi, Boston and Deanna still face many challenges, but they will have each other and their families to carry them thru.I found "Three Sisters" to be a great read.  It's well written and you quickly begin to really relate to and care about the characters.  They have warts, you can get impatient with them, and even dislike them, but by the end, they are women that you have gotten to know and care about.If you enjoy women's fiction, I recommend that you give "Three Sisters" a try.
5	1361836800	I think the Blackberry Island Novels may be Susan Mallery's greatest books yet.  I have read all of her books and her romances are amazing, but Susan does something special with her more serious novels.  I would definitely put this more in the genre of Women's Fiction, but don't worry, there are romantic storylines.  At the heart of this story, is the deep friendship that is formed between our three heroines, Deanna, Andi and Boston.  I think that Mallery did an amazing job developing the characters and giving us insight into their histories...which have formed their present.  The story made me want to call my best friend and just thank her for always being there for me in my times of need.  Mallery writes about serious, emotional life experiences and makes them relatable, as well as funny at times.  I really found myself caring for these three women and their individual struggles and found myself sad when the story was over.  If you want to read a book that is engaging, charming, emotionally moving and still provides moments of humor, then don't hesitate to buy this book right away.  You won't be disappointed!
5	1361836800	I loved this book! It was so realistic.  Modern day problems faced by 3 very different women. They forge a friendship and come together to fight adversity and overcome the pain and heartache that each has had to face. Through this friendship they help each other to live life to the fullest!  I love the witty dialog!
5	1361836800	I only planned to read the first chapter or two of Three Sisters before going to sleep; next thing I knew I'd read almost half the book.It is so good, so true, so interesting you can't wait to see how everything is going with each of the three main characters.  Three Sisters is very emotional and satisfying.  I hated for the book to end but loved the Epilogue.  I say this after reading every Susan Mallery book and I say it again.....another fabulous read!!!
5	1361836800	The three sisters in this heartwarming novel are actually three beautiful houses standing next to each other on Blackberry Island. One a tumbledown , begging for help to restore it's glory, another restored with total accuracy inside and out to it's Victorian splendor, and another filled with "an eclectic mix of traditional and whimsy " all beautiful, and all have their stories to tell just as their owners do. The details have been told by so many wonderful reviewers, but I will try to add my voice.I loved it. I have no sisters so novels of sister/friends are always a favorite of mine. Andie is the owner of the tumbledown house, begging for new life. So is she. After a bad break up, she packed up and headed for Blackberry Island. Her motto, " Go big or go home.Andie decided to do both". Boston lives in the whimsical home, with fairies and stars painted all through. She is an artist, but suffering a loss her husband and Boston just can't seem to get over. She has misplaced her muse, and very afraid of losing her husband. Deanna is the neighbor with perfect everything! Husband and five adorable girls. Perfection is taking a heavy toll .Three Sisters is a a beautiful story of love, loss and forgiveness. I laughed a lot, cried a little, and didn't want it to end. These three very strong women went from strangers, to friends to sisters. As sisters do, they were there for each other good times and bad.This is an amazing work of women's literature, that has risen to the top of my favorites. I very highly recommend this novel, and can't wait for the next Blackberry Island book.This novel was given to me by the author for an honest review. There was no compensation offered, or accepted.
5	1361836800	Susan Mallery has once again outdone herself. This book is more serious than her others, but was outstanding. Three women who are neighbors are each struggling to get through a tragedy or upset in their life form an unlikely bond that helps pull them through their grief and pain. You should never judge a person on first appearance since you don't know what has happened to that person or what they are going through that makes them the way they are. This is a great read about pain, healing, moving on and the bonds of friendship.
5	1361836800	I loved this book. Susan Mallery has captured yet another facet of life with three women going through different life challenges yet so much alike when it comes to their need for friendship. It would be hard not to find a piece of yourself in this realistic novel. It makes you think of how first impressions are not always true, once we get to really start to know a person our view changes. If you like fiction with meaning, this is the book for you.
