5	1405555200	Got this as a gift for two people, both loved it! Looks just like a lens.
4	1405468800	Great item...love using it...BUT you need to expand breather hole to actually drink out of it
2	1405209600	Does not keep coffee hot/warm for very long. Mouth slot leaks...
1	1405209600	It's just a cup. It doesn't keep the drinks hot or cold. It's not a thermos.
5	1405123200	I got two of these for &#34;thank you&#34; presents for our photographers for our wedding and they LOVED them! So I decided to order one for myself too! :)
4	1405036800	Like it. Very nicely built
5	1404864000	Took a long time to arrive, and smelled like plastic (baking soda removed the odor), but the look and feel are great.  I have had many people ask where they can get one.
4	1404691200	love it!
5	1404691200	Nice look. Perfect size. Sip design is great. Feels good in you hand.
5	1404691200	Keeps my coffee nice and hot, looks great and is a nice conversation starter!
5	1404604800	Got this as a birthday gift for my brother who is a photographer.  Cute cup and seemed heavy duty
5	1404432000	Great mug
1	1404432000	Cap does not stay on tight
5	1404432000	Item was as described, timely shipping
4	1404345600	I gave this as a gift and it was well received, but the recipient uses Cannon lenses, and this replica is of a Nikon lens.  She later bought herself a Cannon lens replica.Make sure you know what lenses the photographer uses before purchasing.  They seem to be biased towards that make, and would appreciate a like model for their mug.
5	1404259200	It's thematic
5	1404259200	I bought this for a gift.  Love this.  Its looks like a real one.
5	1404259200	If you bring this to work, just about anyone will make some comment about this jar. It will take a few seconds for unsuspecting friends to figure out why you drink from a lens.
5	1404172800	I bought this as a gift for a friend who is a photographer. Great mug. The only thing NOT canon about this is that it doesn't have the name on it. Seems very high quality. I don't thing it would survive regular dishwashers, so hand wash only.
5	1404172800	A perfect gift for photographers.
5	1404000000	Love this! I bought one for myself and a friend. It looks just like the real thing (except for the &#34;camen&#34; label :) ). The lid is pretty leakproof-- just don't turn it completely upside down. I've been using mine heavily for ~1.5 years, and a few of the white markings are just now starting to wash off.
1	1403913600	This is NOT a Canon mug. It is a &#34;made in china&#34; knockoff, branded with &#34;Caniam&#34;.I am highly disappointed, do not recommend.
5	1403827200	it was exactly what my daughter wanted. she loved it!we bought her two, they look just like real lenses .
5	1403740800	got this as a gift for my camera lovin' friend. she uses it every morning! a must buy for camera lovers
4	1403654400	I love this mug. I've had several compliments and people really think I'm carrying a lense around. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I expected it to be bigger but it holds over 8 oz, I just drink too much coffee.
5	1403568000	These cups are so cute! For the price and the timing, it was excellent. Got it for a boyfriend's birthday, and it was a hit!
5	1403568000	This mug is a really good one, it keeps your coffee hot for hours it also doesn't leak at all!....many of the coffee mugs out there leak like crazy which makes this a good buy.
5	1403481600	I got this coffee mug as a gift for a co-worker he is into photography and said he has the same lensa for his carmera he really liked the mug.
5	1403222400	But it's fun and a great conversation starter.  I've seen other reviews complain that it doesn't have real &#34;brand&#34; names.  Are you kidding?  It's a freakin' mug.  It holds liquid.  It cleans up well and easily.  And it gets some giggles.  What else do you want?
3	1402963200	The cup did not come with the advertised lid.  I was disappointed, but knew my husband would like it.  He will have to use it at work vs using it as a travel mug.
5	1402876800	Looks real. Is fun to drink from at work with all these wanna be photographers around me. Would like the real one.
2	1402790400	This cup is really small barely holds 8 ounces. Sometimes the lid gets clogged and will hardly let the coffee  come out.Cute idea for the photographer in your family, just not as useful as I had hoped
5	1402617600	My dad loved it when I gave this to him. He had just started his new office job and he is into photography, so I snagged it and he just can't take his eyes off of this whenever he's going to work!
5	1402531200	I bought this for a friend who is into photography & he was tickled pink with the mug.  Very happy.
5	1402444800	I purchased this cup for my 5 year old son to drink his juice from.  This cup does not leak when dropped or when thrown into the air! My family is very pleased with the quality of the cups that we purchased!
3	1402444800	I'd rate this an ok product.I bought my coffee mug/thermos from N&J;'s. When it arrived I tested it for leaks. It leaked from the slide on the lid because the slide does not completely seal. It will even pop back and forth a little with jolting (such as stopping and starting at stop lights on the way to work). Additionally, it was MUCH smaller than I thought it'd be and that was disappointing at first.It also says Caniam. I'm not frustrated at this detail, however. The size doesn't bother me anymore either. I get a lot of comments about it, and I love the way it looks. Originally I took too long to return it, so the seller sent it back to ME. I just decided to keep it after all because it's so cute. It works for me even if I have to baby it a little.
5	1402272000	We loved this item. It was given as a gift to a photographer who loved it as well. Great purchase
5	1402272000	This is just a fun accessory for a photographer like myself.  It is sturdy and keeps my coffee hot or my drink cold.
5	1402185600	I bought this for my son and he remarked how real it looked! It even came with a camera lens bag! Made a great gift!!
5	1402012800	I am Canon guy and love this use it every day for my coffee. No leaks no runs keep coffee hot and great looking too.
4	1402012800	This product came quickly and was exactly as described. The plastic seemed a little flimsy around the screw top but otherwise a great buy!
2	1401926400	Not well made at all. Neat idea but not worth the money. I threw mine away it was because it was so low quality.
5	1401753600	The coffee mug that looks like a camera lens is the perfect gift for my friend who is a reporter and photographer.  She really, really loved it!!!
3	1401753600	Great coffee mug, it actually looks like a lens, bad part is not a good thing to wash it with any scrubs, more like just rinse since the color seem to fade easily
3	1401667200	Its not a great product. If you are a camera freak then go for it. I would suggest to buy a coffee mug from Starbucks with extra $10. You would love them.
5	1401408000	Definitely turns heads when one is drinking out of this classy mug.  The lens almost look real from afar but once you get closer you can immediately tell it's just a mug.  A cool cap to go with it too!
5	1401408000	An awesome and creative gift for someone in your life who loves photography.  Not your every day mug and the lid is perfect for on-the-go.
4	1401408000	Just the right size for a cup of coffee.Fits my car holders.Does not keep my coffee as warm as other thermos cups, but I drink it quicker, so, who cares?
5	1401062400	The item is great! It is a nice size.  I bought two as gifts, both recipients love the mug!!! I would recommend this item.
4	1401062400	I love it! I've pranked so many people by throwing at them my &#34;way too expensive lens&#34;.It holds temperatures -both cold and hot- great. The huge issue for me is that the lid does not have a sip hole, so you have to remove the lid, drink, and put it on again (or just leave the lid somewhere in your table).
5	1400976000	Great value, good quality and a fun gift idea. Had seen on other sites for a higher price  Would buy again
5	1400889600	Bought it as a gift for my lady friend.  She loved it!  Holds a lot of coffee and several people have complemented her on how real it looks.  Great purchase.  Quick shipping and box arrived in was perfect.
4	1400803200	It works well and it has held up well to the daily battling I put it through. I get a lot of compliments and sometimes a confused stare. Haha. I love it, my only complaint is that it doesn't have a way to just sip it with the lid on.
5	1400803200	Like many others, I am a photography enthusiast. I came across this item when I saw it in a colleague. I ordered it straight away without thinking much and so far I am enjoying it a lot.I have the real 24-105 lens so I can say that it is the exact replicate apart from the AF/MF and Image stabilizer buttons (not moving in this one) The manual focus and zoom circles are good rubber replicates that offer a good grasping area. This is important especially when considering this mug has no handle. The most important feature for me is the steel interior. I am picky about what hot liquids touch and simple plastic can leak lots of chemicals so steel is a confidence. If you do not use the lid you can drink your stuff without getting it in touch with any plastic.I think for the price it does not have a great thermos, but it is much better then regular porcelain or glass mugs as well. It doesn't feel hot to touch no matter how hot your coffee is and so we can say it does adequate insulation if not perfect.The most problematic part is the narrow bottom. I know this is so for being an exact replicate but if you are not drinking it on a table or some sort of secured place you may tip it over easily. Additionally, it has been 2 weeks and yet the plastic smell from the external elements have not vanished completely. It might be the ruber rings or the plastic itself, I am not sure but still not funny. It does not say anything but I am sure it is dishwasher safe, however I do not trust the paint of the exterior so much so I wash it in hand without too much heat.Overall, it is something you buy for fun and it is fun. Anyone who is interested in photography would like to have one as the cheapest 'lens' in their collection...
5	1400716800	this was a gift for a friend that had taken some pictures for me.  She loved it, it looks so real, she has gotten several compliants on it.Fast deliverly from the seller, would use again
5	1400630400	This cup is really nice. I wanted to look at all day while I work. I really need 20 oz. coffee mug like this. 11 oz. coffee is small to me.
5	1400630400	I love this mug I use it all the time but it does not work well with pop but its good fr everything else
3	1400630400	Bought this for a friend for her birthday. It's an adorable little cup, but the smell was horrible when I first opened it. I had to wash it a couple times before giving it to her. The lid gets stuck sometimes.
2	1400457600	I ordered 2 of this mugs as a present for my friends ( we live in Miami, and they are coming only to visit us for a couple of days), just to open the boxes and in both of them we are missing the the drinking lids they only came with the regular tops, the description said &#34;with drinking lids&#34;, I send and email to the seller asking for them and they only answered to me to make a return&#8230;.i was so disappointment with that, and with the fact that now my friends have to leave with no lids, i was expecting another answer. So for me theres no next time with this seller&#8230;.
5	1400457600	there has been two people who tought this was a real lens. haha it was great. but you should clean it propertly before you use it.
2	1400371200	Not liking this product at all. I thought thermos wasn't suppose to leak. Well this one does. Cute design but that's about it. I don't recommend at all.
4	1399852800	Its a cool coffee mug, but I was expecting a different cap, that I can drink from there. I received one like a fish eye.
4	1399852800	This mug is great, arrived quickly as described.The lid has a good seal on it so it doesn't leak like many of these kind of mugs tend to do. I would have liked it to be a bit larger, so I would order the next size up next time and that's the only reason for the four star rating. Otherwise, great value and a fun mug for shutterbugs!
5	1399507200	My wife loved and is using it often. It was a bargain compared to other sellers and the is top notch quality
3	1399507200	the lid gasket were all twisted, so i don't know how great the seal was when drinking with lid, but fun mug
4	1399507200	First one was stolen so we bought another.  We like it.  It is an attention getter and conversation starter.  Cool.
5	1399507200	Accurate copy. This matches my Canon lens and I'll have a lot of fun with it. Although I'll have to say my wife was non-plussed when I threw it across the living room.
4	1399420800	I gave this as a gift and it came in handy for the winter. The lids needs to be easier to secure.
4	1399420800	This is a fairly cheaply made product, and you definitely are getting what you pay for. I love this little novelty product and it's perfect for a present. It's not made to last forever.
1	1399334400	The pictures show a lens style drinking mug with a traditional mug top you can drink from. If you order from soundBEATS audio you actually get this: http://www.amazon.com/Thermo-Lens-Mug-Stainless-Refreshments/dp/B00GX4G0GK/ref=pd_rhf_cr_s_cp_4_YJY8?ie=UTF8&refRID;=1R4W0REYH5ZQ5RSTGET3A friend of mine has the mug pictured and its actually really cool, but based on other reviews apparently its really hard to find a seller that can manage to figure out which version of the mug they're actually shipping you though.
5	1399334400	Cute little mug that people keep mistaking as a lense. Holds just enough coffee to get the day going and no matter what I put in it, the temp never changes.
4	1399248000	Good quality, Machine washable,and looks authentic.My only complaint?It's so small! Can only fit a small cup of coffee. If you like a lot of add-ins in your coffee, I recommend you go buy a bigger thermos. Hope this helped!-Kayla xx
5	1399161600	This is very clever. It really does look like a camera lens. I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter, who is an avid photographer, and she loves it.
1	1398729600	not as good quality as I thought, holds liquid don't get me wrong just thought it would be built a little better... oh well its a cup... who cares
5	1398643200	We bought this as a thank you gift to our wedding photographer.  She had a habit of always losing her cup while working.  Needless to say she hasn't lost this one yet
5	1398556800	It is a very good product, it well made and it has very good finishes, good material and size.Thank you.
5	1398470400	This is a super cute mug. So many people thought that it was a camera lens and wanted to know where I got it. The logo is not a cannon but who cares! It doesn't have a lid that has a small opening to drink from, you have to remove the entire lid but it's still adorable!
5	1398297600	This cup is absolutely amazing. It is perfect. It looks just like a camera lens. If you are looking for a review that will help you make you mind up about buying it, here is that review.
5	1398297600	We got this for our son-in-law.  He loves taking pictures and I know he will appreciate this.  Not disappointed at all!
4	1398297600	This is an adorable travel mug that is neither too small nor too large.  It is certainly not for you if you are looking for a large coffee, but if you just need a standard coffee cup that easily fits into a car cupholder that sits directly under the dash (often large drinks run into the dash!) then this is for you.
5	1398211200	Got this  as a gift for my daughter. As soon as she got it out & started using it, she immediately started getting asked where she got it. Her friends wanted one. Though she can't stick it in the microwave, it does hold heat extremely well...she drinks cocoa in it. A great gift for aspiring photographers like her.
5	1398211200	Coworkers love it. Even after almost a year people still complement it. Great convo starter. That being said, it does have some wear and tear, mostly on the rubber, so don't expect it to last years and years. (It is a mug, soo..)
1	1398124800	In the seller's description, it reads, in part, &#34;This is not cheap replica thermos of which exterior is made of PVC plastic. They were created by Canon Canada solely as a giveaway to photographers at Winter Olympics in Vancouver.&#34;The first statement is untrue, as the knobs and sliders seem like they would fall right off, and were glued to the thermos crooked with some of the glue dried around the edges. Thermos slider top was very stiff, and I was afraid I would break it if I tried to move it back and forth. In regards to the second statement, this is highly unlikely, as this item seemed unlikely to last a week in an office setting, much less the rigor of covering the Olympic games.I returned this item for a full refund. (Thanks Amazon!)
2	1398038400	The exterior is ok, it looks like a telephoto lens. The lid is NOT a drinking lid, it screws on and has to be unscrewed to get a drink. Hard to do with one hand. It does not keep coffee hot like a thermos. You get what you pay for. It is a cheap gimick cup.
4	1397779200	I have 2 of these, one from a couple of years back that actually says canonThis one says Caniam which does nothing for the functionality of this cup, but since it doesn't say canon on it, it's just not the same. One star was deducted for that
5	1397692800	This was a hit; great purchase. Very happy with the product and delivery-may have to get another b/c it went over so well
4	1397606400	Absolutely love this. The interior is easy to clean but the exterior grooves can hold dirt that gets difficult to remove.
5	1397606400	my fav coffee cup. it holds about 11 oz of coffee. i wish it could hold more coffee but i still love it!
4	1397606400	The outside of this mug looks dead on like a camera lens. So much so that somebody I showed it to actually thought it was one. The only two things I didn't like about it is the size and the lid. The size is somewhat my error as I thought I was purchasing the larger size. The lid however can be quite difficult to put back on after you remove. Hopefully it works itself out. Overall I would recommend.
5	1397606400	I love the detail that makes the cup look like a real lens. It is easy to drink from and keeps my coffee at a good temperature while I am drinking it. Very nice price too!
5	1397433600	what a cute mug for photography enthusiasts and serves its purpose as described.  fun conversation piece.  may consider purchasing more for gifts.
3	1397433600	let's face, we buy it for looks. However, putting coffee in a stainless steel or plastic cup sucks all the flavor out of the coffee. All one smells is the steel or plastic. No smell  = no taste. I drink water out of it.
5	1397260800	I gave this gift to a friend who is a professional photographer, he loved it! Five stars. Great gift idea.
5	1397174400	I, personally, do not have much of a say in this item. My friend and I are lovers of photography and I thought this would be the perfect gift. She loved it. I assume there are no issues. None that she has told me about, at least. I may have to purchase one some day. If you love unique gifts and photography or even just thermos then I am sure this is a great thing to have!
5	1397174400	I love this mug! i love this product, it is clever and fashionable and it holds your favorite drink, I am not much of a coffee drinker, but I take my shakes all the time.
2	1397088000	after about 6 uses, the lid was not able to be tightened.  the cup, itself, if nice, but you need alarge cup holder.  I'll probably return it if I can
5	1397001600	Fun for coffee and camera people! My husband loves it. Wish we had thought of it. Great mug and fun.
3	1397001600	Nice size and weight, but screw on cover does not tighten.  In fact it can be pulled straight off without much effort.  This product is alright to be used as a cup, but not a travel mug.
5	1396915200	I got this for 2 people as gifts and they were over the moon. This mug looks great and has been getting tons of compliments. Best price I've seen too.
5	1396915200	I bought this as a gift for a friend that is a photographer and she absolutely loved it! Great quality too!
3	1396742400	It's cool as a novelty gift, but I had to super glue one of the buttons back on as soon as I took it out of the box.
5	1396742400	We got this as a gift for a cousin who is just starting out in photography. She loved it -- although at first when she saw the box she thought it was a real camera lens... oops!
5	1396656000	It is the cutest thing I've ever seen! Perfect for a photographer! Picture is exactly how it looks in real life! Love!
5	1396656000	just love this Coffee Mug... I have expected something not as good as it is in reality... it's perfect :) so buy it if you like
4	1396656000	But it says made in china on the bottle.... heh heh heh but it looks so cool! Overall I like it
5	1396656000	Got this for a friend who's a photographer as a graduation gift, it's amazingly light but nice design.  It is smaller then a 12oz but she doesn't mind at all.  Really fast shipping good quality, does say candin instead of cannon but again she doesn't mind.
5	1396656000	He picked up the mug placing it horizontally to examine it as a real Canon lens,of course big surprise, and coffee spilled onto his lap -coffee was not hot enough to burn him! Ha-ha.It definitely is an ice breaker conversation drinking utensil.
5	1396656000	This is so cute for someone that is into taking pictures. They can take it everywhere.. It looked so real that they asked me why I bought such and expensive item until they saw it was a cup...
5	1396569600	It looks like a real camera lens. Just am absolutely happy with it. It was a gift and that person loved it!
1	1396569600	Cup leaks and yet somehow no liquid comes out when you try to sip. I was incredibly disappointed with this product.
5	1396483200	Very realistic & substantial.  My son, for whom I purchased this, is a real camera-buff; he really liked it and is not easily pleased!
1	1396310400	lid on top striped after a month or two.  beverage does not flow smooth .  needs hole to keep pressure equal.
5	1396224000	This is an awesome product.  Great Gift.  As pictured and described.  Very, Very pleased with item.  Thank you!  Love Amazon.com would recommend to friends for sure!
4	1396224000	Great item bought it as a gift for our Uncle who is photographer he really thought it was a cool item.
5	1396051200	When I drink out of this mug, I feel magical&#8230;The only thing that ruined the magic was the little f stop cover falling off&#8230;but then I super glued it back on, and now I feel magical again&#8230;every.single.day.Also I like to take pictures, so this mug is nice for that too.
4	1395964800	It looks like a real lens. I keep trying to focus my tea. Only complaint is I wish it held more tea.
3	1395705600	This is a very nice mug, but the only accurate picture is the one with the box...I wanted a mug that can be used with the lid on, but unfortunately the one I received is the one with the blue " glass" lid and every time I want to drink I have to unscrew the lid...it is not a " thermos with drinking lid" ...or at least that is not what they sent me.
5	1395619200	This travel mug has gotten me SO many compliments everywhere I go. It is very unique, and I can't believe how inexpensive it was. The only issue I would have with it is that it doesn't hold as much liquid as most travel mugs, but that isn't a problem for me anyways.
5	1395619200	perfect gift! bought this for my sister who loves photography. she loves it! its not 100% leak proof but is 99% leak proof. keeps her drinks warm and love the fact theres a slip on top so she doesnt have to unscrew it everytime she needs a drink. had a couple people actually think it was a real lense it was hilarious!! great purchase.!
3	1395619200	I was a little bit disappointed with the artwork on these mugs, it was not done carefully and if you take a closer look at it, well it is disappointing. Other than that at first glance it does look like a camera lens and of course it is a great idea. The product did arrive on time and it was properly packed.
5	1395619200	My gf does photography this is the perfect gift great price too thanks so much she loved it great gift for her
5	1395619200	I bought one of these for each of our daughters who love photography. They loved how they looked and they bring a smile to their lips every time they use them.
1	1395532800	It would be a very nice mug indeed if it didn't give off an incredible noxious smell. The exterior of the mug is made of some kind of rubber or plastic that gives off an incredible stench. I have been continuously soaking my mug in soapy water for the past 2 days with little improvement. I bought two and am now getting to return the one that is still in the packaging.
5	1395446400	Got what I expected but now found one that actually says CANON and wish I had paid more and ordered it instead!
3	1395446400	The mug keeps my coffee hot and the lid stays secure. If that's all you want then get it, but it does not look as much like the 24-105mm f/4L lens as it does on Amazon.
2	1395360000	Its smaller than I expected and the lid doesn't seem to stay very tight so it leaks a little.  There are some similar mugs that have better visual aspects.  Ok for the price but I wouldn't recommend it if you plan on using it often.
5	1395360000	I bought this as a gift for someone, and it is adorable. The sides of the cup have these camera looking buttons and shutter levers and what not. The deco for the cup is so much cuter than the picture shows. I would recommend this item for those who love photography and NEED that cup of joe in the A.M.
1	1395273600	I was happy with my order. Pretty much what I was hopping for except for the top is see through from the top of cup. I would have liked Solid. Rather not have been able to see inside. Just telling you guys who feel the same way. Other than that cute mug.
3	1395273600	My husband purchased this item for himself (he's a videographer), as he spend a lot of time in his car during wedding season. He loves the novelty of the mug, but it can only be hand-washed, at least that is my recommendation. The mug is about a year old and already looks dingy; definitely a novelty/fun/funky/gift item more than a functional and durable item. I don't care for the mug because it can be difficult to hold. Something with a handle would make this product a lot better.
3	1395187200	it is ok for the price ................. not bad  ........ but it could be better ...i wish find better quality
5	1395187200	Got this as a gift for my photography-inclined sister, and she loves it. So far no complaints about the ink. It's really cute and realistic, definitely a great gift. And the lid screws on and all that - totally functional as a mug.
5	1395187200	Good price, nice packaging, beautiful mug.  I was happy with the quality and it promptly arrived to my doorstep.  There are others like this in the market but pricing made me decide for this one
1	1395187200	unless you want to waste your time and money on this product, do not buy this one.it is such a poor quality mug, you won't be able to use it at all. smells really baaaad!
3	1395187200	A fun coffee cup which looks like a camera lens.  I've had fun with my camera buddies when I clean my new &#34;lens&#34; under running tap water.  No handle on the cup though.
5	1395187200	Yes... when the package arrived and she opened it, at first she thought it was a real lens for her camera.  She had a blast with it, and thought it was a really cool idea.I would strongly recommend it for the photography enthusiast in your life :-)(one important note... although I don't think it says so, it looses some of the print on it after a couple of times in the dishwasher).
5	1395100800	I bought this for my step daughter as a gift. She loved it. She's getting into photography, so she was super excited about this cup!
5	1395100800	This came in great time and safe delivery.  Loved the look on her face when we gave it to her as a gift, she loved it.
5	1395100800	I gave it to a camera enthusiast and they loved it.  It is not super large, but it is more for looks than anything.
5	1395100800	It looks so much like an actual camera lens. I love it. I haven't tried the thermos since I got it as a gift but it looks great and feels great and I'm excited to gift it to my photography buff dad who also happens to appreciate coffee.This is such a cool gift and just cool in general to have. I have zero complaints.
5	1395014400	I love it, and there is not much else that I can say about it. If you are thinking of buying it, I would say buy it because its nice and it confuses people when they see you drinking out of it
3	1395014400	I was pretty certain the cup would say Canon,  however I received a Canium. Pretty disappointed about that. Otherwise,  not much to complain about.
5	1394928000	I love this thermos. It is not totally leak proof, but the coolness of it makes it ok. It is so realistic looking. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially camera lovers.
2	1394928000	It's a nice looking thermos but it doesn't keep the beverage hot for a period of time and leaks very easily!
1	1394928000	This product rusts... I had it for less than 3 days, and used it ZERO times... and it now has rust along the inside corners.this item looks very very similar to the real 24-105mm lens, as I do have the canon IS lens. The package it comes with is awesome and able to fool someone just by the outside.make sure you wash this several times.first rinse, I had tons of floating greasy pieces2nd rise, same thing3rd rinse, more floating random pieces.after a hard scrub and 10-20 more rinses with soap and hot hot water, it finally became clear for me
5	1394928000	Good quality as these things go!Top screws on and works!Do not microwave-- plastic, guys, c'mon.x x x
4	1394755200	Sometimes the lid/cover might get stuck upon closing, but other than that the product is great and the quality is superb.
4	1394668800	I use my cup every day... It is holding up very good.  Shipment was really fast, Very happy with with this purchase.
3	1394668800	It is ok. It is very light which I wasn't expecting & the lid squeaks every time you put it on. It looks good though.
5	1394668800	This cup is one of a kind. Want to stand out in the office while having your coffee? Even your not a camera guy it's a great look excellent gift and cool. I love it and believe Amazon has the best price with the free shipping.
1	1394582400	Do not get this product unless you want to use it as a pencil cup. Cute but 'doesn't hold water'.
5	1394582400	I am very happy with this product. Comes as described and It simply works great. Five stars all the way!
4	1394582400	Bought it for a gift.  Recipient was tickled to death with it.  Have no idea about it's actual function.  j
5	1394582400	This thing holds about 12 oz, but its dreamy! A must have or great gift idea for any photographer !
1	1394582400	I purchased this as a gift for my 18 year old daughter as a birthday present. She just recently got accepted into an art institute, and will be studying photography, so I thought this would make the perfect gift. Well I am not happy with this product at all, the inside seperated from the outside and it has started to rust.........all this and only used once! The logo on the top of the lid has also begun to wear away already! I would not recommend this item.
5	1394496000	If you know a person into Photography, then it is a great gift!I liked the quality, feel & look. Came quickly. I would recommend it
4	1394496000	You get what you pay for. The paint will fade soon and it will just be a black mug. until then its a great gift ideal. I have given many.  it is fairly priced i feel for the novelty of it.
5	1394496000	love it.  exactly as described.  would buy again.that's it folks.  nothing more to say.oh happy day oh happy day.
3	1394409600	this cup mug is okay, the paint is going to eventually wash off after a couple of use and its very small. the size is, imagine hows small a cups is. for example if you order a cup from dunkin or starbuck and you order a small coffee well thats the same size has this. very small.
4	1394409600	I will probably buy fifteen more at some point. The ink fades quickly, but I don't even care. It's awesome.
2	1394323200	It's a knock off brand and should have been listed as such.  Canaim instead of canon is printed on it.
2	1394323200	overall its not what i was really expecting to get in the mail... the cup itself it ok but the lid isnt the best, it doesnt always go on properly, also about an inch or so of the bottom is just plastic so u lose space  and it can be a little top heavy because of it...
4	1394323200	I got my photography inclined friend to double take when I poured coffee into this mug.  The mug came branded &#34;Canim&#34; but it looks awfully close to a lens I already own.  It keeps coffee hot for long enough for me to burn myself.  The looks when I drink out of it are priceless.
3	1394236800	Well... couple of things.First of all the printing came off at the first wash...disappointing. Also it spills easily and really doesn't hold very much coffee. It is a clever idea, just not that we'll executed.
5	1394236800	Got this for my sister who is into photography as a gift.  She loved it and the whole family thought it was really neat!  Looks pretty real!
4	1394236800	Such a neat gift idea for any photographer!  This really looks real with lots of details.  I just wish it would have been bigger.
5	1394236800	Bought these for my Brother and his wife. This is the same lens he uses on his camera he LOVED them!
1	1394236800	I ordered two of these. They did not come with drinking lids, therefore they are useless as travel mugs. Not only that, they are different than what is pictured. And then Amazon makes it difficult to return them! Which means I probably won't take the time, so I will probably throw them away.Do yourself a favor - Do Not Order These!
5	1394150400	everyone wants one when they see mines, some I get to trick, and they laugh when they find out it is a mug, I love it will buy from them again...
3	1393977600	I got this as a gift for my partner who is a photographer.  He loved the look and weight of it as it really does look and feel like a real camera lens.  However, when you put the lid on be cautious your hot liquid can still drip out, he thought it was secure so he put it in his bag, hopped on the train and got to work with coffee spilled everywhere!
5	1393977600	Neat idea.  Great gift for camera buffs.  Holds liquids, and I assume solids should you want to carry around a cup with say granola.
5	1393891200	Ordered 2 of these :)For a friend and 1 for me. One was shipped right to my friend with a thank you letter ~ free to add the thank you note !!!We both love them. Great gift tooWould order againThank you
4	1393891200	There are plenty of different versions of this, it seems, so buy one that's 'prime', so you can send it back if it's 'wrong'. Mine was apparently not the 'official' version - it had 'Canon' spelt wrong. But the quality was reasonable, so I hung onto it. Purists might be less than happy, though.
3	1393891200	but it DOES NOT keep coffee hot more than.....an hour.  That disappointed me.  I like it though for the cuteness.
5	1393718400	It's a mug, it holds coffee quite well and it's a fun design; what's not to like? I would buy another.
5	1393718400	My boyfirend loved it. It looks like a real lens. We haven't washed it in the dishwasher and probably wont. (To retain color) but it is a cool mug.
4	1393632000	Gave this to my gf and she has been using it off and on.  I have seen some marks/fading from the dishwasher which is why it isn't 5 stars.  Still an awesome produce and idea!
5	1393632000	Seriously, when I leave this out on the counter and walk through a room, at first glance I always think I've left one of my lens laying around.  It makes me laugh every time!  I don't leave it in the car, I'm afraid someone might believe it's a real lens and break in.
4	1393632000	Bought this as a gift for my husband and he became the talk of the office.  Everyone loves this mug and I am sure more have been sold because of it.
5	1393545600	I ended up buying 5 and all my friends raved about how awesome they are! They seal well and keep coffee warm, not only that but they're super detailed and look exactly like Cannon's 24-105mm lens. Definitely worth the price and make a great, useful, novelty gift for any photographer!
3	1393545600	I liked the way as had this product just bother me that when you receive it I got a small rubber band that brings in the broken heart and you threw the whole aesthetic product form despite not cover superior did not arrive in good condition ... I would give a better comment if I did not have this problem ... I hope that others do not occur to these problems and have a good experience.
5	1393459200	I can't believe people are complaining about this cup because it doesn't say &#34;Canon&#34; on it. it keeps the coffee hot for a long time and it doesn't spill out if you hit a speed bump/pothole/someone else. plus it's a great conversation starter! love this cup!
5	1393459200	I bought this just because of its design. as a photographer the lense cup adds to my collections. Thanks to the designer.
5	1393459200	My best friend loves her coffee and her camera, this was a perfect gift. The mug is just like picture and works great!
1	1393459200	These are cute but they did not come with the lid you can drink with.  They have a lid but not one you can drink from.We wasted our money on these.
2	1393459200	looks awesome! why is my hand so hot while i'm drinking my coffee? because this so-so thing is only somewhat well made and therefore only a little bit good at insulating.  kinda sucks
4	1393459200	works good , a nice little travel cup.keeps coffee hot  for a long while. nice way to travel .a nice conversation piece
4	1393459200	This is really cute, especially for people into photography. It is a little small, but that's no big deal. It had a couple of minor flaws, but again, it was no big deal. I like it.
1	1393372800	I probably read something wrong and maybe... I have no idea... im quite sure I typed in Nikon coffee cup... considering I use a Nikon... not a cannon... I just... It works I guess doesn't really keep coffee hot for  very long...
3	1393286400	Functional travel mug, always makes people do a double take. The one major drawback is the lid, it isn't threaded, just an interlocking lip. When filled with hot liquid, the interior metal expands, making for a loose lock. I use the mug every day.
5	1393286400	I got this for my brother for Christmas, and for grins, wrapped it up in tissue and dropped it in his camera bag.  He found it (as I knew he would), unwrapped it - and for that one, glorious split second, I had him!  Add to that it's a great insulated cup...if you're thinking about it, just do it.
1	1393286400	Liquids just fall out of it- don't buy it.  Once you close the lid the liquid just falls through the top.
4	1393286400	Gave this to my sis in law and she LOVED it.  I was a little sad that they lid I received was not the sip through style as purchased BUT it looked just like a twist off version of the lens (which was pretty cool) and she thought it was most amazing so that was all that mattered.
1	1393200000	THe cheapest materials went into this thing. Canon is spelt Cannam or something far off. I tried to fool my friends with it, but they knew right off the bat since it's not even authentic looking. On the plus side, it holds liquid... so there's that. Would not recommend. Find a more authentic version!
5	1393200000	My sister loves photography and I give her one of these, I thought it was great, not to heavy not to light, probably buy another for my grandpa
5	1393200000	Item was as described and pictured and looks very much like a camera lens. This was a gift. The recipient really wanted the stainless steel interior (not plastic) for health reasons and to keep beverages hot or cold longer. This was the one to buy. I was afraid that it would tip over easily with the small base (compared to the bigger top), but so far, so good - it has not tipped over.  :)  The recipient loves this mug.
5	1393200000	5 stars for price, looks, and for quick shipping. I have a friend who's a photographer and I thought this would be a great gift for him. His eyes lit up as he opened the package and was very happy he got it. thanks.
5	1393200000	Great mug. I bought it as a secret Santa gift for a tea loving photographer. It would make a great stocking stuffer!!
4	1393113600	I have recieved many comments about the mug, it's really nice. Regardless of what is written on it (whether cannon or otherwise), the silver writing starts to disappear when touched. It's an okay, somewhat small mug, but it does the job.
4	1393113600	The 24-105mm lens coffee cup is Great! Its a little bit small but it fits a nice amount of coffee just the perfect size. It looks just like a lens, everyone who saw it thought it was one until i drank my coffee. It works great and looks great i recommend this for anybody.
5	1393027200	I purchased this for my dads birthday over a year ago. My dad can manage to break steel coffee mugs so I didn't have much hope for this as a long term thing. And yet, a year later, it's held up surprisingly well! The inside hasn't stained and the outside and lid are in excellent shape after somewhat rough use. The only downside is it can't go in the dish washer but it's not horrible to handwash. He's really enjoyed it!
1	1393027200	its just a piece of cheap plastic, does not look like in the picture not even worth the price, I would buy this for 1 dollar and use it for my dog.don't buy this its just crap
5	1393027200	I was at a loss when I was shopping for my Step-Father's 2013 Christmas gift. He's the sort of person who's content with quirkiness. (You wouldn't see him walking around without looking like a scene out of Benny and Joon.) When I stumbled upon this, I knew I would get a smile out of him. He's an avid photographer and coffee drinker, so I wasn't I surprised by his reaction Christmas morning.Needless to say, he really enjoys the cup. He's tended to take it with him where ever he goes, so I'd say this was a successful purchase. I give the purchase a Five-star rating.
5	1393027200	If you are into cameras and coffee, you need this.  Buy this gift for your camera buddies and they will love showing it off.
5	1392940800	this is a really unique thermos. keeps the coffee warm as long as it takes me to drink the particular size. I really love it and for the price it's a great value!
5	1392854400	gave them as a birthday gift to  my friend . she loved them she thought they were really cool lol
3	1392768000	I wish I read the reviews before my purchase.  My Travel mug also does not say Cannon it says &#34;Caniam&#34;
5	1392768000	This mug was a gift and my wife loves it!!!! it's so real that she thinks was a real lens.... now i have to buy one.
4	1392681600	I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this novelty mug, given the low price and 'country' of manufacture (not usually known for quality!). Stainless steel liner and wide mouth for easier cleaning. I'd buy another. Recommend, especially if you have a photography-buff friend (which is who I bought it for).
5	1392681600	Bought it for a friend, she loved it! Although I never got to see it out of the box, i'm going to have to buy myself one soon
1	1392681600	I was surprise for the size but the worst thing for me it s leaking and doesn't keep the coffee worm even for 15 mn
5	1392595200	This is such an awesome, unique, inexpensive gift for a photography enthusiast! Looks exactly like a real lens. Excellent quality.
3	1392595200	Alright this looks OK and its much cheaper than others. The lid stays on but it isn't a snug fit. It can leak out the side if not careful due to this. For the price its ehhh... Cheaper than other mugs at Wal-Mart for more money. I bought this because it was smaller and I own a 10oz Kurieg machine. and it fits in the cup location.
5	1392595200	The coffee mug was just as described-  my daughter stated the only thing that would make it better is if it telescoped!! :)
4	1392336000	I love my mug.  I was a little disappointed that it was so small.  It will hold a regular cup of coffee or other drink.  I wish I had purchased a larger size.  Still I love the mug!
4	1392249600	I bought this travel coffee mug for my grandpa this past Christmas. He's really into photography, and I thought it would be funny since he always talks about how he wants this lens and that lens--not to mention that he also loves coffee. When I first got it, I had already known that it did not say Canon on the lens, which is what some of the other reviews complained about. I was really impressed with how this was one of the few products that had a thermos drinking lid and the quality of the stainless steel was pretty decent. My only complain that it's sorta annoying to actually screw the lid back on. The grooves in the cup take awhile to match up with the grooves in the lid, and if you're in a rush, it will take awhile to screw it back on. It takes a lot of time and patience to get the lid on. Overall, I love this product, and I know that my grandpa loves it too.
2	1392249600	The product looks good.  I have used it for about two weeks.  However, based on my experience, it does not keep my coffee warm long enough.  I am, now, look for a coffee mug that will keep my coffee warm for at least 2 hours, if possible.
5	1392163200	It was a gift to my aunt and she had the same camera lens as the mug so she loved to have people find the difference between the two. I think she loves it!
4	1392076800	It's not original canon but its good. It doesn't keep heat that longer as i though it was going to...
2	1391990400	There is a reason why this is only 8 dollars while every other products are at least 20.There is two problems that I got with this product.First, your coffee will leak through your top cover. So make sure you never knock this product with any drinks in it. Now, this is really no big deal to me.What really disgusted me the most is that when I poured hot boiling water to clean this interior, I have found that rust started to form here and there in its interior that is supposed to be &#34;stainless&#34;. I think interior might not be stainless at all...
1	1391990400	Simple its JUNK. Avoid this product. Cheap Knock Off or a good product. Buy the original full size cup from Canon.
2	1391990400	It was smaller than I expected but hey you can always refill it a few times. It does look pretty realistic, or it did until the first wash. I washed it by hand and the white paint on the bottom has already started fading after just the first wash. It also leaks, even when the lid is sealed, and when i close it water squirts up. I would recommend trying another brand and definitely a larger one.
4	1391990400	Great travel mug, and fun that it looks so much like the Canon 24-105 of course without the Canon logos.  As a mug, it's fine though because it's in a lens shape the base is smaller that the top making it a little top heavy.No leaks when drinking.I received two this Christmas, maybe I'll use the second to swap out for a lens when my buddy isn't looking.
5	1391904000	I bought this mug for my husband, he is a photographer. He loved it! It looks just like a camera lens. Keeps the coffee hot too.
3	1391904000	I bought this for my friend and he didn't like it cause it's lousy make, I believe it's a good design but cheap make
4	1391904000	I always wanted one of these lens cups! This one is a great copy of the Canon 20-105mm &#34;L&#34; lens (although it's not officially licensed- so instead of saying &#34;Canon&#34; is says &#34;Canam&#34; lol but that is probably a big reason that it's not as expensive)Over all, the quality seems nice, I recommend only hand-washing this with mild soap because the lettering and other details appear to just be painted on and they may wear off over time, especially if you really scrub it. I haven't had it long, but I haven't had any issues with the top leaking or anything like that, and it appears to be well made.I think this is a perfect gift for the photographer, great for slurping down that coffee while he/she is at a shoot (or more often if like me, sitting in front of a computer editing photos) :D
4	1391904000	I had purchased the virtually the same item before but the lid was just a cover that did not fit very tight. The replication of the body was better though.
4	1391817600	I love this cup. I think it's fancy and people are always trying to figure out if it's a cup or an actual lens that I'm carrying around. It serves as a mystery. The only issue I have about this product is that when you close the sliding mouth cover it shoots your drink into your eye which is very dangerous when driving. Do not drink and drive, or at least close it when driving. Other than that get this mysterious fancy coffee cup.
1	1391817600	I was actually embarrassed when I saw the product come out of the wrapping paper. Really a gift that you would get for someone who really doesn't matter because that's the message that the cheap plastic conveys.
4	1391731200	Its small, like a regular coffee cup. I just keep this at the office :)  I  get a lot of compliments on it
1	1391644800	This is a really piece of crap product. Took weeks to arrive, and I couldn't have been more disappointed with what arrived in the box. Avoid this and go buy a real mug.
4	1391644800	Got this for a friend who thought he had everything for his camera collection, but I got him with this. The funny thing, I think he has the actual lens this was modeled after..It's a shame the switch and dials don't move.. Heck, I would have used the dial at the top as a temperature gauge for the contents. (actually not to hard to build, but probably wouldn't last long.. perhaps a color-changing temp sensor.)
5	1391644800	got it for a gift for my dad, he loves it and uses it all the time. would recommed it to others.
2	1391644800	Cheaply constructed with no finesse and possibly worth 1/4 the money, if that. The &#34;Caniam&#34; is deceptively similar to the Canon logo, but the construction quality leaves plenty to desire. Better coffee mugs can be bought at the price I paid, and beyond the first couple minutes of excitement, the article has no redeeming value. Luckily, I bought it as a gag gift for my brother who is expecting a real lens (which I also bought, as I am not a complete idiot), and I expect the full realization of the eight dollars and fifty cents watching his expressions as he would incredulously assess this &#34;lens&#34;. After that, probably he is going to use it as a desktop pen holder, or water his plants.Pros: CheapCons: Cheap and looks it. I do not expect it to be a working coffee cup at all.
4	1391644800	This is a well put together mug, a lot of people look at it at first confused why im walking around with a camera lens until they see me sip from it, it does attract a lot of attention. I like how the inside is made stainless steel to keep your drinks warm even if it sits for a while it wont get cold. The cap shuts tight and if the mug happens to tip over I wont have to worry about spills. The only problem I had was that the opening I sip from that little part wont stay open and I have to hold it open to drink. This is definitely a gift for anyone who loves photography.
5	1391472000	I got several of these for all the photographers in my life-- good reports from everyone. No leaks, and a quality stainless steel liner. Note these are not gigantic--but that makes them look more realistic!
4	1391472000	was disappointed in the lateness of delivery.  when I ordered it, it was to be here before Christmas.It was a Christmas present.  When we did get it, the person loved it and it was so much like thereal thing.thank you
1	1391472000	The description states its an authentic Canon mug, but the logo printed on it was something completely different.  Very disappointed
4	1391299200	I really like the cup but once you screw the lid on it is hard to get it off.  It seems that EVERY time trying to unscrew the lid, it jumps track and is very difficult to unscrew.
5	1391212800	I love this &#34;mug&#34;.  The lid seals tight, and the slide that covers the hole in the lid fits snugly.  Love the design...very realistic.
3	1391212800	First off. This cup is cool as hell. Lets be real, its not an actual Canon L lens converted in to a mug. It's a knock off that is cool to carry around and show off and start a conversation. The logo on the mug says Canian not Canon. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because there are basically no threads on the interior part of the mug to attach the lid. You just twist the lid around until you feel it &#34;SLIGHTLY&#34; snug even though the lid has threads. Odd. One day I will feel the wrath of this poor design choice but for now I have had no problems. And by the way isn't this thing $7.00? Thats less than a Starbucks basic ceramic/porcelain mug. So get the darn thing and stop being so critical of a $7 novelty....
2	1391212800	This is the coolest travel mug ever.  When it sits on the table with the cover on ... it looks and feels like a real camera lens.  It is awesome.However, you buy a travel mug so you, can, um, travel ... and that is where the problems come in.No matter how loose or tight you put the cover on, it leaks.  And, since it is being used for hot tea ... leaking hot tea is not fun.The only reason I didnt give it a rating of 1 is because of the cool factor ... but I cannot recommend this mug if you need it for travel
4	1391212800	I bought this as a birthday present for my wife.  She loved it.  Sadly, it did not arrive before her birthday.  I actually had to contact the seller and have them resend it, since the first never arrived.  The only thing my wife doesn't completely love about it is the fact that it can take several tries to get the lid to sit properly.  The lid screws on, and apparently, it can be a challenge to get the top and bottom to seat correctly.
5	1391126400	I love this cup, looks like a lens and it doubles a to go cup! One of my friends saw it near an edge and were like, Oh my god your lens is falling!
4	1391126400	I was thrilled upon receiving the mug. It looks just like a camera and is pretty sturdy and well-made. I have yet to use it, but I'm assuming and hoping that the quality for drinking will be the same as the aesthetic quality. If so, then this product deserves a 5 star rating.
5	1391126400	Love the mug , but disappointed that it does not have Canon logo, if you wantgoo do not order.
2	1391126400	Doesn't say Canon says Caniam! It also leaks. Its kind of hard to drink from. It also smells kind of funny
4	1391126400	the only thing in my case is that the rubber it is not strait.But I will by it again.
5	1391040000	got this for my dad as a gift and he loves it. we are both photographers and this is perfect. great buy for sure!
4	1391040000	Loses heat quickly and is a little small but looks exactly like the picture and fools people from afar. Love!
3	1391040000	I'm a photography nut, and have a &#34;ton&#34; [actually, about 35] of lenses, and the first thing that entered my mind [besides needing my first of coffee in the morning] was&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Think twice before leaving this in your vehicle.Simply put, a thief might think that this is the real thing [an expensive camera lens], and break &#34;something&#34; in order to get inside, and relieve you of your &#34;valuable&#34; possession. Of course, we both know that the dollar number isn't a big deal, but your car insurance, plus the &#34;breezy&#34; factor that you may not have a passenger side window&#8230;might be more than enough to consider jus' keeping this product in your home.Anyway, thought I'd mention it; cute idea, though! :)
5	1390953600	The mug looks amazingly like a real camera lens.  Fits great in most cup holders and keeps the coffee hot.  Thanks for a great product.
4	1390953600	This was the perfect gift for my photographer brother-in-law.  He is a big coffee drinker and carries this mug every morning.  Coffee stays hot and the design gives him pleasure.
5	1390867200	she like the novelty of the item but other coffee cups she already had have more features so guest she likes that better
5	1390780800	The mug is well made, nice stainless steel inner lining. My sister is a photography enthusiast and this was a very popular gift!
5	1390780800	Product was exactly as was in picture!! I gave it as a Christmas gift to a hobby photographer. He loved it and drank from the mug every morning. The mug was a great design. Its a perfect thoughtful and creative gift.
2	1390780800	after reading reviews  about mug not having canon logo, I purchased it more for conversation piece than anything else.its o.k but I will never use it to drink from
4	1390780800	Christmas gift. this cup is different never seen one like it until now it was appreciated hoping to get more
3	1390694400	nice cup with only reasonable quality as what you pay for.no so bad. may give it a try if you are not so into good quality
3	1390608000	not satisfied with the quality, there's visible dried glue and already fading paint, mind you i just opened it but other than that it's fine, usable atleast.
5	1390608000	I like coffee, and take in these mug me would seem somewhat out of the ordinary ...also is a good presentation, and it was feasible to give as gifts
5	1390521600	I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Anyone who is into photography would appreciate it and use it.
4	1390521600	I think this is more of a fun &#34;gag&#34; gift than an actual traveling cup, as it's not the most secure.
3	1390521600	This really looks like a camera lens. On close inspection one would see on the outside that the switches don't work and it's generic wording, not a Canon. And as a mug it leaves a lot to be desired, there isn't a lot of room, and it's not the greatest quality. But it was fun to pick up and great as a gift for a camera person. As for drinking coffees and such? Nah, I'll pass.
5	1390435200	Really great item and good shipping :) I'm really satisfied by the product. Don't hesitate to buy it if you're fan of coffee and cinema
4	1390435200	There was an issue with my purchase in the beginning, but they handled everything rather well and got me my product as fast as they could! It was just how explained. Good quality. The person I gave to it for a gift loved it a lot as well :)
3	1390435200	I got this for my roommate who is a photographer. It says canmium not cannon, and honestly I think they all say that. I looked all around for the illusive cannon mug, and every one I found, reviews all said &#34;this says canium, not cannon...&#34; I don't mind that too much, and my friend likes it. It's pretty small, and the opening in the lid is pretty hard to open, but It's still a fun mug. I wouldn't get it for practicality, but It's a unique collectable for any photographer none the less
5	1390348800	This product is wonderful and looks very much like the real thing. In case you were wondering, all of the camera &#34;features&#34; are immobile. But that really doesn't make a difference to me.
3	1390348800	I offered this 24-105mm Travel Coffee Mug as a gift because it's original and esthetically pleasing. But screwing the lid takes some practice, if you don't do it at the perfect angle, it will jam and be hard to remove. Otherwise, it's the perfect gift for a photographer.
5	1390262400	Got this for my sister in law for her birthday. She loved it. A must have for anyone that's a photographer.
5	1390262400	Being a amateur photographer had to have this cup, I really like it and it is not a cheaply made. It is my on the road coffee cup, It arrived two days ahead of schedule
4	1390262400	it's a little short, just a little, but details are awesomei like soo much, i think i'll buy another onethank you
3	1390176000	The idea is very novel, to drink from lens ... However the quality of build is not so good. It has a rubbery feel on the exterior and the metal inside is not so smooth.
5	1390176000	Love this. I bought it for my dad for Christmas, because we're both photographers. He opened it and got a funny smile on his face... the next gift I opened was from him, and sure enough- it was one of these. Needless to say, we bought each other what we would have wanted to receive! I don't think I've used another mug since I received this one, and I'm a daily coffee drinker!
5	1390003200	This was purchased as a gift for a photographer- she loved it.  Great gift!  Looks like a real lens! So far no complaints!
1	1390003200	I received a knockoff version of the Canon photo lens mug. It's not what was pictured and not what I ordered. But to return it would be would probably be more trouble than it's worth.  Product itself isn't that bad, it's just not what I thought I was going to get. Considering I ordered as a gift for someone it's disappointing because it looks like I bought the knockoff version of something really cool.
2	1390003200	Not Canon brand. Says Canaim as other reviewers have notes. Leaked right out of the box when I tilted it upside down. Smells a little like weird plastic. Gets two stars because it still looks cool and has a metal interior. I like to hand it to people and pretend to drop it to freak them out. Muahahaha.
5	1389916800	Very cool gift idea - especially to a photo bug. Really practical gift that keeps your drink warm.  Simply loved it!
5	1389830400	great price for great stuff.Really cheap.Good quality and fast shipping.I would recommend to anyone.Big enough for my morning coffee
5	1389830400	I love it! Everybody else who saw it, all gave me complement on my coffee cup! So it's a great buy!
4	1389830400	This is not the highest quality product, but I have no issues with quality vs. price. If you are wanting a high quality mug, look somewhere else, but if you want something fun and funny, this is a great mug.
5	1389830400	This was supposed to be a Christmas present, and I had placed the order rather late.  I was initially worried that it wouldn't come in on time for Christmas, but it did! The product was far more realistic than I could have hoped for, it rocks! It looks just like the picture!
5	1389830400	I actually own the real lens that this mug replicates (very well, I must add!) and I gotta say I love it.It's a bit smaller than I thought but fits well in the hand. Plus you can tell that it's very well made and is lined with stainless steel on the inside, not plastic (like cheaper mugs).I always reach for this mug in the cabinet for my morning coffee, and I'm sure you will too!
5	1389830400	Really a great gift and pretty inexpensive!  Got it for Christmas for my brother who is a photographer, and he thought it was great!
5	1389830400	A fun novelty, and also a very functional cup.  This one seemed to be the best price for a cup that really looks very much like the canon lens.
4	1389744000	I bought this mug for my sister which is starting her own photography business. She loves it and says it looks true to the Nikon lens she eventually wants to buy. She said it keeps her cup of joe nice and hot and is a decent size. She likes carrying it around as it is a great talking point and conversation starter to talk about her new business. I think for what you get its a great price.
5	1389744000	i bought this for a christmas gift for myself and i love everything about it. as a photographer i was very surprised with the details and how real it looks!
5	1389744000	Veyry happy with this gift I got for myself at Christmas.  Only wish it came with cleaning directions, not sure if it is dishwasher safe and that would be nice to know.  For now, I'm hand washing it
5	1389744000	Purchased this item for my son as a gift because he is a photographer.  I was impressed with the detail and my son stated that it is a great replica of the original product.
5	1389657600	The mug works exactly as expected.  My granddaughter, who uses it while away from home for college classes, says it is &#34;PERFECT&#34;.
2	1389657600	The mug does not keep my drink hot. My drink goes cold within five minutes or less. Especially coffee drinks.
5	1389657600	How many ounces is the cup ? And is it a lid that you can drink from. I appreciate it guys thanks
5	1389657600	Great gift item.  Great look of reality.  Nice for a Christmas gift for a camera enthusiast. Fun novelty item that is unique and interesting.
1	1389657600	Picture angle and font used to spell &#34;Canian&#34; appears to mislead you as to what you are buying. There are products that have the correct Canon logo, and others either blank or with a clearly different logo in the picture and product; make sure you KNOW what you are ordering, rather than take a chance. This product returned ASAP.
5	1389657600	I gave it as a present and he loved it! Super cool design! I would buy it again for sure
4	1389571200	I bought this mug for my husband, a sports photographer. He loved it!  Great conversation starter, especially if he uses it on the sidelines to have hot chocolate on cold game days.  Only minor downside is the base.  Wish it were a tad wider, it has tipped easily when it wasn't full.I would recommend for the photo enthusiast.
5	1389571200	The mug really looks like a camera lens.  It was a great gift for my dad who has been taking pictures for as long as I can remember!
5	1389571200	These mugs are suprisingly detailed, and look exactly like an actual camera lens. Nicely done, and they feel like qualiy.
4	1389571200	The cup loopks great. Purchased to give as a gift. Not sure of its function. I did get the reactin i wanted from the receiver. Planning to purchase a few more.
1	1389571200	I ordered this product as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed when I finally received it in the mail.  I was under the impression it was a &#34;Canon&#34; and wasn't happy when I read Caniam on the side of the mug instead.  Another issue I ran into was the mouth piece on the mug.  It was extremely difficult to open and close, as was the lid.  I would not recommend buying this product to anyone.
3	1389571200	It does hold the coffee and keep it warm, but I wish it were dishwasher safe. you have to be carefull when cleaning because the words or the decorations wash off either in dishwasher or scrubbing.
3	1389571200	cup looks really cool, made pretty solid. just wish the groves for the lid and cup to join were both metal, after a while the lid starts to turn like its stripped but thats because its plastic on metal. but other than that its cool.
3	1389484800	I thought these were the official Canon mugs but they aren't.  They look reasonable and have a stainless liner.  The screw on cap is a big plus.  Doesn't say dishwasher safe which is a bummer.
5	1389484800	I gave this as a birthday gift to a photographer friend of mine. He really likes it! I'd buy one for myself next time, too!
5	1389484800	I got it for my boyfriends uncle for a christmas present. He loved it! Would recommend this product to everyone.
2	1389484800	This is a cute item and definitely perfect for me as a photographer, but after a week and just a few uses, the lid stopped screwing on tightly. Just randomly. This item is very cheap so I don't really recommend it to anyone who wants a coffee mug they can use regularly. Fortunately I was able to get a refund. I love Amazon!
4	1389484800	The mug is good. Love every detail on it fools the eye unto thinking it is a real lens. The only problem I had was the drinking piece wad hard to open .
5	1389484800	Bought as a present for a photographer friend. To do it over, I'd have bought a larger one, but this one was of good quality and shipping was FAST.Thanks!
5	1389398400	Hahaha!!!! booooy!!! i had fun with this one in my photography class!!! from a distance, this coffee mug looks so look a like to an actual camera lens, that people tend to look at you with a &#34;whattt?!?!&#34; face. haha If you want to have a fun time with this product heres what you do . have your camera with you, and pretend your changing your dslr lens, once you do, &#34;drop the mug&#34;!!!  you'll get a funny reactions around you XD.. But any who, i am now using it for my daily coffee, and surprise it can keep it nice and hot for a while :)Buy it!!!!!
5	1389312000	This Item is awesome best coffee mug ever I'll deffently get another one sky to have two of them on the go
4	1389225600	I buy this cup and give it to my litter sister as a gift. She like it because she also like the slr camera. But I don't have money to buy a slr camera for her, lol~~
5	1389225600	This was a gift for the family camera buffs. It looks very much like a real cannon camera lens and everyone loved it.
5	1389225600	I wouldn't carry it day to day for beverages, just because I'd like to keep it looking nice. Makes for a nice pencil holder.
5	1389225600	this was a great gift purchase, and the receiver loved the gift and thought it was great. A great value
5	1389225600	My nephew got a superb camera for Christmas, so I got him this &#34;cooler&#34;, along with the F-Stop watch, to enhance the environment. He found it very cool.
4	1389225600	Like a few other reviewers have previously stated, the cup I too received does say CANAIM on it instead of CANON, which if it were to say CANON I would think there would be some copyright issues going on, no? Either way, it still looks quite awesome.The sip lid is a bit stiff, and when shut after sipping, it can flick liquid specks onto your face or into the air and on surrounding things.. So close it slowly.True to color, and the details on the sides are of quality. Switches on sides do not move back and forth though.Filled it with water and did a leaking test the first day I received it. There is a hole on the sip lid and it does leak liquids when it is upside down and shakened. It leaked very, very slowly when just left upside down with no shaking movements, so that's a plus.I'd recommend this, it's a sturdy cup! Wish it was bigger though, but it's capable of holding a medium sized coffee drink from most coffee businesses. Good for cutting back on caffeine ;-)
4	1389139200	The product itself is very good, and keeps the coffee warm for a substantial time. However, I ordered the cup well before Christmas, (possibly around December 10th..) and got it well after new years (around Jan. 3rd). Thankfully I was giving the cup to my Mom, and had a few other big items to give her, so she didn't mind it being a late Christmas gift.In their defense it did say it would take 15-30 business days.Good cup overall. But don't buy it if you need it this week. :)
4	1389139200	Coolest thing ever! I bought this because a friend of. One had it and I wanted it. I even bought one for another friend of mine.
5	1389139200	Gave this to a friend who is a shutter bug. He has the lens that this mug copies and got a real kick out of it.
5	1389139200	Bought this as a Christmas gift for someone. Have no idea how good the product is but no complaints so far. I liked the novelty of it.
2	1389139200	It took less than a week to deliver which was fabulous. However, the quality of the mug was not as well as expected. The words (brand name) on the lids is almost gone after a few times of washing.  And the shape of the mug is a little off too.  Overall, I think it is a little overpriced for what was worth.
5	1389139200	Good quality,  doesnt leek, and my kids loved it in their stocking this year! I will be buying more soon!
5	1389052800	it's a birthday gift for my bf, he love to take photos or something like that, so he love this cup so much
2	1389052800	it does not contain much coffee. the tap does not close tightly or safely.however, the look is great and attention to details is great. I really enjoy looking at this mug! it can be a great decor.
5	1388966400	Looks like the real thing. Print isn't as detailed as the actual lens, but the overall appeal is awesome! Bargain deal!
1	1388966400	I specifically chose this product/seller because other reviewers said that it came as a Canon lens. This was not the case...it is a CANIUM lens. Don't waste your money if you are looking for an authentic Canon lens!!!
5	1388966400	very clever design.  looks just like my camera lens.  my daughter gave it to me as a gift. works great
5	1388966400	I love this thing. Bought it for my dad for Christmas. He's a photographer by hobby and I thought it was a very unique gift. Very accurate.... awesome mug, awesome quality. Love this- I want one for myself now! :)
5	1388966400	This is a great item for any photography enthusiast in the family. Good portion and finely detailed! Five Stars for this great novelty item!
5	1388707200	Great gift idea ! My photography friend is going to love it..I got it for a great price too! A must buy
5	1388707200	Strong PCV smellVery cuteLose the Canon knock off name ...Why is Made in China so prominate?A win for me...
5	1388707200	I purchased two of these for fellow photography friends of mine and they are darling! I was also surprised with one for myself from my mom. I use it every morning for my coffee. Love it.
4	1388707200	Looks a lot like the Canon lens unless you look closely and the word Canon is mispelled.  All in all, pretty neat.
5	1388620800	If you, your friend, or loved one is into cameras - BUY THIS ITEM!It looks just like a real camera lens.  The construction is solid, it is big and just plain looks cool.An excellent novelty for the camera lover!
4	1388620800	I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend since she is a photography major. She dug it and uses it regularly.
5	1388620800	I bought 2 of these!  Love them!  I gave them both as gifts and both people went crazy over them!
5	1388620800	I gave this to my husband as a stocking stuffer--he loves it! I am constantly warming my coffee in the microwave (obviously I'm not a coffee connoisseur=), so this wouldn't work for me as it isn't microwaveable. Highly recommended for the photographer in your circle of friends & family.Pros: The mug keeps coffee warm; it doesn't leak; it fits nicely in our auto cup holder; dishwasher safe; fits under our one cup coffee maker.Cons: Not microwavable.
4	1388620800	The cup looks exactly like a long lens, complete with lens hood (cover). The cup is ceramic. I bought some as gifts for Christmas.
5	1388620800	I bought this for a photographer friend and he loved it.  It looks exactly like the real one he has at home.  It was a great buy.
4	1388620800	The mug/cup looks like an actual lens and I love it! I do not recommend washing the outside of the cup, however, because the paint may come off after repeated washes. The one I received does say 'Caniam' like many others but I do not mind much. I would defiantly recommend!
5	1388620800	This is awesome!!! And cool to have anywhere ! Everyone just looks at it and says &#34; hey what's that&#34; jajajajaja love it!
4	1388534400	My dad loved this mug! Besides not actually saying Canon (which he didn't notice it tell I pointed it out), it looks very close to a real lens. He actually has this size of lens and was comparing them side to side, and at first glance it was hard to pick the real one! The insulating liner gives it a nice realistic heft and the lid fit nice and tight. He carried it around all day on Christmas.  :)
5	1388534400	This has been a hit gift!  She has so much fun with it AND it is a quality mug keeping her tea warm and handy.
5	1388534400	Got this for my bf for a little Christmas present and he loved it - thought it was the coolest thing! It's small, but just the right size for about 8 or 9 oz of coffee.
5	1388534400	My friend loves it! I got it for a present and it looks like the real thing, it was a little shorter than I expected; I was think more of a taller travel coffee mug this realistically is a cup of coffee.
4	1388534400	Like the cup, but smaller than I thought. Got it for a photographer and can't wait to see her reaction.
5	1388448000	I bought this because I own the actual lens. It looks like the lens, is solidly built and keeps my coffee warm. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a travel mug with a story.
4	1388361600	This was a gift for my husband, an amateur photographer.  He got a kick out of it and really thought it was neat. He drinks several cups of coffee a day and within months the seal wore out and the lid stopped staying on without leaking. Having said that, he still enjoys using it at home without the lid.
1	1388361600	While it was a cool design, the outside of this mug was cracked when delivered. It was not worth the effort to even return it.
5	1388361600	This made for a FUN gift.  However, I will say that we had a number of laughs over the fact that the side of the lens reads &#34;Canian&#34; instead of &#34;Canon&#34; :)
2	1388361600	I was hoping to find a CANON lens coffee mug and was so excited when I found this. No where did it say it was a non CANON lens. To my surprise it did not say CANON when I opened up the box. It is to bad because I was hoping to give it as a gift. Make sure you look at it very carefully before you buy it.
5	1388361600	I bought this for my granddaughter, who has her own photography business.  Having a travel mug that recognizes her skill is great.  OK, the mug itself...it is sturdy, and fits great in a car cupholder. I like that it isn't too tall, so it is stable.  My granddaughter was impressed with how real it looks.  Looks count, but I also like that it is a stainless steel interior and has a tight fitting lid seal.  This will help keep that cup of coffee hot on these cold mornings.This would make a great functional accessory for any shutterbug, pro or weekend hobbyist.
5	1388188800	I bought this for my 22 year old daughter for Christmas. It was her favorite gift! She got more excited about this cup than anything else she opened. Absolutely loved it! And it really is beautiful.
5	1388188800	i bought this for my fiance because she is a photographer. she loved it and uses it all the time. that means i love it and recommend it to all. its great.
1	1388188800	I did order a Lens Cup but the one that i received was not the Travel coffee Mug/Thermos with Drinking lid.  I received a cup with a lid but definitely not the travel cup.
3	1388188800	The buttons do not move and it does not say canon on the cup. This was a present and I am happy they are understanding.
5	1388188800	I got this as a little something extra for my wife to open at Christmas. I think that this may be her favorite gift out of all.
5	1388188800	I am a photographer and I love this mug. It wants to make you go shot more pictures. Get and you will get inspired. It's a true reminder of our craft. That's if you love photography.
5	1388102400	I bought this for my sister and my sister-in-law for Christmas, and they loved it.  The price was great for the quality of the product, and for the size.
1	1388102400	I bought this from the seller "3Cshop" whoever and wherever they are. They kept saying it was delivered and that someone signed for it, I checked with my son and he didn't get it, then they said they delivered it to a neighbor, (neighbor not only didn't sign for it but he didn't know what my son was talking about), then they said check the "post" (which I guess means the post office????), checked with them...nobody knows anything about signing for anything.  I asked "the name of the person who signed for it" they didn't know it only that someone signed for it and it was delivered.  I told them to send a new mug.  They responded with "I have to give them time to solve this problem. Best regards. Merry Christmas"  STILL NO MUG!  My son said forget the mug, Xmas is over!  :(
5	1388102400	It's exactly like the picture and serves the purpose it was made for. It's nice to order something online with no idea what you'll actually expect and it meets or exceeds expectations, therefore it's perfect!
3	1388102400	Really cute idea.  I guess I didn't realize how small it would be, but it's still a great gift.  Fooled him at first; he thought it was a new lens for his camera.
5	1388016000	This was a gift package for my daughter who is saving for this exact, real lens for her camera. She loved it, rather bittersweet as she really wants this lens lol Big hit with the grandchildren, too lol
5	1388016000	i bought this for my mom and she says shes likes it and will use it at work! its kinda deep and she loves taking pictures. i believe it works for both hot and cold beverages but check that out to be sure. i would still recommend this anyway to anyone!
3	1388016000	The mug isnt that big and the text on it isnt as good as seen in the pictures. Its not bad overall but can be better
5	1387929600	If you have a photographer in your circle, this makes a great gift!  The pictures really do not do it justice.  The details are nice.  The cup is sturdy and large and actually looks like a lens! Pretty cool.
5	1387929600	This is my favorite coffee mug I own! I get so many compliments carrying this thing around. My only complaint is it gets water stuck inside of it and there's no way to get it out, it's not that big of a deal though.
4	1387929600	I ordered this product a few months ago for my friend who absolutely loves photography and coffee. Turns out this was the perfect item to buy because she loved it! Please note, that since I ordered it as a gift, it was pre-wrapped and I never was able to look at the contents of the package. (However, I did take a look after she opened it, thus how I am able to make this review very accurately)I can confirm that this travel mug is a 12oz mug that will fit your car's cup holder. The realism of this cup is incredible and well done. But now here is where I heed you my warning: Be careful on which buyer you choose! Some of them put a different label on the cap of the mug, while some actually put Canon label on the cap. I was fortunate enough to get the Canon one, but I am sure the logo won't matter too much. It is still a very unique piece to own (for yourself or as a gift).I highly recommend this to coffee enthusiasts and photographers all around. This makes a wonderful conversation piece and hopefully you will like it as much as I did.
4	1387843200	One of the coolest coffee mugs i've ever seen.  I can't speak for how well it functions as a coffee mug though, because my wife got to be a Secret Santa gift for a co-worker.
4	1387756800	A great conversation piece. Gave it 4 stars because the cup is not insulated and hot products don't stay hot for long.  I hand wash this because it most likely won't hold up in a dishwasher.  Otherwise, buy it and have some fun.
5	1387756800	Looks and feels so real!!! My partner is a photographer and he wanted a mug for Christmas and I think he is going to be blown away with this! Yeah it doesn't have the real Canon name, but duh Canon is not going to ok them to use their name for a coffee mug... If feels exactly like a lens and has the same weight too! Couldn't be happier so far!! Yet again amazon you have such great deals it's hard to say no!! Less than $11 with shipping, can't beat that!!!! It seems like it would be a good $25 at least!.. Nope! Hey get yourself 2 for less than $25!..
1	1387584000	Cup did not come with drinking lid but with a solid screw top lid. I ordered two mug, received one.
5	1387584000	This is a perfect gift for photographers you know!  It really does look like a camera lens!  Delivery was good and the quality is excellent.
5	1387497600	My boyfriend is into photography and drinks a ridiculous amount of tea. He loved this mug so much and got a crazy amount of compliments on it. Bottom line: its awesome
4	1387497600	I ordered this twice actually as presents for two different photographer associates of mine. Both really liked the idea and enjoyed them. It's a little sad they aren't actually licensed to use the official Canon logo but otherwise I have had no problems with them.
5	1387411200	Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.
5	1387411200	My husband is a photography buff.  He loves the cup and uses whenever he can.  We bought a second to give as a gift
5	1387411200	I gave this to my photographer friend and she uses it for tea in the morning.  The only thing that's weird about it is the shape on the outside...but it seems to work as a nice grip.  Seems like it will hold up well though.
3	1387411200	It's okay, no real complaints. Looked just like the picture. I saw that a few people said that theirs said &#34;Canon&#34; but mine says Caniam or something like that and none of the switches move.
4	1387411200	For s**** and giggles I bought this for my husband the photographer. It really does look like a lense, but for a travel mug it's small.
5	1387324800	I bought this for my sister as a present and am very excited to give it to her! She is a photographer and I really think she will enjoy it. It also seems like a pretty good quality and for the money is a great buy! Very Cute!
2	1387324800	Bought this as a gift. Very disappointed in the size. Didn't really care that it said Canmain instead on Canon but really disappointed in the size, won't hold but a few sips of anything. Look for the larger size especially for the price.
5	1387238400	Got here by the date they told me! It is sturdy and looks like a real lens! I am sure my photographer friend will get a kick out of it!
5	1387238400	I bought this for myself and I have to say it is really cool. It says &#34;Caniam&#34; where a normal Cannon lens would say &#34;Cannon&#34; but that doesn't bother me. It isn't distracting, no one notices. I do need to advise that it probably isn't dishwasher safe since after I put it in the dishwasher the text at the top rubbed off and it sounds like a little bit of water got in somewhere. Other than that I love my new coffee tumbler.
5	1387238400	It is really cute and my daughter who is a photographer loved it, so that is all that matters. I just wish it held more.
3	1387238400	I have to just use it as a mug, not a reliable travel mug. It says &#34;caniam&#34; not canon. functional but not the best product out there by far
5	1387238400	Bought it as a gift for a photographer friend and she loved it! Looks very realistic and is easy to clean!
3	1387238400	It's a gift. I thought it would be really cool to give to a camera buff.Will rate again when they receive it.
2	1387152000	When I purchased this item, I read other reviews that stated that this product is not a Canon product, so I knew that it was a Canium product.  That being said, the details were poorly printed/painted onto the product.  This problem, however, is manageable. What bothers me the most about this product is that I purchased it for use as a coffee mug, yet the lid is extremely difficult to open/close. It requires a great deal of force, and I actually split the end of my nail once when I attempted to open it. If you would like to give this to a camera enthusiast as a cheap cup or pencil holder, it would be somewhat alright, but do not purchase it with the intent of receiving a well-crafted mug with an easy-access lid.
4	1386979200	bought this for my friend for xmas. She really enjoyed it. The only thing is that the paint for the parts was a little sloppy and could've been a little neater. She still liked it though.
5	1386979200	if your a big coffee drinker get the bigger one this does not hold a lot of coffee, however i dont drink alot of coffee so its great for me, i love it!!
5	1386979200	I bought this for my daughter in law for her birthday, but couldn't wait to give it to her.She loves photographyand this was a perfect gift for her
5	1386892800	Wow like these a lot. So pleased with them. Bought as gifts for stockings, and way better than i was thinking would show up. Always hope for the best...Honest, reliable seller. Will buy from again. Wonderful gift, and for yourself. Good product
5	1386806400	I ordered from W&H (?) and it came with the Canon logo and made Japan.  It has the steel interior and screw top lid.  I think it is good quality for the amount paid.  Wish I could submit photo.
5	1386806400	Was a great gift.  The recipient was absolutely delighted to add it to her photography collection.  It looks very realistic.
4	1386806400	Adorable mug! Definitely not the greatest quality & to does say the wrong name on the side but you can't beat the price and it's a very cute gift
5	1386806400	The mug is exactly how the box and description portrays it. If you're in to photography, you should definitely get this mug!
1	1386720000	Terrible quality,  misspelled, reeks of cheap plastic counter fit that is just cheap enough to not make it worth returning.  Buyer beware.
5	1386720000	Absolutely adorable!!  I got these mugs as gifts for my aunt and uncle who are photographers.  When I opened the box, they looked so real that I actually thought to myself, &#34;Did someone order a zoom lense for my camera?&#34;  I think I might get one for myself!  Great gift for all the photographers in your life.
5	1386720000	Bought this for a photographer friend. She loves it! It's not as tall as a lot of them which made it perfect for those who don't drink a ton of coffee. Plus, a lot of people thought it was a real lens! haha
3	1386633600	Received as a gift, loved the novelty of it. But it didn't last very long because water got between the steel liner and plastic shell during washing (in dishwasher) and I could nt get it out. Also, washing took off the white lettering over time.
4	1386633600	it came just like the pictures. I thought it came pretty poorly because for being shipped from china, it was only wrapped in a blue plastic bag-type, but nothing was broken and it's exactly what the picture says it is :)
5	1386547200	The coffee cup lens looks exactly as pictured, looks like a real camera lens.  It makes the perfect Christmas present for someone who is a photographer!
1	1386547200	Do not buy from Bits & Pieces - it is also a cheap imitation.  I received the nice version as a gift and tried ordering one for a friend.  The box looked the same so assumed that is what I was getting.  Not so!  Be sure to look for the stainless steel liner and the drinking lid.
5	1386547200	I get lots of positive comments when I use this cup, it is definitely an eye catcher and conversation starter
4	1386460800	Excellent gift for the Camera-guru! Didn't open it, but i got one for my sister (who loved it!) so i got another for a friend of mine! pleased with the size of it, lid keeps it snug and warm. marvelous detail, and was very excited when i found this!
5	1386374400	Smaller than I thought, but that would be my fault for not reading the numbers. Looks like the numbers will wear off after a couple washes but oh well.
5	1386288000	I love it! I bought this for my photog friend as a Christmas gift and it is perfect - exactly as picture and she is going to be absolutely thrilled when she sees it. As far as people complaining it doesn't say CANON...well no kidding - because Canon cameras aren't making travel coffee mugs. Of COURSE it says a knock off name...get a clue people.This is a great, quality gift and may just end up buying one for myself! :)
5	1386288000	its cheap and well made, holds coffee... looks like a camera lens.  Who cares what it says on the side.
5	1386288000	This is a really cool mug, stainless steel in side, out side looks like a real lens , lots of fun , hot coffee seems to unwind me more drinking from something I enjoy. its a nice copy of a lens right down to the box it comes in , looks like a canon lens box. Schuetz Photography
4	1386201600	It's really adorable. The drinking snap thing (sorry, that may be confusing) slips open sometimes because it's a little loose, but I like the mug and it gets quite a bit of attention when I bring it to class. I got mine from the seller, Amazingbaby and it displays CANIAM instead of Canon and the switches do not move, but it really does look and feel like a camera lens. I bought another one from Claybox for my mom that had &#34;Canon&#34; on it and she was fooled at first, which was funny, but I don't think the quality was as good as this one
5	1386115200	I got this for my wife, and she loved it.  She took a pic of her real lens next the coffee cup, and couldn't really tell the difference.
5	1386115200	I had been looking for a camera lens mug for a really long time! I wanted to get one for myself and my niece who majors in photography. Yes it&#8217;s true that this one does read &#8220;Caniam&#8221; and not &#8220;Canon&#8221;, but for the price I really wasn&#8217;t trying to be picky and it&#8217;s the thought that counts. My niece was so happy when I gave it to her and she didn&#8217;t even notice the name change, she just needed something to transport hot coffee in when she had late mornings. I love mine as well and use it often! Might buy a few more in the future!
2	1386028800	Great looking mug and super fun to use! However, we didn't get to use it very long. Somehow the lid stopped fitting about a month after we got it and one of the pieces fell off the side. It's now used as a pencil holder.
5	1385942400	Love this coffee mug! I use it at work all the time. I have the smallest size Keurig and if you take out the drip tray, it fits perfectly under it.
3	1385856000	Its not the greatest but its not bad either. The box felt like it was left in someones basement for a while and it kinda smelled old. I don't really use the mug much but when I do it works.
3	1385683200	We have gifted it as a Christmas present so we don't have any report yet as to whether or not it holds water.Nice try.  We should have ordered more.  It is quite striking.  A great stocking stuffer.
5	1385683200	This mug is very cute and realistic looking.  My teenage daughter, who is into photography, loves this and it's a real conversation starter.  You have to take the lid off (which really looks like a lens!) to take a drink.
3	1385683200	It leaks with the lid on and is in a different language. But for a round thee house sipping mug it works ok. at $8 dollars I pay for what I get.
5	1385683200	insulates great and look awesome. don't expect it to feel like a real lens. it also doesn't have any moving parts, but i still love mine.
4	1385596800	Great idea, well made and gift recipient liked it a lot. Wish it had a handle, and that I had gotten a bigger size, but overall, it was a good pick.
1	1385510400	This item is not what what it says it is...says its a travel mug but doesn't even come with a lid to drink it or take.it anywhere! Trash it!
1	1385424000	The description of this mug is false. I ordered this item because it said it was NOT a replica in PVC plastic. It stated it was made for Canon Canada! FALSE. This doesn't even say Canon on it anywhere. It states Caniam Lens made in CHINA, right on the side. There is no way they handed these out for the Olympics in Vancouver. All false advertising. I'm returning. What a piece of crap.
5	1385337600	This is so cute, It is the perfect gift for your coffee drinking Camera tooting friends. It looks so much like a Canon camera lens, someone may try to steal it!
2	1385251200	This was a gift for a relative who loves photography, but it was broken when she opened the box so she was unable to use it. Poor quality, but otherwise would have made a cute gift.
4	1385251200	Difficult to screw on the lid. It will leak easily. Question ? Is it safe for dishwasher.It feel safe on hands.
3	1385251200	In the description the cup was supposed to say canon and instead said caniam. The cup is still a good quality and a decent size however the misspelling is a little upsetting.
3	1385251200	This is clearly a novelty mug.  I'd not put it in the dishwasher if I were you.  The printing on the mug itself was not exactly high quality when I received it so I can't imagine what it would be like after a few rounds in the dishwasher.It's cute and a total novelty, and I treat it as such.  Quality is not what I'd call great but it is as described.
5	1385164800	Great quality mug.  It looks JUST like a REAL camera lens.  It's great and everything, only it IS smaller than I would've expected--there's probably something written in the description of this item regarding how much it can carry--I was hoping for something like 16oz., only I'd say that this is more in the 12oz. range.  (Maybe in the long run, this won't really matter?)Anyway, this will be a Christmas present for a friend who is REALLY into photography AND coffee, so this will be JUST the PERFECT gift for him.
5	1385164800	The product was exactly what I thought it would be and will be an awesome stocking stuffer for the photographer/coffee drinker in the family.
5	1385078400	This was a gift for a friend, who is also a photographer.It is a great coffee mug for an avid photographer.
5	1385078400	love it!!!!!!! still use it and while the logo fades out after a few months, the cup is nice and durable!
5	1384905600	Love this mug. The quality and reproduction of a Lens is great and I get a ton of comments about it from friends and colleagues alike. Very realistic
1	1384905600	The reviews for this product were all over the place so I knew I was taking a chance ordering it.  Unfortunately I am not one of the people who were satisfied with the product.  I realize it is not expensive and that you generally get what you pay for, but it really is cheap feeling in person.  The sippy hole cover was barely movable and felt like I was going to break it or a finger every time I tried to open and close it.  I'm returning it.
2	1384905600	Its fine but its made very cheap and has paint that is already pealing off of it. It is also surprisingly small, fitting no larger than a Starbucks tall size in it. Its a good gag gift but besides that is not so great.
3	1384905600	It's ok. I put it in the dishwasher once and nearly all the text melted off of it. The little plastic rectangle near the auto/manual focus &#34;sliders&#34; are came loose after a few months. Cheaply made, says &#34;CANIAM&#34; not &#34;CANON&#34;.Good for a novelty, but I'm pretty &#34;meh&#34; about it.
4	1384819200	It is cute. I have it displayed in my office and everyone thinks its a real lense. Just wish it was a little bigger
5	1384819200	This mug is adorable. I get comments by the dozen everytime I take it out. I have not yet tried to put it in the dishwasher and probably wont. The insulated mug does keep my coffee warm and the details of the camera lens have been well done. Everyone says &#34;I really thought you were carrying a camera lens&#34; For $8 you cant get a better mug.
4	1384819200	Its cute and petite. Keeps more drink warm for a long time, but the size could've been a little bigger. But its okay!
4	1384560000	It was a hit for my photography class instructor.  Only thing is I couldn't easily order one that read Canon instead of Caniam, but the clevor styling, obvious reference to photography, its lid and size fit my gift giving needs.
3	1384560000	It looks cheap but fun. I don't even try to use this as a coffee mug because I don't trust it with liquid in it.  Instead,  I am using it as a pen stand on my desk.
3	1384300800	Ordered from W & H Store because they stated the logo said &#34;canon&#34;. Spent twice as much on this mug as others for this reason and opened it and saw it did NOT say &#34;Canon&#34;. Do not buy from W & H store. Otherwise, neat mug. Didn't use it so can't attest to that.
5	1384300800	My daughter loves her travel mug! It looks just like a lens and it is perfect for a little travel mug. Great Job!!!
4	1384300800	Decent novelty coffee cup.  Only issues is that the lid is not spill proof and none of the buttons work.  Upon closer inspection you can tell its not made by canon.
5	1384214400	Great price, stainless steel interior, a great deal of detail on the exterior. Has been mistaken for a lens while sitting on my desk more than once. Quick shipping.
5	1384214400	Bought these for my son as a birthday present.  He loves them.  Fits right into his life since he is a photographer in Irleand.
3	1384214400	It is cheaply looking on the outside colors are not complete. I used it as a vase for a candy bouquet. it served is purpose.
5	1384128000	well it does like very good!, totally looks like a lens, fill it in mate. have your drinks on it.
2	1384128000	The sliding piece on the lid broke the very day I used it. Now it won't stay on the cup. If you order one of these don't make the same mistake I made. Be sure to double check before ordering and make sure it says Canon. There are a lot of cheap knock off brands out there.
5	1384041600	Mine says canon on it! I love it and it is perfect. I get compliments on it all the time.
5	1383955200	LOVE IT!!!!  My daughter said..&#34;daddy..WhY do you have coffee in your lens?&#34;!!!  This will make a great gift for the photographer or photo-enthusiast in Your life.  Works wonderfully!
1	1383868800	It's a coffee cup. Everything about this screams knock off. The pant is in the area, the font is wrong, the logo is Caniam not canon. The cup insert is tilted and sits at an angle in the outer case.
5	1383782400	Giving this to my son for Christmas. It looks so real you can hardly believe you won't be able to put it on a camera.
4	1383696000	Really looks like camera lens!  As far as a mug, keeps my drink cold or hot!  Love it so much I ordered another for a friend!
5	1383609600	Nice and sturdy, and even has some moving parts, making the coolness factor even cooler. Love the stainless steel interior, easy to wash, does not keep old smells, and does keep coffee, chocolate, etc, nice and warm.
5	1383609600	Got this for my mother in law and she loved it. Honestly the detail on this thing is very impressive, could easily be mistaken for actual lens!
4	1383609600	Super neat idea! For camra lover! Great gift to give or recive. Also fill with gift card or any thing like fav brand of coffee.
4	1383523200	This is a great gift for a photographer or arts person. You can put the lid on it to drink on the go.
5	1383523200	Absolutely love this mug. I have received so many compliments on it. It tricks some people out because they think it's an actual lens.
3	1383177600	These look five times better in the pictures compared to when you are holding it in your hands. The plastic looks a little cheap and all around not as great as I would have hoped.
4	1383091200	The brand on the cup is Canian instead of Canon, except that, the quality is pretty good and the look is real.
4	1383091200	A little smaller than expected. It will only hold a small cup of coffee . It is very cute though!
5	1383004800	I received this cup in the mail on time and in perfect condition. I got this cup for a Christmas gift and am excited to wrap it up already. Although I have not used it, I gave it five stars based on the way it looks and how long I think it will last.
5	1382918400	This mug is the best! I love using it and recommend it to anyone, especially those who are interested in photography!
4	1382918400	love it , it looks exactly like a lens.  Every where i go i get complimented on the product and the size is convenient for me
5	1382918400	I loved it completely! It was exactly what I wanted and I would buy another one for my other friend!
5	1382918400	She's a photographer and one like it caught her eye and she's been wanting one. She LOVES it! Thank you for having it available.
5	1382918400	Very nice mug, so realistic. Very good quality, would make a nice Christmas gift. Bought for a photographer and he loves it.
5	1382918400	I loved this cup. It was high quality and was better than I had expecte. Wish I had ordered more than one.
5	1382832000	The person who received this item as a gift, reports that it is a top quality item, that works great!
1	1382832000	Not a reliable product. The coffe does stay warm even for 10 mins. The spill resistant cover is loose making coffe to come out often. Every time one drinks coffe you have to hold the spill cover as it will slide automatically because being loose. Overall useless . Highly dissatisfied.
4	1382745600	I was worried about what I would receive because of mixed reviews all over amazon about this product. What I received , I am happy with though. It will serve its purpose. I gifted it and there was nothing to be embarrassed about. My friend loved it. No it did not say cannon, but I was okay with that. I wasn't looking for exact replica.
3	1382745600	I looked at a lot of these mugs and really wanted one that had the Canon name, this one does not.I think it looks nice and I love that it has a lid you can drink from. What I don't like is that it doesn't keep my hot drink hot for very long. When I have a hot drink in it the outside is pretty warm to hold the silver rim gets very hot. I wish it was more insulated, I wouldn't call this a Thermos like the description says it is. It's an OK Mug.
2	1382572800	I Bought three of these, two as gifts and one for myself. They simply are a novelty and u really don't recommend using them much. First of all, mine also says Canium, not Canon, but it still looks pretty realistic until you begin to actually use it. It will age quickly and paint will rub off the outside. It also does a very poor job of keeping your drink warm. Take it for what is it, a novelty and you won't be disappointed. If you plan on actually using this a daily mug for your commute, I'd shop elsewhere.
5	1382486400	Haha! Oh my goodness, this camera lens/drink mug is so awesome! It looks just like a lens! Although the outer material is a lighter plastic, the inside lining and interior is stainless steel. To be honest, I got this because I saw it on VGHS! Haha, It's worth the buy whether for looks or use, I'd totally recommend it! :)
1	1382486400	Coffee or Tea or anything you put, none of it remains hot for more than a few minutes. It leaks. And the build is also not good. The rubber came off quickly.
5	1382400000	These are so well made that I am afraid someone will want to steal them when I leave them in the car.  It is hard to tell they are not real lenses.  Great gift for the photographer on your gift list.
4	1382400000	I absolutely love it but you have to make sure you close it right because whatever is in the cup will spill out. But other than that everyone ask why am I carrying a lens around :P
3	1382400000	The cup is nice and the size is just what it said it was but the letters are off quite a bit. They look like it was smeared somehow.
4	1382400000	I think it's funny that it says "Caniam" because it's not a REAL Lens...it's a cup with a lid.  "Can I am" is pretty funny if you ask me.
4	1382313600	This si a great gift idea. It does not carry the actual brand name of any camera, instead it carries a knock of label. The item was still a great gift for someone who likes cameras.
5	1382227200	I got this for my husband, who is a photographer. He couldn't believe how realistic it is. He loves showing it off to guests and &#34;accidentally&#34; knocking it over to see their reaction.Love it!!
1	1382227200	I can't even give this item a single star that's how bad this cup is but they make you have to select atleast one star. This cup leaks and the lid vibrates open, the lid also instead of tightening it is stripped out and continues spinning, and the little open and close piece to drink from slides closed when trying to get a drink. So annoying. One of the finest pieces of garbage I have purchased.
5	1382227200	looks nice and cute!just like the picture! and i think it will be a good gift for friends or for yourself.
3	1382140800	This mug keeps things warm, but holds very little, and doesn't have any way of drinking on the go without removing the whole lid. Its pretty disappointing as it is not a functional travel mug.  Just a hole in the top to drink through would be a lot better
1	1382140800	This may look good enough and have a great price.  But not so great when the lid doesn't fit properly.  Took a long time to get here as well since it is shipped from China.  Didn't notice that when I purchased it since it was Amazon Prime eligible.
5	1382054400	This cofee maker is an excellent way to get all of the richness in cofee brewing. It is better tan the expreso. A note of precaution: If you use Expresso grinded cofee, then add an extra mark of boiling w&aacute;ter.One issue here: The packaging was lousy!! If you order one DO specify a better handling and packaging.
4	1381968000	Those who are purchasing this product should be aware that it looks cool from far away, but if you take a close look, it does not really look real. The logo is also Caniam instead of Canon. They don't show that in their pictures here! The lid is also not clear glass as shown in the picture!
5	1381968000	Nice One. Canon printed on this mug. Received well within the delivery time frame. Looks like an exact lens. I own a DSLR and if i keep this mug and the lens on a table, not very easy to distinguish, unless you are a photographer :-)
5	1381881600	I love this mug. I want a bigger one now. People have asked me why I was carrying around a lens. It's a lot of fun to have. Works great as a mug and keeps coffee pretty hot!
1	1381881600	The top does not seal at all.  The product looks nice, but is not at all practical to use.  Do not buy it.
1	1381795200	I ordered this for my husband and was completely taken in.  It is not what the picture shows, will not come apart and is made from cheap gray plastic.  Don't buy this if you are expecting what the photo shows.  Its not even worth the price of the postage to return it.
4	1381795200	Super cute coffee mug, I've actually fooled my friends when carrying it around, they think I'm just crazy and holding a camera lens. The lid can leak a little bit if you're not careful, but most thermoses and mugs with similar lids do, but overall totally worth it. I only wish I had bought a larger one, I guess I go through drinks fast!
1	1381622400	I ordered this item with great expectations, waited patiently and have never received my cup, I felt like maybe it was backordered as it was such a unique product pronounced starting to wonder what the heck happened? How do I follow up to find out when this item.has anyone else had a similar experince with this vendor??
5	1381622400	I really don't care about the whole cannon thingI wasn't expecting it to be super legit or have the companies name since I doubt cannon makes theseother wise the mug is very nice.Its best you hand wash it and its pretty small. A little bit bigger than the average female hand.But overall its super cute and a great price, got here pretty fast too
5	1381622400	The lens is very well made and the stainless insert is very nice the top of it opens and closes so you dont spill we got it for our photographer and she loved it
5	1381622400	I give it 5 stars for being everything that is was advertised to be. Lid was a sip-able lid, the details were accurate and the boxit came in fooled the recipiant. dishwasher safe but why put something this cool in the DW?
3	1381536000	really great looking mug and perfect size of coffee, I even like the rubber focus and zoom rings.  It looks just like my 24-105 lens.the bad..... the lid leaks and dribbles coffee all over your clothes.....you will need to find a lid with an O-ring from one of your quality coffee travel mugs in your cabinet to use.  You could possible just by an o-ring to fit it at a hardware store?
4	1381536000	Looks like the real thing with a nice Stainless steel insert. Seems well made and is functional of course it doesn't fit well on a EF Body and everything seems out of focus.
4	1381449600	Looks very much like a lens.  I can't attest to its functionality, since I gave it away as a gift.
5	1381363200	This mug is awesome, super detailed and also sturdy.  I ordered it as a gift for a photographer friend and she loved it!!
2	1381276800	This coffee mug broke when I pulled it out of the box.  Nothing that crazy glue can't fix, but geez, I expected it to be able to go through a few uses before having issues.  Cool concept, just poor quality.
4	1381276800	Nothing special, great product. The mug is not too big, not to small. Coffee mug looks real enough that it fooled some of my friends.
4	1381190400	This was a great gift for our brother - the only downside is that is says some weird offbrand 'Canium' instead of Cannon like the mugs advertise.Its also a bit smaller on the bottom so the mug itself it pretty tipsy. And the lid isn't exactly perfect either - but its a good price for a nice little gift.
4	1381190400	I bought this as a gift. Unfortunately it said Caniam instead of Canon, but the guy I bought it for loved it anyways!
5	1381190400	It was a surprise gift for my husband who is a professional and even he kept wondering why i gifted him another of the lens he already has!!! lol, needless to say, it was extremely funny to open the lens in front of him and show him the interior.thanks, it was worth it.
5	1381190400	I bought this mug as a birthday present for a friend of mine that loves photography. It looks like an actual lens, which is amazing! My friend uses it almost everyday and I am so happy i picked this up for her. The cup itself is well made and sturdy. I expect she'll be using it for a long time to come.
5	1381190400	This was a gift for my photographer friend, and she LOVED it. The perfect gift for any of your family or friends that are photography buffs. This seller shipped fast as well. Highly recommend .
5	1381104000	Interior is stainless steel. great quality.  exterior, I would give 9/10, it is not super details as original.  for the price it is great.  it wow my friends.  recommended.  thanks
5	1381104000	I absolutely love this, it looks like a real camera lens and I have got so many compliments on it. A few tips. though: Don't put it in the dishwasher and don't tip it to much when it is full...
2	1381017600	ProsIt's a cupConsIt doesn't say Canon (It says CANIAM)The lid doesn't match the image descriptionIt feels and looks cheap.I would not recommend this cup. I ordered 4 and returned all of them. I thought it would be a great gift to give my family members who have a passion for photography. It was incredibly poor quality and I would never have given them as a gift.
4	1380844800	Anniversary gift for my photography bride.  She likes this mug.  At least the lid is a drinkable lid, and drinks stay warm.
4	1380844800	I'm not sure how truly &#34;useful&#34; this is as a coffee mug - but it makes a great gift for any friend that has a love of pictures or cameras.  My daughter loved it and has used it a few times but it's kind of bulky and tippy for most applications.  Nothing terrible about it - just not totally practical.
2	1380844800	Have been using this product for a week now, so I am ready to give an informed review.The first thing that I noticed is that instead of Canon it wrote Caniam, which was a bummer but I already expected that from the previous reviews.As a thermos this product fails. I usually fill it up with coffee in the morning and drink it during my commute to work that is about 45 minutes. By the time I am there the drink is room temperature.The other shortcoming is the design. While it looks cool, the drinking hole is not convenient. It is placed in a spot where coffee residue remains around the mug cover and dries up during my day. Looks quite disgusting.On the plus side it looks pretty cool and its just the right size for my coffee needs.Would not buy again.
4	1380844800	Pretty cool. The only thing is it says &#34;Caniam&#34; instead of &#34;Canon&#34;. But I really don't mind a lot. It works great.
5	1380758400	This was my second purchase of this great looking cup for photography friends I have...a great idea, and well received by my friends.
5	1380758400	I am giving this to my son for his birthday. i am sure he will love it.. I do.. seen it had to have it..
5	1380672000	Bought one for myself and liked it so much I got one for each of my 2 brothers.  As we are all big into photography, it was a big hit!  The mugs are well constructed and look very realistic.  Although they don't hold as much as some other thermos-style mugs, it's a very minor drawback.  Love it.The mugs were shipped in good packaging with no damage.  Very pleased.
4	1380672000	Fun gift to give a camera nut. They both loved them. They get a lot og comments from cluent and they look real
5	1380672000	Looks great. You can tell it's obviously fake from less than 2 feet, but 80% of my co-workers have just had to get a closer look. I have received plenty of compliments for it. Great buy!
5	1380672000	This is an amazing product and a great item for photo lovers. Is really like a Cannon Lenses for any reflex camera.
5	1380672000	I bought these as gifts for my cast and crew in a show I'm directing that has a photography theme. They will be stunned when they open their packages. It couldn't be more perfect and it's a fine quality item too.
5	1380672000	I gave one as a small gift to a camera buff.  His wife liked it so well I got one for her too.  Now I am ordering one for myself.
5	1380585600	I love this mug, good quality of plastic and aluminum inside.  It is well made and is worth the money
5	1380412800	looking fun mug. I love this thing, and have often picked it up thinking it is my camera lens.. so the joke works! and it keeps my hot drinks hot!
5	1380240000	I received the order much earlier than I expected (what a plus) and it came in perfect condition too! I was nervous opening the package, as many reviews say the cup says &#34;CANIAM&#34; not &#34;CANON.&#34; I ordered from W&H; Store and it says CANON (awesome.) It's not like the picture shown, and when I say that I mean the FIRST picture shown, with the blue plastic bulb on top of the lid. The lid looks like a normal lid, as shown in all the other product pictures. Overall, it's great!tl;dr- Yes it says CANON (W&H; Store), it came quicker than expected, great quality, functional
5	1380240000	This is a cool product and it works to keep coffee hot! It looks just like the camera lens and functions perfectly as a mug.
5	1380153600	Quality good OK and nice, Will buy more form this guy in the future and recommend to friends, good job!!!
5	1380153600	I love this little mug! Mine says &#34;Canon&#34; on it instead of the knockoff brand. My only complaint is that the &#34;thermos&#34; aspect of this mug is seriously lacking- My regular ceramic coffee mug can contain more heat than this thing!
4	1380067200	I like it. The writing is starting to fade because of some dishwasher use. But it's still my favorite mug. get a lot of compliments on it
5	1380067200	Just as described, good quality product. Does not leak any coffee when moving. I use it everyday on my way to work. Although i wish it was a bit taller.
4	1379980800	This coffee mug iis perfect for someone who likes to take photographs. Because the design duplicates a lens the bottom is smaller and it is not quite as stable as a conventional mug.
5	1379808000	Well constructed, easy to use. The one that I received did not have the clear lid and looks like the end of lens with snap cap. The mug is able to control spillage and keeps my coffee hot, like expected of a thermos.
4	1379808000	It looks fake and cheap but, it's a fun gift to give someone who loves photography. Not sure how it actually functions.
5	1379808000	unique, fun gift for a photographer, comes in a little lens case. you can never have too many coffee mugs!
1	1379808000	What you get in the mail is not what is shown in the photo. The top is not clear like a lens; its a black turn cap which really makes it look kinda bad. When we tried to return it within the allotted time, its been a hassle too.
3	1379808000	I'm impressed, this looks pretty cool and real. It keeps coffee/tea warm for a long time. Lid is pretty standard. The cup's purpose is to look cool because other than that it's just a standard travel mug.My only complaint is that the lid screws from the interior of the cup and if you put fluid in a little bit close to the top it will come out.
5	1379721600	I love this cup, I use it all the time, and people always compliment me on it They think its cool!
3	1379721600	I bought this for a friend who is really interested in photography and she loved it!Her only downside to the mug was that the camera shell wasnt sealed so during washing water filled the mug between the canister and the outer part. She had to manually drill holes in the bottom of the shell to relieve the water because it began to smell.
1	1379635200	I will be sending these back.  I ordered before I read the other reviews.  I thought since it said it was valued at 59.99 it would be the real thing, but I was wrong.
4	1379635200	I'm reading a lot of reviews from people complaining about the logo on the cup not being Canon. I can't believe people actually think Canon would let a company use their copyright logo on these cups. Yeah... I think that would be a lawsuit waiting to happen. If you are a logical person you will enjoy having this cup. The brand name on the cup is close enough that you shouldn't be whining about it. I bought two of them from JasonJrImportsLLC for under $5 each.
5	1379635200	Its so awesome! I love it and so does all of my friends! Good quality for how much I paid for it
5	1379548800	I gave this to my friend who is a film major and he absoulutly love it!! It looks even better in person!
4	1379462400	It was just as I had anticipated, good product for the price.  This was a gift to a photographer who was very surprised when I tossed it to her, she thought it was real for a moment.
1	1379462400	As soon as I took this out of the package, a piece of it fell off. I read other reviews saying which sellers to purchase from and which to avoid, but I didn't see my seller on there, so I took a chance. The one I bought was sold by Glomall, and it IS the one that people keep referring to with Caniam as the &#34;name brand&#34; of the mug. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS! IT'S GARBAGE!
5	1379462400	This is a Christmas gift and I just love it!  Not sure about quality or how well it is when used, but it looks great!!!!
5	1379462400	I gave this gift to a young beginning photographer I know that they will appreciate a lasting tough lens for a wild
4	1379462400	I got this last Christmas for my Aunt who is a photographer. She was very confused upon opening the wrapping paper and then cracked up when she opened it. The mug isn't too big but that's okay. She loves and enjoys playing jokes on her friends with it constantly. It cannot go in the dish washer and that's why I gave 4 stars.
1	1379376000	I bought this mainly because it was on sale and most of the reviews seemed to be good. It is a pretty cool little cup and an awesome concept but it doe not come with the "drinking lid" as it claims to. Mine took about a month to get to me and the lid is a huge shade cap looking thing. It does not screw on or snap on as it looks like it might. It's definitely not good for traveling or taking to class etc...just more for something around the house and a conversation piece.I received one of the 'caniam' ones.
3	1379376000	You will most likely be happy, and it will look really cool.... on your desk!The craft is questionable at best: Low grade plastic exterior (by the smell of it), and the text is *painted* on surface and smeared in certain areas (e.g. Caniam on the side- both the letters C and M are smeared).All in all, it will make a cool and unique gift!
4	1379289600	Cons: The quality is nothing impressive.  If I hold it upside down it leaks.  The drinking lid doesn't close securely so you have to be careful.  Consequently it does not keep drinks warm very long.Pros:  This mug looks awesome.  People are always asking where I got it and even if I made it out of a real lens (I know right).  I'm not sure if this is a pro for others but the size is small and for me it's a plus.  The size prevents me from drinking too much coffee.
5	1379203200	It was a birthday present and my boyfriend absolutely loved it! He's a photographer & coffee drinker; this was a must have. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Now I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself.
5	1379030400	Even though there is on &#34;canon&#34; Logo on the mug, it is pretty authentic and real. Good cup in general.
4	1378944000	Cute little mug but it does not have the CANON logo on it like a few photos show.It actually has a CANIAM logo.A few other details are different but for the most part looks like an old school camera lens.Teenage daughter loves it so that's a plus.A nice gift for the Camera Enthusiast.Please note that the photo of the mug where the person noted &#34;I smell Canon&#34; is NOT THE MUG YOU WILL RECEIVE!!!! Be sure to look closely at all the customer uploaded images before you purchase this.
5	1378857600	My daughter is a camera freak- this was nice for her in her travels-it has a classic look and is very practical
4	1378771200	Know that it is not Cannon, but actually Caniam, so thats weird. But it does look like a cannon lense and I have gotten many compliments.
4	1378771200	Perfect size for me. Not the huge vessel which allows the coffee to cool before it is consumed. Screw on cap with closable hole makes it easy and convenient. It doesn't close tightly, thus a half full cup carried in the side pouch of a backpack tends to dribble if you slosh it around a bit. But above all, it is groovy and I look cool drinking from it... or so they tell me... &#34;I was wondering why you were sucking on a camera lense...&#34;
5	1378684800	Well made and fun. While the lid appears to be a lens, mine was a solid lens cap. Good for one cup.
3	1378684800	It is depicted with a lid that appears shaped like an actual lens. this is NOT what &#34;I&#34; got. I got a lid that is flat, all black and with an opening to access your drink. As depicted was fine with me, and one reason why I purchased THIS cup. The actual cup looks as depicted so I gave it the three star review. Dissappointed I didn't get what I bought. Good luck, but be prepared for something different than you see in the description..
5	1378684800	It is nice and cute small thermos I really like it also was on sale I got it in good price thanxx
2	1378684800	In the photo they show the top cap with a clear bubble that looked like a lens. The product(s) that were delivered had a basic solid black plastic top like any other insulated mug. Not a horrible thing, I guess, but it takes away from the camera lens effect and it's a dishonest representation of the item. I bought one for myself and one as a gift. Now I'm debating about even giving the gift, as it's not a nice as I'd hoped it would be.
1	1378512000	Shows a clear lid. I got a totally black lid with &#34;Canian&#34; ax the logo. Opened bag and a small pice fell off. Piece of junk. This is the second time I've gotten a knock off!
2	1378512000	This is way too little for the real coffee drinker. think I'll give it to my grandsonits about the right size for him, being a toddler and all.
3	1378425600	The cup looks great and sparks up conversation, but the lid has to be held on when drinking to avoid taking a bath in coffee.  Outside of the lid not working it is a great novelty item.
3	1378425600	Low quality lid. its a little loose and closes itself while drinking out of it... but come on! its just 8 dollars!
1	1378339200	Returned item as not what the description says or what the photo shows online. Description also says Canon; however, the inscription says some off brand or fictitious camera name. Also, the lid was not a glass and black plastic one as shown online, only black plastic. Therefore it did not resemble a true lens
3	1378252800	While this made the perfect gift...it looks better sitting on the shelf.  Unfortunately, the first time we washed it we noticed it was already starting to &#34;rust&#34; on the inside, and the spot gets larger with each washing.  Shame, because otherwise it is exactly what we expected.
5	1378252800	I bought is as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it. Her coworkers thought it was a real lense she spent an hour just showing it around. If you or someone in your family or friends are photographers or maybe they love cute neat things I would suggets it...
1	1378166400	It looks nice, but I bought this for a photographer, a Canon fan -not a "Caniam" fan. I feel it is dishonest to place a picture of the product reading "Canon", and then sell me something else. Sold by VanBox. I'm extremely disappointed, and the only reason why I'm not returning it is because I live in South America and had a friend get it to me from the States, since they don't do international deliveries.
3	1378166400	Pros: Cheap price, sturdy design.Cons: The text on the outside fades after a few washes. Still looks pretty good though.Note: You get what you pay for. If you want something impressive you should go with one of the more expensive but better made lens mugs.
3	1378080000	Don't expect this to come with the pictured lens pictured in the ad!!! That is the reason I bought this mug over other ones..very disappointed. It is a good mug just not as pictured..
3	1378080000	The cup is smaller then I expected, the material is steel. It does look very delicate. Reviewers say its microwave safe, but I don't trust tht it is. All in all perfect gift to give, if your looking for uniqueness for a good price.
5	1378080000	My photograph teacher thinks its the best cup for drinking coffee every morning, he loved it, my friends also loved it and want to buy some.
3	1377993600	The top that came in the mail with it is completely different... It also rusts really easily. So weird, considering it's meant to hold liquid?? It's still a lens thermos though, which is cool.
5	1377907200	This cup will be a great conversation piece around your studio or office! This is an exact body of what probably is Canon's most popular All Purpose Lense ready for your favorite beverage. Have fun and make the statement that you are a Canonista!
4	1377907200	Mine has the icky logo on it, but who cares? It was a gift. My husband got a chuckle out of watching me think it was a real lens for a moment. It functions (i.e., it holds coffee).
1	1377907200	I loved this when I first received it.  It is so convincing as a camera lens.  My 85-yr-old mother saw it on the table, picked it up, played with it for a while and said she couldn't figure out how to work it - thinking it was a camera lens.  However, after three months of use there is fluid between plastic outer shell and inner stainless steel shell. I presume it entered when I was washing it.  I am unable to remove the liquid or see how it entered, but I have this slosh and odd weight now. Oh well.
3	1377907200	I purchased this novelty coffee cup for my photography student daughter. She totally loved it. It is a good value.
3	1377820800	I received this 24-105mm travel mug as a gift and I was ecstatic upon receiving the mug! The mug that I have is not exactly like the one picture, the mug does not have a lens for the top. Since the lid doesn't create a tight seal when closed, the coffee does not stay hot for a long time. Also I removed the tab closes the mouth from the lid since I have a difficult time making sure that it is thoroughly clean. I also gave this mug only 3 stars because it does not hold a lot of coffee. Overall, I think the mug is unique and is a great novelty mug. Great for gifts but not for everyday use if you are on the road a lot.
4	1377648000	I got this mug for a gift so I'm not sure how it will work out but it seems pretty good for the price I paid (about $8). However as soon as I pulled the mug out of the box, a little plastic clear piece fell off. I did glue it back on, but I am going to tell my friend to handwash only!
4	1377648000	I love this cup.  I really like it because I'm trying to get into the whole photography thing.  The picture is a little misleading though.  The lid in the picture is clear like a real lens.  But when I got this cup it was just a regular black lid.  Its still very nice though.
5	1377561600	Out of the box, the feel of the lens is that of weight and quality.  The lens cap removal allows you to see the entire interior of the lens, which is not something you get on more expensive models.Now, actual usage.  I found the rear lens cover very difficult to remove, in fact I had to cut it off.  This must be due to the tight tolerances during the manufacturing process.Once it was mounted, I was a little disappointed to find that the stabilizer is stuck on and I can't switch it from autofocus.  I've never been a fan of technology that thinks it knows better than I am.Another black mark is that the focusing ring is nearly impossible to move with mere finger strength which is a con for purchasing this lens.  Also, the zoom seems to be stuck at 24mm.  Well, I've wanted to get into wide angle photography for a while, so I'm looking at this as my chance.Overall, I'd recommend this lens to a friend.  For very little capital expenditure, you get a lens with a threaded, water-sealed lens cap!  I dare you to find _that_ on a Naykon.
3	1377475200	Average, novel, great complimentary gift withe the camera that was bought formy daughter. Not diswasher or microway friendly. Worked for what I neededit for.
5	1377475200	I bought 2 of these and one was Perfect!! And the other one was not.No silver insulated cup or sipper top.I am expecting a replacement as per previous contact. Hope it comes soon.
5	1377302400	I purchase the item, i love it, however was not the one i was expecting, since the listing have 2 different pictures, i was expecting the main picture, and i got the other.But still is a great mug! Just remember to ask first
5	1377129600	The look of the mug is very unique and the feel of it is even better.  Love it! I am going to order another one as a gift.
1	1377043200	poor quality, poor delivery timing. Not close to my satisfaction. When I washed it the first time, all the colors are gone in the cover
5	1377043200	It was a gift for my brother-in-law who really liked it since he is a fanatic about taking pictures with a real camera.
4	1377043200	I got this for my friend as a gift. She loved it so much that I had to order one for myself!
5	1376956800	My dad is a photographer and I got this for his birthday. He really liked it and I thought it was pretty cool myself. When I saw the cup and thought it had great detail and looked like a lens.
4	1376956800	It was not as pictured.  It has a nice lid with a sliding stopper, which is better.  It does not leak, and it's fun to use. One of my real lenses looks like it. Mostly.
4	1376697600	I've been looking for one of these for a while and was pleased to see an assortment of sizes and types on Amazon. This size holds a regular mug size serving and keeps it hot for an appropriate amount of time for the size.  I have noticed that the lid must be put on very carefully though to make sure it's aligned properly.  Great novelty for a photographer!
4	1376611200	A cute novelty that will give all your techie friends a chuckle. It look quite realistic, the "Caninam" name is weird but I suppose they are avoiding trouble with Canon. One warning make sure the lid is screwed down TIGHTLY otherwise you will get drips on your shirt!For the price I am satisfied.
4	1376611200	There's no lens lid and it does say CANIAM. That might be a big disappointment for those are hoping that it is an exact replica of a CANON camera lens. But overall it is a great mug that I would recommend to others because it definitely is unique to have.
5	1376611200	I purchased this cup for my son, a professional photographer, and he loved it.  He thought it resembled a real lens.
5	1376611200	I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends
1	1376611200	I ordered this for my girlfriend who loves Canon. When I received it, it said Nikkon (Nikon), which doesn't fly with a Canon lover. I had to send it back and I never received a refund or a new product. The cup itself though was pretty cool though.
5	1376611200	Got a lot of comments from people on how cool it looks. Keeps my coffee hot and intact. It's the perfect size for me.
4	1376611200	Only a 8oz mug...but good quality conversation piece for the price...that will surely scare you the first time you see it wet in the sink!
5	1376524800	I purchased this mug for my teenage daughter who loves to take pictures.  When she first opened it, she was puzzled as it looks just like one of her camera lenses.  She loves the mug and takes it with her to school - it travels well in the cup holder of her car (I was afraid it might not fit, but seems to be just fine.  The lid stays on securely and has held up well (even after several topshelf dishwasher cycles!).  The box it came in was damaged (not sure if from the postman or the seller), however the product I received was not damaged - I just re-wrapped prior to giving the gift.
4	1376265600	This is obviously a super cool travel mug, but it is smaller than expected. If you drink TONS of coffee (like me), you'll find yourself refilling it often. I'm in college and have a full time job,  so I drink coffee like it's water -not great for my health, but it must be done! It is definitely a great product, which is why I didn't give it less than 4 stars, it's just a little small for my taste. I still use it and it keeps my coffee hot for a good amount of time! But like I said, I have to refill it often, but that's not the products fault, it's mine. If you are an average coffee drinker, this is good for you. But if you're constantly drinking coffee, you might want a bigger mug. This is about the size of a small coffee from Starbucks, but I usually get a large. But shipping was good and this is a sturdy, nice coffee mug!
5	1376265600	This is a coffee cup / Thermos [ or whatever you call it !] It looks like a big Camera Lens! I got it and gave some coffee in it to my wife, she couldn't tell its not a lens till I told her after a minute or so!! [ She isn't a photographer] I had had fooled myself at a friends place when I saw this on his table!!It does say Canium or something like that, but I doubt Canon is going to let others use their brand name, so this is good enough!!! :)
3	1376265600	For all of you who are trying not to get the knockoff brand -- I ordered from the seller Vanbox, and it has a "Caniam" logo. It's also a little flimsy-feeling in the lid. Fun novelty item for photo afficionados, though.
4	1376179200	................my  husband love it though... whats the bigger size? i want the bigger one so it will last me til lunch.  time.
1	1376006400	the top cover losses the grip, and comes off while you are taking a drink of  your coffee, Not good!!
5	1375920000	This product is awesome and came in right when they said they'd mail it. I gave it to my cousin who is a photographer and she is in love with it!!
4	1375833600	The wife's sister is a professional photographer, so we bought this as a gift. She was very happy with it.
3	1375747200	Amazing exterior, but it dosent close to be carefull to use it, just display it. It will work as a Great Mug to use at your office
3	1375660800	What I got did NOT have a lid that looked like aglass lens element.  It also did not have a soft pouch like inthe supplied images.  Aside from that the cup was still worth the money.
5	1375574400	I love this coffee mug! I purchased several of these for the girls in my family, because we all enjoy taking pictures & they were a hit! They look just like a camera lens, so be careful & don't get the two mixed up! :-)
5	1375488000	I bought the $9 version of this mug knowing that it said &#34;Caniam&#34; instead of &#34;Canon&#34;.  Hey, Canon doesn't make coffee mugs, they make killer lenses and cameras.  The lid pictured is a little deceiving though, I did not have something that looked like a glass front element, it is more like a lens cap, but for the money, I'm happy.The stainless inner liner looks well made and fits great; and I'm sure this will be a &#34;handwash only&#34; item, not for the dishwasher for sure.  The detail down to the rubber focus ring is stunning.Be advised, however, this thing doesn't hold much coffee.  Maybe 8oz comfortably with cream and sugar room.  But for the cost, it's a great conversation piece!
2	1375401600	the top cover isn't like the photo, so as the rest of the mug.  The actual thing is far from the photo to begin with.  very plastic like and has a very cheap feeling to it. Sent it back.
3	1375315200	good item ! the reason i gave it only 3 stars was that it was rusty inside! ill have to rust removal if i want o use like a cup! otherwise ill turn into a pencil holder!
5	1375315200	Great conceptual cup and it's actually functional. Me likey very too much. Would recommend as a gift to any adult.
3	1375228800	I bought this for my wife's birthday. I have two immediate complaints. The cap is not as shown in the picture. This is no big issue as the real top has a sip opening - even though it does not look like a lens. Second issue is how to wash the cup; the packaging came with no info as to whether the cup can be washed in a dishwasher. We plan to anyway. The construction looks a little cheap when examined closely; however my wife thought it was cute, and plans to use it.
5	1375142400	The cup was a big hit.  Everyone thought it looked very realistic.  I would recommend this item for photography buffs of all ages.
5	1375142400	This coffee mug is really cool! You can play jokes with other camera buffs and it's works very well. Thank's Amazon
4	1375056000	I bought this as a present for my boyfriend's sister, and it was a great gift for a photography major.
5	1375056000	It's really true-to-life. Works as promised. I probably won't run it through the dishwasher though, because some of the parts look like they won't last long term if so.
4	1374969600	This is a very neat way to drink, especially if you love photography. It looks so real, that when my uncle first saw it he picked it up and spilt my drink all over himself, thinking it was actually a camera lens. The top seals seals great, preventing leaks, and is very comfortable to drink from. It also does a very good job keeping your favorite drink cold or hot on any day. My only complaint would be that some of the printed words fade away easily. The logo on the lid has already worn off. It could also be a bit taller, but you get what you pay for. Overall this is a great product. Don't judge it by the unimpressive box it comes in. If you're considering this item I definitely recommend it. Everyone will be amazed by your unique drinkware!
4	1374969600	nicely designed. Though I haven't used it so far, I like it to be a deco piece on my table..looks uber cool ;-)
3	1374969600	it's OK, but you get what you pay for!The cup is OK, but the lid feels kind of cheap, you can tell is made mass production in China.
5	1374883200	The cup looks identical to a lens so much that I was able to switch it out with one and a co-worker had no idea until after a few minutes of messing with it.
3	1374796800	The quality of the cup is great, it looks like a real lens but the description states it is 3x3x9 and it is not even close to that... It is more like 3x3x4 with the lid it might be 4.5 to 5 inches tall. Unwashed disappointed in that but other than that I love the cup.
1	1374796800	Different lid than in the picture, I wanted to say &#34;Canon&#34;, it doesn't, instead it says &#34;Camian&#34;. I have the same camera lens on my Canon and wanted at least to say &#34;Canon&#34;.  Returned the item back.
5	1374796800	My father-in-law loves this mug almost as much as he loves photography!  It is very realistic and worth every penny!
5	1374710400	This mug bears such a striking resemblance to a real lens I'm afraid of either finding coffee in the camera bag or a lens in the dishwasher. I bought this for my wife, an avid photographer, who instantly tweeted it to her photo buddies. Definitely a solid purchase choice for the coffee-drinking photog in your life.
1	1374537600	I bought a few of these as gifts for my Canon friends and one for myself. The product itself is detailed and fun to look at, but the inner stainless shell is not good. It's got a poor brushed finish and worst of all, it has a really bad metallic taste. It's like they didn't use food-grade stainless in the construction. If you get one, I wouldn't recommend trying to actually drink out of it unless you like the taste of stainless steel in your mouth, not to mention it's probably really bad for your health and safety. Yuk!
1	1374537600	I bought two of these they both filled with water when washed'the water did not come out.There was no way to take it apart.
4	1374451200	great item to have! the only bad thing about it its the mouth cover will start dripping a bit. lovely design.
4	1374192000	actually i thought the lid would be the same as picture,but it wasn't,the lid in this picture more like real lens,but the lid i got is more useful,after all i like it,and i will use it
4	1374192000	I love it, however, it is a little smaller than I anticipated. I would have bought a larger one if I realized how small this one is. Doesn't hold much, but great conversation piece!
4	1374192000	I've seem better ones made, but are usually really expensive. However this I've is perfect for the price if you are just looking for a cool coffee mug. If you just want it for the lens look, I would spend a little more for a better replica. Thus one is the perfect size for me though.
5	1374105600	I bought this for my husband because he loves photography and coffee lol perfect right?! He loves it. It doesn't actually say cannon it says camitara something strange that starts with a c and I don't feel like looking at it but he doesn't seem to mind. :) doesn't leak seems overall great.
5	1374105600	I ordered this mug for a friend not only because of their interest in photography but because i think it is the coolest idea for a mug i have seen! People are always staring at it and puzzled at first glance when they see him drinking from it! Awesome idea for a mug! Love it!
4	1374105600	This is not the best-looking of the lens mugs, but it had two things going for it.  The price was right, compared to others listed.  The mug both fits in the standard-ish car cupholder and has a sippable lid, which I considered essential to a useful product rather than just a pretty thing relegated to a shelf or cupboard.
4	1374019200	I saw this and decided immediately that I needed to have it.First off, they (MIB Deals) shipped it very quickly and it came nicely packaged. I didn't research to see what sellers sell what logo. I received the &#34;Caniam&#34; one from them and was perfectly content.It arrived quickly and neatly packaged. The mug is VERY detailed. It fooled a lot of people (the best part).I gave it 4 stars because I loved the way it looks and it's something I don't see people drinking out of everyday.If I had wanted something to actually keep my beverage hot and not spill, then I'd be very disappointed. My tea goes cold very fast and it spills out liquid after I close the top.I recommend it if you want something that looks out of the ordinary. However, not if you actually need it to function as a proper thermos/travel mug.
5	1373932800	I originally got this as a gift for a white elephant party but loved it so much I kept it for myself! so cute, stands nice and is super easy to clean. yay me!
5	1373932800	After hearing all the bad reviews about getting a Caniam brand and such I decided to really research into this.So I emailed many sellers of what their logos were on it. There was only two sellers who told me that they had the Canon logo (W&H; Store) and (Pocket Store).I decided to go with W&H; Store cause they were cheaper and boy did I make the right choice. Lens came extremely earlier than expected and it did indeed have the Canon logo and Made In Japan text. As a person who loves photography and almost anything to do with it, this mug was a great buy.First thing I tried when I got it was testing if it really kept water in, as told by other reviewers. It leaks water from the drinking spout when you hold it upside down, but of course, the spout is just a hole with a cover, and why would I be drinking coffee upside down? So that didn't really matter.So other than that, this mug was a great buy, looks realistic, holds a nice capacity of coffee, and looks really realistic. I trick a lot of people into thinking It's a real lens when they first see it, so I wouldn't be surprised if I accidentally tried to stick this on my camera from time to time.
3	1373846400	Its says Caniam brand, and the look of the Mug is not too bag, I noted few words have got faded, the biggest disappointment is the lid on top of the cup is lose and you have to hold it when you have a sip with the cover of the mug. if you plan to get a travel mug look elsewhere. but I should say for $8 I paid for the mug I cannot ask for more.
5	1373846400	Durable, keeps hot drinks hot.  My stepdad is a photographer and just fell in love ith his new gift.  Great that it has a lid.
3	1373673600	quality is not great! In pictures on the site looks great but once I got it I was disappointed ( maybe because I own the real canon lens too??)piece of advice: if you look online and the pictures of the mug are hiding carefully the main logo... it is not the real thing.on the mug it is printed: canian instead of canon but you don't see that in the pictures only when you hold it in your hands.the title suggests that the mug is thermos type but it is not - it will not hold temperatures more than a regular ceramic mug and if you put something hot inside you'll need a sleeve to hold it.the printing on the side of mug (logo, numbers, etc.) start fading out after two washes (manual washes, not machine)Pros:- probably the only mug with a drinking lid that's a very nice addition and very convenientbottom line: if you really need a drinking lid, this would be the mug to buy otherwise look for something else that at least show the logo in the picture online.
4	1373587200	Gave this to a photographer buddy of mine.  Since I haven't heard from him, I don't know how he liked it, but I thought it was the bonb!
5	1373587200	Looks like the lens.  From a distance you do a double take to make sure it isn't.  Doesn't leak.  Hold a standard cup of coffee.
5	1373587200	I bought this as a gift for my sister who is an avid photographer and coffee drinker.  She loved it.  It holds about 12 ozs., has a lid for travel,  not a cheap weight cup.  It arrived in about 2 days.  I would recommend it.
5	1373587200	I received my lens mug a few days ago. It looks really neat. Looks like a real lens but it is a thermo mug. Mine says Caniam on it, but I don't really care. It didn't say anywhere in the description or the photos up there that it was going to be a Canon lens. It shows that the lens mug has Caniam on it. I like it anyway. I don't know how much it holds but it feels like it is anywhere from 8 oz to 9 oz. It didn't leak or drip like my other thermo mugs did. My coffee stayed hot in it. I really do like my little mug. Makes me happy to see it. It even cleans really nice too.And to anyone who says that one of the photos show that the mug does say Canon from one of the photos. Look at it closer. One is the Caniam Lens Coffee Mug and the one that says Canon is an actual lens for a camera. It is a comparison of how the two look alike.
5	1373328000	This was a birthday gift for my photographer brother-in-law & he loved it!!He's getting one for his son, who is also a photographer.
5	1373328000	I have a father-in-law who loves photography and this was such a perfect unique gift for him.  He really enjoyed getting it and uses it all the time
5	1373328000	Mt husband loves these. He keeps one at home and one at the office. The clean easily and keep the coffee hot.
5	1373328000	The mug has a really nice looking. It's a little heavy and personally I think it's because of the very nice quality it's made of. PERFECT GIFT for a photographer girlfriend.
3	1373328000	3 stars for the look, but do not drink from it.  One sniff of the inside and you can tell there is some funky lubricant residue left in there from manufacturing. I am too paranoid to clean it and drink from it, though that will probably be enough for the non-hypochondriacs out there. I leave mine on a shelf in my cubical and co-workers get a kick out of it.As compared to other reviews, it does match this picture shown, has a Caniam logo instead of Canon.  Small glue residue visible, but what do you expect for the price.Would I recommend this: Not as an actual cup to drink from. But I would buy one for a co-worker I like and tell them it is just to look at or one I don't like and wish them well.
5	1373328000	I love it. I bought this as a gift for my son who is an avid photographer. He loves it too.
5	1373241600	This is a really cool mug for the avid coffee drink and photographer.  I bought several of these as gifts and they are very popular.
4	1373068800	Its NOT got CANON on it but its mentioned by other reviewers as well, other than that you get you pay for.
1	1373068800	Bought two: one for my wife and one for me.  Eighteen dollars of junk.  Poor insulation, leaky (coffee running out at the threaded cap), and labels falling off.  If you're going to set them up and look at them--fine; if you're going to use them, forget it.  I want to return them, and will.
5	1372982400	Great Detail and love the product but a piece fell off right as I used the product within 10 min no big deal just glued it back on.
4	1372809600	i bought this for my boyfriend, and when he opened it and i took a closer look at it, i realized that it doesn't say &#34;Canon&#34;, it says &#34;Caniam&#34; instead.  It's not a big deal and the mug still works it just makes it obvious you chose a cheap replica as a gift
2	1372809600	Mug was advertised as saying 'CANON' on it and when I received it, everything on the mug says 'CANIAM'. The ONLY reason I bought it was because it was a birthday gift for a dear friend. We met almost 20 years ago at a photofinishing lab and are both huge aficionados of Canon cameras and lenses. Also, the little thingy that opens and closes the non-spill part to drink hole on the lid doesn't stay open or shut. I'd send it back but it came from Singapore, and wouldn't be worth the money in postage. Very disappointed.
5	1372723200	Excelent product, fast delivery. The cup really looks like a real camera lens. Friends love it and they will order more very soon.
5	1372723200	I got this for my husband who is a professional in the film field.  I thought it was a cute gift.  He really loves it and his film coworkers think its neat as well.  It does not say Cannon but Canain, however my husband isn't bothered by this fact.  Plus you need legal permission to have it say Cannon.  It looks like a real lens. I am sure if you inspect it really close you can find flaws but I didnt see any nor did he.  Its a fun gift for not a lot of money.  Also he has used it for weeks now and has had NO issues with leaks or the cap not fitting.
4	1372464000	The quirkiness of this mug makes it a perfect gift for a picture taker. It was smaller than I expected,  doesn't hold much fluid, but it is so novel it is worth consideration.  It was a gift that brought smiles and seemed to be greatly appreciated.
5	1372464000	We had a yard sale a few weeks ago and I was drinking out of this and that's what one of our customers said. When I showed him what it was, he offered to buy it on the spot. No sale. I love my fake lens; it makes me feel like a spy.
5	1372377600	I bought this for my Camera-nut son. Couldn't resist! It's very cute. I haven't given it to him yet. But I'm sure he'll get a kick out of it.
5	1372377600	Bought this for a friends birthday. He is into photography and he absolutely loved it. The details and creative value of this coffee mug is excellent and would definitely purchase again or recommend to someone :D
1	1372291200	Really cool looking but washing this mug washed off all the paint and it smells like chemicals.  Made in China... not surprised it's poisonous.
5	1372291200	Love this mug. Keeps cold stuff colder, and hot stuff hotter. Only negative I have found is trying to make sure you cleaned all the little nooks and crannies on the outside, since I wash it by hand.
5	1372291200	This looks so real, I have fooled everyone at the office!Great product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique gift
3	1372204800	i was disappointed by the size. I guess i should have looked further into the description, but i didnt readily see the size listed?
3	1372204800	The cup is pretty cool. It looks very realistic. Definitely gets people's attention and I love it, being a canon guy.The lid only fits while there is hot coffee in the cup. Once the coffee cools, it will just fall off. The painting on the mug is fading very fast - within a month some of them are gone from rubbing on my hand.I only rinse it out after use to keep it clean. I would not recommend putting this in the dishwasher or washing anything but the stainless liner.
5	1372204800	this is a great travel mug for my wife. she loves photography and she loves coffee so this was a perfect fit.
5	1372118400	perfect gift for my photographer girlfriend :) she got it and she was so excited. she's wanted one for so long!
5	1372118400	A great find.  I take pictures on the side and this just gives me an excuse to bring along my second passion, coffee!  Fits about a cup and half of your standard mug size.
5	1371945600	As a photographer this is a must have. I love this cup. It looks like a real camera lens. The only thing that I do not like about this product is that the rubber band that is around the cup is loose and comes off too easy. This is a great item and I would recommend it too anyone. Keep in mind that it is a smaller mug.
5	1371859200	Bought this for a birthday present for my photography friend and she loved it.  Many reviews said it was cheaply made.  I was not expecting it to be as solid as it is.  Looks just like a camera lens.  If you are looking for something that says "Canon" on it, then maybe you don't get that it is a gag gift.  Delivered fast and by expected date.
4	1371772800	This was purchased as a gift so I cannot rate how it functions for drinking but I basically bought it for the novelty of looking like a camera lens.  I read the reviews and this too does not say Canon but for me I bought it because it looks so much like a camera lens replica.  I know the person I bought it for will still get a big kick out of so for me that works.
4	1371772800	I just got mine, and my first impression of it is cool but it may tip over easily. After inspecting closely and testing it out, it turns out to be decent.The outside is made of hard plastic and the labels printed on it. I suspect with many uses and washes, these labels may wear off quickly. The switches are fixed and are not movable. The rings are of rubber for grip and they do move when turned.The inside is lined with stainless steel instead of plastic. This is good. However, I wished the stainless steel rim was a bit thinner, so one can drink straight from it without using the cup lid.The lid has a normal lip (thinner than the cup rim) for easy drinking. It has a slider to cover the opening. It is not tight seal. So if you tip over, the liquids will leak out through the slider.As far as keeping the liquid hot, it didn't keep my coffee hot for very long. The coffee stayed hot for about 1/2 hr, and then warm until I finished it.Btw, this mug is designed to be bottom heavy, so it doesn't tip over easily. I gave a few good tap at the top, but it doesn't just fall over. So I like this.Would have given it a 5* if the lid was sealed tightly to prevent leaks when knocked over.
5	1371686400	I heard some reviews that people had purchased different mugs like this of varying quality, But I will say these ones looked good. stainless steel liner, and all the &#34;buttons&#34; and printing were well done.
5	1371686400	Since I have been using this coffee mug I have gotten more than a dozen double takes when people first see it.  Lots of fun, keeps my coffee warm and is a great conversation starter.
5	1371513600	Great conversational item,,and not a bad coffee cup, either. I have enjoyed using it. Consider one for a gift for a photographer friend.
5	1371427200	This was a father's day gift and my dad loved it.  Delivery was super fast, I received it within only a few days.
5	1371427200	The mug is heavy and feels like a real lens.  We gave it as a thank you gift to the photographer who took our son's Sr. pics.
5	1371340800	I loved this book. It proves to everyone who reads it that even the most different of people can come together to overcome tragedy such as death. This book is for anyone looking for inspiration,a reason to care, or just looking for a good read on a Sunday morning.Michael Phillips is an amazing premier Christian novelist who writes from the heart, and it's hard to find authors these days that do that. This story of friendship is amazing and will inspire anyone to befriend someone who needs a hand, or just to simply look at life a little differently. I couldn't put this book down and you wont want to either!
5	1371254400	I bought 2 of these mugs. One for my sister and one for myself. I found the quality very good. I would buy these again.
3	1371254400	OK, it's a coffee cup. When it finally arrived it had a small crack in maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch and smelled. The crack is noticeable, but you need to look for it. It isn't but a fraction of an inch wide and with teh delivery time to get here, it wasn't worth trying to send back.  I assume the odor was the plastic outer shell of the cup itself. I put it in a storage room for several weeks until the odor disappeared. Then I washed it several times before I used it. Since the inner cup itself is metal I feel better about it and it looks cool, and it works as a travel cup.
3	1371254400	Cute idea, great gift for the photographer in your family. Delivery took a bit long, but the item was wrapped well.
5	1371168000	Bought for a friend who is a photographer. It looks just like the lens she uses! It's a lot smaller than I expected but nonetheless I think it's a great gift!
2	1371081600	Good look to it but I dislike that you take a gamble on what name you'll get if canon or canion.
5	1371081600	The mug arrived on time. Looks great. The only down side is that the logo on the lid rubs off easily. Other than that, the cup is perfect.
5	1371081600	I got this for my best friend who loves photography and she uses it every day. She posted pictures on Facebook and everything showing off her new cup.
3	1371081600	PRO:Holds a nice cup of tea or coffee and keeps it hot if the lid is kept on. Easy to drink from with the sliding top, and also very easy to clean.Stainless interior washes up with a gentle rag or just hot water and a brush.Top is easy to rotate on and off and so far has not gotten stuck or tight.No leaks from the spout or the screw on top.Rubberized seal on the screw top seems to be adequate for insulation.CON:Without the lid in place my beverages have cooled down very quickly. The insulation appears to be lacking around the interior, so without the lid in place the heat rapidly escapes.The base is somewhat unstable, because the styling/designer chose to make the base much smaller in diameter than the rest of the mug. I understand this is truer to an actual lens, but since this product is meant to be a functional vessel, it does present a "tipping" problem if knocked or accidentally pushed.I removed two stars. One for authenticity, and one for the design flaw of the smaller base. However, if you have the lid on and closed then tipping the mug over presents less of an issue - but when I accidentally did it, I was in the midst of enjoying a hot beverage and lost a lot of it.
5	1370995200	I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it.  The delivery was a little slow, but worth the wait!
3	1370995200	Good cup. Sucks it doesn't have canon logo. It has a plastic part that has fallen out and had to glue. Over all, its a nice cup.
5	1370995200	I gave this to a friend as a gift, and she thought it was real until she tried to remove the &#34;lens&#34; cap. Great product, awesome price.
4	1370908800	shipping was extremely slow, like a month, but the cup was cool and has a lot of detail and arrived in good condition and was as shown in the photo.
4	1370908800	Not much to be said. Poor in liquid. put on lid. drink liquid.Oh, be aware that the base is narrower than the rest of the cup and therefore has a better chance of tipping than other cups.
3	1370908800	My title says it all.  I love it because its so cute but the quality of the product is just ok.
4	1370908800	Bought as a gag gift, it turns out to be a nice mug; keeps coffee pretty warm for quite a while. Fabrication appears to be good. Only had a few weeks for mostly for water. So far, so good.
3	1370649600	Caniam! Really!! Ironically the cup is solidly built and does its job well, but the point of buying this cup over a plain mug is because of its style. And that is where I felt let down. Still a good deal for the price.
3	1370649600	It's a pretty good mug. The parts fit a bit loose, but I got it as a nick knack so it works fine for that.
5	1370649600	Came in the mail at the perfect time to wrap and give my mom for mothers day. Perfect size and looks just like a real camera lens. My mom stared at it for nearly a half hour she was so excited.
5	1370563200	I was skeptical when I ordered this product because it seemed really hit-or-miss, and I planned on buying it as a gift. When the package came I had my fingers crossed that it would say &#34;Canon&#34; on the lid because that seemed to be the distinction between good and cheap qualities. I'd read that others' cups had arrived broken, came apart during the first washing, or was poorly insulated. My dad didn't think twice about the brand name and loves it. I bought it from BinnBox.
3	1370563200	my girlfriends loves her and actually thought it was a camera lense. shes loves photography and drinks coffee regularly so it was a win win....but not &#34;Canon&#34; and says made in china in bold ass white on the side which i took off
5	1370563200	I think this is just a wonderful idea, but since I don't take drinks to go, I use it as a pencil holder on my table. It's really neat.
5	1370476800	I love it don't see these often great for to and from work and traveling to keep coffee hot for a while
4	1370476800	great for the price and i really enjoy my mug but the lid doesnt really keep the liquid in so I just dont use the lid
5	1370390400	Received as early Father's Day Gift and I love it. It does look like a Canon lens but is labeled Caniam. The lid is a true sipper lid. Some office mates have the Canon version but must remove their lid to drink. I like this lid much better... I can use it in the car with reduced spill concerns.
4	1370390400	The mug says caniam not canon, but that doesn't bother me in the least. Stainless steal inside, as promised, and by simply unpacking it, two individuals were fooled, thinking it was an actual camera lens. I am delighted, and the person I am giving it to will love it as well.
5	1370390400	This was a gift to my son, a professional photographer. He says it is very well made and closely resembles the real lens. It fits the drink holder in his car.
5	1370390400	If you are looking for a specialty gift for the photographer in your family or a close friend, look no further. I was amazed at the likeness to that of a real high powered lens. Awesome, my friend loved it.!!  : )
5	1370217600	WAS A BDAY PRESENT FOR MY PARTNER WHO LOVES PHOTOGRAPHY. HE ABSOLUTLY LOVED IT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LOVE CAMERAS
5	1370217600	I ordered this mug about 2 months ago and use it every day because I LOVE it. It's heavy and durable, and it looks and feels exactly like a camera lens. In fact, my brother said he thought it was one of my camera lens (I am a professional photog) until I took a drink out of it.It's well made and keeps my tea hot for a good 45 minutes to an hour. The only negative thing about it is that the "Camian" name on the close tab (on the lid) rubbed off after the first week, which isn't a big deal for me but some might find that annoying. but the rest of the words and markings on the mug body have stayed clear and intact.I just ordered another one because I accidently put mine in the microwave - I was too busy thinking about selling my house to pay attention to what I was doing. So I'm ordering another one because I can't be without one, its just too fun.

4	1370131200	It does look like the lense for the camera, but it was a little smaller than I thought it would be. Guess I should have read the information about it a little more
5	1370044800	This looks like a genuine camera lens! The size, detail and graphics are very sharp. This could sit on a shelf and hide small items!. The capacity is a bit small though.
5	1369872000	It looks just like in the picture. It is small but is very cute and looks like the real thing.
4	1369872000	I bought it as a novelty gift for my photographer friend and he likes it. It looks like a Cannon lens although its labeled as a Camion.
4	1369785600	Purchased these for my husband and a good friend who are avid photographers.  Once the disappointment wore off that I did not purchase him a &#34;new lens&#34;, he loved it!
5	1369785600	I loved the product! My friends were very impressed. I am thinking of ordering a few more of this item.
4	1369699200	Great for that morning cup on the go. Keeps coffee hot for a good while and looks cool. It really catches everyone`s  attention.
5	1369699200	This is a perfect gift for a photographer.  It was a big hit that I would highly recommend.  It is a well made product
4	1369612800	really like this mug... people are fooled and think it is a real lens... even photography people, from a distance.... only thing I would prefer would be that the lid screwed on instead of pushed on... not as secure as I would like... otherwise GREAT product... keeps stuff hot or cold well also...
5	1369612800	Great gift for photographers, none of the settings and stuff move or twist to play with, although it makes it easier to clean and difficult to break. Cons would be that they aren't as fun to fidget with as they would be with moving parts.
5	1369612800	A friend had one of these and I thought it would make a great gift for my daughter, who is a photographer. She loved it.
1	1369353600	DO NOT BUY FROM BINNBOX.  When I recived this item, I noticed right away that the cover of the hole in the lid to drink from is loose and can be easily come off and spill everywhere. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
5	1369267200	looks just like a camera lens and the quality is amazing as well! Will order more for gifts for friends!
5	1369267200	great craftsmanship! really well built and highly recommend this to everyone. looks like a real lens too. tried putting on my camera, didnt work lol jk
1	1369267200	I ordered this product genuinely hoping it would say "Canon" on it, since it appears that way it almost all of the product pictures. The seller Binnbox seemed like the way to go since they had great reviews and Prime shipping. WRONG! It came it 2 days and it's an authentic "Caniam." Great.It should have been stated that this was a "Caniam" being sold. If any one knows which seller sells ones that say "Canon", please let me know.
4	1369267200	Awesome. I just wish it was a little bigger.  Still a really big hit with the photographers in my life!
3	1369180800	Clever design for which I've received many comments, but the rubber gripper near the bottom fell off after washing it by hand there times. Myother frustration is that the Thermos inside doesn't keep the hot liquids hot for more than 10-15 minutes, much shorter than I'd anticipated it would.I  appreciate that the container can be held at any position but not that there is only one way to screw on the top. The treads easily make the top go askew necessitating having to take to top off and start over again. If there were another layer to keep the liquids hot, it would be nearly perfect.The designers appear to have spent more time with the outside form rather than insuring the inside would keep hot liquids hot and cold one cold..
5	1369180800	Other than being a little smaller than I imagined, I love this cup. It's a great gift for any photo buff.
3	1369180800	Purchased this mug for a birthday gift for a friend and was very disappointed when I received it.  It did not say Canon as pictured.  It said "Caniam" on several places all over the mug.  Really embarrassing and cheap looking.  I did complain to C & M Medical and they instantly gave me a full refund which was very nice.
4	1369094400	Cups are functional and in good conditions. Though unlike the 70-200 F2.8 mug, the received product has the logo Caniam instead of Canon. Slightly disappointed only because the pictures showed &#34;Canon.&#34; Functionality-wise no problem.
2	1369094400	The item arrived 2 weeks after payment was made. The package was damaged but thankfully the cup was intact. This was to be a birthday gift but since the late arrival I had to choose a different gift.
5	1369094400	Purchased for a friend.  It looks very authentic.  We really had him going for a minute or two. Do not know if he has ever used it for drinking; he has too much fun making people think it is a real lense.
4	1369094400	Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. Some of her friends thought it was a real camera lens. She has wanted one of these cups since she saw them in a magazine. This seems to be made well. The price was good. The shipping was quick.
5	1369008000	I bought this as a gift for my photographerbrother and he really liked it! Several of his friends want to get one as well.
1	1369008000	I searched through Amazon for so long to find the actual product and according to the other reviews, I finally found it, well, turns out its too good to be true.This cup is knock off.
5	1369008000	The mug came exactly as the picture and description shows, nothing hidden or down sides to this mug, get one for yourself!
2	1369008000	Very low quality. I received it with one of the labels dropped off it.It does not keep beverages hot as long as expected, and it gets hot from outside
4	1368921600	This is a really neat mug for whatever you want to put in it.  Conversation starter for sure.  Wife loved it as a gift since she's a photographer.  Some of the logos rubbed off the lid, but other than that, no problems so far.  I wouldn't put it in the dishwasher and one of them I bought got water in between the walls when I hand-washed it.
4	1368921600	Very functional. Perfect for the office. Like the funny looks people first give you when they think it is  real lens ...
5	1368921600	WE love the this product. My daughter takes it to school with her every morning.  I love the fact that it looks like a camera since this is her hobby-photography.  We have been able to get the products at a reasonable price on Amazon
5	1368835200	Looks like the real thing.The two people I sent the mugs to didn't realize at first they we used for drinking.  The only  negative comment would be is that the boxes that the beautiful mugs came in were slightly crushed. I certainly would by more!
5	1368835200	Love the novelty and the quality of this mug. The seller got it to me quickly and in one piece. It's a small cup of coffee, but it's right-sized. Love it as a conversation piece for meetings. I'm thrilled with it!  Will use this seller again.
3	1368835200	Like other reviewerw have said,  the sellers selling them for cheap are selling super fake looking versions. Stamped lettering vs embossed (raised lettering), low quality paint that comes pre smeared, misspellings everywhere. If you want a genuine looking one, don't be looking for the cheapest of deals.Overall, if you are just looking for something to set on a shelf, or on your desk to impress colleagues from a distance (soon as you step up, you see it's fakeness), this will do.
4	1368835200	How perfect for your photographer friend, give as a gift to your wedding photographer with a nice tip inside. Great idea
5	1368835200	What does this stupid thing mean why did I buy this? Isn't it obvious? It's a sweet ass coffee/tea mug. DUH. It's awwwesome.
3	1368835200	It's a really cheap mug, price and build. You get exactly what you pay for but be aware that pieces fall off the day you get it. It's fun to have but the lid doesn't screw on all the time and it has issues, but for a dirty cheap cup like this, you can't expect much. You get what you pay for.
5	1368835200	I gave it to a photographer friend and two weeks later, all she can tell me is how many compliments she's gotten. Of course, she's majoring in photojournalism with an emphasis on videography, but it's a great gift with lots of meaning for a cheap price.
5	1368748800	the mug seals very nicely with the cap on. also it looks like a camera lens. I would recommend  this to other people.
4	1368748800	It looks very lifelike. it's a great conversation piece.  i love it. Had to buy two more as people kept asking me.
3	1368748800	this was a lot smaller than I expected, especially for a travel mug. However, that is probably my only complaint - the detail on it is fantastic, and Amazon's price (through Prime) was a lot better than buying it at a local coffee shop.
5	1368748800	Good quality and the fact that the brand name is exactly like the original lends to its originality! 2 more words
5	1368662400	It was just what I ordered. If you know someone who likes cool things this just foe them. they will really like it.
5	1368576000	The mug came exactly as described/pictured.  It was a gift for a photographer friend.  He was impressed by its novelty. I would order from this retailer again.
5	1368576000	I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she loves it. She is quite a camera buff and this fits right into her personality
5	1368576000	Very pleased with how fast it came. I have gotten so many compliments about it. I have also gotten weird looks because people think I'm drinking from a real camera lens and are confused. (; Only thing is I have washed it a couple times and some of the lettering came off, but it doesn't really bother me.
3	1368489600	The product is nice/ok. I thought that it was going to be from the ones that said &#34;canon&#34;, instead it said &#34;caniam&#34;. After, I found out that you have to look for a seller that says that &#34;sells with canon logo&#34;.The quality of the product is good. Hard plastic. The interior, where you pour your contents, its really good. Real stainless steel. It stays still, and if you misplaced it (because you were not looking where or how you were putting it) it will try to recenter itself. It does LOOK like a lens, and if you are not an expert on cameras, you will thing is a real one when it is closed. For the price, and the look, is fair game. I just have two complaints, as fallows.Two things I didn't liked: On one of the small details that is painted with silver tint, the tint was messed up. As if it didn't dry, someone touch it, and it screw up the tint. The other one, is that when it is fully closed, and suddenly you hit it, the content will start coming out through the hole where you drink (while it is closed) (drop by drop). It seems like it is just a defect from the one that I got. Is not something that I can't live with it, but I know it is now supposed to happen, as I have way too many mugs in my house. Asides, from these two, the product is nice. It does 98% fulfill its purpose. Hope this helps you.
5	1368489600	Bought this as a birthday gift for my photographer brother; he appreciated that it looked and felt like a real lens.
5	1368489600	This is by far my favorite coffee cup! I absolutely adore it. The only con would be is I wish it were larger.It looks exactly like picture. I was very pleased.
2	1368403200	The ink stamping of the coffee mug is rubbing off with my finger within the first 3 days without having been put in the dishwasher.  I hove the cup but all the writting is comming off which is not good.
5	1368403200	This is definitely a solid product. Insulated and not the occasional knock off &#34;Caniam&#34; This mug say Canon all over and you can guarantee quality. Girlfriend has loved it since day one, a must need for a photographer looking to take his/her camera around and enjoy a sip out of their lens !
5	1368316800	I bought one for myself and one for a gift. The person I gave to had never seen anything like it before. Great
4	1368316800	There are no brand name markers on it, it just has everything else you would find on a camera lens
5	1368230400	I bought mine from Nomorerack.com.It did not claim to be a specific camera brand only to be a SLR coffee mug, so to me it really didn't matter what name brand it was.Anyway, it is smaller than I thought it was going to be but it is the perfect size for a Keurig cup.I liked this so much that I ordered one for my father who is a professional photographer.I would almost think it would be a copyright infringement if it said Canon or Nikon, unless those brands were the actual makers.
3	1368144000	As others have said, be careful which seller you order from.  I thought I was receiving a mug with Canon on it, as described in the sellers ad.  Nope!  Received a cheap knock off mug.  It was a gift for my wife, she is an avid photographer and she loved it just for the conversational value.  The seller and Amazon Customer Service were quick to help resolve the situation, but I did not get what I thought I was ordering.
1	1368144000	Bought this as a suprise for a photography friend....so upset when it came. It had scratches, pieces broke off, rubber pieces look melted! Do not waste your money!!!! Cute idea but VERY POORLY MADE!!
5	1368144000	This is what I was looking for, I like the product and will probably buys several more as gifts for my Photo Friends. It is what I expected and didn't disappoint me.
1	1368057600	We ordered two of these because I am a photographer and loved the idea. We use one of the cups ONCE, washed it like normal by hand and it is now filled with water. If you shake it you can hear the water somewhere inside the cup.
5	1368057600	every photographer needs one! My husband loves it even though its not as big as his outer cups. Would order again
2	1368057600	It took a long time to receive and the cul smells strong of burnt plastic or chemical it made it difficult to wanna drink anything out of it
4	1368057600	Wish it said Cannon and was a little bigger, but it's fun and functional.  Great for a photographer.  Real lens parts.
3	1368057600	I bought these 3 items (100, 70-200, 24-105) mugs. and this comes with the sip hole. It's OK, hard plastic and aluminum as with the other two. But this one is good for coffee while driving. This one says &#34;Caniam&#34; while the other two has &#34;Canon&#34; all over it. I'll be using the other two for parties - ice cream, boba tea and other mixes.
5	1367971200	I gave this to a photographer friend for Xmas.  She got it around Valentines Day...she loved it...... and the wait was okay
3	1367971200	i was so exited to get this mug. i loved the engenius of the product design. But the writings started to fade and come off preaty soon after the first wash...oh well, what did i expect. :-)
4	1367884800	The one I received has "Canaim" instead of "Canon," not a big deal. It's well made and doesn't leak. In fact I think it looks too much like a real lens to leave in my SUV. I certainly would not like someone to smash out a window to steal a $10 cup (or anything else for that matter) because it looks like a $1,200 lens.
5	1367884800	What could be more fun than sipping from a classic lense.  This device is durable and well constructed.  It's nicely insulated so it's easy to hold for hot drinks.
5	1367884800	I love this and use it every day. Definitely a good order. I am a photographer and this is just a unique way to enjoy my morning coffee.
5	1367884800	Got my lens cup and I love it! It looks so real it still freaks my husband out when he sees it in the sink thinking one of the kids put my real lens in there-lol it looks great and I have gotten many compliments on it.
4	1367884800	It looks exactly like a Canon lens but it is a novelty item, it perform sub-par in keeping beverages hot/cold. It's rather small, holds just 10 oz of liquid. Not bad for 11 bucks,though.Some people have complaint they received an item with the name "Canaim",the item I received had Canon on it just be careful which seller you buy from.
5	1367798400	The kids I got these for are very pleased....they really do look real too. budding photographers dream I would guess. lol
4	1367712000	I love it! Very good buy!! I use it almost every day. It keeps my coffee hot. I would recommend this product to my friends.
5	1367712000	Priced right! As described.  Fast shipping.Looks like my 24-105, but use it for coffee.Does not say Canon, but Caniam, probablyfor legal purposes.  But love it.
5	1367712000	Great product that combines my morning cup of coffee with my passion for photography.  The product appears to be well built with a stainless steel liner and decorative plastic (the lens motif) overlay.  It is insulated sufficiently that it is not uncomfortable or difficult to hold (some stainless mugs and mug liners transmit exceptionally high levels of heat) and still keeps the coffee at acceptable temperatures for a couple hours.My only problem was the wait time.  This item shipped directly from Singapore and while it arrived within the promised dates, I am used (spoiled) to Amazon orders arriving well ahead of the promised dates.  The month of waiting was a little nerve-wracking as I ordered and received other items while waiting for this one to arrive.  But then, I am not a patient person.Overall it's exactly what I expected and I look forward to enjoying my morning coffee served up hot in my &#34;camera lens.&#34;
5	1367625600	This is a great mug. It looks exactly like it was pictured at Amazon.com. The lid seals really well and I just love the way it looks.
3	1367452800	Cheaply made, smells a bit funny. The cap always sprits you with the liquid inside of it but overall it's cute and works
5	1367452800	Quality material, not cheap rubbish.  Great detail, just like a real camera lens!  Picture perfect cup of coffee!  Highly recommend!  :)
5	1367366400	This is a must have for the avid photographer this cup holds a good size cup of coffee and looks like you have a lens that you are holding great product must have for all
5	1367366400	This was a neat little coffee mug that my friends really like. I wish it was a little bigger for my morning coffee but it still deserves a 5 in my opinion, quick and efficient delivery and packaged well.
4	1367366400	Chinese knock-off, Caniam logo. It's actually very funny to me. Hey, stainless steel inside.I wish the switches an dials worked but you get what you pay for.It's flat out a cool mug if your not picky!
5	1367366400	Its a great product at a great value. Works great. Was a really good present for my Grandfather who was a photographer.
1	1367280000	SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY GARBAGE BAGS FOR YOUR TRASH IT WILL HAVE MORE USE THAN THIS CUP. No stainless steel insert or lid. I would have been better off reusing my old Starbucks cups
5	1367280000	If you love cameras, you will love this product.  It is well designed.  I bought it as a gift for my mother for her birthday.  She loved it.
1	1367280000	I wouldn't even give it one star.  First of all, the seller I chose was, unbeknownst to me, located in China and it took forever to come.  Secondly, the thing leaks terribly and if you put the lid on more tightly to prevent leaking, you can't get it off.  I'm ready to toss it in the garbage.  If you must by it, at least make sure you can return it!
1	1367280000	This item is shown to have a stainless steel interior and states this in description.  It DOES NOT, it is cheap plastic with no stainless steel whatsoever
2	1367193600	The intrior it's made out of stainless steel and not plastic, and it's a very attractive mug. The only problem I have with this cup is the gap between the plastic and the stainless steel, it's not well made. The bottom of the ring is sharp and it cuts my lip every time when I use it.
4	1367107200	As others point out, the outside design is not perfect (messy work in some areas). But, the stainless inside is great and it does not leak, so it's great so far! And it looks real from afar! It didn't even take too long to arrive (in MD); shipping took maybe a week or two. It does say CANIAM not CANON, but that's not a big deal.
5	1367107200	Awesome novelty. Being a cameraman this is a great cup to have, I've fooled friends, thinking its a real lens, then I have a drink.
5	1367107200	I bought this for my sister, who is a photographer. It looked realistic and was very detailed. She loved it!Took awhile to arrive - Amazon did tell me it would - but it was well worth waiting for.
1	1367020800	I am usually very satisfied with the products I receive through Amazon.  This item was completely wrong.  The box was the correct box, the label was correct, but the mug inside was plastic, the &#34;lid&#34; (which would not fit and was not a travel mug lid) was actually an ash tray.  The return procedure was frustrating because it would only allow for a refund, not an exchange.  So I just said &#34;forget it&#34; and will do without the travel mug I wanted.
5	1367020800	Great gift for a photographer who drinks coffee!! It was more of a hit than I even expected! Good idea for a Dad or Grandpa.
5	1366848000	IT is great! I Love drinking out it.  I even bought one for a friend who is a photo teacher.
1	1366761600	Advertised as stainless steel insides.  First stainless steel I ever saw created rust after one washing.  Don't buy this unless you intend not to use it.  Looks great on the shelf.
5	1366675200	Bought this for my son who is a Professional Photographer, and he LOVED IT !! It was a hit for his birthday! Thank You!  The best gift I think I have ever given him.  I don't think I've ever seen him so ecstatic over a gift that I've given him !!  Whooo Hooo !! Very Good Quality tooo, I was very impressed !!
5	1366675200	the only bad thing I have to say about this mug is that it is smaller than I thought it was going to be.. the details though are perfect. I bought  one for me and one for my business partner and she loves hers too
4	1366675200	Love this item and it's great for photography lovers!  I do wish it came in a larger size, but it's so cute!
3	1366588800	It took forever to receive and smells like cheap plastic but overall really cute idea. Well see how it holds up when I put my coffee in it!
4	1366502400	For the price, this was great buy. Works very well. My only two complaints are that the plastic focus scale cover came off under hot water. No problem, I superglued it on. Also, build quality of the lid slider cover is a bit loose. But other than that, very happy!
4	1366502400	Of all the sellers of this product, this one indicated that it was labelled &#34;Canon&#34; and &#34;Made in Japan&#34; unlike others I'd read of that said &#34;Canaim&#34; and &#34;Made in China&#34;. When they (2) arrived (earlier than expected, happily) it was &#34;Canaim&#34; and &#34;Made in China&#34;. My wife and daughter, both coffee-drinking photographers, liked them nonetheless. I've yet to hear anything about their other properties such as insulating, taste, etc.
1	1366416000	This is such a joke :|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a photographer.He liked it at first when he received it because of how it looks.He left the cup on his table until he has the use of it for the first time, which was yesterday, and as soon as he use it, a detail on the cup fall off. Can you believe it? Only at first use. Cannot describe how embarrassing I felt for  giving him such a low quality cup. And what is sad is it already passed the deadline to return. I wished he could have used the cup earlier so we know how defective the item was and return it. Waste of money. Dont bother.
4	1366416000	it's a niche product and very fun.  It would be 5stars but designed to drink with the lid on more than off.  which makes sense for a travel mug.  Plus it's not a Nikon.
5	1366416000	I couldn't believe how real this looked!!! I bought it as a gift for our friend/photographer and couldn't be more satisfied with it!!!
5	1366416000	I purchased this mug for my husband because he loves to use older cameras with the large lenses you adjust yourself. It was beautiful and larger than I expected. Actually looks like a lens--my daughter's boyfriend picked it up to look at it and was amazed that it wasn't a camera lens! My husband loved it! Great gift!
3	1366329600	Bought two and They function are a bit smaller than expected. The knockoff brand name was not expected. I'd look around some more before buying again.
5	1366329600	It came quick, looks great and gets a lot if attention. Despite being stainless steel, the coffee cools down fairly quick, but it hasn't been a huge problem.
1	1366329600	1st thing that is wrong is it does not say CANON2nd thing is it says Drinking lid which mine does not have it has a piece of crap lid that u have to unscrew every time you want to take a drink
1	1366156800	Received my cup today which was supposed to be a gift, BUT it's a CHEAP knock off. It does not say Canon as the picture shows. It says Caniam. Also there is no sippy lid but a lid that will not stay screwed on. So it doesn't even work as a travel mug. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!  DO NOT PLACE YOUR ORDER WITH GREEN MAN FACTORY!! I will be returning!!
5	1366156800	I got them in one piece.. 2 of them. Pretty good quality. The interior looks very good. Overall very sturdy. I know they are mostly for hot/warm drinks ...but with mine I drank beer ! :D Very good .:D
4	1366156800	So I really wanted to get this mug, since it has the sippy top, but I read the reviews, and everyone said that the top leaked. I still wanted to get it, and sure enough-the top leaks. But, it doesn't really matter much to me, because I really liked the way this mug looked. It also isn't very thermal, you're hand gets kind of hot when you hold hot beverages in it, but I really like the style of it, and that's all that mattered to me.
1	1366156800	Not sure what I expected for the low price, but this is a pretty cheap looking knock of, the details were poorly finished and the exterior of the cup was quite dirty when I recieved it, I was a bit dissapointed.
5	1366156800	This mug is so cool!  I am a photographer and thought the idea was so original.  It looks just like a camera lens.  Since buying it, I have ordered 5 more for friends and family members who saw it and wanted one.  Great product!
4	1365984000	On my way out the door to work I checked the mail.  When I opened it at work I showed it off; everyone liked it, thought it was awesome and asked who bought it for me.  I bought it for myself of course!  Well, I work night shift so when I got home I just put it in the sink.  My husband was loading the dishwasher, saw it in there and thought, "Who the h___ did that?!"  Then he figured out it was a mug.  My 16 year old daughter was unloading the dishwasher, came to me with "lens" in hand saying, "I may have bad news."  Innocently I asked her, "Oh, is it not dishwasher safe?"  She looked at me like I was high.  Even with the lid off she thought it was one of my lenses and was terrified I would go ballistic over someone putting my lens in the dishwasher!!!  So, unless you're up for giving your family heart attacks, please show it off to them before this happens to you.
5	1365897600	With the real thing. Haha. It looks so real people question my sanity on the street and train while I drink from my lens.
5	1365811200	LOVE LOVE LOVE this mug...I use it all the time and it is super easy to clean, super glad I bought it
4	1365724800	Gave this 4 stars due to the size but other than that it's a great mug. I've heard mixed reviews from others about typos saying Cannon instead of Canon and the printing was slightly faded. Mine did not have this problem fortunately. Im sure there are many different manufacturers that produce this mug but as long as it serves its purpose for holding a decent cup of your favorite beverage for an average price of 12 bucks then I can't complain. The bigger models hold more but you have to take off the lids in order to drink. Just but it already. I'm actually ordering another one right now.
5	1365724800	This item is incredibly faithful to the original. I gave it to my daughter as a gift. She is a professional photographer and uses a Canon SLR camera in some of her work.  She was quite amazed at the workmanship. Needless to say, the mug was a huge hit as a gift.
5	1365638400	I'm a coffee person but also a photographer. Two of my passions in one. Great gift idea! I'm thinking of giving these out to my fellow photographers.
5	1365638400	my girlfriend loves it. is very practical and lasting worth making this purchase for someone who likes professional cameras. cool
1	1365638400	The inconsistencies of reviews made it extremely difficult to order this product from Amazon and I wish I had not wasted the time trying! Unfortunately, I ordered this mug from Small Bang company in the hopes of receiving a mug that said Canon on it, but received one of the dreaded Canaim mugs that reads made in China along the rim.This is a cheap knock-off of what was pictured and I am very upset I wasted $12.00 and a whole month waiting for it. Also, there was no invoice and no return slip as this item came directly from Singapore. I guess I am stuck with an inferior product I am not happy with.
5	1365638400	This mug is an accurate reflection of what is described! Very well detailed and constructed for the price! Great stuff!
5	1365552000	I bought one as a gift for a photographer friend and loved it so much I bought one for me.
1	1365465600	The packaging when I received this item was the poorest I have ever had from an Amazon order.  It was little more than a small box turned into a ball of duct tape.  The mug looks like a lens from a distance but has a &#34;dirty&#34; unpolished look to the finer details.  When I received it, the mug still had machine oil coating the inside and outside which still produced a sheen in the water after cleaning it several times (hand wash and machine wash).  The cap is not water tight and will spill your drink.This is not a safe, clean, or reliable mug.  It looks good enough for photography enthusiasts, but I would not recommend using it as a coffee mug.
2	1365465600	i buy it for my sister who likes camera a lot. This cup has worse quality than I think. Hate it.
5	1365465600	This product looks very real, and the recipient absolutely loved it.  It is on the small size for coffee, but the uniqueness makes up for that.  The shipping time I was given was a long time from when I placed the order, but it arrived a good week ahead of the estimated time.  It was shipped in an envelope, so the box the mug was in was squished and bent - not in the best shape since it was to be a gift.
5	1365465600	I got this for a coworker, and he loved it! :) My only small issue was that the product box it came in was pretty beat up, so it didn't present as nice for a present... luckily it wasnt damaged, so it's all good.
1	1365379200	What a disappointment!  I ordered this, and also got a real camera lens, for my husband, to give to him on our anniversary.  Unfortunately what was sent was the Caniam, not the Canon lens.  So, it is going back.  Amazon, why do you do business with vendors who misrepresent their products?
3	1365379200	Pro: It works fine as a mugCons: Outer plastics detail is cheap and you would probably be happier if you spent the money on a nicer quality one that looks more like it could be a real Canon lens.
5	1365206400	I bought this for a photographer friend of mine... and although he already had one, he was quite pleased to have a matching set. I was told that not they only fashionable, they are well made as well.
3	1365120000	It's a cool gift to give someone. Just not as high quality as pictures lead you to believe.Still works as a coffee mug, just not what I was expecting.
5	1365120000	great and really cheap! great price! and amazing! looks great too! i bought this because im a photographer and love to have this sitting in my office!
4	1364860800	These are nicely manufactured and a great gift. Would love to learn how to have them monogrammed or customized to be able to use them as promotional item.
4	1364774400	I am enjoying my new coffee mug. I do not have any complaints. I am very pleased with this purchase.
3	1364515200	I think this cup is adorable but It did have a slightly weird smell to it that made me nervous to drink it. The shipping also took a really long time but it was coming from another country so I understand.
1	1364428800	This lens cup showed up with a 1/8th inch thin layer of see-through foam duct taped to the original box....worst shipping protection ever seen. Box was junk once got it opened. As for the lens cup....quality was HORRIBLE, UGLY and LAME. All the printing looks like a 2 year old smeared it on with crayons so can't read most of it. The &#34;lens barrel&#34; rings are so skewed and wrong shape. Lastly, the sliding cover for the lid hole doesn't snap closed. VERY POOR product....I wasted my money on this one !!
3	1364342400	i bought this with the idea that it was generic lens. Come to find it was a Cannon lens. I am a Nikon person; the return policy sucked so I was able the remove any Cannon reference. Now it is a generic lens.
5	1364342400	I gifted this to an old friend that's been a photographer for over 50 yrs.He was impressed and Loved it! The only thing is that is doesn't say Cannon because they don't have the rights to the brand trademark. Instead it Says something like Casian but it's on the same font and the product is still overall impressive. My friend said it's very realistic. Doesn't appear to be cheap in quality however it did come from China. I would recommend this product :)
5	1364342400	Great Gift Idea....Good Conversation StarterI love carrying this item at work or around town with coffeePlease be midful that this is more of a novelty item, expecting it to not leak or to be spill-proof is a bit unrealistic for this exact item at this low priceI am happy I ordered this and will probably order another one in the future to gift
3	1364256000	I purchased this as a gift for a photographer in my life. When I purchased I knew from other reviews that there was a possibility it would not look exactly like a Canon lens and it does say &#34;Caniam&#34; instead of Canon and made in China. It does come with a travel mug lid so it can be used in the car and the inside is stainless.Lets face the fact it is a $12.00 gift so I don't expect it to be high quality, it is a great novelty gift that can be used by someone that is into photography and who I'm sure would still appreciate the thought
5	1364256000	I bought this travel mug for my husband who loves photography. It's been a huge hit at his work as a lot of people do a double take when they see him drinking out of a camera lens
2	1364169600	My hubby just got a Canon T3i and I thought this mug would be a cute present. I saw the pic and it says Canon on the side. I thought it was an amazing offer and went ahead and bought it. When I got it, it had the word Caniam or something like that on it. It would have been fine except that the picture shows the name CANON. It is misleadin and not fair.I went ahead and purchased an original Canon mug. It was like 10 bucks more expensive but definitely worth  it. My hubby loved it.
5	1364169600	i chose the rating because it is an awesome cup. i liked everything about it, just wished it was a little bigged. i would recommend it to anyone who likes taking pictures
1	1363910400	This is a cheap knock-off of a licenced product.The body is marked "Caniam" not "Canon" despite this being a clone of a Canon lens. (unlicenced?)They strategically photograph the product so as not to show that.The lid threading strips out very easily, resulting in a loose fit.The sliding cover for the sipping port is so loose, out of the box, that you need to hold it in place with your finger or it will slide shut while you try to sip it.On the plus side, the body of it does look like a reasonable facsimile of a Canon 24-105mm lens, including the rubber zoom and focus rings.There are many other variants of the "camera lens coffee cup" available for only a few dollars more. Look at one of those instead.
5	1363824000	I got this because I loved photography, and it's the only thing that looks like an L lens that I can afford at the moment. A little small, but good quality.
1	1363824000	The metal lined rusted out after only 1 use, making it worthless as a mug. Don't waste your money like I did.
3	1363737600	My only complaint is that this doesn't have a hole in the lid so it can be used as a travel mug. The one pictured does but the one I received does not. It was a gift so I didn't send it back. Just be aware.
5	1363478400	EXCELLENT!!! SUPERB!! I'M VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH MY ORDER!! THERE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE WITH EVERYTHING!! GOOD JOB!! IM SO PLEASED!
5	1363219200	Cool mug. I love how real it looks. I actually got it for a gift for someone and they loved it.
5	1363132800	This was part of the gift package i bought for my husband, he loved it!  it was as real as the lens he owns, hes a big fan of Canon so this was perfect!
4	1362700800	I'm not a professional, or even an amateur, photographer, but I do have a Canon EOS Rebel SLR camera that I love and when I was looking for a new travel coffee mug and saw this I thought it was perfect.For the price, this is an absolutely perfect and unique travel mug.  The details on the exterior are great and make it look very real as a camera lense.  The seal on the lid is tight and no leaks.The only complaint I have is that it is fairly small.  Only holds about 12 oz of coffee.  If it would hold 16 to 20, it would be perfect.
2	1362700800	Received today and yep, it says Caniam (not Canon as pictured).  It does have a lid and metal liner but I won't hold my breath to see how it wears during normal use.  Just a novelty gift, not a practical every day mug.
4	1362528000	Our friend really liked this camera lens cup.  It looks just like a real camera lens.  This cup looked well made.
5	1362355200	A great gift.I loved the details and better yet, have surprised my loved one.I love, congratulations, I will continue in the future reviewing their products.
2	1362268800	because he sent different my order he sent copy.i received China but my order Japanmy order Canon but he sent Canian
1	1362268800	I received my lens coffee cup today. It looks like a lens and that is cool. I haven't used it so I have no idea if it even keeps anything warm. Mine as well does have the "not" Canon label. I will give the seller a low rating because they are in fact advertising something different than what they show. Be up front as a seller and show the real product if your going to sell.
1	1362182400	I ordered this for my Photographer girlfriend because she uses Canon equipment. Imagine the surprise when she opened it up and found the obvious knockoff didn't even spell Canon right. I found one on another site that had it spelled correctly for less money and way quicker shipping from somewhere closer than China.
4	1362182400	Great novelty mug for any photo enthusiast . Work well. The slide is a little cheap but still works well.
5	1362182400	I bought this for my boyfriend's dad because he's a photographer and he absolutely loved it!!! It comes just as it said it would and is hauntingly realistic, he thought it was a real lens! Anyways would recommend to anyone as a gift.
4	1362182400	I love this coffee cup, wish I would have gotten the bigger size and wish it would stay hot longer but I still love it. It is a lot of fun.
5	1362096000	Fantastic mug that is a great conversation piece.  :)  The base fits in car cup holders, and the lid fits snugly.
4	1362096000	Every time I drink coffee from this, people always ask, is that actually a camera lens? And then I point out what's really going on. My only issue is that it's 12oz. I go through the coffee quite fast in this. Other than that, it's a pretty cool product. Keeps my coffee warm for a decent amount of time. This product gets conversations started!!
5	1362096000	i love this mug, so real looking, I need to get a larger one too, this one hold 12 oz, It is so adorable
5	1361923200	I get so many compliments on my mug.  Husband thought it was my real lens and ask why I had it on the kitchen counter.
5	1361836800	I get compliments all the time for this mug. Most people think its a lens, and then they can believe I just have it sitting out. Funniest time was when i received it and took it out of the box my fiance got pissed because she thought I spent 1500 dollars with out discussing it first!
1	1361750400	You'd better have a napkin handy if you want to actually use this cup...it's the worst ever.  I thought it would make a fun addition to my office mug set but I could even carry coffee in it from break room to office, the lid is worthless. Althought, it's a nice paperclip holder.
5	1361750400	Have gotten a number of great comments on it from other shutterbugs. Keeps the coffee hot and washes great, I do not havea dishwasher, but wouldn't use it anyway.
5	1361750400	My daughter is a part-time photographer and she loved it because, we gave it to her for a Christmas gift and I think I may have to order another and tuck it away for many years down the road if she loses it.
1	1361664000	The photographs and notes of the product say that you will receive a mug with "canon" on it. This is far from true. This product says "caniam" on it in three different places. Also, quality of the product is very low. Paint is not correct, crooked logos, all in all bad craftsmanship. Very disappointing.
2	1361491200	I gave this a two, because it looks nice, it's a neat product. Unfortunately the lid will not stay tight on it very long. Even before a week is over, the lid will not tighten properly and can come off at the most unexpected and inconvenient time. I was not hard on this as I wanted to use it for a long time.Maybe a 6sigma project to define a better quality product is in store.
4	1361404800	Looks the way it did in the picture, which is all that mattered. The friend I gave it to loves it. No complaints with the exception of the late delivery.
5	1361404800	Took waaaayy longer than I expected but apparently it came from China! Lol! And it said Canon on the side and everything. Perfect gift for my photographer friend!
2	1361318400	When I first seen this item on another site I thought this was a great idea. A camera lens that is a Coffee Mug.Since I use all Canon items I wanted a Canon coffee mug lens. The one I received for Christmas (ordered from Amazon) hasa defect in the screw top and it does not have Canon on the lens it has Caniam. Amazon sent us a refund so I orderedanother one. The item is marketed as Canon. I did check the picture on Amazon and the Cap had&#34;Canon&#34; on it so I ordered it. Well it is the same knock off as the first one.....CANIAM ??? Made in China.Not happy with this item but I will not spend any more money to send it back. Beware it you want a coffee mug with &#34;Canon&#34; on it.
3	1361232000	We got this for my brother-in-law for Christmas, and so I can't attest to the overall quality of it. It seemed pretty cool and sturdy for the most part. He seemed to like it.The real complaint: Even though there was a small warning that shipping might take some time, when I got to the ordering page, it actually said shipping time should only be the standard week or so, but then after I ordered it... it told me it would be almost a month out!Needless to say, my brother-in-law didn't get his gift until a week or two after Christmas, but as a joke, at Christmas we gave him some batteries and a card that said &#34;Gift sold separately&#34;. (Yes, we know this is gift doesn't require batteries at all-- just thought it was funny) :)Thankfully he has a good sense of humor and he likes his coffee. So it worked out, I just wish the shipping info had been a little less misleading.
4	1361232000	I was a little disappointed by the none &#34;Canon&#34; brand name and the fact you can't move the buttons on the cup but the bride and groom love photography as well as their cup.  They stated it was a &#34;niffty&#34; idea.
4	1361232000	I gave this to a friend for his birthday because he's a photographer.  He found it to be great fun--it keeps drinks cold or hot for a good amount of time (not all day, however), but it really does look like a fancy camera lens.  The only problem that I could foresee, is if you leave it in your car and some nefarious individual thought it was the real thing.
5	1361145600	Have had it for awhile and works perfect. Keeps my coffe hot for a great deal of time. Just received the 70-200 version as well and both cups are great and love the price.
1	1361059200	I loved the idea of this, and got tons of complements and chuckles the one time I got to use it, but that very day the lid stopped screwing on tight, the threads were too weak to hold it and it just kept twisting and leaking. Twas tragically disappointing. I really wish it would have worked well! But alas I had to return it.
1	1361059200	Cheap plastic used for manufacturing.... not worth the costneither one has the stainless steel insulation or the lid!!! So disappointingI don't recommend this for others
5	1360800000	Cutest thing ever! The only problem it has is it doesn't really say CANNON on it, but it's because they can't. Otherwise everything about this product is great!
4	1360800000	For the price, a really well made copy that looks just like a real lens. It leaks a little even if the lid is closed, so its not a good idea to fill it up and put it inside a bag or something, but to have it seating in your desk, its a great mug.
5	1360713600	one of the coolest items I've found in awhile! Someone was extremely creative with this item, and my friend loved it!
5	1360627200	I just fell in love with this considering I'm a photographer and shoot with Canon. I want to drink out of it all the time. :)
1	1360540800	When I ordered this product, I thought it was a Cannon mug as it is modeled to look exactly like the Cannon version. When I received this purchase I was very disappointed.
5	1360540800	its even cuter in person! my sister is super jealous and now wants one to. came faster them expected and the best price i could find online.
4	1360454400	Travel mug exactly as described -- just took forever to get here; here is your  review &#34;eight more words required&#34;
4	1360454400	I loved it! Great gift idea, and it came exactly on time :) Exactly as described in the photo. And mine actually says Canon on it!
1	1360454400	I received this product from my sister for my birthday.  It was the perfect gift, as I love photography, but there is one very big glitch.  The lid doesn't screw down.  It just twists and twists without catching and I call pull it right off.  A big problem with hot coffee!!  I've emailed the seller to ask them to send a new lid or a new mug, but they haven't replied.  Don't waste your money on this - unless you want a conversation piece or perhaps a flower vase.  If you want a travel mug to drink coffee out of, go somewhere else!
5	1360454400	If you love photography, you'll love this mug.  I didn't want a large mug and this one is just perfect. Great for coffee, tea or hot chocolate.  No fake Camera &#34;brand&#34; printing was found on this one. It also has wide rubber black bands around the exterior for a better grip, they resemble the lens adjust grips.  The sliding sip cover can be popped out from pressing the inside of the lid to clean it on both sides.
5	1359849600	I like my lens mug.  People look twice at it.  It looks like the real thing and words as a mug just fine.
1	1359676800	Cheap plastic used for manufacturing.... not worth the cost. I purchase this product when the price was 12$.I wont recommend this for others.
5	1359676800	It was a cheap Christmas present for someone who absolutely loves their camera and the look on his face as he unwrapped a lens was priceless... as was the look of confusion and disappointment and humor when he found out it was a mug. Of course now he keeps in on his desk at work to make the company photographer cringe when it gets bumped and dropped and eventually drank out of. +1 for realistic look and feel. Nothing like getting someone's hopes up only to find out it was a gag gift.
5	1359676800	I chose my Seller based off all of the feedback that I read and the reviews as they are clearly mixed. Obviously there are some bad sellers with imitations having the wrong labeling, cheap plastic dollar store style imitators vs. the one you see in the advertisement. Be very careful which seller you purchase this from. I just got mine today and it came in perfect condition and it does say "CANON" not "Cannon" or "Canaim" for those of you whom perhaps got the cheap knockoff. If you are wanting to get a better one, My seller was a company identified as (UNIQSTORE). After reading many comments it is suggested to not buy from a seller called something like (liu coco?) as it appears they are horrible knock offs. I tested my mug today with both cold and warm beverages (I recommend you do the same PRIOR to posting a comment in here to know for sure). Also I checked to see if the stainless liner was faulty or showing imperfections of becoming vunerable to seperation losing the seal from the plastic body, and the lid works like it should and seals good has a sip spout and it seems to pass my QA test. The logo and details are amazingly good. To anyone whom thinks these are real lenses converted to a coffee cup you need to put your head back in the sand as I can't believe I actually read several buyers with remorse due to that in a couple reviews. The only bad side for my purchase was it was ordered on January 3rd, and it took a month to get here. Most likely it is because of the little China man in a row boat coming across the Pacific (HaHa). Overall it was a well worth wait. Remember... research the sellers feedback and I hope my advice helps. I know to some it's more effort to make a big deal for $13.00 plus shipping, but the small amount of money spent is not the point it's the item recieved as described and that is the principle. We as consumers have an obligation to help Weed out the misleading sellers on Amazon.
5	1359676800	It has stainless steel. It has a sippy on the cap so you don't need to screw the top off to drink it like others.
1	1359590400	This product is terrible, Yah it is has to cool factor of being a camera lens but the it is a bootleg version of Canon. It says Canim on it instead of Canon. Would rather it say nothing than a fake brand. Better off spending the extra $10 to get one that actually says Canon on it.
1	1359590400	Total bait and switch move.  They make it look like it is a replica of a Canon, then they send you a mug with Cainam, or whatever garbage they put on it, stamped on the side.
3	1359590400	the picture shown shows the cannon name brand on the mug; but it's not cannon, it's cannium brand. so if you're looking for the real deal brand don't get this. while it is a nice mug, it was a little disappointing to see a different brand than what is shown in the picture.
5	1359504000	Thank you for this awesome travel mug; I love taking pictures so this captures something I can take w/me & get people talking!
4	1359417600	Bought it for my dad for Christmas. He got a kick out of it and switched to it as his main/favorite cup. None of the parts move on it. It was never a real lens that was gutted...but still pretty cool. Definitely a fun accessory for any photographer.
5	1359331200	This went over better than expected.  My husband opened the box, looked up and said ' A lens.  You shouldn't have done this..........!!!!'  Then reached in and took out the mug.  The entire family laughed, including him!  It does look just like his camera lens.  Too fun.  He uses it.  Loves it.  Wash by hand probably best idea.
5	1359331200	This was a gift for someone. It's a very unique gift that people will love to show around. Get this!
4	1359244800	This was bought as a gift for a Canon Camera enthusiast and was all that I expected.  A good buy.
2	1359244800	the cup looks cool and all but theres a little hole in the side that allows water to get trapped between the metal casing and the platic shell. rusty water purs out when i drink anything out of it and its nasty
5	1359158400	Had Canon logo on it and it looked just like a REAL Canon lens. Gave it to my son in law for Christmas. He was so happy with it that he put a picture on his Facebook page and his friends thought it was the real lens. Arrived on time and in great condition. Buy from with confidence.
4	1359158400	I got this for a friend for Christmas. He is a professional photographer and he loved it! It came in the mail promptly and was a big hit. Strongly recommend.
5	1359158400	This cup is really nice. It almost looks like the real Canon 24-105L lens! If you actually look at it from a distance you can't even tell it's a coffee cup. The lid is decent, it leaks a little when the opening where you sip from is even closed. But thats no deal breaker for me. I even bought another one as a Christmas present for a friend and he loved it! It's made of high quality plastic and it even has some heft to it. Overall, I would highly recommend to other photographers.
1	1358985600	Expected to be the original, which is made with a real len, but this is a copy.Had I known I would not have bought.
5	1358985600	This mug was a HUGE hit with the person I gave it to, who happens to be big into photography. Now he takes this mug everywhere with him. He commented that half-full, it even has the proper weight of a camera lens.Another comment about this mug is that it has a red line which apparently is only given to high quality camera lenses...
3	1358899200	I got this product from a friend, who had it sent right to my house. I received one that says "Canon" on it, versus the "Canian" or whatever, others have claimed to receive. Mine has a lid, as well as metal inside. I washed it and put coffee in it as soon as I got it. So far so good. Does have a strong plastic smell, but I'm hoping that goes away within a few days/washes. Definitely a fun coffee mug to use every now and then!
5	1358899200	I bought two of these as Christmas gifts for people who are really into photography. They absolutely loved them and couldn't stop talking about how neat they are! Also, they said it looks just like the real thing!
5	1358899200	Great product. I purchased it as a gift. It arrived on time and I would purchase from this seller anytime.
5	1358812800	I bought this mug for my brother for Christmas. He loves it. He is a photographer and had actually thought that I had bought him a new lens ^_^  . The mug travels well and has a reeealllly tight seal.
5	1358726400	This mug is awesome for any photography enthusiast. It really looks like an actual camera lens.  I often time find myself wondering why my wife just left her lens on the counter.... then it hits me.
3	1358640000	Doesn't hold as much coffee as you would like it too. More of a novelty gift. But a great price
4	1358640000	It 's fine, but not as good as in the picture. You can notice some detail is just not as good as you think it should be. Over all, it's good but a little bit over price.
5	1358553600	I bought this travel coffee cup for an aspiring photographer who adores coffee.  She loved it!  It was the perfect gift.
4	1358553600	The cup itself when i pulled it out looked GREAT! However the more i played with it, it started to lose the greatness. The zoom and focus rings are rubber, twist but do not zoom the cup(change length) and are quite difficult to turn. And make sure you know it says Canaim and made in china which as some might know is an not actual camera company. But i was fine with that because i an a nikon and i got for the price. Also it came much faster than expected. Got it today, expected delivery: February 3. Overall no leaks or cracks. So far so good
5	1358553600	The product is awesome! I bought it as a gift for someone and the person loved it a lot. It's a great item to have as a collectible too.
4	1358467200	Overall great product. The only downside is that it is an off brand travel mug. It resembles a canon lens but on it it says &#34;caniam&#34;. I had purchased this item for $20. I would suggest buying it around $10. The price does go down.
1	1358467200	Purchased this item because it looked cool. Unfortunately, within a couple of days of receiving the item, it broke. The top will not properly screw on to the cup and slips causing leakage. Definitely disappointed.
3	1358467200	The cup didn't quite look like a real camera lens and why slightly cheap looking. However, the lid is nice and tight and its still an interesting coffee mub.
2	1358467200	This  mug smells strongly of chemicals, even after numerous washings. I won't be drinking out of it. Also, my lid does not say Canon on it ( which isn't a huge deal).
5	1358380800	I gave this a 5 star because this gift is clever and fun for coffee drinkers. People stare at you in awe wondering why your drinking out of a camera lense. i would recommend this to any coffee lover drinkers out there so have an interesting day of people staring at you. I love it!
4	1358380800	It's good and take advantage of them in my car ExcellentIt's good and take advantage of them in my car Excellent
5	1358294400	Bought this as a christmas present for a friend and he loved it.  Very realistic looking.  Can't comment on how durable it is because I don't have it but overall, very satisfied.
2	1358294400	Bought this mug to give as a gift. Was very disappointed when the recipient asked if it could be returned because the lid wouldnt stay on after 1 use. Not sure if I should take the chance and order another.....
4	1358294400	My boss got this for me for Christmas and I'm pretty happy with it. Although the mug says "Caniam" all over it instead of Canon, it is still a nice little piece. I use it every day at work, although I'm afraid to take it home to put it in the dishwasher. It's got a good weight to it, but doesn't hold a lot of coffee. I would recommend getting one of these for the Canon-ophile in your life, as long as they don't need the Canon name on it.
5	1358294400	My mug is exactly like the pictures, it has the canon logo and it's thermal. Ask the seller if they have one with the canon logo! Just like a lens, I'm very satisfied!
1	1358208000	20 words>>>>When I researched 24 oz mugs, i seen this one in the middle of all the others. Did I see the (24-105mm) no. What good is a 4oz mug? Very disapointed!
5	1358121600	I have an illness that requires the use of a Bi-Pap machine to breathe, and have tried many cups or mugs to drink my morning coffee, to no avail.  Therefore, I was on the verge of feeling like I would have to give up my morning coffee until I found this particular mug.  As this mug allows me to drink my coffee as long as I use the nasal pillow fitting rather than a mask.  This has been the greatest find for me, and I can still enjoy my morning coffee and start my day with a very positive outlook by enjoying my morning coffee just as I have for Fifty years!!!!!!!!!  Thanks!!!!!!!!!
5	1358121600	I gave the mug to my daughter for Christmas and she was thrilled. She is a professional photographer and she did tell me one of her coworkers received one last year so the surprise of &#34;you never saw one before&#34; was gone but she still was very happy with this gift. It is really looks like a telephoto lens and is well made.
5	1358121600	My daughter ordered this for her photographer dad for Christmas and he loves it. It was definitely his favorite gift. It looks just like one of his lenses. We keep seeing it in the kitchen and every time we are tricked and wonder why his expensive lens is sitting near the sink:)
3	1358121600	This would make a good gift idea for a photographer friend. If you dont value any form of photography please don't buy this as you may not like it. It retains heat and can easily be used on the go.
2	1358035200	I think some of the other sellers have a better product. Some reviews I saw said this was labeled &#34;Canon&#34; and had stainless steel inside. The one I received leaks and says &#34;Canium&#34; the company that sold it to me also never got back to me when I emailed to ask if it was the generic name or the &#34;Canon&#34; name on it and to verify if it was stainless steel. They also never got back to me when I gave them a bad review.
5	1358035200	I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! Everyone is always commenting on the interesting design of the mug and how they've never seen anything like it before. I intend on getting one for myself.
4	1358035200	This gift is perfect for a coffee buff how is also a camera buff.  Its a tad smaller then I would like, that's why i gave it 4 stars.  Otherwise it would've been 5 stars.
1	1358035200	I literally used this present once. It was given to me by my husband, as a Christmas present. I am very disappointed, I used it and immediately the steel expanded and I can no longer use it, the cap no longer stays on the actual mug making it virtually impossible for it to be " travel". Very sad because I loved it! But now I can no longer use it. Not happy at all!!!! Will be returning.
5	1357948800	This was a Christmas gift for a friend that just got into photography.  He loves it  and does not leave his sight :-)
4	1357862400	It seems the lid does not completely seal at times.  But other than that, it is great.What can be done to have it seal tightly?  I have been using it, though, so what canI do?  I am also interested in the 70-200 lense-style mug(white&Black; design) withCanon written on it.Thank you for your cooperationRecipient of Gift(Husband & Father)
1	1357776000	I'm giving this product one star for the following reason: when I took the mug out of its box (not the amazon shipping box, but the product's box) I noticed there was a feather inside of it. Why in the world would a feather be there? Needless to say I'm not drinking my coffee on this; it went right to the trash can. This is odd and gross, I'm not sure if its the factory or the seller fault.My advice is not to buy this.
3	1357776000	Looks great. Buttons fell out after first wash. Says Canon not Canaim. I hate the metal cup; it imparts a metallic taste to coffee. Bedes well with non acidic drinks.
5	1357776000	Very pleased with the way this mug looks like. If you didn't know what it is, you could think it's a real camera lens. I wouldn't put it in a dishwasher though, I think it needs hand care and gentle dish soap. All in all, a great (original) gift for someone who loves photography. : )
1	1357776000	I purchased this as a neat little Christmas &#34;stocking stuffer&#34; for my wife who is a wedding photographer by trade.  What we received is absolutely nothing like what is described.  There was NO lid, nor was the interior stainless.  It was a useless open plastic cup.  I returned it for a refund.  Buyer beware!!
2	1357776000	I wouldn't have a problem with the cup if it actually matched the product pictured. It doesn't. It's a "Camian" lens "Made in China" and not a "Canon" "Made in Japan." At the very least, the seller should change the picture.
1	1357776000	This cup was nothing as described!  It is a single wall, plastic interior cup with NO STAINLESS STEEL and there was NO lid.  I doubt this cup is suitable for hot beverages and it appears a plastic film inside the cup is peeling...
5	1357689600	My mother is an amateur photographer and bird watcher and she loved it. The mug looks pretty real, and well, it's a mug, so it's not like there could be any functionality issues. So in other words, WORKS GREAT!
5	1357689600	This travel mug is great.l  Really looks like a camera lens and keeps my coffee hot.  I would recommend it.
4	1357689600	bought this for my sister because shes an inspiring  photographer and she drinks coffee so this was perfect for her loved the item but a little smaller than I expected I was hoping it came sooner but great buy
5	1357689600	I love this coffee mug. It's practical and looks so real as a camera lens. I recommend it to anyone.
5	1357603200	I have bought 2 of these mugs for my photographer friends and they both love this mug. It isn't very large, but it fits in cup holders and doesn't have a handle to get in the way - and that sometimes is the most important thing.
1	1357603200	PRODUCT ID NOT COME WITH LID OR STAINLESS STEEL. DO NOT BUY. PRODUCT WAS PROMPTLY RETURNED. I HOPE WHAT I SAY IS VALID BECAUSE I'M TALKING IN CAPS.
5	1357603200	Very fast shipping! This item is as described and too cute! The camera/photography buff I got this for absolutely loved it! Stainless steel keeps your drink hot and lid makes it a travel mug! Wonderful :)
5	1357516800	I love this mug! It is so great. The one I have does say Canon. I love that the 'lens' even has the switches for image stabilization and auto focus, the switches do not move though, nothing on the mug does. The focus rings are rubber grip, which is nice.
5	1357516800	My wife is a photography teacher and this is the best gift I ever gave her.the mug looks like a real lent. So far so good, the mug does not leak and it is well done. The shipping was impressively fast, it came from  china.
4	1357430400	its great looks great good quality EXCEPT for the lock on the cap its very crappy opposite of the actual cup itself
4	1357430400	I bought this for my father in law, he is a photographer and owns a canon... He LOVED IT!! The only downside is that I thought it said canon on the photo, but when I received it it read caniam... No biggie, it still looks good and it was very much liked.
4	1357430400	I bought this travel mug for my sister who is a photography major in college, and she absolutely fell in love with it. Unlike other bulkier (and more expensive) versions of this same product, it is small enough to fit into a car cup holder, and to carry comfortably in your hand, and also has a drinking lid which makes it extremely convenient for on-the-go use. The stainless steel interior keeps coffee warm, and makes for easy clean up--however, I would not recommend dish-washing this product as it the paint may scratch off, so just a gentle hand washing will do. It has a cute zoom-lens appearance, and would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the 'Caniam' name which is on the side of the mug. Obviously it is not a 'Canon' licensed product, and therefor cannot have 'Canon' plastered on the side of it, but it maybe could have been left off entirely and wouldn't have ruined the authenticity or appearance of it. Overall this is a great product, and I would highly recommend it for any photography enthusiast in your life!
5	1357430400	The shipping was super fast and the cup was in perfect condition the box was slightyl beat up but non the less me teacher adores his new cup~
5	1357344000	I bought this for my husband who loves coffee and photography.  It's the perfect little travel mug.  It's larger than the average coffee cup, but not so large that your coffee has the chance to get cold before you drink it.  It fits well under a single serving K-Cup brewer, unlike standard travel mugs and keeps its contents warm for a very long time.  Unlike some photo lens mugs, this one doesn't have any moving parts, but it's still a fun mug that is also very practical.
4	1357344000	I bought this thermos as a christmas present to myself and i don't regret it. It's so cute and compact! I read from reviews that most people have gotten theirs with &#34;caniam&#34; on it instead of &#34;canon&#34; so i was very paranoid of making the same mistake. I saw the seller &#34;HCL-join&#34; and in their little spiel, they said that their thermos said &#34;canon&#34; on it - just to make sure i emailed them just to make sure and they confirmed it said 'canon'.i bought it and even though amazon said my package wouldn't come about 3-4 weeks later, it came about a week and a half instead! I was very pleased. the packaging came very nicely and safe and nothing was broken.After washing it and examining it, i was very satisfied. The little rings on the mug turn but they don't extend the cup which is kind of a bummer. the lid's beak extends a bit much where you sip from, which makes you have to tilt the thermos a bit up more. there's also a hole in the lid too which means i wouldn't recommend you to put it in your bag and let it move around in their or it will spill. those are the only cons to the product.i would recommend you to buy this product - from HCL-JOIN if you want the canon logo on it.
1	1357257600	I got this as a gift for Christmas and was so excites to show it off to people, however i was very disappointed that all the parts did not come with my order. All I received with my order was the "lens" shell and that was it, no lid and no stainless steel insert. Extremely disappointed, I wanted to get another one however this has happened to a lot of people and I don't think amazon is carrying it anymore. Will be sending mine back for a refund.
4	1357171200	Lots of fun for camera buffs. Looks like a real lens. Just doesn't hold as much liquid as it seems.  Great gift.
5	1357171200	I got it for my brother in law (who is a well known photographer) for christmas.  It shipped super fast, even with all the christmas craziness, so since it's not the holidays anymore, i'm sure you could expect a speedy delivery!  It seemed to be great quality, the lid does not leak and its a pretty sturdy (and very realistic!!!) little mug.  It is short though, I think a 12oz or something, but its a great buy!
1	1357084800	I received this mug as a Christmas present from my wife and I was super excited to use it. The first time i hand washed the mug but when drinking coffee out of the mug it left this metallic/plastic after taste in my mouth. So out put in the dish washer for another try the next morning. Same metallic/plastic after taste! I really don't think that this item is a safe vessel for liquids for human consumption. Rather then return it I've decided to use it as a pencil and pen holder on my desk.
5	1356998400	I got this as a gift for a friend. It was fantastic and had much greater detail than I expect.
5	1356998400	Looks exactly like the photo! My daughter loves her new mug! Great gift for any photographer! Will definitely recommend to others!
5	1356998400	This product came GORGEOUS but I have had horror stories from others who ordered it. A lot of people say it doesn't come saying 'Canon' or comes broken, etc. I read a few reviews in which people suggested buying it from 'Luminaries' and it was definitely the right choice. Product is absolutely gorgeous. It came very quick, came in a nice box, came completely unharmed and said 'Canon' on it (which is very important to a photographer!) It was a gift for a friend whose two favorite things are photography and coffee and they absolutely gushed over it :)
5	1356912000	The person that rec'd this as their gift loved it. The writing on the pseudo lens wore off quickly in the first run through the dishwasher, but it still looks cool.
4	1356912000	THE CUP WAS VERY NICE EXCEPT I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BIGGER ONE ITS KIND OF SMALL FOR  ME WHEN I GO TO WORK ID BE FILLING IT UP MORE NO WAY DOES IT HOLD 8 OZS WATER BUT IT IS NICE DO U CARRY THE BIGGER ONES AND HOW MUCH IS IT.
2	1356739200	This was purchased not only as a novelty gift, but also to be a useful travel mug. Description boasted drinking lid and stainless steel interior, neither of which were delivered. The picture and description provided were completely wrong, as the mug had no lid, and a black plastic interior. While a nice rendition of the lens on the exterior, this mug is completely useless as a travel mug. This was supposed to be given as a Christmas gift, but missing components ruined the gift. Item being returned.
1	1356652800	Not sure what I thought this would be like, but I expected it to be a bit...less crappie! I would suspect the crap Chinese spraypaint to last about 5 uses before peeling completely off. I wish someone would make a quality one, even if it cost more. This is junk...
5	1356566400	Great gift idea! It took a very long time in transit, but was well worth the wait. There seem to be conflicting reviews about whether Canon is written on the mug, but the one I received had the real name. Additionally, there was great detail and it looked just like a lens.
3	1356480000	Okay for a conversational piece but tipsy.  Would be okay for the car.  Didn't really keep the coffee warm too long.
4	1356480000	liked that the top of mug had the name &#34;Canon&#34; and not a look-a-like word.  I purchased as a gift for someone and recipient liked that it looked so real.
4	1356480000	This gift totally fooled my cousin who I bought this for.  Looks a lot like a real lens and a very creative idea besides a typical thermos
5	1356480000	is a 'thermos' type coffee mug. all the parts are snug, and the best part - it resembles the Canon 24-105mm lens, with the labels and everything.great buy. great gift for a photographer / enthusiast..p.s. DO NOT MICROWAVE - it will melt the plastic surface.
4	1356393600	First off, the lid is a sliding latch sipping lid, not the fisheye lens like in the pictures. That is OK. It twists on. Nice details - looks neat, and your photo friends will love it. Not the best coffee cup ever, but a fun novelty / conversation piece.
3	1356307200	This really isn't the best quality mug. It does the job, holds my coffee. But, the writing on the lid smudged off ( on my nose, might I add!!) and it just feels pretty flimsy.
3	1356048000	It looks like a real lens and fooled the person I gave it to as a gag gift.  However, it is very lightweight, so even holding the box isn't particularly convincing to anyone who has ever held a real lens before.  Additionally, the inside is plastic, not stainless steel, so I'm not sure I'd want to use it for real.  It was effective as a gag gift, though.
2	1355875200	Disappointing. I purchased this for my daughter who is a professional photographer and Canon user. The mug seems OK but the pictures of the product clearly say Canon on the mug. The one I received is similar but does not say Canon on it. Kind of defeats the purpose of the gift. Oh well, no time to exchange it in time for Christmas so I guess I'll keep it.
4	1355875200	Very cool & 'lifelike' - Love the details.  i like that the cap is designed so you can drink out of it, rather than having to remove it.
5	1355875200	have not used it yet - it is a gift for Christmas But I LOVE the way it looks :)
1	1355788800	Bought this mug specifically because it said that it said &#34;Canon&#34; on the side. It did NOT and I was not able to get a replacement mug from the company. Luckily Amazon gave me some money back so I only ended up paying $5 in the end. But it's not what I wanted and it's not what my husband asked for - so it will probably end up in a garage sale pile.
4	1355443200	I only wish this cup was a little bigger, but it does fine for my needs.  I have a little trouble tightening the lid, but if I keep turning it eventally tightens up.
1	1355443200	The item has shipped but not arrived.  The notification states it's being shipped by China Post.  If I had know this was coming from out of the US I would not have ordered the coffee mug.  I'll come back after it arrives to when I know how warm it keeps the coffee.
1	1355356800	The item i received had no stainless steel liner or lid.  The plastic was cheap, and the graphics and detail were poor.  Returned for a refund.  Look elsewhere for this type of novelty.
1	1355270400	I read the reviews and took the chance that we would receive a complete mug.  Alas, it was just the plastic shell, no stainless steel liner or lid. Grrr....I think I received someone else's return.  Returning this and hoping it won't get passed on to another gambler.
5	1355270400	Excellent.No boot and keeps the drink hot.It looks like my real camera lens.I loved my cup it's funny.
5	1355270400	I got this cup as an avid photographer. Its a great little cup. Definately a great conversation peice! Doesnt leak either.
1	1355270400	I'm about to leave seller feedback because, as many others have noted, what you receive is a cheap plastic cup with no lid and no stainless steel interior.  I paid almost $18 for a piece of plastic.  Since I do almost all of my shopping on Amazon, and I usually experience excellent quality, I am really ticked off about this.  Amazon customer service is issuing a refund, but it is on me to re-package this landfill item and send it back.  Then I will get my refund.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!
1	1355184000	Seriously, it's so annoying.... Canned Yams is all I can think of ... Ick. Bad ad. They should clearly specify that you will get canned yams... I mean Caniam...
1	1355184000	I specifically looked for a "Canon" logo, and that is what I thought I ordered.  It is NOT what I got.  It says "Canian".  It's too late to return the item, as it was purchased for my late boyfriend's brother and getting it right is now not an option.  Really dissatisfied and disappointed.The item also arrived in a travel-damaged box, and it was dirty inside the plastic container.
3	1355184000	The mug is cool. I just thought it was going to be a little bigger. Looks just like a lens.
1	1355184000	this is such a piece of crap! if i could give zero stars, i would. there is no "stainless steel". there is no lid. it's a cheap plastic cup, completely not what is advertized. it looks like some people on here get what is advertized and some get this. i am beyond frustrated. when you order something, it should not be a crap shoot whether you actually get it or not. will be returning, and never ordering from this distributor again. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
1	1355097600	The cup we received was just the outer plastic shell - there was no stainless liner and no lid.  The picture on the box correctly matched the contents but the label on the box specifically stated &#34;24-105mm Travel Coffee Mug / ..lity Stainless Steel Interior&#34; which is what the description says/shows online on Amazon.  This is not what is pictured on Amazon.
2	1355097600	I think the actual cup is awesome. True that it says "Caniam" instead of Canon, but still it is a nice looking, sturdy travel mug. It is stainless steel lined, which I always insist on for a coffee mug. It looks incredibly like the real canon lens. Very happy with the cup part. However, the lid is complete junk. Not a bad design in that it has screw threads and a nice seal but it shrinks after 2 days.When I first got it and washed it out, I noticed a couple of things I didn't like.1. Hard plastic on bottom. Placing it down on a table sort of bangs. I resolved this by gluing a piece Velcro on the bottom. I just used the furry part. Fixed that problem nicely.2. Valve on lid that you can shut off to keep warm open to drink coffee, flopped around too easy. I solved this by putting an o-ring under the valve. This added resistance. Problem solved.Then, after one day of drinking hot coffee I noticed that the lid seemed slightly loose. It still tightened up though. After 2 days, it was more loose. After 3 days it didn't tighten up at all. The plastic lid shrunk such that it no longer contacted the screw threads on the cup. I solved this by heating the plastic with a small torch and stretched the plastic with a tool. It then worked better than when I got it. After one more day of hot coffee it shrunk again.So, I feel the mug is great but the cover is junk. If you buy this product plan on drinking coffee without the lid.P.S. I didn't drink any cold beverage so I can't comment on that.
1	1354838400	I just bought two of these two days ago.  They came today.  Both boxes only included the plastic outside - neither one had the stainless steel insulation or the lid!!!  So disappointing :(  I'm sending them back.  I really want what the picture said, but that's not what I got!  Afraid to re-order!
5	1354838400	I bought this for my grandpa for christmas!! im so excited to see his face when he opens it. i love it!!
4	1354752000	I received mine today and it looks great; such a nice size. It is a gift for a friend who loves cameras, so I am sure she will love it. It says "Canon;" It looks authentic. It's nice for a gift.
5	1354579200	It doesn't say 'Canon,' it says 'Caniam.' That's not a problem, just odd. It showed up at my house weeks before I was expecting it though, and that was a happy surprise!
4	1354579200	The pictures show a Canon logo, so some products are made with the real logo, but as some reviewers have mentioned, there are some with a misspelled logo. I took a chance and ordered from the cheapest seller. I got a mug with "Caniam" on it, plus a paint smudge, so I returned that. I went through the seller list and found one (Luminaries) that indicated the mug was a Canon replica. I emailed them, and they assured me the product they shipped had the Canon logo on it, so I ordered from them. It does, in fact, have the Canon logo and the "Made in Japan" type on the lens to make it an actual replica. I'm really happy with it, although it's Christmas gift, so I won't know how it functions as a mug for a while.
1	1354579200	I'd give this a no-stars rating if I could. I looked at all the reviews before purchasing this product. Some reviewers said the mug has the word "Canon" on the lid and side, others said it had "Caniam" instead - it wasn't clear if the reviews were for mugs all from the same seller. I figured I had a 50/50 shot of getting one that says Canon - but no such luck. It seems to be a pretty heavy mug and looks like a real lens but I didn't even take it out of the plastic. My camera friend would not like the fake name any more than I do.  I don't appreciate false advertising - the product from this seller is pictured as having the Canon word, when it doesn't. I'm returning and will purchase the real thing from ThinkGeek - it is more expensive but they advertise their products accurately.
4	1354579200	I got this for my roommate who is really into journalism and film and all that jazz. I was very impressed with it and I think she will be too. :)
5	1354233600	The appearance, product quality, unbeatable really looks like a camera lens. I could not be happier with this product, perfect for traveling
5	1354147200	Bought for my husband for fun for Christmas. The one I ordered does say &#34;canon&#34; on it. Wish the box was a little nicer, but for the price I won't complain (seen elsewhere for $30-40). I only hope he doesn't see the writing on the box and jump to the conclusion that I bought him a $1000 camera lens, that sure would be a disappointment. I'm tickled waiting for him to open it on Christmas Day, I just hate waiting. Certainly a conversation starter! I can't speak for the durability or the leak-proofness (ok, I made up that word, but you know what I mean) but either way, at the price, it doesn't really matter. It's just too darn cute!
5	1353888000	I love this cup.  It is exactly what I wanted and it is very sturdy and will be used alot.  Cute idea.
5	1353888000	Ordered this mug as a gift for an avid photographer. The mug seems to be built well (just like a canon ;-)). It also comes in a box that looks just like a canon lens box. This is a great gift for a photographer who uses canon products and they will be sure to love it.
5	1353801600	This is a great product for photography lovers. The cup is excellent quality and says canon. It looks just like a canon lens.
5	1353456000	I am not a coffee drinker but I am a photography and Canon is my brand... PERFECT! A great gift for any photographer friends of yours!
1	1353369600	I was excited to get this lens mug for so cheap because Photojojo sells the &#34;same&#34; one for $24. I wasn't aware that it would LOOK so cheap, though. Maybe I set my expectations way too high, but it looks nothing like it does in the photographs. The print on the mug is dull, smeared, and scratched in some parts - it also looks nothing like an actual Canon lens. The only good thing about this, is that it will only look decent from a distance. Also, it also says &#34;CANIAM&#34; in four different places. I think that might be the worst part, haha.
1	1352332800	I bought this because I wanted a lens mug with a sippy lid, however this one doesn't work. I was rinsing out the mug for the first time and decided to test the lid since it seemed loose. When you go to screw it on it screws endlessly it never gets tight. I put some water in and put the lid on to see if maybe I could hold the top on and drink, however in my test with soapy water, I put the lid on and turned it sideways and the lid fell off along with all the soapy water... This is the only lens mug that had a sip lid, and yes I tried to see if the lid would fit my other ones and it doesn't. So this item is goin BACK to amazon...a-z.... item does not work!
5	1351814400	After seeing this item on one of those Deal sites, I searched out the item on Amazon as I prefer this site, I found several Camera Lens mugs but none of them had the drinkable lid!!  This one has a drinkable lid that says "Canon" right on the top.  This is the cutest thing ever for someone who is into photography.  Can't wait to give it to my husband for Christmas!!!!!
5	1351209600	Mine says Canon all over it and, having just bought the actual lens, think this is fantastic. Detail is great although I fear the lettering wouldn't stand up to much dishwasher-ing if any all but who knows.  The stainless insert is easy to clean. The top sippy cover is very good and it feels oddly comfortable to hold and drink from.  Doesn't fit perfectly in my car's cup holder but secure enough (hey it is faithful to the lens not the std cup holder sizes). With coffee in it I think it weighs as much as my real 24-105!  Can't beat the price either.
4	1348272000	I received my within a week. Everything work great and mine has "Canon" on it. It looks like a real thing. I drink lots of coffee. I hope it's a 16 oz cup instead of 12 oz.
5	1347321600	This mug is awesome!! It says Canon everywhere and it really looks like a real lens. Perfect size and look.
5	1347321600	I love it! Very good buy!! I use it almost every day. It keeps my coffee hot. I would recommend this product to my friends.
5	1345852800	This mug is so cool! I bought it for a gift for our wedding photographer, and I had to make myself give it to her because I would really love to have something like this! All the parts look real, like you could move the switches and twist the lens, etc.! This is a great deal, no kidding. It's very sturdy and people will look twice when you drink out of one of these. :)
5	1344988800	a very fun product that amazes my friends - looks like the real thing - just nervous someone will break into my car cause it looks so much like a real lens
2	1344556800	My husband is big on coffee and cameras so this mug seemed like the perfect replacement for his current mug. The Mug looked great but the stopper on the lids spout did not stay closed which would have made a mess in my car.
5	1343088000	I might have to drink more cOffweeee... just because. This cup holds up to 10oz of liquid enough to have my coffee. I was expecting "CANIAM" but it say's Canon!, I'm happy with this product... check out the pictures I posted.
5	1341100800	This is a great Coffee mug. It keeps the drink nice and hot and does not leak when knocked over on it's side. I gave Six of them to my Photo Club Fiends and they are also delighted.
5	1340150400	This cup was amazing. It was shipped accurately and it says Canon! I don't know why everyone else is saying it says Canium because mine says Canon! I loved this and it was perfect!
1	1338854400	This is not a Canon lens mug. It says "Caniam" on it. I wish I would have known because I would not have bought this. Being that the product was only $7 plus shipping, I probably won't be returning it. It should have been mentioned in the listing that it's not coming from Canon.
4	1337904000	I will agree with some of the other reviews that "Canaim" was a bit disappointing to see. That being said, I was buying this as a gift for a Canon-lover in my life, and did some extensive research first. This may not be the best option, but it is certainly not the worst by far.What drew me to this mug specifically (aside from the price, which is fantastic for what you're getting), was the fact that it actually has a travel mug top. Some of the nicer, more detailed, and more expensive versions of this only had a cap that screwed off, making using it in the car impossible. I gave this gift a month ago, and even with daily use it has not had any of the rust issues mentioned by others.Bottom line is that it may not be as detailed as I had hoped, and it might not be the finest quality available, but you can only be so upset when your $10 purchase doesn't completely blow you away.
4	1337644800	I REALLY like this lens coffee cup!It "looks" like a REAL camera lens.It "Works" like a REAL Coffee Cup!I like the "sippy cup lid" for travel, it seals perfectly (no drips)Keeps my hot coffee hot, and iced drinks cold.The ONLY "Negative" thing about it...It's not a legally licensed brand so it can't say "Canon"So, instead, it says "Caniam" in the Canon font. But that's the ONLY "negative" thing about it so, it's well worth the price.I took it (full of hot coffee) to my photography club meeting, and "discreetly" took a sip of coffee from the lens sitting on the table. Needless to say, this received rave reviews. People loved it!YES, it IS a "novelty" item but it WORKS Great and Looks Great too!I am VERY pleased with the quality, value and price.I LOVE IT!
5	1337558400	Product is well made and looks exactly like a real camera lens. Well worth the price and delivered quickly. You won't be disappointed if you buy this.
1	1335744000	This is not a Canon mug, it's labeled "Caniam". I was very careful to order a mug that was described/pictured with the authentic Canon logo but this product was not described accurately. Cheap, shiny plastic finish on outside does not match the authentic Canon lens texture. Canon users will see the difference immediately. Seams from mold are visible. Numbers in depth of field window are on a clear sticker placed crooked on outside of lens. Wouldn't be surprised if that sticker came off during washing. Buttons and rings don't move. Cap fits tightly but I didn't check to see if it's waterproof since I'm returning it. Very disappointed.
5	1335484800	This was purchased as a gift. When It arrived it looked so great, I wanted one!!! Will purchase more, thanks!
2	1335398400	The description is (or was if they changed it by now) way off. Claims to be a canon mug by canon but is not. Says a knock off name brand. I gave it to a friend as a gift who is very eclectic and into niche things like this. A week later, this thing started to rust inside the mug. Totally embraced about this now. Id give them item a higher rating if they weren't so sketchy in hiding the true cheapness of this product.
1	1335398400	This was advertised as a Canon Mug....now they changed it. It looks cool and I hope it don't rust like one reviewer said.
3	1334880000	This is a nice product, came in good time. A little smaller than i expected. I was skeptical of buying because it had no reviews but worry not, mine came in good condition and overall i'm a happy customer.I would give it 4 stars but i just got it and haven't washed much to see how it stands up. but it is adorable.
