5	1404518400	I love this book. I thought I wouldn't but it was lovely. the characters could have been built up a little better but the story line was amazing.
4	1404345600	Solid read.  Kept me wanting to turn another page.  I would definitely recommend this book and can't wait to dive into the next book in the series.
4	1404345600	I really enjoyed this one. Thankfully this wasn't about a contract but an agreement. Jack was arrogant and totally sweet. I didn't agree with some of the things he did like not telling (Paige) his real name but overall he was a really sweet character. I wish that we could have have had more insight to who he is though. Whats his history and what made him the way he is?Overall this was a easy book for me to get into and I enjoyed the writing style. I have to say that I am glad that I have the next book already to see what happens next.
5	1404345600	I absolutely loved this book. The story was so easy to fall into, you just couldn't put it down. The characters were engaging and sexy. I can't wait to get part2.
5	1404345600	absolutely loved it!
5	1404259200	Good writing, well developed characters! Can't wait to read the next one! I'll take a Jack Henry...please and thank you!!
5	1404259200	This book took me by surprise ~ I loved every second I read this book and I couldn&#8217;t put it down. There&#8217;s also a major cliffhanger to leave you desperate for book two. An amazing story ~ it just blew me away. It totally consumed me ~ I was engrossed from the first word right through to the very end
5	1404086400	This is a story u want to read when you have time and no plans. It's such a great story you won't be able to put it down. I strongly recommend getting books 2 and 3, so you'll just continue and not have to wait the frustrating 2seconds to download. Lol  Wonderful love story that will make you fall in love with the characters. This a new author for me, but one I'll continue to read.
5	1404000000	I'm booking my ticket for Australia now! I love Jack and Laurelyn and they are one of my all time favorite couples now! I'm off to read book two now!
5	1404000000	Georgia Cates this is an awesome read!!! Couldn't put it down. I will be getting the second and third books!
5	1403913600	FROM A INTERESTING ATTRACTION AT A WINE TASTING ,TO A NO NAMES GIVEN, THREE MONTHS AFFAIR. TO UNEXPECTED ROMANCE, WHICH TAKES PLACE IN AUSTRALIA'S WINE COUNTRY.  LOVED THE STORY.  CAN NOT WAIT TO READ BOOK 2.
4	1403913600	50 shades meets Australia.  Great story of no strings attached that ultimately turns it to something more and then it's too late
5	1403740800	5 Stars!!! I really liked Jack Henry and Laurelyn. I love stories that make my gut twist and that happened a couple of times- The first night that she met Jack Henry's family and he yelled at her in the bedroom- tears were leaking out of my eyes. And when she left to go back to the USA and he read the note she left. Ugh!!!!
4	1403740800	Beautifully written. The author brings you into the story and you feel like you are right there with the characters. It was emotional, I laughed, I cried, and my kindle was on fire from time to time. This is a must read, I am going straight to book 2 because the end left me with tears and so much wanting to strangle the author for the cliff hanger, but it is all worth it.I recommend 18 + year old readers. Like I said, my kindle was smoking...
5	1403568000	Absolutely loved it. I can't wait to see what happens next between Jack and Laurelyn.  Makes me want that kind of life.
5	1402358400	Absolutely LOVED this book! ...it is one that as soon as you start it, the pages just continue- until you realize you have finished the book. The characters are very visible, and you truly are there with them through every moment, every touch, and every emotion. A definite must read!!
4	1402099200	** spoiler alert **I saw this book for a while but it was a little expensive so I waited until one day it was free. I downloaded it without hesitation. The book was written in dual POVs which is my favorite. I was hooked from the start. I thought at first that it was going to be Addison's brother or his friend that would be Laurelyn's love interest. I was wrong. Jack was something a whole lot different.The plot line was predictable. Because a relationship with 3 months agreement was going to end with them falling for each other and with Laurelyn leaving without telling him. It was predictable, though I enjoyed it. I was intrigued if it was going to turned out different. At least the part where he brought her to his family was a welcome surprise. Audrey wasn't mention again but I'm sure she was going to make an appearance later.There were some typos. But not to the point I couldn't tolerate. I told myself I'm not going to buy the second book and read my high pile of to-read first. Turned out I wasn't that strong. I bought the second book right after I finished this one.
5	1401667200	I loved it. I couldn't put it down. I haven't been this in love with two characters since 50 shades
4	1401494400	This book was a great read I'm so glad I read it I can't wait to read the next book
3	1401494400	A lot of potential with good characters but felt rushed maybe?  Kept waiting for a storyline to play out...everything resolved quickly?
1	1401408000	This book -- for the first fifteen pages or so -- seemed well written. Then it got worse. And worse. And kept getting worse after that. My guess is that the beginning of it was professionally edited to send away to a publisher, but not the rest of it.The book was childish, unbelievable, and the sex scenes completely boring, predictable and lifeless. Part A was rubbed over Part B, resulting in Reaction C in Part D, so that Part E could be inserted into Part F, and there's your money shot.Awful.In fact, another reviewer pointed out that the wording of the sex scenes seemed to have been lifted from 50 Shades of Grey, and sadly, this seems to be true. If you must copy, why not copy something GOOD? Having gone from reading this book to reading Alice Close Your Eyes by Averil Dean, the contrast was a huge shock to the system. Dean's book, while more a dark psychosexual thriller than a romance, had the best sex scenes I've read. Sure, they too were literal -- but the Part A, Part B stuff went all the way to Z, and encompassed not just sight and sounds, but every sense we humans can experience, making the sex scenes rich, sensory, and complete. THAT book is one to copy, or rather to read and learn from.Back to Beauty from Pain.I am Australian. The H in this book is Australian. The author has rounded up a few expressions from our rich language, sprinkled them through the book, almost always completely out of context, and made a dog's breakfast of the whole thing.The H uses these &#34;Australianisms&#34; in a way that is stupid and artless, and if anyone spoke that way here, everyone would think he was a complete simpleton, not the suave, intelligent man he's supposed to be in this book.He's supposedly rich, highly educated, from a rich family, Australia's most eligible bachelor, chased by paparazzi etcetera, but he and his whole family, not to mention his housekeeper, talk some cutesy uneducated version of the language which, in reality, was spoken only by grannies speaking to small children fifty years ago.Also, a lot of his speech is made of Americanisms, words not used in Australia, and yet our supposedly highly cultured Hero has never travelled outside Australia in his life.Also, the h supposedly just goes along with this guy telling her he plans to use her for sex and whatever else for a few weeks, but won't tell her his name, ever, and she goes, Oh yes, sure, that's fine, and wanders off to a secluded vineyard with him.In which universe are women this stupid?Interesting too that this young billionaire -- whose brother, by the way, has no money, apparently because he's married instead of working in the family business!?! -- does all the menial work on the vineyard, which seems to have a staff of one, apart from himself.I read a lot of books, and mostly I don't finish bad books, but I had to finish this one for a book club -- there's no way around this, the truth is that this is the worst book I've ever read. The worst I've ever finished, anyway. I won't be reading this author again, and I'm astounded the book's sold so well, and that anyone in the world could have given it a 5 star review. Unbelievable.
5	1401062400	I went into this book blind and was shocked at how much I enjoyed the story! It was different even with the predictability at the end and am looking forward to the rest of Laurelyn and Jacks story.
5	1400630400	I read this is in two days! And that's between working!!You will not be disappointed!! I'm off to buy the second in the series NOW!!
5	1400630400	Beauty from Pain by Georgia Cates is the book to read. Can wait to read the next book in this great series !
5	1400457600	Love love love love love love love this book so much I can't wait to read the next book I can believe she left him
5	1400457600	I really enjoyed this novel. It was a great intro for the rest of the books. I can't wait to purchase the others.
4	1399939200	Not a bad series. It is very likeable. I just don't know how these people have so much sex. It just seems so unrealistic.
5	1399852800	This story is good, like really good! When laurelyn goes to Australia for a 3 month holiday the last thing she was in the market got was a man, but when she crosses paths with a handsome man named Jack she gets a lot more than she bargained for.Having a courtship that they both agree will not involve feelings, and will end in 3 month. Sounds simple, right?
5	1399852800	Just when I think I have read all the good books and there is nothing else to read, I found Georgia Cates book! This book was fan-freakin-tastic. It was romantic and steamy, but also had a different story that was great to read. I love the chemistry between the two characters and I love mostly that they (the lead) are a little older. Already finished book 2, and now on to book 3! You can not put these books down!
5	1399766400	I have to say this is the first book that I finish reading  in a day because I could not put it down. I loved the story from the  beginning to the ending. This book is full of love, caring and some hot sexy scenes!!! I HIGHLY recommended reading this book. Now I gotta go I have book 2 waiting for me :)
5	1399593600	Fantastically sexy and entertaining this book had it all. I would loosely relate this book to the Fifty Shades series as they both feature rich domineering men, but Cates saves us from the awkwardness of the &#34;red room&#34;, instead imbuing her book full of hot sex scenes and character development. Laurelyn has set off on a three month journey with her best friend to stay in Australia with said best friends brother. We start to see right away that Laurelyn didn't leave Nashville, TN in the best of moods and is in fact running from a failed relationship and a music career falling apart. She is determined to use these three months to get over him and figure out where to go next with her musical career. Within her first few days in Australia she finds she has attracted the attention of a well dressed, sexy as hell man who is intent on having her for himself. You only live once so what could possibly go wrong with a three month fling when you both know the stakes; no real names, and we go our separate ways at the end. Three months of intense passion later we will have to see what happens to Laurelyn and her sexy Australian. This is a series and I quickly one-clicked book two and am devouring it too.
3	1399507200	I liked the h personality, carefree, sure, confident.I have to agree with several of the reviews in different items.  When reading the age of the main characters seems older, which I would have liked were the ages used.  It is an old overused idea the young girl with the young ultra millionaire.  In addition, being this genre one of my favorites, I could identify lots of ideas that seemed to come from not one but several books already around.  The good thing is that only the idea of the issue/item is used as when the idea is developed a twist or different approach is taken.I enjoyed the book, dislike the unnecessary use of more than one book or more books than really necessary but I guess that is the business part of this hobby.  Waited until all the books came out as I am not a fan of cliffhangers nor of story lines that change and get derailed depending on the success of the first books to extend the series without added value. Trying to review individually though.Summary: enjoyable, not a unique story but simply and well written.  An editor could help some as there were several errors although nothing major that distracted me.The stars are not as high as I would like due to the continuous recalling of the other books whenever something seemed familiar and the cliffhanger thingie.
1	1399334400	Did not care for the ONE-TRACK mindset on sex, or the blatant use of the sex act.  No story  at all unless your interested in when who is going to  ---- who and when.
5	1399248000	Jack was looking for a companion while on business. Laurelyn was taking time away from home to recover from a broken heart. What neither of them expected was to find each other.How could you not fall in love with Jack. Although he only wanted a temporary relationship, he was everything you'd expect from a man who knows how to love. They were good together and I look forward to reading the continuation of their story.
5	1399075200	This book is perfection combination of love, music, and diversity.The love story in this book, is heart-clinching.The line up music the author uses, is phenomenal!The story being centered in Australia, truly gave it a unique edge.  I loved reading the jargon that Australians use, and appreciate that the author put effort into it!Truly, this book needs to be read, and I cannot give Jack, and Laurelynn justice by even attempting to explain their story!Just read this book, and make sure you have the next book in the series!
5	1399075200	Loved it! Laurelyn and her best friend, Addison, go to Australia for 3 months. Laurelyn meets Jack Henry and they agree to a no love, no real names, no commitment relationship. Guess who gets their heart broken in this story?
5	1398902400	What a lucky girl to find herself such a sexy man.  I love her writing style and I love her music list.  I like how she chose for her to be a pole dancer for exercise.  What a sexy lady.
5	1398902400	Beautiful love story. The man is hot and the woman is hot and together they are sizzling. You will definitely be looking for the next book in this series. The story is captivating.
4	1398816000	WHAT a wonderful romantic book. I really enjoyed reading this story that was full of passion and romance. I couldn't put it down.
5	1398729600	Loved this series.The book was set in Australia which I felt was very authentic.  The two leads had great chemistry and were fun to watch.His mother is great character in the book, she's not your normally bossy mother.  She does hit him with her handbag because he misbehaved as a teenager.  Very funny and loving.
4	1398643200	I really liked how this 3 part series played out. This being part 1, it has a nice set up of how you expect the situation to go. And american girl on vacation for 3 months, meets up with a handsome Aussie for a no strings relationship. Of course strings happen, and you need to read the rest to find out. This is like a less erotic version of Fifty Shades. Very enjoyable if you get into character development.
4	1398556800	Georgia Cates writes an engaging story about two people who have individual issue that fall in love despite their best efforts to the contrary
5	1398297600	What a great book.  I could not put it down.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  Let's just say I am glad it is already out.
5	1398038400	Every woman would want a man like Jack Henry McLachan. I thought there would be some kink in the book (hence the title) but it was still a good sensual read, I can't wait for 2nd book.
3	1397952000	I'm not certain that I will read the next book.  Don't get me wrong, it was an okay story line.  I just feel it's been done already, and quite frankly better than thisone.  No offense.
5	1397952000	Where's the sequel??? A must read love story. I highly recommend to all those who love a erotic love story.
5	1397692800	I loved everything about this trilogy ---the Aussie location, the compelling couple and their journey, and the supporting characters.  I read this whole series in 3 days...could not put it down.
3	1397692800	I enjoyed it. Not quite as steamy as I thought, but good none the less. I'm about to read the next one.
5	1397520000	Great read. I was intrigued just as Laurelyn was... I would definitely recommend it to friends. Just a good read and well written! Props to the Author
2	1397347200	The sex was too much like porn but the story was good.  Now where can I find the next book that gives me the end.  I don't like not have an ending.
5	1397260800	Makes me want to believe in love again, this series was so good I could not put it down. Lots of sex scenes, some a little too much. I recommend  this series, I wish she would write a fourth or continue the series with the othe characters. Addison and Zac, Ben and Chloe and even her parents.
5	1397174400	Absolutely fantastic read!  Love the story love the characters love the writing!  I have already one clicked book 2 and I am sure I will do the same with book 3!  So happy I found this writer and this series!!!  Highly recommend!!!
3	1397088000	Interesting, the characters seem well constructed and the story is fluid, yet... well, you know, a twisted love story between two people who likes certain things. I liked it.
5	1397001600	AUSSIE WINE MAKER.....yes please....and I don't drink....but I will drink with Jack Henry....kind of jerk but for some reason we want that.....he will make you swoon, he will piss you off....but you will end up drunk over him, and the hangover....there is no cure and you wont want one......plus the real cure for a hangover is the hair of the dog....so just get drunk again.....
5	1396915200	This had everything I look for in a good book; funny, sad, romance and hot sex. I enjoyed the chemistry between Jack Henry and Laurelyn. I can't wait to start book 2 tonight.
5	1396915200	Brilliantly written "non" love story! I'm so absolutely loving this story, the characters, the suspense. The characters are to die for, fall in love with. Great erotica, great truism, great romance.
5	1396828800	So much emotions to name, from start to end. This one is now my #1 on my list of best book ever. I wanted to wish for this to be a never-ending story but we all know it can only go so far. Now..... ready for the next part.
5	1396828800	Love love love love love this book. Starts with a proposition and escalates into love and sadness. This book is great I love it and I couldn't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.
4	1396742400	Same fantasy framework. Rich man looking for a short term arrangement with no strings. Young woman on extended vacation considers the offer and accepts. Her character is as complicated and nuanced as his. Oh yeah, the sex is hot and frequent. You remember what it's like the first 3 months of a relationship, don't you?
5	1396742400	This was an awesome story - the second book in the series in a necessity - the third is a bonus...all a must read!
4	1396742400	Great read, read in a day! This was on my TBR list for awhile and not sure why I didn't get it - it hooked me in! The premise makes you want  to say, "no, don't do it, this is a bad idea!" But then "Paige" says yes, and we learn more about Lachlan . saw some negative reviews for book 2 and 3 but I think I'll take the chance!
5	1396656000	Loved it! Couldn't put it down! Started the second in the series and its as good as the first! A must read!
5	1396656000	this was a very romantic & mysterious book. The book is very intense and I could not stop reading it . I can&#34;t wait to read the other ones.
3	1396569600	Almost didn't finish cause it was so slow I would dozed off every time I pick it it up to read.
5	1396396800	This is a story that grips you right from the first page, a fast read, and leaves you wanting more, and more, read this book in one day, and can not wait to read the other two in this series!!!, what a great read, from start to finish.
5	1396396800	I always love books where there is a price to pay for what you think you want. The man wants no strings and anonymity in a 3 month 'affair' that anyone with a brain knows can't happen.  No, I'm not referring to the affair but to the 'no strings' and the staying 'anonymous' part. I'll give him points for trying though. The woman knows what she's getting into from the beginning but is also a realist enough to understand that her heart will become involved and worries about when it comes time to leave if she will be able to.A great story that did it all but stopped at a crucial point.  I just hate that I have to go through two more books to have the whole thing resolved.
1	1396396800	Bad character development.Over used statements like &#34;I eat like a pig hope you don't mind&#34;.Didn't finish. Glad I didn't pay for it!
3	1396310400	It is a wanna be like the Fifty Shades of Grey series, however I enjoyed it anyway. I enjoy calgon take me away books and well, this adds a little more to that.
5	1396310400	I picked up this book to try it for free. It was my first book from this author. I am so glad I took the chance on it. It has been an amazing story to read. I can't wait to read book 2 and book 3 which I am starting right after this review. Don't pass on this book . Read it!
5	1396224000	I read this book as a buddy read. I was really captivated by the summary. My thinking was that Australia, wine making bachelor had to = HOT and boy was I right. This is exactly the kind of book I wish I would have been around when I read Fifty Shades. While at times there are some cliche phrases and lines in this book it did not hinder my enjoyment. I really like that Lachlan had controlling aspects of him but he still allowed Paige or Lauralyn to have her life and friends. The lovemaking was extremely sweet and romantic. The ending was my favorite and the cliffhanger didn't bother me the least bit. It was filled with a lot of sweet emotion. I am looking forward to reading book 2 in the series and will complete the series.
5	1396224000	This book was different from the first chapter. I cried at the last few chapters, the chapters were written with so much passion and heartbreak words from both the characters (Jack Henry,and Laurelyn) thanks for writing an amazing book. I can't wait to read the second book
3	1396224000	This is a very sweet read, not my usual genre, but I enjoyed it all the same. The plot was an interesting concept with a new twist to the normal contacts we see so much of. There was a lot of sex but not a lot of details and it was all very vanilla. Still, a good read in a sweet HEA way.
4	1396137600	If you love accents would definitely recommend this book. Also has a slightly different unique love story to it. Reminds me of the proposal series but different.
5	1396137600	This series (no spoilers here) is really well written. I fell in love with the characters. Georgia's Cates is an excellent writer and does an amazing job of developing the characters and letting the reader get deep into their thoughts and souls. I read all three of the books quickly because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I will read them again and I know I will pick up on details I didn't retain the first time and enjoy the story even more. I highly recommend this series and look forward to reading more books written by this author.
5	1396051200	Keeps your interest from start to finish.  Leaves you wanting more, which we will get in the second book.  I can't wait!
4	1396051200	Very enjoyable storyline. Ms. Gates writing style is witty and humorous and the sex is hot! Can't wait to read her next book
5	1395878400	Very well written, loved it. Very good story too, the sexy parts were in fact sexy too. Words words words.
5	1395878400	Very good story line, hard to put down!  Had to get book two the day I finished book one.  Wanted to find out what was going on!!!!
4	1395878400	Couldn't put it down. Familiar story, but the unique characters make it work. I bought the sequel immediately. I was hooked.
5	1395878400	You will never relate to characters more in a book more than Laurelyn and Jack Henry.  Even if you have never lived in a world of relationship agreements and fine wine, you will instantly feel connected to these two characters.  I loved this book from start to finish and was hypnotized with their story shortly into the first paragraph.  I would read absolutely anything Georgia Cates writes.  She is a rare and phenomenal find in the world of books.
5	1395878400	LOVED this book. Could not wait to pick it up everyday. Had to puchase the next book as soon as I finished.
5	1395878400	The whole Trilogy was like a roller coaster of emotions. The way they met, was the beginning of Possibilties . Loved the series!!
5	1395878400	I can't wait to read the next book in the series! I didn't put it down from start to finish,
5	1395792000	Jack and Laurelyn's story is a sweet, unique, sexy and loving tale of two people who find love.  Definitely worth the read!  This is my first Georgia Cates book but not my last.  I'll be moving on to the next beauty book :)
5	1395792000	Absolutely loved this book!! The story seemed to capture me right from the beginning. Will definitely be reading the next in the series.
5	1395705600	I would totally recommend this book to everyone its awesome.I can't wait to start the next book to see if he comes looking for her in the states.
5	1395705600	I wasn't sure about the flipping between perspectives but Georgia Cates does it in such a way that I don't think the story would work without the switching. I can't wait to start the next one a must read for sure!
5	1395705600	I love this book. It was a fantastic read, and I can't wait to read the next one to find out where the story will go.
5	1395705600	could not but it down could not read fast enough to know what is going on with couple just loved this series.
5	1395619200	will look for more of the authors books to read. it keeps u interested and a very good story line.
4	1395619200	I figured it would be another Fifty Shades knock off so I didn't expect to enjoy it but I definitely did. Good writing and believable. I am off to buy the next book in the series.
5	1395619200	A beautiful gripping story about pain love and loss that has me begging for more and I didn't expect a cliffhanger
5	1395532800	Change of pace, kind of story line. Just wish it would have wrapped up in one book. The story was good liked the characters. Recommended.
5	1395446400	holy hotness Batman!!Laurelyn and her bff, Addison are heading on a vacation down under.  They are staying with Addison brother for 3 months.  Sounds like fun right?  Yeah!  First night there they go to a club where he sees her and has to have her.  But is Laurelyn prepared for what Lachlan is offering her?  Can she play by the rules and not get her heart broke at the same time??I really enjoyed the inner action between Laurelyn and Lachlan.  There were no games.  They both knew and understood going in.  Laurelyn might be 22 but she is wise beyond her years and funny.  I enjoyed their banter.  Lachlan is reserved he has to be.  He needs to remain anonymous.  This is much better than the 50 shades book.  Much much better!!It always amazes me that it take a man so long to figure out what he wants when it&#8217;s right there, looking him straight in the eyes.  Lachlan bent so many of his rules for her, that should have been his first clue.  But like any man, he was to damn stubborn to realize what he had until it was gone.I will be picking up book number 2.
5	1395446400	Georgiea Gatis is great at making you feel that you know the people she writes about, they are down to earth, real and exciting. The emotion is deeply moving and the love is over the hill. From start to finish you live with these people and wait for the next move. I look forward to anything this writer will put out. Thank you for time well spent enjoying this Series. I have read all three and will I know read all three books again.
5	1395446400	Really great and we'll written contemporary romance with engaging characters that held my interest enough to make me read this in one sitting. Will definitely be getting the next book in the series.
5	1395446400	In reading the summary, I assumed that Beauty from Pain would be the typical sweet and innocent girl falling for the bad and experienced guy. Although it is very much that way, I felt myself actually drawn into their lives throughout the book. The beginning was a bit slow but the pacing throughout the book was pretty even although at times the dialogue was a bit immature.I liked both main characters right away as they were written to be kind, funny, and caring people. They weren't crude or abusive and in fact Jack (the main guy) was actually a decent and great guy. At first I thought his character would be abusive given the situation but he was never written to be that way, for which I am glad. So many writers write the typical rich, uncaring Hero to be offensive or demeaning, but Jack wasn't that type. And Laurelyn was sweet and funny and had just enough gumption to deal with the playboy. It was quite comical at times to read their interactions with each other.I wouldn't recommend this for younger readers or those shy of explicit sex scenes as there were a lot of sex scenes but they weren't dirty or creepy in any way.I know the books are sequels and I do plan on picking up the second installment just to see what Jack does to find Laurelyn.Some people might compare it to Fifty Shades of Grey and although I never completed that book as I found the writing to be so immature and disengaging, Beauty from Pain has so much more depth and so much more feeling to it. Fifty Shades is just a book and before it became &#34;famous&#34;, there were many other books and movies out there with similar plotlines. It just so happens that Fifty Shades was made famous by middle-aged women who needed a good &#34;escape&#34; so to speak.If you're looking for some unusual sweet romance mixed with a bit of naughtiness, then you'll probably enjoy Beauty from Pain.
4	1395446400	Found this book on a freebie list in Facebook. And I'm really happy I took a chance on it. It was really good. I will be reading more from this author.
4	1395446400	I loved this story and I can't wait to read the next one. Jack is very charming and I loved the playfulness between him and Lauralyn.
5	1395360000	I loved every page of this book. Wasn't sure at first but the pages kept going and pulling me right along. The story is awesome, can't wait to read more.
5	1395360000	Loved it!!!! I can't wait to read the rest of the series! Hope they are already out in kindle form.
4	1395273600	What a really good romance.  I was surprised how much I liked both main characters.  They both agree to a no strings, short term relationship.  That always seems good on paper, but emotions play into everything, and the game changes.  I am anxious to see how things play out for Jack and Laurelyn.
5	1395273600	I couldn't put it down. I Absolutely.......loved the series!!  Looking forward to the next series with Georgia Cates.  It's a must read!
4	1395187200	This is a sweet story even though the premise is that Jack is not romantic or wanting a relationship.  I waited until all 3 books were out to read them so I did not have to wait with a cliffhanger.
5	1395187200	I was a little skeptical of this book, but boy did it surprise me! I immediately fell in love with the characters. It had enough romance and the characters had enough personality to really enjoy the book. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good love story along with some great romance!
5	1395187200	I really did not know what to expect, as I got this book as a freebie one day, but wow... It's really intense and keeps you wondering what will happen next.From the beginning, I thought any relationship agreement would or could end in a major heart break, but falling so deeply and being a little blind, I didn't see. Moving to book 2!!!
5	1395187200	What a wonderful book! The characters are believable and each character's manner of speaking fits their description. The plot is intriguing, and oh-so-luscious. The editor of this book is to be congratulated. I didn't find the usual &#34;bumps in the road&#34; in my reading pleasure -- the inaccurate use of tense or the inaccurate use of a homonym -- and it was always clear as to which character was speaking.I've read quite a few romance books in the past couple of years, and I must say, this one has hooked me big time. Ms. Cates crafts a tale well and presents it beautifully. I know I have more good reading ahead of me. And now, readers, it's back to Jack Henry and Laurelyn for  more deliciousness!
5	1395187200	This was a quick read and HOT!! The pole dancing was my fav part, except the music-great choices. I can't wait to hear more about Jack Henry and Lauralyn.
5	1395100800	Loved Laurelyn and Jack Henry's story.  Laurelyn is a young musician with a difficult past trying to decide which direction to go in her life.  She and her best friend decide to go to Australia and stay with her best friends brother for 3 months.  Jack Henry is a mulitmillionaire wine mogel and only has anonymous relationships.  He sees Laurelyn from across a crowded bar and he has to have her.  She puts up a small fight at first but finally agrees to his demands.  Of course during the 3 month period they fall in love with each other but before Jack Henry wakes up and realizeshe loves Laurelyn she decides to leave a day early so that she doesn't have to tell him goodbye.  Of course he dosen't know her last name and can't find her.  This is where this cliff hanger ends and believe me I will be reading the next book in the series.  Beauty from Pain is a beautifully written story and I can't wait to see what is in store for the couple in the next book.  An excellent read that you shouldn't miss.
5	1395100800	Omg this book blew me away. I've never read anything from this author before. I'm definitely hooked now. This story drew me in from the first chapter. I literally could not stop reading. Freaking Jack Henry I could just eat him up. He is so sweet, loving, romantic, hot, sexy, desirable, hot, sexy, hot, ans sexy ( oops I think I repeated those ALOT lol ). I'm dying to read the next book. This was such a great read. I cannot recommend it enough.
3	1395100800	This is a quick light read that you can pass on to friends without them questioning you as to why you like it.  The bedroom action is vanilla, the characters are young but written as older without there being much to back it up - in this book.  As this is part of a series I would hope/expect that the characters gain depth and more chemistry through the development of the story into the second book.Will I read it? Probably only as a free download.  This just was a bit tame for my tastes.p.s. non-Australian readers will likely have issues with some of the lingo used, i.e. Daks = trousers, rellies/rels/rellos = relatives, etc
5	1395100800	When he realizes he loves her, I absolutely MELT. This book was not quite what I thought it would be but it was better.  It is pretty graphically descriptive but as long as you know that going in lol.  I immediately downloaded #2 and #3 :)
3	1395014400	Not a bad story but what is happening with the vineyard sabotages and what is possessive mistress #3 doing now?  As it nears an obvious ending there is a complication, followed by continued in Book 2.
5	1394928000	I am completely in love with this book and this series - nothing has captured my attention like Georgia Cates has in this BEAUTIFUL Series - Almost done with book 2 and I don't want this series to END! Highly Highly Recommended!
5	1394928000	I love Jack and Laurelyn and I couldn't wait for their next book.  I read this last year when it came out so the wait for book two seemed forever, but I never forgot Jack and Laurelyn. Beauty from Pain end with a cliffy so be ready to start book 2 ASAP!This is book 1 of 3 books and is told by both POV's.
4	1394928000	I looked forward to my next session of reading each evening before bed. I have to find out what happens in the second book and can't wait to start it.
5	1394841600	I came across this book as a freebie that was being promoted on facebook by a blogger I follow.  WOW! I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did but I loved it.  Laurelyn goes to Australia with her best friend. Laurelyn meets a mysterious man who proposes that they have a fling for 3 months then walk away, no strings attached.  They don't tell each other their real names so there are no complications.  Only Laurelyn falls in love.  Jack doesn't realize he is in love until it's too late.I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book and I will be getting the other books in the series.
5	1394841600	this book is a lot like fifty shades of gray. if liked that series u will love this series. it has mystery, secrets, and love all shAped into a wonderful reading experience.
5	1394755200	What a awesome story. A lot more then I expected it to be. Great character depth. You felt what they were feeling. Can't wait to read the next book.
4	1394755200	I loved it (of course).The sexy billionaire meets the poor sassy girl (hallelujah she wasn't a virgin LOL!) It's like Disney for perverted grown ups and I loved every moment. It was sweet and I cried more than once (ya... I'm a sappy wuss... So what?). I'm looking forward to finishing the series.
3	1394668800	I've already read and appreciated other stories by Georgia Cates so I've decided to start the first book in the Beauty series and I like the Australian setting, a nice change of scenario.The story is easy to read and enjoyable most of the time but there are points overstressed without a valid foundations. See how Ben is unreasonably possessive, jealous and taken with Laurelyn after not even one day he met her, he acts like a betrayed boyfriend she spent years with, his behavior is over the top and comes out of nowhere; plus I don't buy Jack's motives of secrecy that lead him to have temporary affairs. I can understand he fears to have his personal affairs hit the headlines or sold to magazines for money but if he's so famous and recognizable like he thinks to be then unless he doesn't choose out of country women I don't know how it's possible to remain anonymous.Jack's mom wants to see him settled down, married and with a lot of kids, like all the moms in the world but it's not that you can accept unconditionally the first girl your son brings home, find beautiful and spend few pleasant days with.I like the little tender gestures Laurelyn and Jack share (I can't call him Jack Henry, this name doesn't have a nice ring in my opinion) when one of them hugs the other from behind, kisses the lover's cheek but I find the sex scenes are too clinical, rushed and not exciting at all. They fell in love along the way but what made them love each other apart the sex? It's true they exchange some personal informations and childhood experiences but this is not something enough to built a great love on, they just scratched the the tip of the iceberg with personal background info and you don't fall in love with a person because this shares his/her past history with you. I know this is a trilogy and not all secrets can be revealed at once but they fall in love in the first book and I'd have liked to see more depth behind the development of this love.And I get a Fifty Shades vibe and since I don't like that story in the slightest I don't like to have some things proposed here again.This said the story doesn&#8217;t come out of the ruck but it&#8217;s not bad. In the end I liked it more than how I disliked some things.
3	1394668800	I wanted more.  Another reviewer suggested fleshing out the story more and gaining an editor.  I absolutely agree. The story itself was good,  and I think Ms. Cates has the raw talent to be successful as an author.  I'll be watching for more as she refines her skills
4	1394582400	I am slow on the pick-up but I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to reading Beauty from Pain by Georgia Cates. This has been on my kindle since last year. Now, I am wondering what took me so long to read the book! The story is told in dual POV's between Jack Henry and Laurelyn. There was no instant love instead it was a slow steady build up of two flawed people getting to know each other despite the untraditional way it started. I was transported away and the world around me melted. I love when books do that especially since I had a trying and stressful day. I felt as if the events of their lives were happening right in front of me. In the beginning of the book I could feel Laurelyn&#8217;s energy and I was spellbounded as Jack Henry. Repeat after me &#8220;Private Dancer&#8221;. Yoozer, that scene was HOT! Through Laurelyn, I was swooning over Jack Henry alongside her. I recognized his feelings for her even when he was to dense to notice or acknowledge.The book was a short read and I really needed that. Was it a little predictable? Yes, but it didn't take away from my eagerness to find out what would happen next.I can&#8217;t wait to read the next book and am glad it&#8217;s already out and I don&#8217;t have to wait!
5	1394496000	First let me start by saying I have never read anything by the author and I had won copies of all three books in this series.I'm hooked.  I loved the characters, Jack and Laurelyn.  Jack, a very wealthy man who doesn't like relationships.  He enters into agreements with women for usually a two week period where they are his constant companion.  He always makes up a fake name because he doesn't want the companions to know who he is.  Laurelyn is fresh out of college traveling with her best friend, Addison to Australia to spend the summer with Addison's brother, Ben.  Laurelyn is just looking for a fun time this summer.  On her first night there she meets Jack at a karaoke bar.  He has his sights set on her, wanting to make her #13.  After meeting Laurelyn and finding out she is in Australia for the summer, Jack is thinking maybe two weeks will just not be enough time and three months is looking better and better.  All he has to do now is get Laurelyn to agree to this arrangement.Laurelyn agrees to the 3 months, no strings attached, leave when it's over agreement and also gives a fake name.  The next three months fly by with the two of them having a great time.  For once, Laurelyn can be completely open because it's only for 3 months.  Jack finds that he is actually starting to have deep feelings for her.This book ends with a cliffhanger.  At the end of the 3 months, Laurelyn leaves without telling Jack goodbye.  Turns out, Jack is devastated.
5	1394236800	I loved this series!  It was raw and emotional, and beautifully written, and you will not be able to put it down. As soon as you finish one, you'll be dying to move on to the next!
5	1394236800	I didn't expect to love it, however, I certainly did.  This book was so beautifully written, it blew my mind.  I was fascinated by the character development.  It was emotional, beautiful and just lovely.  This One's definitely a Keeper.  I highly recommend it.I am not a reviewer who tells the story to make a point.  I just wanted to applaud Georgia Cates for a job well done.  Bravo,and Cheers!
5	1394064000	I hated the title!  I LOOOOOVE the book.  Very romantic and sentimental.  I loved the progression and the characters are very likeable.  Again, .  Not what I expected at all, soo much better!Laurelyn leaves Nashville with a friend to travel for 3 months in Australia and stay with her friend&#8217;s brother in order to get her life back together, or so it seems.  There she meets a handsome stranger who offers her a magnificent 3 months long relationship of a lifetime with no strings attached, with the understanding that after the three months they will go their separate ways and this is guaranteed as they won&#8217;t even know each other&#8217;s real names.  Although Laurelyn is hesitant at the beginning he easily sways her to agree.  Of course love will show up and complicate the situation. Nothing turns out as planned.I&#8217;m reading book two and the follow up seems also very good.  I recommend it without hesitation.  Did not see it as a FSOG knockoff, just a really good romance.
4	1393977600	This was a great read but was a little predictable, that's not to say I didn't enjoy it because I did.
5	1393891200	I really enjoyed this book. I put off reading it for a while because I thought I was going to get a similar plot as FSOG and I just wasn't ready to relinquish my hold on Christian Grey. While this book has a lot of similarities, it differs in the most important ways; the connection. I really loved the female lead of this book, Laurelyn Prescott. She is smart, funny, humble, and knows how to play the game. She really works hard at keeping her heart at bay, but we all know the heart has it's own mind. When she agrees to the &#34;terms&#34; of the relationship with Jack Henry she truly feels that she can play along in pseudo relationship. But as times passes they both get more than they bargained for.Jack Henry is a sexy, swoon worthy male that has more money than he knows what to do with. And because of his worth he tends to get more notoriety than he'd like. So having a &#34;termed&#34; secretive relationship is what has worked for him. Because most women just see dollar signs when they look at him. Until Laurelyn.Moving on to Book Two
5	1393804800	You won't want to stop reading this series.  I enjoyed this authors writing style and story lines all the way through.
3	1393632000	This was just an okay book.  I enjoyed reading it but it is not on my reread or recommend to my friends list.
5	1393459200	Okay this book was the s***!!! this story line is off the chain glad I went ahead and bought all three books.On to book number 2 Georgia Cates, definitely on my top 15 author list yes ma'am.
5	1393200000	This book was great! The friends with benefits relationship between Paige and Lachlan gradually turns into the love story of laurelyn and jack
5	1393200000	I know it is not realistic, but everyone fantasizes about an anonymous relationship with a hot, wealthy man.I loved the relationship between Jack and Laurelyn.  Both trying to be anonymous but skating dangerously close to the truth.  I didn't want this one to end where it did, and I am hesitant to read the next in line because I do not want them to change.  I know I will read on and hope for the best.
5	1393113600	I can't believe I waited so long to read this book! I could kick myself! I purchased this long ago, but somehow forgot about it. I read so often...OK, too often...and I honestly thought I read this series. Nope! I was sadly mistaken. Thankfully, I was reminded of this jewel. A definite must read! I'm on to read the sequel. I'll never find sleep at this rate. :)
4	1392940800	Awesome addicting read. This is my second time reading the series and I wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait to read the last book
5	1392940800	This book was so well written, I love that each chapter was in each main characters point of view. I found I got a great understanding both sides of the story. Absolute fantastic book and would recommend it to anyone.
5	1392768000	this was a great book i could not put it down and i was so happy that i waited till the second book came out so i did not have to wait to see what was going to happen.
5	1392768000	I loved the story line and the level of detail the author described was right on point. the pace of the story was perfect
5	1392595200	This is a cliffhanger however the entire series is already written so it is a wonderful series to begin and read to the end.  You will not be disappointed with any of it.  This pair is so sweet and perfect together.
5	1392595200	The build up of this love story was great! Didn't expect the ending quite the way it was. Glad book two is already published.
5	1392249600	So glad I was fortunate enough to be gifted this book.  Loved the directness of the story and can't wait to get my hands on the next one!!!
5	1392249600	First thing I have to say is to the people who wrote the negative reviews. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW A GOOD READ, IF IT HIT YOU IN THE FACE!! Sorry, had to be said. Well written, great character's and a awesome story. Not giving anything away on this book, not even names. It is truly that good. Happy reading to the people who enjoy a good read. Almost forgot, well done Ms. Cates!
3	1392163200	The title and cover of this book are extremely misleading.  I thought it was going to be  somewhat dark and angsty, but what I really got was a cutesy version of Fifty Shades of Grey (sans the spanking.) Although the writing was much better than FSOG, I just can't get on board with an author blatantly copying someone else's story.  There is absolutely nothing original about these characters and the plot was extremely predictable. It was good enough to keep me interested until the end, but I wouldn't say there is anything about this book that makes it special or unique.  The character of Jack made no sense....he is a nice guy from a good family and as far as we know, he suffered no major trauma to make him damaged, so why would a guy in his 20's have no friends, spend all of his time alone, and proposition women to be "companions" for only a month??  Also the character of Lauralyn  was all over the place....one minute she was strong and confident, the next she was a doormat, and her overly dramatic past felt very forced.  Overall this was just an okay book for me....not bad, not great, just okay. A solid 3 stars.
4	1392076800	What a wonderful writing style. Loved the character. I loved the fact that this series did crush me but was just amazing!! Must Read!!
3	1391990400	I don't know how I stumbled onto this is series.  This book is okay.  The author would like you to think the man is a dominate who is kinky, but he is actually very sweet.  Nothing wrong with this ;but if you are looking for a dominate male, this is not the book for you.
4	1391904000	When I first started the book, I thought I would be startled but it quickly turned into an amazing ride. I don't know how to explain it but you get completely caught up and turning pages. I could not wait to find out what was coming next. You want to fight for this couple. The characters are a,axing, creative and fun. You get completely invested in them. You will not regret this series, trust me.
2	1391817600	You guys, Jack is a sexist egotist. He's not some self-assured, sexy alpha man. He's a guy who feels completely okay with running roughshod over Laurelynn and expecting her to make all of the sacrifices in their relationship. He lies when he finds it convenient, yet wants to be in every part of her life. I nearly gave up on this book halfway through, but then I convinced myself that he wasn't as bad as I'd thought. Halfway through the second book, I had to be honest with myself: Jack is awful. To be fair, most of the people in Laurelynn's life are. I think she needs to cut ties with everybody she knows and try to find people who will respect her, instead of claiming to love her and then negating everything she says or wants.Maybe it gets better. Maybe Jack pulls his head out of his butt, but I'm done. I couldn't make it past yet another person in Laurelynn's life thinking that they knew better than her and telling her that what she wants doesn't matter as much as what others want for and from her.
4	1391817600	Really enjoyed this one. Had a bit of a slow start, but really enjoyed it once I got into it.
5	1391817600	They are amazing and I loved their relationship. It was so hot I had to stop reading a few times to catch my breath
3	1391644800	2,5 starsIt's a common romance story, with some minor original aspect and something that, for me, didn't sound right in the characters' relationship agreement (He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached.He arranges relationships like business deals and they're always the same. No long term relationships). He went from a maximum of four weeks relationships to a full three month...and he didn't expect to create a bond with the girl he will chose...but nearly immediately the reader will find the situation is not at all as he (or better the author) described it.If you want something fairly well written but very similar to many other stories, well this can do for you.
5	1391644800	Five Stars ! I truly loved this story!Jack Henry is a no strings attached , play by my rules kind of man. He enjoys female companionship but on his terms. He likes to get to know their bodies on a personal level but does not want any other connection to make things permanent or long term. He has not any difficulty finding willing participants who will go along with his plan of gifts, dining, fabulous sex and being taken care of by this handsome man.Laurelyn is in Australia visiting with friends. She is a beautiful, talented young woman who needs a break from many things in her life in the U.S. She goes out to a club with friends and that's when everything changes. Jack is sitting in the club and has now set his sights on her as she gets up to sing.The proposition from the handsome, wealthy man is no real names and no commitment. It is all to end at three months or if agreed upon before that. A beautiful, young talented woman who is looking for a change and some excitement. It appears to be the perfect arrangement until too many feelings become involved. Things become complicated and Laurelyn takes matters into her own hands, unfortunately Jack never found out her real name! This puts quite a twist in the game for him and now the rules are changing. It is a great story and I couldn't wait to read the second book! Be warned it is a cliffhanger!~~Michele McMullen~~
5	1391472000	love this story.a man who will never let anyone close enough to destroy him. a girl on a trip with her friend trying to get over a married man who lied to her. 3 month agreement to be lovers and then NEVER see each other again. things are great until there not. what do you do when love comes into play?
5	1391472000	Omg why have I not read this book before now? Oh I know because there's something wrong with me!!!!! Ugh it's been sitting on my kindle an  little did I know I had an amazing treasure from Georgia. So THANK GOD I have part two on my kindle and I don't have to wait or I'd be going on Misery on Georgia's was LOL AMAZEBALLS Book. And from just book one I can see it make my top list of trilogys :-) &lt;3
4	1391385600	Great story, loved the relationship between Jack and Laurelyn, while the premise of how they began their relationship seems a little far fetched, the writer made it work. Good balance of romance, hot sex scenes and humor. Heroine had issues but wasn't a wimp either, she held her own against Jack and she was decisive and strong. Can't wait to read the next installment, although I wish writers would stop with the trilogies; just write one book and charge more money for it, I don't mind paying more for a good book!
5	1391299200	Very sexy love story. Well written with a good deal of humor mixed in. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Will be ordering  the sequel.
5	1391299200	I absolutely recommend this book it was amazing!!!!  That's saying a a lot consider the hundreds of books I've read. You will fall in love with the characters...not at first. But as they do u will as well. Uhgghhhh. I won't give any details I hate reading spoilers.  Just wish I didn't have to wait so long.I love that she intertwined so much music into this. I caught myself going to iTunes to check the songs out lol. Gives you more of a sense of what they are felling not just with her words.An amazing author I'm definitely going to be looking for anything else she has out.  Thank you Georgia Cates
5	1391126400	This series is one of my favorite books on my Kindle.  I can not tell you how many times I have re-read this book.  I think that the characters are well developed and I love books that develop characters that you could really picture in real life.
2	1391126400	why I didn't care for the book, there was not enough story line.  To much bedroom/any room to keep the story going.
5	1390953600	A smoking hot read! Beauty from pain is sexy, edgy and romantic. Loved it. This book will keep you wanting more. Looking forward to reading book 2.
5	1390867200	i absolutely love the book it shows  the game and passion how someone can change  it was a great book
4	1390867200	This was a great read and I couldn't put it down. I read it in a day and then promptly purchased the second book in the series. The book leaves of with you wanting/needing to see where the relationship is going or does it end after the three months together.
3	1390867200	If your looking for a good, affordable read to pass the time, this is it. Plot was a bit predictable but over storyline was intriguring.
4	1390694400	I had never heard of Georgia Cates before reading a book by Julia Kent in which the main character gets lost in her electronic books reading novels by a bunch of authors I read and then in the list of those names I found Georgia Cates.That's how I started the Beauty series and I'm glad I did it when the three first one were out otherwise I would have been very frustrated.So just a note of warning; be aware that it's addictive after book 1 you'll want book 2 and so on.
5	1390435200	OH MY!  I love this book and am so excited its a series.  The characters are just perfect!  I could not put this book down and read it in 1 day.....Jack and Laurelyn are easy to fall in love with and easy to hate too.  If you want to read something that is a little erotic, but yet does have some romance, this is a good choice.  I hate to compare it to Fifty Shades or Bared, but they do have some similarities with the characters, but you will fall in love with this series.
5	1390435200	Having read FSOG,Crossfire Series,In Flight/Up In the Air Series,Locked/The Alpha Group Series, Release Me/Stark Series,Fixed Series and others I can say I truly liked this book.No BSDM, but just enough Alpha with developed layers for ever character to keep you wanting more.
5	1390262400	I really loved this book. I love Paige/Laurelyn's laid back attitude and Jack is great. Wish we had more insight into why Jack is like he is, but book 2 answers it. Highly recommend.
5	1390176000	I've seen this book for quite sometime but would not start the trilogy until they were all out (or almost).  Im so glad Ive gotten to finally start this series.  Ive completed Beaty From Pain and totally in love with this story.  Extremely well written, fast paced, captivating story and I love the characters.  Can't wait to finish it.
5	1390176000	OMG. This book was amazing. I can't wait to read the next.The story is so well written. Yes, this story has been done before, but this author really has awesome characters. You love both Laurelyn and Jack. There is humor, sexiness, drama. OMG. She really took her time and built the story up. She used punctuation, too and even spelled correctly (I see so many errors in other books). I got this book from a reading list, Top 50, and this book was 50. No way. This book should have been in the top 5! I will recommend this book to ever single reader I know!!!!!
5	1390089600	Loved the characters and locations. Totally hot. Read both books the best HEA. I want to read more of her writings.
4	1390003200	I like these two characters. They are original and their dialogue is witty and contemporary. They're an unlikely couple, but it's interesting to watch their growth -- especially John Henry's. Lots and lots of sex scenes, but they're well done and move the story along.
5	1390003200	Wow, this book was awesome! I love a book that starts with a man or woman with commitment issues and turns into something more with different emotions. Then you have the duh moves on both people's parts and it turns into something more. And of course you have the crazy ex that you just want to punch! On to the next book to see what happens!! Great romantic read.
5	1389830400	I won this book back in September/October and I just now got around to reading it. I cannot express how glad that I did! :-) It was unclear to me at first where the story was headed. I was intrigued by the proposition from Lachlan to Laurelyn and had to keep reading to find out more. It certainly kept me interested from beginning to end. The rules that Lachlan has lived by previously slowly go out the window as the "arrangement" changes. I can definitely understand both side of the story. I cannot wait to see what happens next. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone I know!
5	1389571200	Kept me interested and can not wait yo read next book by this amazing author wish I could have read this on my nook but worked on my iPhone too
4	1389571200	About my reviews:I am by no means a book scholar; I read for entertainment purposes only.  I couldn't care less about grammar and spelling as long as I can follow the story (I&#8217;m still a novice when it comes to the English language and I am 30+ years old and English is my first and only language&#8230;I&#8217;m a 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s kinda girl). With that being said, I do appreciate those who have the gift of bringing good characters and stories to life via written words evoking all my &#8220;girlie&#8221; emotions.  For the most part I&#8217;m a sucker for likable characters, good chemistry, angst, heartbreak, and happy endings. I judge books by how I feel while reading them and I am always looking for my next &#8220;5 star book&#8221; high!I wanted to share my opinions on the books I&#8217;ve read recently because Amazon ratings can be misleading at times; however, I don&#8217;t want to spend too much time on reviewing a book when I could be reading the next &#8220;5 star book&#8221; (hence this template).  You will not get any spoiler alerts or harsh critiques from my reviews&#8230;nope, you will simply get a star rating based on the following:5 stars &#8211; I could read this book over and over again&#8230;everyone should read this book!!!4 stars &#8211; I could read this book more than once!3 stars &#8211; Okay book&#8230;one read was enough2 stars &#8211; I just about got through this book1 star &#8211; I could not finish this bookHopefully this will help you identify some good reads and avoid some not-so-good ones!
5	1389571200	I'decided that i wouldn't purchase another series, becasue it usually take so long for the next book, or the author promises one release date and it never happens. I'm surprised that a purchase this series, but am glad that I did because I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it in one day because it was just that good. I can't wait to read book 2 which I've already purchased. This book is worth the purchase!
5	1389484800	This is the first book I've read by Georgia Cates but I'm an avid fan now!  My first thought this was just going to be another erotic story and believe me the sex is good.  However, there is a good storyline beyond the sexual.  Enjoy as you too get hooked.  I'm so glad there is a second one in the series that I just had to have already!
5	1389484800	really enjoyed reading this book. I loved everything about it from the game of strangers they played to slowly learning more about each other then married couples do. I loved the fact that a friend can understand and be supportive and not judge when I think most would have. I'm trying not to give anything away beside if you want a different type of Romance this is it.
4	1389312000	While I did enjoy reading this book. A couple of things bothered me. One was the cliff hanger. I don't care for that. The other was the fact that this book was so close to the movie Pretty Woman. That movie is my all time favorite. I know it when I see it. He wanted her to spend time with him while he was going to be in town. She was given money to go shopping for clothes because he wanted her to dress nice for him. They were also going to go to the opera and right before they left he gave her jewerly. I knocked off a star because of these things.
4	1389312000	It was riveting. I enjoyed it very much. Can't wait to read the next book in the series. It was entertaining.
5	1389312000	This book has hundreds of reviews, so I'll keep it brief:  I looked at the plot summary and didn't think I would like it honestly.  It didn't sound all that interesting so I passed it up, again and again, when recommended.  Finally, I broke down and got it.  I'm so glad I did!  The plot is a tad different but not much, just a variation on the usual manwhore theme new adult has got going on really.  But the writing was wonderful, and the characters were true and honest.  Loved every word of this one.
5	1389225600	This is officially the first book I have ever read in a single day.  I could not put this down, and the second I was finished I purchased the second in the series.  It was similar to 50 Shades but still different enough that I didnt feel like I was reading the same story.  I loved the leads in this book and look forward to the rest of their story.
5	1389225600	I knew from reading the reviews there was going to be a #2 book but fortunate for me, #2 was already out.  So I dove into &#34;Pain&#34; and now I can't buy the sequel fast enough.  If Beauty from Surrender is just as good as Beauty from Pain, Ms. Cates will have a lifetime fan.  She made me adore both these characters and can't get enough of them.  Back to reading.  I'll let you know how it goes.
4	1389139200	I thought this was a good book. Really hot! The ending is was a surprise which was good. However, at times it was a little redundant and kid of slow but the other parts defiantly make up for it :)
4	1389139200	Adult love story that starts with a twist but becomes predictable towards the middle.  Still it is a good read and I look forward to book two of the beauty series.
5	1389139200	I LOVED this book!  It has almost all the things that make me love a book.  The sweet, protective, wealthy male who pursues the younger, less experienced girl.  He promises to make her fantasies and wishes come true, and that is exactly what he does.My only negative comment about this book, I think it could have easily been a stand alone.  Instead, there is a sequel and this book ends with a cliffhanger, which I do not like.  That is the only negative comment I can make, and surely does not lesson my 5-Star rating.  Can't wait to read more by Georgia Cates.
5	1389139200	OH MY GOSH!!! I absolutely adored this book series so much. It is a new age romance without the bdsm. I thought it was to die for. I have now reread this series numerous times and can't wait for the end of January to read the third installment. What a lovely read. I love Emily and Jack... they are a darling couple. I love that the story takes place in Australia. I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this novel!!! I would recommend it to anyone!
4	1389052800	I enjoyed this book very much. I felt the connection they have and their reservations about attachments. The author did a great job conveying that. I look forward to the next book
5	1389052800	Great start to a series. Really good story behind all of the good stuff. I highly recommend this book to all.
5	1388966400	Couldn't put it down, and left me wanting more! Excellent story line with the perfect amount of naughtiness. Can't wait to read book two.
5	1388966400	This was an awesome story. It was unique and the couple's were relatable. I look forward to the next book.
5	1388880000	I just finished this book and now I am in love with the vineyards and a certain JACK HENRY. I absolutely loved this book. it was well written and well executed. and now I am primed and ready to read the next one. it was an amazing book words cant even explain how much I loved this book...
5	1388880000	I have had this book in my kindle wish list for months and I am so glad that I finally bought it and read it because it is one of the best romance books I have read from beginning to end in a really long time.
5	1388880000	I keep hoping that this author will write some more books like this one and its follow-up. Compelling characters and a good back story made this a definite page turner!  I highly recommend it!
5	1388880000	Wonderful read!!  I couldn't put the book down.  I'm looking forward to the continuation of this love story between these two characters.
5	1388880000	I loved this book.  It was romantic, steamy and sexy.  I fell in love with both of the character and can't wait to read book #2 & #3 in this series.  I really enjoyed the story and was pulling for the the couple.  I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did.  Have fun!!
5	1388880000	The Beauty from Pain Series is by far one of my favorites!!! It ranks up there with 50 Shades, Crossfire Series, This Man & Up in the Air.  If you are a fan of any of those books, then Beauty from Pain is a must read for you!  Happy Reading!
5	1388880000	I fully enjoyed  reading this book and the plot was full on reached within the beginning of this book. However, like some of the reviewers, I dislike trilogies,because of the length of the wait.Before I bought this book, I made sure that this was a stand alone book and since I didn't see a description that this was book #1; I bought it.
5	1388793600	Ms. Cates had me in the first chapter.  This is a great love story.  I felt all of the feelings of the characters. Highly recommend for those into love stories.
5	1388793600	I can honestly say this is the best book I have read in years!  And I read a LOT!  The setup, the characters, the way it was written... Everything!  I started it about 8 hours ago and didn't put it down.  I am going to go online right now and buy book two.  I may not sleep all night!
3	1388448000	I downloaded this series after reading a raving review from a blogger. I read them both in one weekend. The captivated me while reading them, good story, a bit  familiar though for an avid reader like me....
5	1387929600	Loved it. Read #2 in Beauty series as fast as this one. Their relationship was a bit odd at first, but keeps you reading.
4	1387670400	Laurelyn is vacationing with her best friend Addison in Australia.  The ultimate get away and escape from a break-up of a bad relationship.Beauty from Pain will keep you wondering throughout the book when the shoe will drop.Laurelyn is not looking for a relationship, so when she &#8220;bumps&#8221; into sexy Jack and he pursues her with a certain type of uncomplicated relationship for the duration of her stay, she throws caution out the window and decides to get it on.  Their strange affair starts and not only is Jack super sexy with an Aussie accent to boot, he is a secret multi-millionaire.We don&#8217;t gather too much of Jack&#8217;s history and this affair starts out feeling like a dirty little secret, but Jack starts to get to know Laurelyn and she is not your typical man-hunter.I liked that Laurelyn is complex, talented and kind of goes with the flow.  She&#8217;s pretty steadfast to avoid getting walked all over.  I also liked that Jack&#8217;s character evolved and was open to more despite himself.Georgia Cates tells an interesting, complex story with a slowly paced development.  The story is not rushed but has many things transpiring altogether.  The pace was quick, and whoa there was the mother of cliff hangers.  So, if you&#8217;re not a fan of the cliff hanger, get ready to snatch up book 2 right away.  I personally like the angst of a cliffhanger and love to have the story drawn out so long as I don&#8217;t feel like I want to hurry it along.This was a great first story for me to delve into the writing of Georgia Cates and I truly enjoyed it.  I would have liked more angst and heartache (I do like to feel completely drained by a good story), but Beauty From Pain was equally fulfilling and left me wanting more.  Now where can I sign up for my pole dancing lessons?!?!?!  Give this a try!!  4.0 Stars
5	1387238400	RUN, don't walk to get this series!  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVED it!  You become so invested in the characters.  It is well written and you can get lost in the story line.  I cannot wait for book 3 to come out (January 2014!)  I will read the first 2 books again before I read #3, that's how much I liked them!
4	1386633600	This book's hero and heroine were people I wanted to know. I felt their emotions and story. I couldn't wait to buy book 2.
5	1386547200	Crazy good...I really loved this read. I can't wait to download the next one. It just ended so quick. I was like what just happened and nooooo....
5	1386115200	I fell in love with laurelyn and jack right away.  I literally could not put this book down. I can't wait to read the Next book. 5 stars.
3	1386028800	This is a unique twist on the usual story line. I expected this book to be about BDSM, but was delighted to be wrong. The &#34;pain&#34; referred to in the title is emotional- not whips and whatnot.I truly enjoyed this series. There where numerous elements that I loved. I loved Jack Henry. I loved his family. I loved how he loved her. I love the down under setting and the steamy scenes were hot.I thought Ben was an odd and forced element in the story. How many times does one person get sexually assaulted in their lives?  Every villain she met tries to attack her even though they are friends or co-workers. That to me seemed a little off putting. All in all I think I'm having a difficult time summing up the pros and cons of this series, but I can say that ultimately I truly enjoyed it.Would I recommend?  Yes, but be prepared to buy two books.Was it worth $3.99?  Begrudgingly yes...Was it worth my time?  Absolutely.
1	1385510400	I don't usually write reviews for books, but this book was so exceptionally, unexpectedly bad, that I felt compelled to let others know about my take.I got the book when looking for an erotic romance novel. With such high ratings, I expected a catchy plot and a good romance. Instead, I was delivered neither. The writing is very simple. Short sentences and no big words. That is fine with me. But I do have a problem with the following aspects of the book:1. The characters are completely unrealistic, as is the entire story. If you enjoy reading about a guy that is young, handsome, super rich, super romantic, super famous AND super nice, then this may be the book for you. I can't stand reading about characters like that - just perfect individuals with no faults. At least Christian Grey has some weird kinks in bed.2. The whole book is extremely predictable, and a similar plot must have been written hundreds, if not thousands of times. It's the typical SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS "I'm not going to fall in love with you. But ah you are different from the others and now I'm in love with you."3. The plot is full of holes. He's trying to protect his identity, yet he gives her a fake name that's strikingly similar to his real name. He has no problems with her taking pictures of him, or appearing in public with her, despite the fact he's hounded by paparazzis. What?4. The book doesn't even end. I knew there's a sequel, but I still expected some kind of closure. Instead, it kind of just abruptly tells you to read the next book.I really wish I could get my time back.
5	1385337600	I bought this book by recommendation and it looked good, plus i dream of going to Australia!!When Addison and Laurelyn go to sydney to visit her brother Ben, they weren't expecting to fall for aussie men.I love how intense Jack is and how Laurelyn throws him for a loop!:aurelyn finally agrees on 3 months while she's in sydney. I couldn't read the book fast enough to see where it took them.Such a HOT read and couldn't put it down!Defintely one of my series that i always recommend!
5	1385251200	Jack McLachlan is a playboy who does not want a a committed relationship = then comes Laurelyn Prescott into his life and he thinks he has the perfect system to have some no strings fun for her few month stay in Australia.  Without knowing each others real names, they form a bond that turns into love and also turns the tables on the playboy!  So loved this book and you get to read Beauty from Surrender right away!  We had to wait!  Enjoy!
5	1385164800	Loved this book, characters and plot were kind of awesome. Loved the premise of the book...vacation...meet a man....spend the vacation not connecting but connecting...loved Jack & loved Laurelyn and loved the relationship & how it grew or didn't. The end of the book kind of killed me. I wanted him to realize and I wanted her to be honest. I had to dig into book 2 immediately and I was not disappointed. I loved the way the author was able to keep the names hidden but yet they would sneak out a bit.His family was so cool and her family sucked. REALLY SUCKED
5	1384732800	SIMPLE GREAT & AN AWESOME READ. Whatever you do.....go BUY this book and READ IT NOW. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this author &#9829;
5	1384732800	This was a great read!  One that you will enjoy and even though it has the usual storyline...rich man gets regular girl it is still fun to read and the storyline actually starts to suck you in and you see that there is more to this story than you thought!
5	1384732800	I loved this book. I loved the characters and the story. I loved wagga wagga. I loved the arrangement lauralyn and Jack had. It wasn't kinky or dirty. He just gets lonely on the road so he finds a women to date with all the benefits. He got way more than he bargained for with lauralyn. She is visiting Australia from America, taking a hiatus from her music career and a failed relationship.  Jack offers her 3 months of happiness in exchange for 3 months of dating. She agrees to the pretend dating. The story just takes off from there. I laughed, cried, swooned, and held my breath. What a good book. I am just really thankful I have the next book. The ending of this one is a killer.
5	1384473600	Wow! This is one of those books that make you stay up all night because you don't want to quit. Jack Henry was amazing, yet reserved. I understand his thinking even though it cost him in the end. Looking forward to book 2!
5	1384300800	This book is one that you can't put down once you start reading!!  From the first chapter I couldn't wait til I could get back to reading it!
5	1383696000	I absolutely loved this book and I was hoping it would never end. I am really happy there is a sequel and look forward to it coming as soon as possible. There were many moments in the book that were &#34;sigh&#34; worthy and I was wishing Jack would just wake up to himself and his feelings and realise that Laurelyn was the only one for him. I loved the writing style from Georgia Cates and will definately be looking at her other works. Very enjoyable read, thanks.
5	1383523200	I felt a real connection to these characters. I know that I love a book that I am reading when all I do is think about the book when I am unable to read it (like at work). This was that book.i am ordering the next one in the series right now!
3	1382918400	Not bad.  Another 50 shades like premise.  Rich guy doesn't want relationship and girl does.  Lines are crossed and she isn't like the others blah blah blah.  I read the second one to see what happened.
5	1382918400	Any news on book three ???? Been waiting forever for the rest of the series ... Ahhh someone tell me there is more to this love story ... Just has to be ... Seems like I've read this so long ago and the third book isn't out yet !!
5	1382140800	Wow!! I simply loved everything about this book. The story, the writing style, the characters. EVERYTHING!!! Georgie Cates, I am hooked!!
3	1382054400	Georgia Cates fist installment on the beauty series. This book started interesting, then it felt like a 50 shades d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Regardless, I continued. I tried to put the smililarities aside, and read it for what it was. I actually enjoyed it. I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars, because I felt 'cheated' of an ending. Not only did it end at 86% (seriously?!), it ended on a cliffhanger. Not. Cool. Book 2 is out, but I'm still on the fence about tackling it. Do I care enough about these characters and their story to continue? Meh. Idk. Time will tell.
4	1381881600	Yes we have read a few of these kind well a lot lately. This first book in this series surprised me. I read it all!
5	1381622400	I really enjoyed reading this romance. I found the plot refreshingly different. I'm looking forward to the next installment. I can definitely recommend this one for people who love romances and are looking for something not so run of the mill.
5	1381104000	Yes, I'm in love with this book. And I'm desperate for more. Georgia, I don't say this often. Bravo. Bravo.
5	1381104000	This was one of those books that I kept putting off and then finally read. The synopsis didn't really stick out to me but I heard good things about it so I eventually made my way to it. LOVED. IT. Seriously, I don't know what it was but I loved the characters, the plot, the back stories, the idea of a casual summer encounter with no strings attached and of course, who doesn't love a man with an Australian accent! I absolutely adored this book and the sequel and will be on list of books that I recommend for a long time coming!
5	1380844800	So, I finished this book when I was working away and therefore, went straight onto book two. So I'm writing this review whilst I am halfway through the second book, which is something I try to avoid doing.Firstly, I'm really really loving this series. When I first started 'Beauty from Pain' I wasn't sure it was going to be for me. But then, I've been through a real run of books that haven't floated my boat, so I was beginning to wonder if I was needing some time away from my beloved Kindle.However, 'Beauty from Pain' pulled me out of my slump!'The pain is conceived out of beauty - my love for Jack Henry McLachlan. I embrace it. I clutch it as tightly as I can with both fists because I never want to forget the love I have for him. Loving him will forever be my Beauty from Pain.'Knowing I had to get up for work at 4am, I couldn't force myself to put Jack Henry and Laurelyn down until I'd finished the book at 2am! Cue a very sleepy, very clumsy, very grouchy Smitten. Oops!I loved the will they/won't they throughout this book... will they reveal their real identity, will they admit to falling in love, will he ask her to stay... Aaargh! Scrummy!"You don't always know the true worth of a woman's love until it becomes a memory."Jack Henry, and the sex scenes, are haaawt! We all love a sexy multi-millionaire... and now we have a sexy secret multi-millionaire, with a filthy mouth and an Australian accent!"Right now, all I'm thinking about is how I'm going to get you in my bed so I can show you all the ways I can make you come."Laurelyn takes a trip to Australia, with best friend Addison, for the Christmas holidays, to escape a previous relationship-gone-bad. Despite wanting nothing less than to meet a man, she can't help the lure she feels when she bumps into charming, handsome, Aussie `suit', Jack Henry McLachlan.But Jack needs a certain type of relationship. One where identity is kept secret, real names are withheld and contact is forbidden once their three months is up. Of course, Laurelyn agrees and their strange affair begins."Listen to me, Laurelyn. The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else."Laurelyn is a great female lead. She has a playful, real character and isn't afraid to speak her mind. I can't stand miscommunications in books, and I was pleased that these characters seemed able to talk things through, despite the need for secrecy in their relationship."How can you think it's possible to have something this hot without one of us getting burned?"This book does end in a cliffhanger. I'm really glad that I waited until Beauty from Surrender' was released, to read these books as I know this cliffhanger would have irritated me if I hadn't. But now that both books are available, I'd definitely recommend this series, so far!Beauty from Pain StatisticsSteam Rating (out of 5): &#9829;&#9829;&#9829;&#9829;&#9829;Ending: CliffhangerSeries: &#10003;Reading Order:Book #1 - Beauty from PainBook #2 - Beauty from SurrenderCan this be read as a standalone?

5	1380499200	These two books from the Beauty series are excellent. Read them and tell you friends about them. Id like to see a movie made of this series. This author is so good, please keep up the great work . I will buy your future books.
5	1380412800	I would recommend this series to anyone!!!!  The story line is awesome.  It keeps moving and doesn't linger in any area.I have read a lot of books and this by far is one of my top reads for the year.  I will be recommending it to several friends and customers!!!I just want to end this review with a Thank you to Georgia for some awesome good reads, and all the time you have put into them. I hope to see more!!
4	1380326400	I waited to read these till the second came out and I'm really glad I did. Didn't fall in love with the characters but there are so many great one liners. Such as the best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else. Or even if minor, all diamonds have imperfections or even music is what feelings sound like out loud. I look forward to reading the next one and seeing how the characters grow.
5	1380067200	I don't  write reviews but here goes.  I just read some reviews for BfP most are very good reviews and a few are so so. I didn't get the average reviews, I personally was entertained, couldn't put the book down and thought the story was very unique. One person with a negative review compares BfP to fifty shades, WOW, was I reading another book? It is nothing like FSOG, zero. Some ladies complained about spelling or grammar mistakes, well I rarely read a book with no mistakes, and by the way, many mistakes in FSOG and it's not very well written but sold 75Mil copies, I don't read a book to count how many mistakes  I read for entertainment, and this book was fun, entertaining and kept my interest enough to keep me awake all night to finish it by morning.  Some people thought John Henry came across older than his age of 28, well I wonder if that person have met a 28 year old millionaire or billionaire. Those people that reach that level of success are smarter, more intelligent, more mature worldly men, they're not the guy next door mowing his lawn.  AND that letter Laurelyn wrote when she left, that was heart wrenching and beautiful.  Congratulations to Ms Georgia Cates, my friends and I think this book will make a great movie.  Can't wait for book 3 in the series.
3	1379808000	This book was just okay.  A story about a narcissist who uses women purely for short termcompanionship, mainly sex, and then dumps them.  Although the women know in advanceof his terms they go along with his game.  This time its different as he falls in love with thisgirl and she feels the same, however, neither of them know of the other's true feelings.  Now itstime for her to return to her homeland . . .
4	1379635200	I enjoyed this book. I liked the main characters, it was a fun read and liked the story. However, i still needed a little bit more essence but the good ended with a cliffhanger and it kind of fixed my problems. Thinking about reading next book.
5	1379548800	I loved it.. such a good story read both books in 2days. Can't wait for another.. so please hurry and write it.. lol
4	1379548800	this was better than the second one....it was a good story...and entertaining.  I do recommend this book.  ends in a bad place but at least the second book is available
5	1379289600	I enjoyed this book.  It sucks you in and you really care about the characters.  The premise is different and fun.  I will definitely read the second book.  I want to know what happens when Jack Henry gets to the states and finds Laurelyn.
4	1379289600	Couldnt put it down! Loved it! It was a page turner.  Very good story! Cant wait for another one to read!
5	1379203200	Oh man I liked this books. Great couple Jack and Laurelyn. This was a nice fun read. Definitely enjoyed reading this book. It was very good. I loved their chemistry. It had a nice progression and build with them as a couple. You see them go from lust to slowly fall in love. I was glad I found this book and took a chance. It definitely was a little sad since it didn't end HEA and there is a cliffhanger. But it was a nice read and it's definitely going in my keeper pile.
4	1379203200	The characters are what interested me in the book.  I liked their quirky personalities.  The story line does remind me somewhat of "Filthy Shades of Grey"!.  I am now wondering what book came out first.  I have now downloaded the 2nd book and I am hoping that they will grow the characters and the story line and not just focus on just the sex!
3	1378944000	This book had some great elements and I liked some of it but I didn't like the cliff hanger ending and I didn't like how the main character felt like an immature brat to me. I feel like I have read the same type of book over and over again, maybe I should switch genres?
4	1378857600	I so enjoyed reading this book, it was refreshing that there wasn't any dominance in it, so many of the books these days are all about dominance. This was just good old fashioned romance. I loved reading about Australia as I'm an aussie. I can't wait to read the second book.
4	1378771200	This book started a little slow at the beginning. About 25% in it started getting good to the point of me finishing this book in one night just so I can start the next book. Laurelyn left the US to forget about a man that broke her heart and maybe her career in Country singing. She goes to Australia with her bestfriend for 3 months of relaxing. She meets Jack Henry the Australia's most eligible bachelors and multimillionaire but doesn't know it. He proposes a 3 month no strings attach affair until she leaves to go back to the states. His game, his rules by having fake names and no contact after the affair is over. Little did he know that they would fall in love during those 3 months. It really was a pretty good book and it ended were you had to read the 2nd book to find out what happens next.
5	1378598400	This is a good book. I enjoyed this book and I will read more from this author. Good job,Love it.
3	1378252800	One more book trying to take advantage of the momentum created by 50 shades.The title says everything you need to know.
5	1377907200	Even though I new they would fall in love it was a great story leading up to it. Jack Henry was a great leading man and Laurelyn compliments him well. Can't wait to read the continuation of their love story.
4	1377820800	Great love story....I this was straightforward and the story line was great. I can't wait for book two. I wonder what Audrey is up to.
5	1377820800	this was just like the furst one it was a great romance and story and great people to read about
1	1377734400	The creepy main character who refuses to share true names doesn't even act like an adult.  His words are more like a high schooler.  There is nothing sexually appealing about him at all.  He may have money, but his actions show that he has no power at all. I can't imagine anyone listening to him, especially in bed.  Not sexy at all....
5	1377561600	i &#60;3 these books.... quick read but so much fun to escape reality and have an amazing evening respite!  don't hesitate!  read it!
5	1377475200	So Georgia Cates is one of my favorite authors, and I had the pleasure of meeting her a few months ago at a book signing. I have this book in digital format, but I had to buy it in print because I wanted her to sign my copy. Well all I can say is that this is a must read book. The story of Laurelyn and Jack Henry is sexy, provocative, and beautiful. Then their story continues in Beauty from Surrender, which is equally awesome! Get to reading!
5	1377388800	This book was so well written. The story was not only well spaced out in the time line and not drawn out. Can't wait to read part 2. It was a hard book to put down.
5	1377388800	This book had me on the edge of my seat I really enjoyed the romance aspect this was a great book after 50 shades another great romance with out the kinky stuff, but still a twisted man that needs to find true love.
1	1377388800	It was disgusting, immoral pornography.  It could have been such a good story but they didn't develop the story - just took the easy way out and went for cheap sex.
3	1377129600	I felt this was just a copy cat of Three Shades of Grey.  I was hoping for something different, but it wasn't bad.
4	1376956800	This was an expected find. Jack Henry was is sexy and wicked and Laurie is funny and holds her own against Jack. Looking for a lot more interaction with the crazy ex-companions of Jack but the dialogue between both of the leading characters is very strong. It is a good read.
5	1376956800	Great book I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book to all 50 Shades fans. You won't be sorry
5	1376956800	awesome, enjoyed it very very much. I could not put it down. I wanted it to keep going and going.
5	1376784000	Great read. I would recommend to anyone. Good combination of romance and hot sex scenes. Very well written and great dialogue.
5	1376697600	Best story I have read in a long time! I can't wait to start the next book and find out what happens between Jack and Laurelyn.
5	1376524800	After reading 50 SOG, this was a good transition into a similar storyline, but had better writing. I really enjoyed the way the author did both the male and female perspective and without the repetitive feelings portrayed over and over again (ie 50 SOG). This was only my second time reading a romance/erotic novel, so I liked that it still had a story line with sex scenes sprinkled in. Loved it enough to read Beauty from Surrender.
5	1376438400	I loved this book. It was a great read. I have such high hopes for Jack and Laurelyn. I like how you really got to see their relationship progress. I think the ex is going to come back in some form, we'll see.
5	1376352000	I'm actually leaving tomorrow to visit someone I share a very similar story to this one with. Totally related to the emotion in this book and the situation. I write music and sing as well and have gotten some pretty good stuff since starting this journey. I'm so thankful to have had this to keep me sane and am starting book two now!!!!
2	1376352000	I read this book a few months ago but forgot to post my review. So, here you have it.I don't have nothing against cliff hangers. I love a good trilogy. I love a good romance and I love fiction... This book barely made my 2 stars, but please read my review, I have special tastes and maybe you can like it...This is another book by a billionaire that doesn't want anything to do with the girl. The only difference this time is that the girl doesn't want anything with the guy too and she accepts to go to bed with him without even knowing his name.My irritation started there and continued along the book:1-Call me a feminist if you will but why does almost all female authors have to put women in such a compromising place? IS SHE SO DESPERATE, JUST BECAUSE A GUY DUMPED HER?  REALLY? Woman up, lady, and go live your life without sex for a few months. There is nothing wrong with it and makes it rocks when it happens with the right guy.If Jack were ugly and poor, would Larenlyn go to bed with him just for sex, without knowing his name? No, I guess not.2-If you haven't been to a place, don't write about it. It's obvious the author haven't been to Australia.3-If you don't know how wealthy, intelligent people talk, please don't write about them. Please, pretty please! Intelligent billionaires, specially CEOs that have to read contracts and deal with politicians tend to have a better vocabulary.Besides, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THESE AUTHORS THAT ONLY DO SLANGS or LOCAL TERMS?One or two local words or one or two slang is okay if you want to stress a character's quality, but the whole book?4-I love alpha males. Just making myself clear: I love alpha males, not psychos or sick men such as Grey or Cross.Jack is not that. The author lost her hand here, because he starts as a psycho, becomes a jerk and then toward the end he is nice, loving, understanding and just a bit jealous. Never intense or possessive as an alpha male should be.My fault. So if you like sweet, caring and understanding man, go for it.5-Why does the female characters have to be so dumb? He tells her he is a very wealthy man and still she believes he works for someone that allows him to sleep in all those marvelous houses? Being Jack one of the richest man in the country, wouldn't he be in the news as soon as his property catches fire? Would he never appear in the newspaper? Or maybe Laurelyn is so idiot that she doesn't read the newspapers or watch the eight o'clock news? Not even the internet? Really?6 -IMO:The book tries to be funny, but doesn't make me laugh.The book tries to be sexy, but doesn't make me hot.The book is shallow. No great angst, no great heart ache, until the last two chapters.Really?7-He is a billionaire I'm okay with that. He wants to go to bed with women, who he doesn't know the name and doesn't even ask for exams, kind of hard to believe, but okay, this is a fictional romance, let's overlook a few things. After three months with the girl, when he is already liking her, she leaves and he cannot go after her, because he still doesn't know her name, where he leaves, so on and so forth, after having had access to her cell phone, identity in her purse and everything else, such as passport? Oh, please...8-It was a very light reading. What I mean is: If you squeeze it, nothing will come out. I know it's a romance; I know it's fiction but doesn't literature have a function in life? Weren't us taught in school that we were supposed to read to be better human beings and function in society? A romance can, better should, bring nice ethical or morals concepts?Too obvious, too light for my taste. I hope I never come across one of those again.Just trying to being fair here: Would I recommend the book to anyone? I don't know. There're people who have loved it... So, read the 5 star reviews before deciding if you want to buy it or not. It's just my opinion.BTW, I bought the book. It was not free, 0,99 or cheap.
5	1376265600	This has been my favorite book I've read in a long time- I loved both characters so much and I cannot wait to read what happens in their story!! Read this book!!!
4	1376265600	It was a fun reading with great excitement and looking forward to reading the other book. I hopit's much better than this book.
4	1376092800	I thought this book was well written and an easy read; great for a lazy weekend.  It did have a Fifty Shades of Grey twist to it, however, I liked the fact that the intimate scenes were a little more realistic.
4	1376006400	Was a good story line and held your interest. In the middle it did take a short turn and was more like 50 shades of gray. But overall easy read and felt like you were there.
4	1376006400	First book of the Beauty Series.  I enjoy series andthis was a quick read with the right price worth the read.
4	1375833600	Finally! Finally a book with a Fifty Shades of Grey feel that I enjoyed!  I was hesitant to start this one for fear it would fall prey to the same problem all others that are similar to Fifty Shades does and that is being Cheesy and unbelievable.  Wrong!  This book was neither cheesy nor too hard to believe.This story is told in dual POV where we get to get into the mind of both Laurelyn Prescott and Jack McLachlan.Laurelyn is fresh out of a relationship that left her shattered and the last thing she wants is a relationship.  However, Jack's proposition is still hard to swallow without feeling a little insulted so she fights the idea.  After thinking it over his proposition doesn't seem so bad, she is attracted to him and she is only in Australia for a few monthsJack is a guarded individual who has been hurt by gold diggers in his past, deciding no one will try and trap him again.  He has resigned his life to one of being alone outside his family.  A Dominant man in control of his life and those he allows in his he soon learns we can't control our heart.The steam scenes were good, and better yet I did not find myself skimming them which I do in books when the scenes seem redundant.  They were fun to read and the perfect amount spaced in the book.Ms. Cates wrote two well developed characters that you could believe and become intrigued by.  This book was emotional, sexy and attention grabbing.This book is part of a series so don't expect everything to wrap at the end because there is a cliffhanger!
4	1375747200	SPOILER ALERT, READERS!  :)Jack Henry McLachlan is a rich, 30-year-old Australian who "practices" pre-arranged liaisons with women. These women agreed and understood from the get-go that there will be no contact between them once the affair is over.  He's had plenty of training under his belt, 12 in fact.  He was on a prowl for # 13 when his eye caught Laurelyn Prescott, a 22-year old American beauty who's spending 3 months in Australia.Laurelyn is an aspiring musician/singer/songwriter who went to Australia with her best friend for a much needed break. She didn't agree to his proposal right away. She was actually insulted at first and I approve that she didn't give in easily. But she slowly wore out her playing hard-to-get when she decided to go with him in Avalon. She kept on saying that she hasn't verbally agreed to his proposition yet but she had already packed her overnight bag and they were already at the vineyard, for crying out loud!There is enough conflict going on for a reader to keep turning the pages:There is Ben, her bff's brother, who's shown interest in Laurelyn and shared a few pissing contest with Jack.There is that sabotage going about in at least 2 of his vineyards, most likely a gesture of courtesy from a crazy ex-girlfriend. Then this same cracked ex presented herself to Laurelyn in an attempt to sabotage their budding relationship. I just know that I will see this witch again. It would be interesting to read her next attempt to get Jack back before finally stumbling hard to her imminent downfall.Then there's the McLachlan clan, oh yeah! What a typical happy, meddling family he has especially his mother and I adore her! She will not stop being intrusive till his Jack Henry is groggily married and spewing grandchildren for her to spoil.An affair to remember, that's what they had. Their sexual chemistry is immediate and plenty. And boy, did they do a lot of humping and romping! Truthfully, I wish I've read more character build-up than sex scenes.Soon enough, the 3 months is over and Laurelyn leaves Australia. She left Jack Henry, she had to - he basically handed her her walking papers during their last night together. I do not blame her why she had to leave him that way and it is a superb segue to the next book (I am saying that now because the sequel is out and published) *wink*. I know that a happy ending is coming for Jack and Laurelyn soon.So...That next book will be read starting tomorrow.Or should I forego sleep tonight?
5	1375574400	This book if fantastic!!! I recently finished this book and almost died because I didn't have access to the internet to get the next one for 2 days. The author flips between the views of 2 characters and does it in such a way that it's easy to follow and keeps you wanting to read more. I love the story line and all the characters. The main characters are perfect for each other and I love the way Jack Henry keeps breaking his rules for Laurelyn but refuses to admit to himself why. I just hope he does track her down and they get back together. I can't wait to read the second book!!!
5	1375228800	I enjoyed this love story....  Look forward to book #2Cates has a unique way of telling a story that keeps me interested.
5	1375142400	This was a great romantic read with the right amount of mystery, suspense and romance! Loved it and read the second book in the series right away!!
4	1375056000	I found it a different story line in finding love but was a good read and not bad sexually speaking, LOL
1	1374969600	The sex was not hot. The writing was amateurish and without any sizzle to it. I borrowed it for the cover art and was more disappointed than the low standard I started off having.
5	1374796800	I was late for work, twice, because of this book. I LOVE this story. I could not put it down. It is very well written and the story line isn't predictable. Another plus is the grammar is great. READ IT!!!
4	1374796800	I love Georgia Cates, and this book didn't disappoint.  This was a good book, and I am excited to get more from this series.
5	1374710400	This 2 book series is totally great, it was well written and detailed and there were no dull moments. Definitely a great book! I read it again from time to time!
5	1374624000	This was a great book  you really enjoy the two main characters and really get into what is happeneing.  But be worned as much as this book has great development and plot the follow up is a flop and will make you hate the series
5	1374624000	I just couldn't stop reading .....Amazing!!sexy!!The first book after fifty shades that catches my attention this way ...I'm just in love with it .... I can't wait to read the second part.. I LOVED IT!!!!
5	1374537600	This was an awesome book! I couldn't put it down! Love the characters!! Strong, heart felt characters, I couldn't get enough!
5	1374451200	Georgia Cates has become one of my favorite authors!! I liked the fact that both books were available for purchase, You didnt have to wait months to read the series completely.  Her writing lets you know that Life may not always be pretty, but it can be beautiful.  Everyone has it in them to change, if given the chance. They were both given their happy ever after.
5	1374451200	I read this in one sitting, I couldnt put it down its that great.  I was enthralled with it, I actually was a little down when it ended.  I hoping they find each other again, it was heartbreaking when laurie left jack henry, I could feel her pain, being in complete love with someone I can totally understand what she was feeling.  Im looking forward to getting the next book, georgia cates doesnt disappoint, she weaved a great story.
4	1374364800	and visit the down under. i wonder if i do can i meet a hot rich dude to show me around? hot scenes, somewhat good plot. Hate the cliffhanger.
3	1374364800	This book has its heart swelling moments between the main characters: Laurelyn and Jack Henry. This leads to their comparability, which  is obvious from the very beginning, is like he met his match. I liked Laurelyn from the very beginning, but it took Jack Henry to start showing some sensibility before I warmed up to him. Jack Henry came across as being too possessive too soon and it did not seat well with me. And then his crazy mother Margaret was also another character that took a little bit for me to warm up to. She was so desperate for her son to be in a relationship that she could not even enjoy having him on his birthday, odd? The best part of this book is that once you have finish it, then you can proceed Beauty from Surrender, which is fantastic!
5	1374278400	This book is just.....wow. At first I wasn't sure but after the first chapter I was hooked and can't wait to read book two!!!!!
2	1374278400	I felt like I was reading 50 Shades of Grey all over again with slight variations, but generally the same scenario. Rather disappointing. This made me wonder if all new romance novels were going to be a trilogy of books based around the same story-line...
5	1374192000	A fun and predictable story but just what you are looking for. This is a must read - easy and sexy story
2	1374192000	BORING  It just didn't hold my interest.Little conflict involved and it seemed a little unrealistic.Maybe it just moved to slowly.
5	1374105600	Jack Henry where have you been all my life. That's right on my TBR list for way to long. Thank god for my fellow Jack lovers that pushed you to the top of my list.Wow this story is beautiful. A chance meeting in a bar leads us on a journey to true love but is that enough.Laurelyn is hurt and needs to get away. She leaves to find herself. What she finds along the way is not what she bargained for.Jack Henry is set in his ways. No names no expectations no future that's what he's set out for. Well funny things can happen when your heart takes over.They set out on this 3 month journey of no expectations. It's starts out as no real names that leads to to much. Well minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, week by week, and month by month the plan gets away from them. They've exchanged names and words that shouldn't have been spoken. One to afraid to admit to the other of there love. They have an amazing time. Jack and Laurelyn are amazing chemistry right from the start. She challenges him and he loves a challenge . He promises to make her dreams come true and all her fantasy come to life . He does just that and in the process has the best 3 months of his life as well. But is it enough for them to be . She leaves without a word for fear of the pain. He decides he needs more time. But is he to late can he find his way. So looking forward to Beauty from Surrender :)
5	1374105600	here is something about this book that just really did it for me. It skims the fine line of something that is being overdone but in my opinion out does the other books of its kind. I fell in love with the characters and really loved the writing too...it all just felt very real to me. Absolutely can't wait to read the next part of this story.
5	1374019200	Geez, right when you start getting into the book.......it ends!  NOOOOOOOO!!!Easy reading, lots of steamy sex and great story.  You wont want it to end.Loved it!
5	1374019200	It was full of the good stuff,  everything us women love.I will tell my girlfriends about both of these books.
3	1374019200	I liked this, but was bitterly disappointed it was just a set up for the next one.  I really have no desire to read it because the general reviews were so bad.  Oh well.
5	1374019200	I loved this book; it had a smokin hot man, a beautiful funny woman, and steamy sex scenes, a perfect combination. I thought Laurelyn was a down to earth girl that was not swayed by money and things, when she meets Jack I like how she at first thinks about acting like she knows alot about wine but then decides to tell the truth, this is how their relationship ends up being, her never being the stuck up woman, instead finding joy in simple things which Jack loves. I like how he calls her his American girl. I think her friend Addison is hilarious she is a nice addition to this story. I like how spirited Laurelyn is, she doesn't mix words, and she says what she feels. I like how she doesn't jump right away at his request to join in this arrangement, and how he thinks he has screwed up the whole deal. I like the different scenario in this book, it is an arrangement but it isn't the same as many books I have read. I like how upfront he is with the information she asks for in regards to him doing this in the past and it is refreshing how direct he is when asking her things he needs to know like if she is on birth control and him insisting on using condoms, no stupid games. I love how she doesn't make it easy for him, that she didn't give him an answer right away and he notices that she is not like the other woman but this interest him and he keeps pursuing her. Oh my gosh the one thing that was so funny was a part when she tells him that she is only seventeen and she has daddy issues, his reaction is priceless. I love the connection they have right away, how she feels she can share things with him that she has never told anyone else and wow the life she has had is terrible. One of the funniest parts is when she keeps calling him Jack, she says things like "Got it Jack?" but not knowing that is his real name, it freaks him out. One of the hottest things is when they get back from their first "date" and he pins her to the wall outside her apartment and tells her that he can't wait to get her in his bed and show her all the ways he can make her come, then she challenges him to kiss her, his kiss leaves her weak in the knees, then he tells her that she doesn't have to be in his bed to make her come and starts to go down toward the spot I swear I was left speechless lol and this is how their sex always is, wild, all consuming, and hot. I was wild about Jack he is sexy and possessive, his jealous steak, his dominance, and his love making is so manly. He loves her humor, her innocence, her wonder of new things, her not caring about money, and is shocked by a sexual act that she will perform for him. Jack's mum is great and how she grabs onto the idea that Laurelyn is his girlfriend is wonderful. When Audrey shows up at his house and tries to trick her my heart was breaking, I thought oh my gosh she is going to leave and he isn't going to know what happened, that was quite the scare, I think he realized how much he cares for her and when he called his mum to prove that Audrey was lying I thought there it is he is starting to really fall for her. I love when she meets his family and how she fits right in, and now every thing about their relationship changes. When the time gets closer to her having to leave my heart feels like it is breaking a little each page that I read. When she says something to Jack and he doesn't respond to her I swear I could feel the deep down hurt in my own heart. Then she makes a decision in regards to how she wants to handle having to go home and of course he makes a decision that should have been made days before and now it is too late and my tears start and don't stop until the end of the book. This is a great read, don't miss it. I started the next book right away. Fantastic job Georgia
3	1373932800	This was an okay read. The characters did not interest me and I found myself reading for the sake of finishing the book but not really enjoying it. Jack Henry was supposed to be like a Christian Grey but he did not have any depth or a tortured past that explained why he avoided commitment by having secretive arrangements with targeted women. In fact, I found him weak and not at all an alpha male. Laurelyn seemed pretty immature and nothing really stood out about her apart from her music and pole dancing skills.
5	1373932800	I hated that their relationship only lasted three months! Overall, I loved the couple in the book and how they was falling in love.
5	1373932800	This book was keeping me on my toes I loved it!!! Couldn't put down I definitely recommend. There was some interesting twists that are good, worth purchasing.
5	1373932800	Great story!  Had me glued from the minute I picked up the book.Recommended it to my friends for a summer read!  Both books a MUST READ!
5	1373846400	OH.MY:GOD....It's amazing! I'm in love all over again, this time for Jack Henry! Great story, great characters, great sex scenes.... You haver to read it, like NOW!!!!!
5	1373760000	What an amazing story. Like nothing I've ever read. So very good. It kept me interested from the beginning to the end. I have book 2 and loved it, too. I wish authors would say in their synopsis that it's a series and which number it is and if there will be more so we don't have to go hunting it down. I hate waiting and usually wait for all of them to come out so I can read them together. Now I find out there will be book 3. Hope I don't have to wait long. I am excited for more of Jack Henry and L.
5	1373500800	5 Fan-Freaking-Tastic Stars!!! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I smiled through much of the story and felt broken and on the verge of crying at one point in the story. Thank you Georgia Cates for that rollercoaster ride. Looking forward to Beauty from Surrender...which I purchased today...as soon as I finished this book.
5	1373500800	Couldn't put the book down! I feel bad for disrupting my husbands sleep when reading through the night and the kindle light bugging him all night lol!
4	1373500800	He is a hot, hunky, demanding Aussie that is swoon-worthy! Love how their feelings grow gradually...you are just waiting for someone to declare their love at any moment! Really enjoyed this book:)
4	1373414400	I had a tough time getting into this book and almost gave up on it but I'm glad I stuck it out. I eventually got sucked into the story and feelings of the characters. Going for book 2 to see what happens next. There is a cliffhanger.
5	1373414400	I love when I finally find a great,well written book with characters I care about. I get halfway through so many books and just lose interest, that's not the case here. Georgia Cates is a terrific writer and I look forward to reading more of her work. The fact that I'm actually writing a review shows how much I loved Beauty From Pain because I have never took the time to review a book before. Now I'm off to start Beauty From Surrender. I can't wait to lose myself in the world of Laurelyn and Jack Henry...Well done Mrs Cates!!!!
5	1373414400	This book was great. I loved the personalities that these two have. The fact that their relationship can withstand so many troubles is also awesome. This book kept me interested and I would recommend it to those who liked bared to you and fifty shades.
4	1373414400	Unable to put it down!  Total character and plot development!! Interactions with characters were great.  Loved the mystery surrounding the main characters.  Highly recomend.
4	1373414400	BEAUTY FROM PAIN is the first storyline in Georgia Cates's New Adult Beauty Duet series that focuses on Australian billionaire winemaker Jack McLachlan and American singer Laurelyn Prescott. The Beauty series is yet another storyline following the FSOG/Crossfire phenomenon but-with a twist. Our hero does not want to reveal his true identity-his real name-and the women with whom he gets involved are limited to a three to four week affair. No entanglements, no promises and definitely no personal information. Jack is a man who believes all women are only after one thing-his money-therefore anonymity is his closest friend. What Jack does not bargain for is falling in the love with his latest anonymous partner.Beauty from Pain is told from two distinct POVs and introduces the usual cast of characters that are similar to the other more famous series: the BFF; the scorned ex lover; a father who has not had any permanent contact with his daughter and much more; but where this particular storyline differs is that our hero comes from a happy, well adjusted family background with no abusive or dark secrets hiding in the past. But Jack's foray into the flavor of the month club has generated some unwelcome history when one woman refuses to let go.The relationship between Jack and Laurelyn begins as a mutual attraction that eventually leads to a three month business arrangement where no one is expected to fall in love or discover the true identity of the other person. But a family emergency will pull Laurelyn into Jack's private life and all bets are off when Jack's mother sees something between the couple that neither one is able to admit. When the time comes for Laurelyn to return to America, she is heartbroken when the man with whom she has fallen in love is willing to let her leave. The three months have past and it is time for Laurelyn to move on. She was never supposed to fall in love with her temporary boyfriend.We are privy to some background information regarding Laurelyn's history-her troubled family life and her most recent relationship with a powerful record producer who wants nothing more than to bring Laurelyn back home. There is the requisite friend who falls in love with a fellow Aussie; and of course another man who is vying for Laurelyn's attention and love.If you are a fan of FSOG and like the premise surrounding a contractual relationship that develops into love, than Beauty from Pain is the perfect read. There is forbidden love and the heartbreaking realization that perhaps it was never meant to be. Georgia Cates has found her niche with Beauty from Pain. Book Two-Beauty from Surrender was released May 2013.see all of my reviews at : thereadingcafe(dot)com
4	1373328000	Good story, Hot sex.  The characters are developed well and the story line is interesting.  I'd read more by this author.
1	1373328000	Seriously? Why wasn't I warned that this is a knockoff of 50 Shades? All that is missing is the BDSM sex. I freaking loathed that book so really, I did not have high hopes for this one. First with the way Jack speaks, then with the fact that Laurelyn is super weak. There is a deal involved and a whole lot of insta love. I kind of wish this whole style of writing and plot would just fade out and go away already. We get it, stop writing tons if books about the same stupid story.
5	1373328000	Ok don't let the Title of the book fool you.  The pain comes from a past relationship and needing to get away.  However if Lauren hadn't left for 3 months and gone with her best friend on a trip, she wouldn't have met Jack Henry.  I read the book in 2 days because I just couldn't put it down.  The second book is just as good, Beauty from surrender. After reading both books, I'm rating these as two of my favorites.  If you like love, romance, suspense, and a little kinky sex you'll love reading this book.  One other thing is Lauren's mother is something else, but Jack Henry has one great mum  that I wished I had for a mother inlaw!! She's a fireball and not afraid to tell her son whats on her mind and even told Lauren she needs to give her son a little nookie!! haha It's a MUST READ!!
5	1373328000	I absolutely loved this book! It was the first book I've read that showed both characters point of view! I really liked that it was a romance book that had more to offer than just the steamy love scenes! Although I did enjoy the sexiness and rawness of the love scenes, it was nice to actually have a great story line behind it!!
4	1373155200	This book was nice and interesting but I don't understand why they don't state that it is not a stand alone book.Have to wait for the other books to come out
3	1373155200	3.5 stars.  This started off slow that's why the 3.5 rating.  But it did get better, and I ended up really enjoying it.  Can't wait to start the next one.
5	1373155200	It was a great sexy love story it made me laugh and cry several times it intrigued me  I read both books in 5 days.. And I am not what you call a reader but I could not but these books down. . Enjoyed it alot hope to read more about the two characters and see what happens in their lives.
4	1373068800	I love the way the characters can be "themselves" during their relationship. You need to take chances in life with no regrets.
3	1373068800	It didn't have much of a story. Seemed to dwell on sexual encounters more than anything else. It was okay I guess.
4	1372982400	Oh what does one do with their time in a different country? Meet wicked, handsome men and just enjoy the ride. Jack and Laurelyn's story is fairly predictable, I mean you KNOW he's going to fall in deep as will she, but the art work in these stories is making all these various misunderstanding between these 2 still readable, and not overtly &#34;bangs head against kindle&#34;. Which I think Georgia Cates did beautifully.
4	1372982400	Beauty from pain was a beautifully written light romantic novel. Has all the components to a great book. Jack Henry is swoon worthy. Highly recommended, especially after reading something with a lot of angst
4	1372982400	I loved the relationship between these two. The chemistry flowed easily and the author did a great job conveying real emotion that jumped off the page. Looking forward to book #2
5	1372982400	When this book first come out I was looking forward to purchasing it. After finishing a few books I was in the process of reading I bought it. After starting it I wondered why I had waited so long to get it! I has a wonderful story line along with wonderful characters. Thank you so much for a wonderful book. Looking forward to reading more of them.
4	1372809600	Loved this book. Could not put down! Can't wait to read the next one as well as more from this author.
5	1372723200	It was very interesting. Would love to see a third book. loved the Characters. I loved it very much very sexy.
4	1372723200	I was uncertain in the beginning whether I'd enjoy this book because I didn't warm up to Jack right away. There was no instant attraction to him. But I loved Laurelyn, a well-rounded brilliant heroine that you can totally adore for her strengths and weaknesses. Jack redeemed himself after a while and I began to love his character too. Wonderful story Georgia. I was really engaged and love your writing style. Thank you for "Beauty from Pain." Oh and the one liners are brilliant! The sprinkle of humor was like icing on the cake:)4.5 Stars Would have been a 5 star for everything except a cliffhanger ending. Not a fan of leaving me waiting.
5	1372723200	I loved this book. It is similar in theme to 50 shades of grey but 100 times better. Really looking forward to reading the next book, Beauty from Surrender.
5	1372636800	Beautiful story that was beautifully written, boasting strong and well defined characters that you come to adore. Well worth the investment. Read this and #2 in record time.
5	1372636800	After reading this book, I was so mad at myself for letting this sit on my recommendation list for so long before trying it. I saw the cover of the book, and the name and assumed the story revolved around a BDSM relationship. Boy, was I wrong. This is a great story about about finding love when you were not looking for it. I was hooked from the very beginning.
5	1372636800	Loved this book!  Steamy!!  Enjoyed the characters a lot.  The end had me sobbing.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
5	1372636800	I love the characters you feel their pain and the love that develops between them. The story concept was very interesting reading cannot wait to read the next book.
2	1372636800	Is this  50 Shades the remix? I've only read two slutmances in my adult life and they are the same story! This book had some decent moments, but I'd be pissed if I paid more than a $1 for it. At least the vocabulary was tolerable as opposed to 50 Shades. Not my kind of book really.
4	1372636800	I loved this book...not enough for five stars but I still could not put it down. The characters  were great except for Ben...he was annoying. I liked that the female lead was not an annoying  crybaby  which seems to happen a lot in these types of books.
4	1372636800	OMG what  a great book. Can't wait to read more. It has a wonderful story that keeps you right to the end. Looking forward to the next book. And see what else she has written. If you put any more letters in your books you should consider putting them in the same size text as the rest of the book. I could barely read them on my Kindle, with a magnifying glass.
5	1372550400	Very enticing book! The author keeps you hooked in the whole book and makes you keep wanting to read the second book.
5	1372464000	Oh my goodness...I LOVED this book! Laurelyn Prescott has decided to travel to Australia with her best friend Addison for three months. She is trying to get over a bad situation and decided getting out of the United States and away from the situation would help her heal. She plans on going to Australia, hanging out with her best friend, and enjoying life for a while.Jack McLachlan is an Australian native who has no plans on getting involved in a real relationship. He is a very wealthy vineyard owner and doesn't trust women to not use him for his status and money. He frequently asks women to be his "companion" for three or four weeks and then moves on to the next one. He is going to be in Waaga Waaga for the next three months, so decides he is going to find a companion for those three months. When Jack spots Laurelyn, he knows she is going to be his next companion.Jack has a few stipulations though. Jack and Laurelyn will NOT tell each other their real names. They will use specific cell phones just to contact one another and he will show her the time of her life for the next three months. Because Laurelyn is coming off of a bad relationship and has no intentions of getting involved with someone, she decides she could use a little fun and agrees to Jack's proposal.From this time forward, she is known to Jack as Paige and he is Lachlan. Can I just say Lachlan is swoon worthy. He treats Paige wonderfully. He truly does intend to keep up his side of the bargain and show her the time of her life. You would never guess that he sees her as just another companion.Paige's spunk is awesome. She doesn't try to change who she is in order to please Lachlan. She is a "you get what you see" kind of girl which makes her so likeable.I have to say I LOVE Jack's family. His mother was awesome, and the relationship between Jack and his brother is really great. Jack's family adds a lot to this story just by getting to know Jack better, but they also add to his relationship with Laurelyn. His family adds a whole other element because they have no idea about their arrangement.Paige and Lachlan spend all of their time together. They really enjoy one another's company and they know that is because there are no expectations. There is a definitive end date, so they don't have pressure on one another. The problem is they start to develop real feelings for one another.This book actually reminded me so much of the movie Pretty Woman which I love. They just have an arrangement, but have no control when their hearts begin to take control. It is not all roses though because they do not truly open up to one another.This book does end in a cliffhanger, but part two is already out. I am giving this book 5-STARS!
4	1372464000	Jack McLachlan is spending 3 months in Wagga Wagga taking care of business and while he's there he's looking for a beautiful woman to spend the 3 months with. He sees Laurelyn singing in a club one night and decide he she's the one the will occupy his time. He lets her know exactly what he wants: 3 months, no real names, no pretenses and they both have to agree to walk away after 3 months. A tragic moment brings Laurelyn into Jack's life like no other woman has and things began to become complicated. Jack and Laurelyn find themselves going from a black and white relationship to a fuzzy gray when feelings come into play. When the 3 months are up, will Jack be able to stick with his initial plan?"Beauty From Pain" was a great read. I fell in love with both Jack and Laurelyn. This book has a way of making you smile one minute and frustrated the next but it is definitely worth reading. I finished the book in one day as it was hard to put down. I will be starting the next book next. I look forward to seeing what's in store for Jack and Laurelyn in the next book. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great romance that will make you smile, have you frustrated and wanting more.
5	1372464000	There are so many things I loved about this book starting with Jack being an Aussie and well who doesn't like an accent. Yes, I imagined that accent every time he spoke. Second, I loved everything about Laurelynn: her adventurous spirit to get away from a bad breakup in Nashville and put her music career on hold to get away from heartache. Third would have to be the crazy no strings attached, no real names, temporary relationship agreement he has with Laurelynn. The best part of the book is watching and wondering if Jack and Laurelynn will break the rules of the agreement when their hearts get in their way.
5	1372377600	I loved the main characters in this book.  I had a hard time waiting for the second one to be published to see how it progressed.
5	1372377600	Fell in love with the characters. Can't wait to read Beauty from Surrender. Have enjoyed the link with the wine industry.

5	1372291200	Love this story.  Starts out innocent and simple no strings and quickly grows and really pulls you in.  Feeling all the emotions that Lauren and Jack do.  I just wish they would speak their mind alittle more.  Book 2 in the series is also a must.  Highly recommend
5	1372291200	Heading says it all. The chemistry between the main characters is unlike any other. Passion, lust, profound love and most intriguingly, crude.
5	1372291200	From the moment you open this book you are captivated. Not wanting to put the book down to spoil the fun these two share. It's an easy read with a great story line. Added to my favotites
4	1372291200	I was captivated from the beginning! I loved reading the character development and watching a fantasy come to life. The unexpected twists and turns kept me enraptured and I couldn't put it down!  Georgia Cates captures a wild fantasy for any reader and adds some extra spice!
4	1372204800	Jack and laurelynn have a crazy relationship that fit perfectly for them. I still don't understand why it took the advise of young wise Evan for jack to go look for her. I love Evan wise word to his brother&#34;Jack you don't always know the true worth of a woman's love until it become a memory.&#34; True indeed young Evan.
5	1372204800	I am dying here!  I hate cliff hangers but man do they work for readers like me. This is an amazing story and the storyline keeps you glued.  Jack and Lauralyn are great together. ThIs story is hot and romantic. It is a great read. Now on to book 2. ...
5	1372204800	Come back/Go back...great story. Strong characters. Reading them back to back was the way to go. Would love to see yet another one...we'll see according to Georgia Cates. Thank you for a lovely series.
4	1372204800	I liked this book. It's not astonishing or mindblowing, but it's a good read. I just wished it had ended. The characters deserved a happy ending and the readers needed closure, not being dragged to reading a sequel. It would have also been nice to understand why Jack Henry was so averse to having normal relationships. Since we already had his POV, we should have gotten a glimpse of his character, as we did with Laurelyn. I'm not discouraging you to read it, but don't have such high expectations about it.
5	1372204800	Can't wait to read #2! Such a quick easy read. Both characters are so compelling & I love hearing from both points of view!
4	1372118400	This story is about as good as Shades of Grey. It is less in the revealing content of the intimate moments,  but overall the  sorry is well written in a place that is as beautiful as the characters.
4	1372032000	This was a good book...loved the MC and the twists in the story. I'll definitely be buying more from this author.
4	1372032000	Jointly reviewed for : [...]Gitte: So this was my first Georgia Cates and wow...how did I not know? Yes, I hang my head in shame?! I loved this story, it was fabulously written and the characters and premise of the story was fab. But urgh...cliff-hanger!"There is evil f***ery afoot here." - JackYeah there really was and I bloody enjoyed it!Anyway, I loved the changing pov's, we get to connect with both our male and female character as we hear and understand their inner thoughts, which ultimately lead to their respective actions. I have to say I was so hooked I read this in one sitting. I just couldn't put down Jack and Laurelyn's story and just as the characters became more and more involved so did I."He holds me and his embrace speaks without saying a word."What did you think Jenny?Jenny: Agreed Gitte! How have we had this on our Kindles since Feb and yet not ventured into Georgia Cates territory until now! We headed straight into this Monday after being swamped with recommendations on our Blog and we weren't disappointed!First thought....Oh dear .....another cliffy! But I'm okay and will eagerly look forward to finding out what's afoot in Jack land and just what is going on in that man's mind! There's still so much I need answered that's for sure.The alternative POV's in Beauty from Pain really did allow you to become invested in the story....to get inside both heads and feel what each was going through. I have to say, George Cates really can tell a story. I completely connected with the characters, I felt their conflict, I felt their pain and I laughed at their wit."Oh, double swoon. His lips are when mine were. Lucky glass" - LaurelynAnd don't get me started on the heat and chemistry between Jack " thud, there goes my heart" Henry and Laurelyn. Yep! They burned up the pages of this book and I loved it too!Gitte: So we meet our heroine Laurelyn as she arrives in the Land Down Under, Wagga Wagga to be specific, with her best mate Addison. They are visiting Addison's brother Ben (yuk, I didn't like him at all) for three months as he is living there studying Wine and everything that comes with it at Uni.Laurelyn has a lot of emotional baggage from her past and she's an aspiring singer/songwriter which plays out through this story. She came across a tad cynical and "tired" of life but who can blame her really. That is until she gets a proposal thrown at her by a hot enigmatic millionaire who clocked her in the pub on her first night out.I have to say he freaked me out in the beginning. I thought he was going to be an evil stalker. Our Laurelyn isn't convinced at first either as the offer consists of three months of nookie and apparently being wined and dined in between; with no strings attached. No identity reveal is allowed or demands made. Except for one. Laurelyn, who is number thirteen to sign up for this, must never contact him again after her three months are up. Yeah I'd be a bit freaked out and sceptical too. However, then her friend Addison comes out with this classic line and it's all systems go:"The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else."Well, that's true, and why not a gorgeous Aussie rich guy who makes you melt into a puddle on the floor? Their chemistry was hot....it was sensual and passionate and they can't keep their hands off each other."This relationship isn't romantic and won't ever be. It is arranged and temporary. I'd do well to not forget that any time soon." - LaurelynThey fall into an almost instantaneous "relationship" because there is no pressure and they aren't really trying to impress each other."This relationship...I get it now. I get why it works.....Because we have no pretences and clear expectations, I don't feel pressured to be anything but me." - LaurelynThere is funny banter as well as passion which really broke up this story and made me connect more because it was not all about the nookie. There's an age gap, daddy issues, music, secrets, mystery and suspense."I like being with you even when there's no sex involved. That means you're not a booty call." - JackOh and you know you are in the company of a hot alpha male when you hear:"No one else touches you. Only me. Do you understand?...I won't share you with anyone." - JackJack....not a creepy stalker that's for sure. He was pretty bloody lush. He's a man with a plan that's bullet proof right? Ummm wrong."Say my real name..."Both players knew the game but both players broke the rules and it made for one hell of a sexy, passionate and emotional ride...that ended....in a cliff-hanger!"She makes me want to break down and tell her everything. It's strange - I've never wanted to do that before. She makes me want to do lots of new things." - Jack"I don't say it, but I definitely think it-we've both just experienced something that can never be topped." - LaurelynSo yes I really enjoyed it, my main issue resulting in why this isn't a higher rating is that I had a problem with how long Jack's identity was kept an enigma. This, in my opinion, was a bit unbelievable as Ben should have known who he was, after all...he is in the industry and as he has an axe to grind you'd think he would be right onto that one. Spoiling what Jack and Laurelyn has, taking what he wants. But....bring on Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2), I can't wait. At least we haven't got long to go right Jenny?Jenny: Yay for not having to wait too long Gitte! We follow Laurelyn as she arrives in Australia with her friend after taking some time out to get her head sorted after leaving baggage in the States and trying to figure out where her life is going. Despite being confident, beautiful, sexy and funny, Laurelyn's self-esteem has taken a bit of a battering over the years and she has issues to work through."Music is what feelings sound like out loud. I sing songs that speak from my heart. They tell my story, how I feel." - LaurelynGorgeous, sexy, alpha, independent Wine Magnet and multi-millionaire Jack doesn't do relationships. Jack prefers his no strings attached "arrangements" - it's better that way as he fiercely guards his privacy. He maintains women for companionship and sex for a specific time then moves on to the next one. His life doesn't lend to relationships and he has no intention of starting one."Looks like we both have secrets."Jack meets Laurelyn at an open mic night and this American beauty immediately beguiles him. And boy do these two have chemistry! They definitely have "it" between them...that something that sizzles and demands to be explored...and explore they do! The sex scenes were off the charts but never did they overtake the guts of the story, just the opposite. It complimented it and took it up a notch."She has bewitched me. And I want her. She's the one." - JackJack intends for Laurelyn to be his "number 13 arrangement" and promises her pleasure like she has never experienced and the best three months of her life if she agrees to it."If you say yes, I will pamper you every day like a princess." - JackSeeing as Laurelyn is only in Australia temporarily the arrangement seems perfect for both of them? While spending time together, learning about one another and growing with each other, on thing they didn't count on was their hearts entering into the equation. They both bring about a change in each other they didn't expect and as a reader your heart is in your mouth as you face the inevitable with them. The time when Laurelyn must leave and the arrangement has run its course."She's showing me a new side of herself. It's childlike and damaged." JackWhen I was caught up in this book and being swept along with the story, the characters and emotion, I really did enjoy Beauty From Pain. In fact I loved it. So why not 5 stars?I had one negative with Beauty From Pain. It is purely a personal one and I understand the majority of readers would not even find this an issue or pick up on it but I'm afraid I did.Being Australian myself I have to say the use of the Australian vernacular was a misrepresentation of Jack in this book. The use of 'Strine which is a type of Australian slang language wasn't a correct representation of how Jack would converse and after a while I found it grated on me and at times this took me out of the story .You see 'Strine is kind of ockerism as such and simply not the way Jack would converse. Not to mention there were words used that I have never heard fellow Aussies utter. The voice in my head, based on the vernacular used in Beauty From Pain did not match up with the Jack I pictured from the book and to me it was distracting.Overall though I found Beauty From Pain to be a well written, well paced, sexy, witty and enjoyable read. It was more than a millionaire meets beauty book. It had heart, heat and emotion and because of that I would absolutely recommend picking it up."She's a magnet and I'm metal."Jack......And the cliffhanger....wow! Bring on Beauty From Surrender is all I can say! I need me some more Jack Henry!
5	1372032000	I started reading this book after reading the very disappointing third book in the Crossfire series.  This book totally renewed my love for these types of stories.  This story is written from both main characters POV in alternating chapters.  I always love reading the male POV and this male happened to be hot, rich and awesome in bed...triple threat as far as I'm concerned!  Oh, and the sex scenes in this book were OFF the charts...just saying.This author did such a great job of developing the characters, laying out the storyline, and drawing the reader in to this powerful love story.  This is book one of two and both are phenomenal!  Although the story of how Laurelyn and Jack Henry meet is not completely original, the way this love story develops is.  I could not put the book down and finished it in less than a day (staying up until 4 am to accomplish this I might add).  Worth every second of lost sleep.I found myself laughing during so many parts of this book that I found that to be one of the best surprises.  Both characters are strong and confident with no horrible tragedies (sexual abuse,etc.) to add a depressing turn, which is a pleasant change from most novels today.  You will love this story, the characters and the author by the time your done with this book.  A must read!
5	1371945600	This book started out great! Lachlan was rich and not looking for a relationship just a 3 month fling. Laurelyn was on vacation in Australia with her friend Addison trying to catch a break from another bad relationship. Lachlan doesn't do relationships, period! But as always boy meets girl, boy likes girl but is too headstrung to admit it, until its too late. Thank god for Beauty from surrender! Beauty from pain left me wanting more... I was left questioning, Whats going to Happen?? He doesn't know her name or her number and she is gone now back to the US. Lachlan really pissed me off in Volume 1. He knew he loved her but let his ego stand in the way. Volume 2 turns out great... the way it should be! Now if we could get a Volume 3 so we could read more of this lovely happily ever after! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES. it will not let you down... The hot steamy sessions are to die for!
5	1371945600	Just happened by this series by the star rating and boy o'boy the star rating was spot on!! I was one of the many was waiting for book #2. Hotness was uummm, uummm, ummmm! Read it!!
5	1371945600	I really enjoyed reading this story about Jack & Laurie. Well written love story that kept me up very late.  Now on to Beauty by Surrender.
5	1371945600	Typical... This is just so damn typical of my life in the reading world these days. Yes, I am referring to myself, not the book. BEAUTY FROM PAIN is a far from typical romantic story with a wonderfully unique premise. What's typical then? I'll tell you what's typical, the lack of resolution...the dreaded cliffhanger that has my soul in knots wanting to know the rest of the story.BEAUTY FROM PAIN is a beautifully written, all engrossing story that explores the journey of a relationship that begins as a no-string-attached fling but ultimately blossoms into something else entirely.Laurelyn Prescott escapes her life as a musician in Nashville, with her best friend, to the "Land Down Under." She is hoping that Australia will help mend her broken heart after suffering a nasty break-up and she plans to do this without the help of any man. That's the plan, or at least it WAS the plan, until Mr. Secret Sexy-Man makes her an offer that's almost too good to refuse... but she has to refuse, right? That's when her spunky and carefree BFF steps in and speaks these awesome words of wisdom: "The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else." Well, I couldn't have said it better myself!Jack McLachlan is, by Laurelyn's description, "hotter than the devil's a$$" and also happens to be a very successful owner of multiple vineyards across the South Pacific and Europe. Needless to say, he is a wanted man, but he has issues of his own that prevent him from opening his life and his heart to any woman. In order to protect himself from the complications (that he perceives) women bring to romantic relationships, he has devised a foolproof plan that has worked for several years - anonymous encounters lasting weeks or months, only promising to provide hot sex and the best life has to offer during their time together.Pffft! Sexy smokin' hottie + The time of my life = SOLD! Where do you want me? On my back or my knees - heck, I might even let a man like that strap me to a St. Andrews Cross, but, no worries, there's no cross or crop to be seen in this novel.BEAUTY FROM PAIN is chocked full of subtle humor, sexy characters and great one-liners. I even picked up my new favorite phrase "slut button" - Oh! I am soooo using that one again! This is far from being author Georgia Cates' first book, but it's a first for me by this author and you can bet a "roo's a$$" (love that) that I will be snatching up more of her work and stalking the release of the next book in the BEAUTY series.
4	1371945600	I was afraid of reading this book because I read some reviews comparing it to 50 shades and really... I can`t stand another copycat of 50 shades.BUT, in my opinion, this book has NOTHING similar to 50 shades. Really. I don`t get why some reviewers compared it to 50 shades. Maybe because the guy is rich? I think it`s the only thing they have in common.I just love this book. Really. The beginning of the book was weird, specially the part of Jack proposing to Laurelyn. It was kind of strange the proposition and the reasons WHY he acted that way. It didn`t feel real or something doable. Anyway, from this part on, the book is amazing! Jack is a real gentleman and he treats Laurelyn with nothing but respect. He is loving, caring and a sweet guy. A true gentleman. I fell in love with him through out the book and I could totally understand why Laurelyn would feel the same.Laurelyn is funny and cute. I like her personality and how sensitive she is. She accepts Jack`s proposal even though it`s something she never did before. Actually, she had only one guy before Jack so we can see how he really affects her and we can see her conflict about accepting or not. She only accepts after spending some time with him, which i think made it very believable.I just describe Jack and Laurelyn`s relationship as romantic. They are like boyfriend and girlfriend and it`s really sweet! I love this kind of book!Well, i just loved this book and I am going to number 2 now! ;)
3	1371945600	Helpless heroine, rich & powerful millionaire, looking for a short term contract-type relationship ... doesn't sound too original? True, but i was quite pleased with the version done in Beauty from Pain. That said, I do have some bugbearsThe character of Laurelyn was contradiction that a little too unrealistic for me - country singer, sweet yet pole-dances (was that added to make it more steamy?) Also, great to have an Aussie character but it was trying too hard to make him an "Aussie". Sorry, but as an Aussie myself raised and living in the city (which is how I took Jack as - even though he does travel to his wineries a lot), I don't come across a lot of young men  using Aussie slang such as coldie, daks, sheila on a regular basis - every know and then maybe or when trying to be light-hearted but not as much as as its been written here. It was consistent throughout the book in Jack's POV but it feels incredibly contrived to proof that he's a real Aussie.That said, scenes were hot and was an enjoyable read.
4	1371859200	I was hesitant about reading this book, for some reason the synopsis didn't intrigue me and I really wanted to do my research before I bought it. I asked around to my book lover friends and they were all raving about it. I'm so glad I listened to the recommendation to read this wonderful story. I really enjoyed Jack and Lauries story. It was definitely different than your typical romance and the author did such an amazing job connecting you to the characters. I would definitely recommend this book to other people. I look forward to reading more by this author.
5	1371859200	Good character development.  The story progressed at a pace that holds your interest.  The storyline was a little different from many other romance novels.
5	1371859200	From the very start I was head over heels in love with Jack Henry! Although he is controlling and a bit over the top, I couldn't put it down. It was an amazing read and once I finished the first I couldn't wait to get the next one. The only thing that I really didn't care for was how SHORT it was. It just wasn't enough for me! lol
5	1371859200	Amazing story, perfectly written and wonderful character development. Could not put it down. Must read finished the book in six hours. Worth more than the $.99 I paid for.
5	1371772800	I liked these characters and the premise of their agreement made for a little different storyline. I am sure he will find his girl in book 2, but am curious how it will all play out.
5	1371772800	AMAZING BOOK!!! Loved every second d of it...  Definetly would recommend this book to anyone who loves romance books. This book will keep you guessing on where their relationship will take them.
5	1371686400	I Apollo loved this book! You would think I would be sick of this genre but I am not. Very easy fast read because you can't put it down!
5	1371686400	This is now one of my all time favorite books!  Loved the story, the angst, and a book that you will definitely not be disappointed in!  I would highly recommend to anyone who loves a story with a bit of angst in it!
4	1371600000	I really liked this book, it wasn't anything that i haven't read before but I enjoyed it.  Really interested in what is going to happen in book two!!
5	1371600000	A promise of 3 months , sounded like a great love affair with no strings attached . But they were wrong ...... The heart wants what the heart wants . Great book !
4	1371600000	Love the store can't wait to read #2  I am not a reader but since I have the Kendal fire I have read 5 book
4	1371513600	Okay Ms. Cates.  First and foremost, I loved the conversational aspects of your book.  Very nice.  I could hear this in my head and it did sound natural and the book was light, dark and gray (no pun intended).  it was a pleasant read. I enjoyed it, as a matter of fact, it was a great summer read, I read it in a day.I know it is a fantasy, I have read a lot of books with this flavor-but my question is: Are there people out there who would be a sex object, just for the fun of it? This is not a put down of the book, but it seems to be a running theme.  But as women, we know that there is nothing "casual" about sex, that's some serious stuff, and I think Ms. Cates drove that home (great job, men, you should read this).I loved Laurelyn and Jack; I loved the way this book was written, it seemed like a movie playing, (hey, this could be a movie).I will move on to book two.If you like romance (kind of romance, I guess it's romance)then give Ms. Georgia a read, it is so worth the money.
5	1371513600	This book came to my attention at the perfect time. This book was just what I needed right now. I just came off some really dark reads (the dark duet and epilogue), then a totally judgemental and juvinile frigid female MC caused me such emotional distress (sweet thing) in my last read, and I desperately needed this simple transparent love story at this exact moment in time. Georgia Cates truly delivers in this angsty emotional tale of boy meets girl.Laurelyn is the real deal. She is honest. When I'm reading a book and desperately wanting the female MC to just say how she freakin feels instead of dragging out half truths and complete lies, Laurelyn arrives on the scene! She says how she feels. She doesn't make you wait for it. She's not perfect, but she's raw and true to her word. She's not immature and selfish. I can't tell you how refreshing she is! She wants something thats a little taboo and she allows herself to experience it.Jack Henry is interesting.He's not your typical alpha millionaire. He gets what we wants but his softer side is also very present from the moment he's introduced. I don't have much to say about him except for the fact that he's a well written compliment to Laurelyn. They are so good together. His interest in her makes him intriguing.I just love how all the cards are on the table and I'm not left upset or completely irritated with any of the characters. I will definitely be continuing the series. This is a good book to read if you just want to indulge without all the drama (there is drama but it's not the sucky kind!).
5	1371513600	I loved it !! This book was truly amazing ! Georgia Cates creates a story about two mature adults who agree to have a monogamous relationship for the next 3 months . After the 3 months are over the plan is for them to go their separate ways . The twist was a kicker ! Jack Henry becomes someone totally different by the end of the book in comparison to who he was at the beginning . I'm not going to spoil it for those who haven't read it . You feel this girl's pain and how she really feels about this guy . It seems so real !!I laughed reading this . I cried , I said OMG !! The sex scenes were HOT !! & boy was there a lot off sex they had . Some parts had me giggling like a school girl . I enjoyed it so much . I read it in a few days considering my work schedule . Thank you Mrs. Cates for creating a wonderful story . I'm so ready for part 2 !! Now reading Beauty From Surrender .
5	1371513600	Just incredible!!!! I'm running to buy the next book now!!! I'm sneaking it on my iPhone during work so I can read it!!!
5	1371513600	Omg!!!! I laughed, cried, and was fanning myself from the hot smoldering scenes. It was really a great book. I love series books and this one I will add to the fav list. I can't wait to read book 2. Kudos to Georgia Cates for writing an awesome book. You will not be displeased with this book at all.
5	1371513600	I really enjoyed this book. I didnt realize it was a cliffhanger but now i'm really really looking foward to seeing what happens next. Lauralyn and Jack have amazing chemistry.
5	1371427200	I loved this book and you will to if you're into redeemable manwhore, alpha males who meets and falls in love with a seemingly innocent young woman.Jack Herny is a rich Aussie playboy and Laurelyn is a country singer from Nashville. They meet while she is visiting Australia with a friend. Their relationship blooms frim then on.Georgia Cates will have you rooting for this couple from the beginning til the end.
5	1371427200	This book I so romantic and so worth every star I gave it. The best romance I've read this year. Even with its twisted plot and a little bit of an Aussie language barrier, it wraps around you heart and pulls you into the story. I want own Aussie millionaire Winslet.
5	1371427200	What a great book! It is a sexy love story the that keep the reader turning the page. Loved it!
1	1371340800	This book was highly erotic and in my opinion should be classified as such.  I must say that I didn't finish the entire book.  I am really not into that style of writing, which is basically pornography.  Didn't like it and would not recommend it!
5	1371254400	This book is amazing!!!! I love reading romance and its the reason why I chose to read this book. I will recommend the book to my friends. From beginning to end is a good read very interesting.
5	1371168000	I am stoked to read the next one..what a great love story!! I could read this over and over...more jack and laurelyn
5	1371168000	This was a great book!  I just might have to read it again. I loved the story and the characters.
5	1371168000	I gave this book five stars!  I think it is so great!!!  Loved the story and can't wait to read the next book!
5	1371168000	OMG what can I say other than this book kicked ass. I so fell for Jack Henry and Georgia Cates sure as hell captured me and made feel all their emotions. LOVE IT when they do that to me. FANTASTIC READ!!!!
5	1371168000	This is one of my favorite stories... I didnt think I was going to like this book when I first started it... but trust me and stick with it.. the Hero is really great!!  The love scenes are simply scorching hot!!  Can't say enough good things about the book and the author.
5	1371168000	A wonderful, romantic story with really salacious love scenes.  Loved the setting in Australia in wine country. The 2 main characters are never boring and the conversations between them are very real and natural. I cried at the end. I've never done that after reading a romance / erotic novel. Get a glass of wine and hunker down in a comfy chair and read it really slowly so you can savor it. I'm starting Beauty from Surrender today!
5	1371081600	I loved this book from beginning to end, so much so that I practically devoured it in one night. I love the characters and how their relationship, complexities, insecurities and endearments unfolded with each chapter. Who wouldn't consider a sexy deal like what Jack was offering...a deal that just kept getting better and better with each layer that was revealed. What a great love story!!
5	1371081600	loved loved loved this book immediately have to read the next book can't put it down!don't care what it costs
5	1371081600	I started reading this book when I was on vacation, and I never put it down till I was finished. I highly recomend it!
5	1371081600	Could not put this one down...not writing. A long review either because I have to dive into the next book! A must read absolutely intoxicating! See for your self!
5	1371081600	I absolutely loved this book! I loved it so much I bought the second book right away, because I couldn't wait to read it, too.It is exciting to see where Laurelyn and Jack Henry's relationship goes. I couldn't put the book down for a second!
5	1370995200	Hands down this book should get a 10. I love the friction between the two and  how they know it as true love that they feel!
4	1370995200	This is a good book and the characters draw you in almost immediately. It leaves you ready for the next book!
5	1370995200	I really loved reading this book and couldn't wait for the second to come out.  Love the two main characters and the journey they go through together.
5	1370995200	I loved this book. If you like fifty shades and crossfire you will love this. I love the set up on how they meet and how long they have a chance to be together. I've read it twice now and it is unforgettable. I love how different it is. it's a must read.
4	1370908800	This was a pretty quick and basic read.  The plot was what you expect after reading the blurb. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters.  The hero is not entirely as alpha as I normally prefer but he's still pretty dominant.  The heroine thinks before she acts and is quite likeable.  I had two pretty big issues with this book and they are solely MY issues (others will likely not agree).  One, I don't like stories where the POV switches around.  While I understand it helps the reader understand more of what is going on, I find it very distracting popping in and out of different heads.  This book switches between the hero and heroine's POV. Also, I really dislike cliffhangers.  There's a doozy of a cliffhanger in this book.  Therefore, I detracted 0.7 stars for each of these issues and 0.1 detraction because it was a relatively simplistic plot/story and gave this book 3.5 stars.
5	1370908800	I couldn't put this book down. Great plot. Excellent character development. All around entertaining. I will definitely read Book #2.
4	1370908800	Didn't want to quit reading.  Kept me interested. Just wished I had the second book right away to see what happened.
5	1370908800	Georgia this was awesome, a must read. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end and could not wait to start the second book. Nothing like a Australian hunk, omg the visual alone was swoon worthy.
4	1370822400	After I started reading this book I could not put it down. I love the story between Jack and Laurelyn.
4	1370822400	I read a lot.  I look for romance with a good story.  Georgia Cates did a fabulous job in creating great characters.  I loved Jack and he was hot.  This is a must read!
5	1370822400	What an enjoyable read. The alternating perspectives of Laurelyn & Jack every other chapter were well written & insightful.  The plot line reminds me of a cliche &#34;vacation fling&#34; but the author does a great job developing the characters & illustrating how Jack & Laurelyn slowly open up to each other & get to know each other.  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!
5	1370822400	Isn't this every girls fantasy?  You go on vacation and meet a gorgeous man by chance (you think), and then find out he chose you to make an off the wall proposition to.  No names, no commitments, no strings, and amazing sex. He promises to make your every fantasy come true if you take him up on it.  At the end of three months you go your seperate ways as if nothing happened.  It had me hooked.  I had to read it to see how this all worked out. I have to admit that a few times I wanted to slap both characters but that just tells you how much I was sucked into their story.  I loved it.
5	1370822400	I enjoy this story so much love between these two especially Jack Henry not even knowing he love Laurelyn from the beginning.
5	1370822400	I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I love love loved it!!!! I loved watching the relationship unfold between Jack Henry and Laurelyn. It does end in a mild cliffhanger, but book #2 is already out!
5	1370822400	Ok!  I see why this book is on the best sellers list!  It's just that good.  I couldn't put it down.  I read it in one day.  Now I'm starting book two and don't care if I get any sleep!Sonya
5	1370736000	I couldn't put this book down. It grabbed my attention from page one and left me wanting more.Laurelyn and Jack make an agreement to have a three month relationship while she is in Australia. Will they be able to end it like planned? Will they fall in love?Laurelyn is in Australia for the summer with her best friend. She is captivated by Jack when she runs into him at a club. She doesn't know who he is and thinks about him till she runs into him again. He then invited her to dinner to make her a proposition. Does she accept it? Can she handle three months with a man she doesn't love? Will she be able to protect her heart?Jack is a very private man. He doesn't like women to know who he is because they try and take advantage of his status. He is the richest most eligible bachelor in Sydney. He knows he wants Laurelyn the instant he sees her on stage at the club. He will do anything to get her to agree to his ways. Will she agree? Can he find love with Laurelyn?What an incredible story of love and how we have no control of how and when it happens. It is an amazingly well written book. I can't wait to read book two!!! This book gets 5 Ah-Mazing stars!!!!
3	1370736000	Ms Cates almost got my four stars for this very engrossing tale.  It seemed to have a FIFTY SHADES air to it and therefore lost a few points on originality.That being said, I am ready to order the sequel and have recommended this book to others.  It's totally enjoyable!
5	1370736000	Wow! What an emotional read!! I couldn't help but falling in love with Laurelyn and Jack Henry's love story!!! One of the most intense love affairs I've ever read! I just read it twice in three days!
5	1370649600	This book was amazing and I could not put it down. It was full of building emotion between the two main characters as well as lots of well written sexy time!
5	1370649600	I really enjoyed the story line. And I don't want to give any spoilers but I could not wait for book #2 to release to see where the story goes.
3	1370649600	This book had so many good reviews that I decided to give it a try despite similarities with 50 Shades of Grey. It definitely pulled me in and was very hard to put down. However, I just couldn't  get past it's glaring similarity to 50 Shades of Grey. It is a quick read and I read the second book as well, but it annoyed me the whole way through because it seems like a knock-off.
5	1370649600	I never write reviews. However,  I made an exception. This book is a 5 stars PHENOMENON! I am in love with their emotionally forbidden, yet inevitable love. It's something I would definitely see myself re-reading or recommending. I can't wait for part 2. Additionally, the growth of her characters are amazing. Jack's unintended love for Laurelyn is what truly captures my heart and makes me feel like true love is something you can't ignore or resist. &#128516;&#128516;&#128516;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;
5	1370563200	This was a great story that left me wanting more.  I couldn't read it fast enough, and I love the relationship between the 2 main characters.  Georgia Cates does an excellent job creating sexual tension, warmth, and emotion between the characters and for the reader.  Looking forward to the second in the series!!!
5	1370563200	I could not put down this book.  The story captured my attention from start to finish!  The romance shared between Jack and Laurelyn was so sweet and it caught me up in its flow.  Wasn't sure I could like Jack at the beginning, but he didn't disappoint me at all.  Although Laurelyn had previously been hurt by love, she was very courageous for being open to this arrangement at the risk of being hurt again.  The cliffhanger got me, but luckily, the second book is on my shelf to read.  Perhaps we'll find out why Jack is so opposed to love in the next book.  I surely can't wait to find out...  I recommend it highly for readers over the age of18.
4	1370563200	She came to Australia to escape the pain of betrayal.  He is a multimillionaire who only has short time relationships where his partner never knows his name.  He sees her and knows that she is to be the next one. She agrees.This is a wonderful adult romance. I enjoyed watching the character's relationship evolve. There are rules but can they change? Can there be beauty in the pain of keeping the promise of the rules.
5	1370563200	Absolutely loved this book! I feel so attached to the characters and I can't wait to continue reading where their story goes from here. I love that it was different and honest. Very little of the 'do I love him? do I not?'. Just loved everything about this book!
3	1370476800	I smiled the entire time I read this book. It was titillating and exhausting to hold my breath after each turn of the page. Very well written....however I can't help to wonder if it's FIFTY SHADES OF GREY fan fiction. It was all too familiar...regardless of the differences in location....but the same sub tense. Tortured billionaire denying falling in love only to fall for the young brunette who makes him take things less serious. Over bearing mothers, promiscuous BFF and the antagonist.
5	1370476800	I really love this book, the characters, the story... I want more!!! I think the cover doesnt make justice... I didnt expect so much from this book but Ive a great surprise. Im a fan!!!
5	1370476800	Amazing, had me in tears on sum parts. Every girl wants that guy who loves her to the core & not afraid to show it!
5	1370476800	This book was Fantastic. Georgia Cates WOWS in the first book in A Beauty Series. One of the better books I have read in this genre. It kept attention and hooked you with the story line. Line and SInker I was invested in the outcome of this love story and it continuously blew my mind. It deserves the five allotted stars plus some.In this story we began with meeting Laurelyn. She is one of my new favorite female characters. She is witty and interesting and I loved her. She is on vacation with her best friend in Australia and "coincidentally" falls into Jacks lap. She is exactly what he has been looking for and yet more. There story is one of love and situational troubles. In a way they are set up to never have the happy ending they are meant to have. You can just FEEL it once you meet them. Its one of those meant to be from the first moment stories. But alas, fate does not shine her hopeful eye on them. They are thrown to the wolves with everything that is put in their paths and it is wonderful to watch them on this roller coaster ride.This book was perfect. It was well written, the characters were developed and people you felt like you knew. The plot had me from this first page. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen. I am on the edge of my chair waiting  for the next book!!! That ending!! It was epic and wonderful and everything I was hoping for with this story. A MUST read for you!
5	1370476800	I've had this book for a while now and finally finished it and I have to say that I was hooked from page one. I highly recommend reading this series :)
5	1370476800	I loved this book. I was searching for something light to read that didn't cost too much and this book has exceeded my expectation. I loved the story and characters I have come to care so much about. It was all well written with very few and minor edit mistakes. I can't wait to read the second book.
5	1370390400	I absolutely love the characters in this story and I fell in love right along with them.  I read this book very quickly and couldnt wait to pick up the next one.
5	1370390400	There is a lot of what we call a smexy in here.  A lot!  What keeps it from being smutty is the great plot.  Jack and Laurelyn are both complex characters with a bevy of issues that plague their lives.Behind all the sex is a sweet romance.  Jack can be demanding but he's not crude or foul about it.I really enjoyed this book and can't wait  to read Beauty From Surrender.
5	1370390400	I just finished reading "Beauty from Pain" and Beauty from Surrender."  I absolutely cannot say enough about these books.  What a great sensuous love story!  I am so glad I bought them both at the same time so I could continue Jack Henry and Laurelyn's story in book 2.  It was an emotional roller coaster!  I experienced tears, laughter, fear and absolutely loved the ending!  I would love to see their story continue.  I really loved the way Georgia Cates continued their story and did not end it abruptly.  Honestly, it was one of the best love stories I have read this year. Make sure you buy them both - you will not want to wait a second before grabbing the second book and diving into it!!!  Wow two great books!!!!
5	1370390400	What starts as a casual 3 month arrangement, develops into a scorching hot love affair.  Jack and Laurelyn come from two very different worlds.  Neither knew they would need each other by the end of their arranged time.  I recommend this book and it sequel Beauty from Surrender as one of the most endearing books you will read this year.
4	1370390400	Finally,  a book I couldn't put down after being destroyed by the Captured books by CJ Roberts!!!  You don't be disappointed!!!
4	1370390400	The only thing that would make this better if it were one book. I am getting tired of always having to buy the next one to get the rest of the story!  Why not wait and put a higher price on it?  So frustrating when you are an avid reader!
5	1370390400	Loved the main characters and the cliff hanging ending. I wasn't sure at first about how they ended up dating, but it wasn't long before I loved them as a couple and could NOT put this book down. I can not wait for Beauty from Surrender. The author nailed this story from the start to finish and every word in between. A must read!!
3	1370390400	This book had a strong start, but kind of petered out at about the 4th chapter.  I lost interest and didn't finish it.
5	1370390400	I really loved this book! I couldn't put it down once I started! I cannot wait to start the next one!!
4	1370304000	I'm very excited to read the sequel that has just come out. Lachlan and Paige agreed to no emotions just a fun, three months and no real personal details on his part...time has a way of changing plans.
3	1370304000	This book shows a lot of Twilight/shades of grey themes. If you enjoyed those you will like this. The smut in this book is not intense like shades of grey but the characters act the same. Dominant male, girl with self esteem issues. Misunderstandings, obsession over how many have been before her....I did enjoy book, and thought it was a good buy for 99 cents.I feel as though we need to warn future authors to avoid the twilight and shades of gray fad so they retain their original idea's and themes, too many romance novels have taken up that banner already.
4	1370304000	I liked this book, it kinda reminded me FSOG, but alot of books these days remind me of that.  Good story, you won't be disappointed!
5	1370304000	That I would find the exact story I needed when I decided to read this one. Fell in love with Jack only about 10 times and only fell out of love with him twice. Thank God the next part of the story is available now. I may not get anything else done as the desire to read book 2 right away,  its just that lovely of a story - strong writing and amazing characters with nothing too over the top in thestoryline- (in fact  this was really well done)  and Ms. Cates dialogue is superbly written. Looking so forward to finding our what's next...
5	1370217600	The characters in this read are very unique to one another, they captured my attention an I fell for their love! I'm excited about reading the second book!
5	1370217600	I loved this book! Definitely a new author for me! Read it, you won't be disappointed.  I have read a lot of romance and this one has a twist that I haven't encountered before... Great read.
5	1370217600	I love them both.  Loved the beginning of the unexpected love story between both characters.  It also just goes to show that men are still out of touch with their feelings until it is too late.  Great book
4	1370217600	This is another recommendation from my co-blogger extraordinaire, and I do have to say I feel bad she has to re-read all of this stuff with me because I am codependent. And being codependent I do thoroughly enjoy reading with her. When she said "You have to read this book!" I asked no questions !1) Laurelyn. So I thought this girl was absolutely nuts. I love me a good story about a youngish girl and the wealthy guy, totally cliche, I know but I like what I like. But this took that whole scenario and did a 180 on me by their entire relationship being anonymous. Yes, I guess it would take the pressure and expectation out of the equation, but I truly know nothing about this anyway since I have been with the same guy since I was 15. I thought sometimes she acted way older than her age because of her current and past experiences. This caused me a lot of feelings of dislike towards Addison. Chick needs to grow up a bit, yes? She was flighty with her treatment of her supposed BFF so I was glad (sorry!) that she wasn't as present in most of the book as I figured she would be. The set up with her sperm donor and mother, and ex-lover was consistent throughout the story, but mostly unresolved so I am thinking we are going to get a lot of information for these plots in Beauty from Surrender. Two other things we love with a passion is the setting in Australia and that this girl is a rocker. Well, country rocker, but musician all the same and I cannot wait for more of that in the next installment!2) Lachlan/Jack. So this successful, handsome man is on one of those "I am not looking for love complexes." Does this get old? No! Want to know why? Because they're going to fall and they're going to fall hard and I for one love reading about it. Usually it's the result of some past trauma or issue, but his biggest problem just seems to be his money and the fact that his father worked all the time. I loved the experiences with his family and one scene especially with his brother and some *ahem* photos. (Isn't that the worst thing ever when you give an inch and people take a mile and start swiping through all of you pics on your phone!) This scene made me laugh so hard. I loved seeing his interactions and his growth as their relationship evolved. Other than that, Jack Henry is the ultimate bachelor and I think he feels this is the only way he can have an intimate relationship and ensure that people don't turn into a gold digger. I have a feeling that one or more of his past relationships are also going to cause a boatload of drama coming up in book two. The end. Oh...Emmm...Gee! Heart shattered for this guy!3) The story. I was so crazy surprised and in love with the depth of the story that is this book. The setting in Australian sucked me in and it talks about all of these beautiful places and wineries. Then, the glam life of going to the Sydney Opera and being wined and dined by this generous man. I loved the Aussie talk and was quite satisfied with the pacing and thought the writing was great. Not to keep kicking the dog repeating stuff that has already been said, but the secondary plot kept things interesting and not all sex all the time. This is my favorite part...when they're communicating and the dialogue is strong and the characters have to deal with issues or just live.4) Cliffy, you suck. I had an idea that there was going to be a cliffhanger since Shelley had read the book before, like I said. I am in denial at this point I think. Thank goodness the second one is already out, because I would be sad to have to wait 6 months or whatever it has been for this one. I don't know how all of you did it, if you're following this series! Just whoa!Just from this one book Georgia Cates will definitely be a frequent flyer on my to be read this! Cannot wait to see what else she has in store for us, besides making us feel like dying! (And if you read the angsty books that I do, you will know that this is the ultimate compliment!)
5	1370217600	I loved this book..I couldn't put it down the moment I started!! If you like hot sex scenes then this book is for you!! REALLY REALLY GOOD I would recommend to all of my friends..
5	1370131200	Wow!  Beauty From Pain is one of the best I have read!  Very Pretty Woman-like.  Jack Henry and Lauralyns relationship starts off a little unconventional but the writing is on the wall- they are meant for each other.  But will the be able to step outside themselves and admit their true feelings?  Cates definitely leaves you hanging!  Must go download Beauty From Surrender!
5	1370131200	This booked grabbed me from the start. I found it hard to put down once I started it. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series.
5	1370131200	This book surprised me, I disliked Jack arrogance so much at the start but feel in love with his gentle manner and romantic manner. Go get your girl
5	1370131200	I totally loved this book...it is exactly what you want to take you away from reality for awhile.  Lucky for me I found this book the day before the sequel came out...because I would have had a very hard time waiting to see what happened...If you love, love stories this is the book for you!  Jack Henry will steal your heart!!!
5	1370131200	This is a great book to read. after the first few pages I could not put it down. great book,
5	1370131200	I was hesitant to read this book because of the title but then my cousin said she had loved it so I read it. It was awesome. The thing I loved most about it is that all of the characters are so well developed that you come to love all of them. Laurelyn & Jack Henry may just be one of my favorite couples ever - their love story is so sweet and the sex is perfect. Buy this series (this is first and the second came out last week) you will love it as much as I did!
5	1370131200	I loved this story. I couldn't put the book down. I love the characters, the story line, the love story!! I can not wait to read beauty surrender!!
4	1370131200	I adore authors who make the effort to write non-American characters believable, particularly in their different vernacular and mannerisms. As an Australian, I applaud the effort Georgia Cates made with Jack and the McLachlan clan, in her stellar novel Beauty from Pain .This book had a very interesting premise. Self-employed, wine maker Jack McLachlan sought females for short term relationships whilst maintaining complete anonymity. At the heart of the it, Jack actually sought love for love's sake, not for his riches, but he didn't acknowledge this. He seemed an old soul, quite mature for his 30 years.Upon his first sighting of musically talented and beautiful Laurelyn Prescott, he fell victim to 'her siren's song' feeling bewitched by her. Little did he know, that Laurelyn had an impressive strength about her, something that would challenge him, perplex him, captivate him.Laurelyn had self-confessed daddy issues and had always felt second to her mother's first love. This resulted in the confident, sassy facade, yet hid a solitary, mature and somewhat untrusting woman. I liked her. I loved her nickname for Jack - caveman. Perfect! She also had me wanting to take up pole dancing. LOL - you'll see why.She was instantly attracted to the sexy, mysterious Aussie, and eventually accepting of his plan. She eventually broke through many of his standard relationship guidelines, with many steamy sex scenes, and many affecting moments, that set it apart from just being another book about hot sex alone.Some events could have warranted expanding, but as a general rule, I found that each situation was justified and not superfluous. This and the splashes of tension, lent to the book's excellent pacing and easy reading. It was emotional and had me laughing, crying and I admit, flushed as well! The sparring dialogue between her and Jack often amused me, and auxiliary characters provided just the right amount of support.Chapters alternated voice between Laurelyn and Jack and were written in first person, present tense. An interesting yet good choice to tell the tale.Overall, I enjoyed Beauty from Pain. Both the cover and the title suited the book's theme and storyline really well. I am so thankful that I bought this when the sequel was already out, because the cliffhanger at the end would have been agonising, had I been required to wait! Phew!Well done Georgia Cates! Well done. I would recommend this to many.
5	1370044800	Great writing style and characters were strong.  The story line kept me going even if there wasn't too much angst in this book.  The "dangling carrot" was to see how far the arrangement would go and looks like we'll get answers in the next book.  My favorite part was the alternating POV' s from Jack and Laurelyn.
4	1369958400	I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I thought Laurelyn was a great female lead. Jack Henry was pretty interesting too, but I really liked Laurelyn; she was strong, funny and likeable. They were both respectful of and kind to each other throughout the book and that was refreshing.
4	1369958400	First read by this author. Enjoyed this roller coaster ride if emotion. Have to purchase second book to see how things work out for Jack & Laurelyn.
5	1369958400	well I've had this book on my kindle since shortly after it came out, kept hearing you need to read it and you need to meet Jack Henry but kept putting it off, so with book 2 coming out and so much hype about it decided to pick this up and read it this week.  Let me just start by saying, OMG, wow what an amazing book, absolutely loved it and LOVED Jack Henry, so glad I read it and was kind of glad that by the time I finished it, only 12 hours later I was reading book two.  ONce I started this book I could not put it down, was truly an amazing readThe book starts off with Lauralyn travelling to Australia with her friend after and is just coming off a bad relationship.  She then meets a sexy aussie, Lauchlan (a.k.a. Jack Henry) who then gives her a propostion to have a three month arrangement no strings attached relationship that will end and she will never contact him again and she will not know his real name.  Intrigued and attracted to him she agrees.Jack McLachlan (aka Jack Henry) is such an awesome character and is now one of my top BBF's.  I loved the relationship he had with Lauralyn, I loved how swoon worthy he was, how well he treated her and the chemistry between the two, I absolutely loved watching the two of them fall in love.This book was truly an amazing read, will definitely be added to the list of top reads for this year and all time favorites.  Yes it has a CF at the end but not one that is not doable, have read so many worse CH.. If you have not read this yet, you definitely need to.  ANd I will be definitely reading more from this author, she seriously has a new fan
5	1369958400	I loved this book to know end. For 99 cents come on.  I read this in one sitting and was sad to see the 2nd book wasnt out yet.  I fell in love with this story..re-read it right before the 2nd came out!  LOVe LOve LOve!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	1369872000	Oh Ms. Georgia Cates.The first thing that comes to mind when I wanted to write this, is that THIS is what Fifty Shades of Grey should have made me feel... without the BDSM. Lochlan and Laureln had an arrangement. 3 months, have fun, the time of their lives. No strings. No real names. No attachment.Granted, I knew from the beginning that one (or BOTH) would develop feelings for the other. It's that way it should be.I loved the change in JHM with her...and how she was different. I loved how he made L feel, like she was special, that she was everything. I LOVED JHM's mother...she cracked me up.Quite frankly, there was nothing that I really disliked about this book -- except perhaps the title. The title confused for me up until about the last 2 chapters or so. As a frequent reader, "pain" to me doesnt necessarily point me to emotional pain. But it fits. Completely. So all my dislikes are completely obsolete.If you buy one book to read this year? Purchase Beauty from Pain (then again...you may just have to buy Beauty from Surrender...I did...)
5	1369872000	I love it!!!!Great sequel!!!!!!!!I couldn' t put it down i read it in one time that how good it is i can not wait for the toher novella is is planning to write in the future
5	1369785600	This book caught me by surprise!  I didn't expect to love it but i did!  Although I saw the reviews about the cliffhanger ending, I was so engrossed in reading I didn't see the end coming!  Next page and ... poof!  Gasping for breath!  I am so relieved to see the 2nd book will be released soon!!
4	1369785600	Will laurelyn change her mind and return to Jack or will he follow her and say he was stupid and he loves her. Tenderly written can't wait for the next one
4	1369785600	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I struggled in the beginning because I couldn't think of one person who would realistically agree to the three month relationship. I may be a touch old fashion, but I didn't find it logical. Once I was able to let it go, I was able to easily connect to the characters and bask in the budding romance. The book progressed perfectly through the three month relationship. Cates skipped over time chunks that wasn't relevant to the story line. I appreciated I didn't have to read every detail about every meal they ate, etc. The ending has a proper cliffhanger and I'm excited for the next book, but I'm not ripping my hair out in anticipation. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes the NA genre. Happy reading!!
4	1369785600	It was a good read.  Could not wait to get to the end.  Waiting for book two! Worth the money.
5	1369785600	I can not wait for the sequel of the story line.  It is a great story line. A SHOULD read.
5	1369699200	I first read this book a few months ago.  I gave it 5 stars then and after rereading it to get read for book 2, I'd give it 5 stars again!  This is a great book.
5	1369699200	Love a book with a sexy millionaire!! Loved everything about Jack & Laurelyn's story. I couldn't put this book down & can't wait for the next book & I'm so glad I don't have to wait long. It's out May 30th...yay!!
5	1369699200	I loved this book read in one day! It's a good read with lots of emotions and sexy scenes. Can't wait for 2nd book:)
3	1369699200	My least favorite thing about reviews is deciding on a title.  I enjoyed the story concept of no strings, time restraints and keeping the identities a secret. I felt Lachlan/Jack Henry was somewhat effeminate in his speech, but that could also be because of the Aussie influence. I enjoyed Paige/Lauralyn but couldn't reconcile her Southern roots with some of the things she said. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how their relationship changed over their time together, though I can't help but feel that part 2 has something sinister in-store. Much as I hate serials, I am waiting with baited breath for the next few days to pass for its release. I would recommend this story for a quick read.
5	1369612800	I can't begin to express how much I loved this book. I do hate cliff hangers though. I'm thankful I waited till now to read it because the next book comes soon! Beautifully written and so unexpectedly gripping! Not to mention red hot!
5	1369612800	I'm so glad to have read this story, I've been wanting to read for awhile. I enjoyed the pace of  story and my heart was breaking knowing their time would come to an end. Can't wait for book 2.
5	1369612800	This is a lovely story balanced with humour, sweetness, and steamy sex.  I'm reading it again as I wait for Beauty from Surrender.
5	1369612800	Love it, love it, love it. Nice story full with hot, steamy sex and an unexpected ending. The best $.99 ever spent.
5	1369612800	Absolutely freaking fantastic story!! I am falling in love with this story!!I really need to read second book. Can t wait!!
4	1369612800	Really enjoyed this book. So glad I don't have to wait long for book #2. The h had a great personality- wish more heroines were like her.
5	1369526400	Hot & sexy story. Looking forward to reading what happens next. I need to write 5 more words before I can download the next book......done!
4	1369526400	Loved the idea of traveling for 3 months with nothing specifically planned and the ability to agree to a 3 month-no strings attached relationship. And it's Australia!
5	1369440000	I so loved this book. It made me laugh and cry and swoon. I cannot wait until Beauty from Surrender comes out. Go get her Jack Henry!!!!
5	1369440000	I loved the way the story developed, how the characters began falling for each other much more believable than most stories in this genre.  It was great having both of their sides of the story as opposed to just his or her perspective.  This has been my favorite read so far this year.
5	1369440000	I love romance novels and this book is great. I enjoyed reading it. keep up the good work look forward to volume 2
5	1369353600	"If I do this, something will go wrong and this man will hurt me. I know it as sure as I'm sitting here next to him feeling how much he makes me want to say yes."Where do I even begin? It is hard for me to remember the last time a book made me this giddy. Now don't get me wrong, I read a lot of books and I love a lot of books. But this is different. I sat at work and couldn't stop thinking about Jack and Laurelyn. My friend had already finished it the day before me so we eMailed, text, and chatted all day about it. I rushed to a quiet spot on my thirty minute lunch break so that I could read as much as possible. I rushed home immediately after work so that I could dive back into their story. Even now that I have finished, I can not get enough of Jack and Laurelyn. I have joined a Beauty From Pain support group on Facebook (no joke), and have found myself slightly obsessed with the teasers and fan art that the author has released. In short... Hello, my name is Christine and I am a Beauty From Pain addict."I didn't love you the day I met you, or even a month later. But somewhere between hello and the goodbye I'm unable to bear.So the question to be asked is, why did I fall so hard in love with this book and it's characters? There is no one real answer to this but I will do my best to explain. Let us start with the location, Australia. This was a nice change of pace from having it set in America; I enjoyed reading about the new locations and places. Also, the pace of the story was perfectly set, and it never felt rushed or hurried. I didn't question the time frame given or the feelings that had developed in that time period. I loved almost all of the side characters, mostly Jack's family. They were warm, loving, and I just wanted to give his mother a big hug."We've shared countless kisses. They were almost always heated and demanding, but this one is entirely different. It tells me things he can't or won't say because it goes against everything he intends for our relationship."However, above all of these reasons, it is Jack and Laurelyn that make Beauty From Pain such an amazing story. I simply fell in love with both of them. I will be completely honest and admit that it is rare for me not to find something annoying with the main female character. There is always some trait or action that causes me to find myself rolling my eyes. This never happened. There was not a single moment where I did not understand why the characters were acting, and or reacting in the way they were. Every situation was handled in an adult manner, and honestly it was the single most refreshing thing I have read in a very long time."She has bewitched me. And I want her. She's the one."It is so easy for adult contemporary romance/erotic novels to fall into the 'same ole same ole', but this story is so beautifully told that even if you look at the synopsis and think you know exactly how it will all play out, trust me... you are wrong. This story has depth that will have you so wrapped up in it, that you will not be able to put it down. In fact, I challenge anybody that would say they even remotely enjoy this genre, to read Beauty From Pain and not love it wholeheartedly. I would have to think it an impossible task. I honestly do not have even one single negative thing I can say about this book."..you don't always know the true worth of a women's love until it becomes a memory."And the ending? Would I classify it as a cliffhanger? Yes and no. Yes, it ends in a location that makes you want to rip your hair out and curl up into a fetal position until the next book is out. But no, because I went in pretty much knowing where the ending was going to have to be. I refuse to give anything away from the story but I think that there is no way that Laurelyn and Jack would ever have been able to have a happily ever after if this book would have ended any differently. This ending can only bring them closer together, and is exactly what they need to move forward.It also helps that book two, Beauty From Surrender, is due to be released on May 30th 2013. So, we do not have very long at all until we get to meet back up with Laurelyn and Jack. I am a on major countdown to this book, and I am already wondering how I am going to concentrate at work knowing that it is sat on my Kindle all day waiting for me to start it..."I've known pain my whole life, but this is a new kind for me. It isn't born of something wrong or ugly. This pain is conceived out of beauty - my love for Jack Henry McLachlan. I embrace it. I clutch it as tightly as I can with both fists because I never want to forget the love I have for him. Loving him will forever be my Beauty from Pain."ChristineRainy Day Reads
5	1369353600	This review and others posted on Schmexy Girl Book BlogBeauty From Pain ...Rocked.  My.  World!!! I bought this book in February and wasn't sure what to expect.  I had never purchased anything from Georgia Cates, and I was in a book rut, so if it wasn't great I wouldn't have been surprised.  Thank you for ending that streak!!  Beauty from Pain grabbed me from the first chapter and didn't let go, I stayed up until 5 am reading.  Typically I'm not a fan of dual POV, I like to be in one persons head and I usually find that I lose some of the story by going back and forth.  I never once felt that throughout the entire book, if anything it helped the story be even schmexier.Laurelyn Prescott needs to get away from her life, and mistakes in Nashville.  Her best friend Addison convinces her to spend 3 months in Australia with her while visiting her brother Ben.  Their first night out they go to a karaoke bar, which is where Jack McLachlan first sees her.Jack is a wealthy, sexy, successful vineyard owner.  He doesn't do relationships (at least not the conventional kind) and is looking for his next "companion".  When he sees Laurelyn, he instantly decides she is exactly who he was looking for."She has bewitched me.  And I want her.  She is the one."Jack believes that because of his fame and lifestyle, having a business deal as a relationship is the least complicated.  He has rules for his companions:No real names.  She calls him Lachlan, and he calls her Paige.Never spend time with outside people.  She will never know anyone who is a part of his life, no family or friends.Time period is established.  She is there for 3 months, so that is their allotted timeI loved their relationship from the very beginning.  Laurelyn is young (22) but she carries herself in such a way I often forgot that. She is playful and feisty, which Jack is not use to, but he finds he enjoys it.  The freedom that they have with each other is really amazing.  They have no pretenses, no expectations of marriage or where is this going. Best part for me was no instant "love"; they just enjoy each other and actually are friends.  Jack is &Uuml;ber schmexy, he is just pure male and says what's on his mind, especially with sex."Right now, all I'm thinking about is how I'm going to get you in my bed so I can show you all the ways I can make you come."Their relationship is really unique, and Jack is often breaking his very strict rules when it comes to Laurelyn.  He finds himself yearning for her, and battling with his own ideals on what their relationship is.  I loved that I can literally pin point where their relationship changed from the "friends with benefits" to an actual love.  Of course they have some obstacles, but they have a true love that was so beautiful.  However, Laurelyn's time in Australia is closing in and Jack has to decide whether he will fight for her and ask her to stay, or let her go.  Overall, Beauty From Pain  made me hot, made me laugh, and made me cry.  I have read it multiple times and am literally counting down the days until "Beauty from Surrender" which is being released on May 30, 2013!
5	1369353600	I could not put this book down. The more that I would read I would continue to want to know more of what was going to happen between them knowing feelings were going to be involved..
5	1369353600	I honestly don't think I can wait until the 30th for part two. I miss lauralyn and Jack Henry already. I hate the cliffhanger but I love that I got lost in th  book and was able to escape reality
5	1369353600	I would like nothing better to give this author 10 stars.The journey that Laurie and Jake take is an awesome read. What starts off as a simple game of a 3 month relationship somewhere took off too more than that. Too bad that Jake didn't listen to his heart sooner. I wasn't happy about Laurie actually getting up the nerve to walk away either. But in the end I hope to god she made the right decision. I know this is only book 1 but I couldn't put this book down so what will happen when book 2 comes out..Oh boy another day of pure reading yeah..Really this author made the book seem so real..I kind of was hoping that Jake would have somehow beaten her to LAX in the end. I mean he has his own personal jet. But then again what mystery would that be?Well instead of reading my simple review you should just go buy this book right now and sit back for a laugh out loud, cry out loud, scream out loud book. Tissues on standby for sure.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did reading it. I have read it twice now since getting the book..Yeah
5	1369353600	O so excited to see what happens next. Good thing I only have a few days to wait. He should have to wait to find her though he needs to suffer a little for not telling her her loved her soon enough.
4	1369267200	I wasn't so sure about this book at first. But I kept reading and LOVED IT. And the the ending.....REALLY....Looking forward to the next one in this series.
5	1369267200	I truly enjoyed this book.  Laurelyn was breath of fresh air, not a weak, clingy, damsel in distress waiting for her knight in shining armor to solve all her problems in life.Although I would have loved for Jack to realize his feelings a bit earlier and the final scene to have play out a bit differently I was very much awed by her strength and determination.I didn't read the excerpt for book 2 since (keeping my fingers crossed) it will be out in a week and there is so much more to be said for both Jack and Laurelyn, I have no doubt that it will be as good if not better than this installment.
4	1369267200	This book did not blow me away,but it is definitely entertaining. At first, I thought OMG, this story is ridiculous. This is not even remotely realistic. As time progressed, I could understand why Jack wanted these types of relationships. To protect his himself from gold diggers. He didn't think this thing through though. The first thing I thought when he said they would not share names was what if they ran into someone who knew him, wouldn't they say his name.I liked Laurie, she seemed like a real person. She agreed to this strange arrangement, and I knew that she would fall in love with this guy. Hell, I did. I also knew that his feelings for her were very strong from the beginning because of the way he thought of her. And from the way he felt about Ben.I absolutely do not like reading books that are in a series until all of the books have been written because I do not like waiting for the next book. I didn't realize this book was part of a series. If I had known, I wouldn't have read it yet. The cliff hanger is too much. The author says the next book will be out in May, but it is my experience that author's aren't that good at predicting when the next book will be out. They are artists after all.
5	1369267200	Loved everything about the book. Thought laurelyn reacted perfectly to everything in the story. Jack Henry is smokin and I can't wait for him to find her in book 2!
5	1369267200	Beauty from Pain is a wonderful story of two people who set out to have a three month relationship. Laurelyn has traveled to Australia with her best friend, Addison, for three months. Laurelyn is escaping from a painful relationship and isn't really interested in men right now.Jack McLachlan is wealthy man. Jack is also very private. He looks for women to fulfill a very specific role in his life for a set timeframe and to accept the parameters of the relationship he's offering. He prefers these types of arrangements as a way to protect himself.These two have share an amazing chemistry. Even though Jack always keeps his companions separate from anything related to his business, he doesn't keep those same boundaries with Laurelyn. She's different from all of the others for him and he ends up breaking all of his rules for her. I love how Jack is able to listen to Laurelyn and provide her comfort without judgment. He struggles to stay away from her.Mother and daughter relationships can be very difficult and that's true of Laurelyn and her mom. It's interesting to see how Laurelyn relates to her mom during their phone calls and their differing ideas of how Laurelyn should approach her chosen career.He's very generous and has a wonderful family. It's great to see that he comes from such a normal family, but I wonder what secrets he's hiding. There has to be a reason why he pursues these types of arrangements, but that question really isn't answered.This relationship became more than either envisioned. When Laurelyn's time in Australia comes to end, are they both ready to let go?Beauty From Pain is really well written with great characters. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to read the next part in Beauty From Surrender!
5	1369180800	Great read, just wish I didn't have to wait so long for the second book to come out! Very romantic couple. Can't wait to see what happens when he chases her to the US and to see if her music career has taken off!
5	1369180800	This is must read! It captures your interest from page one!!!!! I was disappointed when it ended! Can't wait until May 30 to buy the next edition! Hope I will be able to find it! Brilliant work Ms Cates!
5	1369180800	Imagine me lying on the floor kicking and screaming, "I WANT BOOK 2. RIGHT THIS SECOND, RIGHT NOW." That, my friends, is me throwing a temper tantrum. If I didn't love my Kindle so much I would have thrown it at the wall when the book ended so freaking abruptly. I kept staring at the last page trying to wish for one more chapter.I really fell in love with this Laurelyn and Jack! Hard! This was a really refreshing read, because it was not a love at first sight read. An attraction at first sight maybe, but not a case of the insta's. The relationship builds throughout the book as the characters are in their 3 month companionship agreement (not as bad as it sounds!). At first I thought I was going to think that Jack was a major bad boy making a ridiculous request of Laurelyn, but for some reason he never really seemed all that bad to me. You can see through his shell to all the goodness underneath. He's my new book boyfriend. Totally crushing over here.So, their relationship starts while Laurelyn is visiting Australia fresh from a heartbreak with a guy that totally led her on and lied to her. She's from Nashville (my home!!) and she is pursuing a music career. Their first encounter happens when Jack see's Laurelyn singing. I LOVEDLOVEDLOVED all the music mentioned in the book! I was so excited when Dave Matthews "Crash into Me" was mentioned. There were some pretty unique songs mentioned in the book, like Laurelyn singing "Whatever you like" by TI (out of curiosity I looked up a girl cover on that on youtube and it was good!). Laurelyn has lived a life where she has hardly ever been placed first and has been through her fair share of pain. Even though loving Jack is tough for awhile, she realizes that the pain is coming from somewhere good, somewhere beautiful.It definitely leaves you with a little bit of a cliffhanger, but it's bearable with the excerpt from the next book at the end. I have faith :)
5	1369180800	I loved the suspense and drama of this book. This is a must read for those who like drama, sex, and love.
5	1369180800	I am becoming skeptical when purchasing an ebook, because most 5 stars should be negative 3 stars. So I am now submitting on my faves. I actually started cussing when I finished this book. Because I was so upset that I have to wait 1 week for the next book. I LOVED Lachlan. I loved Laurelyn. It was a hot read and most of us girls from the south can relate to Laurelyn. I can not wait til next week to see what Jack Henry(Lachlan) does.
5	1369180800	This is the best book I've read in awhile. It's like Fifty Shades minus the s&m (but including love scenes), and a likeable Ana. I finished this book in one day I could not put it down!
5	1369094400	I really loved this book. It's simply in its love story, without all the overly graphic sex scences. It was just a beautiful love story, well written and easy to fall into.
5	1369094400	Great story and I like the way it was told with almost alternating perspectives from the mans view in one chapter and continued with the womans in the next.  I could not put the book down.  When I bought the first book, I did not realize that the second was not yet written.  I HATE getting into a story and getting hooked and then finding out that it may be MONTHS before I can know the whole story.  There needs to be a system to pre-order continuing stories so that they don't get forgotten or missed when released.
5	1369094400	Great book to read. You will not be disappointed. I would recommend this as a great summer read for all ladies.
5	1369094400	OMG! I loved this book.  It had me captivated from beginning to end.  I can't wait for the next book!  Well worth the money.
5	1369094400	WOW...just WOW!!  I don't know how she does it,  but this book is almost too much (I said almost)!!  Lauralyn and Jack Henry are a match made is heaven.  Really makes u wish you could find guys like him in real life.  Her characters are so believable.  Their situations and encounters feel so natural, not forced.  They relate to each other on a level that most authors can only dream about.  Georgia Cates has a very, very, very bright future if she can keep writing books like this.  Thank GOD I only have a few more days for the release of the next book in this series.
5	1369094400	I was apprehensive about this book bc of the title... didn't want it to try to be like a Fifty Shades. Loved this book... hot, steamy, romantic and has a story!  Definitely will not be disappointed... give a read!
4	1369094400	I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Sure,there were lots of steamy sex scenes, but there was actually a fairly decent story line that was well written from both the male and female POV. We saw a millionaire hero with serious trust issues try to guard his heart by continually playing a dumb game in order to satiate his carnal needs. We also saw an emotionally damaged heroine slowly chip away at the walls he built up around his heart, only to see them ultimately crash down on him. I only wish the book was longer and didn't have a cliff hanger. Thankfully, the next installment comes out next week. If you are looking for a YA story with romance and angst, read this. I woud definitely read more from this author.
5	1369008000	I am glad that I only have a few days to wait until the next installment of this series!  WOW...the story is just amazing.  The story flows so well and the characters I am just in love with!  Kudos to this series
5	1369008000	I loved how the story started out, definitely got my attention from the start. There were parts of the story I was disappointed in the main character for settling for less but it kept me reading. I'm left waiting for the next book, I can't hardly wait.
5	1368921600	I loved this book, I enjoyed the charachters,  loved the songs and the music in it, can't wait to read more about this story in the next beauty book.
5	1368921600	Awesome book. A little disappointment it will be continued in another book but looking forward reading the sequel.  I hope it ends with the next book.
5	1368921600	I wasn't sure if Georgia Cates could pull off the dual perspectives but I was very happy to see she did and quite well! Loved this book and only hope she can take us somewhere good with the next installment.
5	1368921600	The author did a wonderful job with taking the reader through an emotional roller coaster ride of emotions. My heart leaped inside and I couldn't breath when Lauralyn poured her heart out to Jake. I can't stand the anticipation before I know what happens t.
5	1368921600	So good. You have to read this book. It is kind of like fifty shades of grey . But nicer lol. Can't wait for book two
5	1368921600	I bought the book by curiosity. It's not usually my first choice for genre. However, after reading a few chapters I realized I couldn't stop. I even read in the car while my hubby was driving. I was a little disappointed to see it end this way but I am looking forward for the next one in the series.Definitely will buy when it comes out.
5	1368921600	I absolutely loved this book. While many of the themes and storyline were similar to others in the genre I was definitely drawn to the main character being a strong woman who wasn't just going to be pathetic when the storyline took the obviously but well written turn. Looking forward to book #2
4	1368921600	Love the book from the beginning to end. To feel in love is easy staying in love is hard part.
5	1368835200	You know how sometimes books sit on your kindle and then when you get to read them, you want to punch yourself in the face for not reading it sooner? Yep. This was one of those books for me. I'm a fan of Cates' writing, so I knew I would like it, but I didn't expect to be fully immersed into the story. Needless to say...I loved it.I liked Laurelyn almost immediately. She isn't a 'simple' character. She's had an interesting life and she also has a broken heart she's tyring to mend. How does she do that? She decided to go on vacation with her best friend to Australia. While there, she meets Jack. They begin a relationship, but there are restrictions. They will date for three months and their identities will remain a secret. Jack has had relationships like this in the past and it's always worked out well. This time, it's not quite so simple.Jack is a multi-millionaire. He's listed as one of the most eligible bachelors in Australia. He tries to keep his private life...well, private, but that can often be challenging. When he first sees Laurelyn, she is exactly what he wants. Jack isn't the kind of guy that falls in love easily. However, over the course of the few months that Jack and Laurelyn are together, they do fall in love.Do you want to know about the sex? Well, it was pretty darn hot!!!!! Jack is super sexy, so I knew that the sex scenes would likely be hot. It's not even that they were kinky or that Jack was a dirty talker. They just had such great chemistry that the sex scenes were a huge turn on. Definitely a panty soaker level 4.Overall, I loved this book. I'm so anxious for the second book to release at the end of this month. So, actually...maybe I was smart waiting to read it, because now I have a shorter wait. If you like sexy, intriguing books, definitely check this out!
5	1368835200	Amazing intriguing and HOT!! I was just so disappointed to learn there is more...... can't wait for the next adventure. I will even pay full price.
5	1368835200	Loved the beginning. This book is full of personally. Loved the slang. Read in only 3 sittings. Super excited to see what is next for these two.
5	1368835200	Will try nit to spoil it here. I saw it coming like a train wreck but I kept reading. Damn. I just want to smack a dude. For once say what you feel damn the consequences. Read it ladies....it's funny sad and with lemons thrown in. :-)
2	1368835200	I would have given this book five stars for the story alone.  It was a great story that kept me interested from page one. I liked that it switched from Laurelyn and Jack's point of views and that it let you know at the beginning of each chapter who's view the chapter was about.  My biggest frustration was that nowhere in the product discription does it tell you that to read their whole story you will have to purchase more that one book.  The fact that it is called the beautiful series doensn't help because this could mean that each book is about a different set of people.  I had really gotten into the story and was expecting resolution and instead get wait until the next book.  I am aggravated right now I could scream.  This is not the first book that I've purchased like this and I'm really tired of it.  At least tell me when I'm purchasing the book that if I want the whole story I will have to purchase more than one book.
3	1368748800	It took me awhile to get into this book. I liked the characters, I liked the proposition, and the fact that Laurelynn was in another country. Who hasn't wanted to go on vacation and have a sexy affair no strings attached? But it just didn't grab me. I'm not sure why. Maybe the fact that Jack was adamant about the terms of the "relationship" but almost immediately breaks his rules. I loved Laurelynn. She was the right combination of sass and sweetness. She didn't just melt at this feet, she made him work for it. Jack was sexy and kind. I even like the secondary characters. Jacks family, especially his mom and brother were great characters.I got into it just as it was ending, but I didn't know it was ending. It ends right in the middle of the story!!!!! I wanted to scream and throw a fit. Why, why, why would end it in the middle? Overall, I enjoyed it. Will I read the second book? I'm not sure. I'd like to know what happens with Jack and Laurelynn, but I don't absolutely have to know.
4	1368748800	I loved the story line. The plot was superb. The scenes could have been more detailed without becoming redundant. However, I would highly recommend this book. I am anxiously await book two.
5	1368748800	This was an amazing love story! Jack Henry and Laurelyn are great characters and I can't wait until the next book comes out so I can read about their happily ever after!
5	1368748800	I have so enjoyed reading this book. I am looking forward to the second book to coming out at the end of this month. You will not regret buying this book.
5	1368748800	I Loved, loved, loved it.  It was sweet, steamy, sexy and romantic all in one. Love the rich bad boy turn sweet by a woman. Please publish Beauty from surrender quickly.  Can't wait!
5	1368748800	Very very worth the read.Suspensful, witty, romantic even though it isn't supposed to be. Easily one of my favorites.
5	1368748800	Beautiful love story!  I love Jack Henry and Laurelyn,  This is a definite must read for anyone looking for a love story that can blossom without warning and signifies what real love should look like.
5	1368748800	Omg I need to read  Book 2 and I need it like yesterday.Book 1 was amazing and I Def recommend it!
5	1368748800	This one just kept pulling me in! I couldn't put it down!  It is a great book! I am ready for book two to come out!!
5	1368662400	I can't believe I have to wait until May 30th to find out what happens next!! Man!Jake is a multimillionaire who owns the largest vineyard company in Australia. Laurelyn is a talented country singer from the states who went to Australia because of a stupid guy who broke her heart.At first when I started to read this book it reminded me of Fifty shades a little and that bothered me. But after continuing the book, I fall in love with it! There is no bsbm in it which made me like the book even more because must books now a days are starting to have bsbm; my guess just to sale more books. But that's be sides the point. GREAT BOOK!I like Jack but what an idiot!! Laurelyn is everything he never knew he wanted!! I need to know what's going happen in the states when Laurelyn gets back because she is definitely going to run into Blake.
4	1368662400	I ENJOYED THE READ AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ MORE FROM THE AUTHOR. YES!
5	1368662400	Wasn't sure what this book was going to be like when when I read about but I bought it anyway and OMG I couldn't put this one down. Jack is one of my favorites and Laurelyn I loved her too she was a strong woman New what she wanted as he did of course. It was my first book by Georgia Cates and I can't wait for next one!!!I
2	1368662400	The story was enjoyable, but I had no warning I'd have to buy and read at least one more book (or more?) to get to the end of the story.  No thanks. It should have been billed as an incomplete story. I don't have time to read more so I'm just left unsatisfied, unhappy, and poorer.
5	1368576000	Beauty from Pain (Beauty Series) by Georgia CatesI wish I could give this book 6 stars. This is a great contemporary romance. The premise is a bit unusual but thoroughly enjoyable.The hero and heroine both have issues. Laurelyn, the heroine, is someone I think most of us can identify with whether we had great parents or not so great parents. I think we all know someone like Laurelyn. I felt her pain, her stubbornness, her restlessness to get away and do something completely out of character for her. I really identified with the character of Laurelyn.The hero, Jack, well, I think most of us can understand Jack as well. The only difference is, he is very wealthy and so has been able to go to some extremes you don't normally see in order to prevent getting too close to women. But then, the women he's been with are... pretty much only after his money.Jack, the Aussie... and can't you just imagine how delicious he sounds? Jack meets Laurelyn, a southern girl from the US who is in Australia for three months. Though he usually only makes "arrangements" for three or four weeks, he makes a deal with Laurelyn for the entire three months she will be in Australia.I think a part of why Laurelyn accepts Jack's offer is because her best friend's brother is really interested in her and she's just into him. But she does like Jack. Coming out of a bad relationship (her only one), she decides to spend the three months with Jack, but not for his money. Indeed Laureylyn's biological father, the one she calls the "sperm donor" is a country music star, she is not after money.I think she just wants to have a relationship where the rules are known up front. I can see how the relationship she enters with Jack would be a comfortable change for her. The story really lets me understand her character enough to buy into that.Meanwhile, the relationship is... hot. There is a lot of sex. These are among the best written sex scenes I've ever read. This is not sex for the sake of... "well, here on page whatever, we need a sex scene", but instead they are totally believable between the hero and heroine. They are not boring.Honestly, I read a lot of romance and sometimes just sort of glance through the sex scenes. After a while, they can get old. The sex scenes in this book seem to naturally flow.I hate to give away spoilers in a book but... I love the ending of this book. I loved it. I know there had better be another book to finish this story but, the ending was... justifiable.I despise wimpy heroines who give up all their ideas, principles and ethics over one kiss. Those stories are just unbelievable and I hate to waste my time reading those. This story is one that I'm glad I spent the time to read.There are many things left unanswered in this story and I know there better be another book to finish this story!In fact, I think the second book is due out at the end of this month. I'm glad I don't have to wait very long.This is a great romantic story and I recommend it without hesitation. The characters are wonderful and both the characters and the story line draw you in. Georgia Cates has done an excellent job with this book. I wish I could give it six stars.
5	1368576000	This was such a great book, the only downfall was that it is a cliffhanger. I was so upset when I got to the end and it wasn't the end, it was a ... Now I have to wait 2 weeks for the next one in the series.I do have to say that I loved the story between Jack and Laurelyn and I thought the book was well written minus the common grammar and editing mistakes that are found on Ebooks. I recommend this book to any romance reader out there.
5	1368576000	This book was an excellent read.  She leads you slowly and deliberately thru their meeting to the realization they are in love and too late to get it together at the same time.  Will they find their way back to each other?
5	1368576000	I loved it. I like the alternating POVs gives you more insight on what's going on in the heads of both characters. This is a series so there was a cliffhanger but luckily for me the next book comes out in two weeks. It was sweet and touching regardless of the &#34;agreement&#34;. You never know when you'll fall in love. :)
4	1368489600	Just awesome I would recommend reading this it is great wanna read more love love love this book I thank my friend for telling me about it
4	1368489600	Seriously!!!!! I was so into it I didn't realize I was at the end. Then you just leave me hanging like that. Omgosh I'm so bumbed right now I can't stand it. I want more.. I'm so glad it's May and the next book is due out soon because I'm already anxious and on pins and needles waiting.
5	1368403200	Great story to the end of the book.  You'll be excited for the sequel.The characters are fun and realistic.  Can't wait to see where the next book takes theirstory.  After I read it, I gave to my daughter to read as well.  She really enjoyed it, also.
5	1368403200	I Loved the story can't wait for book 2 I am ashamed to say I let it sit in my que a little longer than I should've but very glad I read it would love to see these two get there HEA
5	1368403200	You should definitely read this! I just can't believe how much I loved this! I am amazed at how i find these treasures of books on here! If you found this book and found this review, then read this book! Other books I loved include Collide (Vol. 1), Indelible Love both Jake and Emily's stories, Twilight, Beautiful Stranger, Beautiful Bastard, Fifty Shades, and Wallbanger.
5	1368403200	I really liked this book, and would  let other know about it.I hope there is a sequel to it.  I will look forward to seeing that
5	1368316800	Every once in a while, you read a book that wraps its arms around you, pulls you close and refuses to let you go. That's what Beauty From Pain did to me. This was an excellent read from the first word to the last...and I simply cannot wait to get my greedy little paws on the next book in this series. I completely fell in love with Laurelyn and Jack. I adored how Ms. Cates developed both of her characters and forced me to fall in loved with them. Why do I say forced? Because I had convinced myself I was going to despise Jack. I made up my mind I was going to hate his guts for what he was doing to the sweet and lovely Laurelyn. But did I? Absolutely not. I am in love with him more than ever. And I'm dying to know what has happened to him to make him hide himself from women. What is his deep secret that he's afraid to share? Georgia, you have outdone yourself on this one and far surpassed any expectations I could have had for this story. In fact, this is one of the best books I've read this year. Thank you SOOO much! Now, get off Facebook and start writing faster because I want more adult contemporary romances from you!
4	1368230400	Well, this is an interesting book.Jack McLachlan is a 29 year old, rich Australian bachelor, who does not do normal relationships. He has decided to however change his own rules and to spend some month with a woman, both remaining incognito to each other, so that she cannot follow him after they split. They would be enjoying the time they spend together, no names, no strings attached, without falling in love, without games and pretenses. When he is looking for the perfect woman he meets a 22 year old American girl, Laurelyn, who first resists him, but attraction and his charm win her finally over.First of all I expected due to its title and its cover an erotic BDSM story, which it is not, erotic yes, but DS no.Secondly: Some days ago I was disappointed by another book explaining to my friend that I am fed up with romances were the two simple immediately fall in love, can't resist each other or are mates or are victims of any other type of irresistible attraction. I just find this too easy. Now this is what irritated me. At one point throughout the book I had the impression that things just went to slow between Laurelyn and Lachlan, there was a lot of sex, plenty of everyday life activity, no real dramatic event or twist in the story, everything went quiet until the last pages. This is when I thought; well this is what I was looking for: a realistic tale about two people falling slowly in love.I liked the characters; their honesty was refreshing and enjoyable. Both characters are straight forward and nice, a lot of their relationship is sexual, but also fun and nice.Yes the story lacked rhythm and events, but still the last pages, her letter more specifically made me cry. Maybe  because some of the story reminded me things that I have already felt. So this is good, isn't it. Touching strings of feelings makes a romance good in my opinion.The story was no real innovation, but was nice. It was told from the POV of both characters one after the other and both were realistic.Now the next step would be her next book. In about 15 days on the 30th of may 2013 pain from surrender should be published. I expect it not only because of the cliffhanger at the end of this book, but also because I am curious how Mr. Cates is going to continue this story, in the expected way or is she going to surprise us?If you like a realistic story with a lot of sex and honesty, try this one;Enjoy the read and feel free to comment. MBTM
5	1368230400	I didn't think I was going to like this book, bought it on a whim because I needed something to read during my commute time.  I read this in record time, I loved it and can't wait for the next installment.  It has some of the feeling as 50 Shades of Grey but not as erotic.  Good story and very entertaining reading.
5	1368230400	I would recommend this book to anyone.  It starts out very similar to fifty, but quickly turns into more.  The second book comes out May 30, and I've already pre-ordered it!
5	1368144000	I loved this book..................and I hate the way it ended.  How could you leave us readers hanging like that.  I can't wait for the next book  I really really enjoyed the first one
4	1368057600	Sometimes a book surprises you and takes a hold, then knocks you off your feet. That's what is book did to me. I never wanted to put it down. Jack is so swoon worthy.  He really know how to treat a lady. Laurelyn is sexy, sweet and playful. She knows how to get to a man's heart. The internal dialog with the characters is great.  The story was perfectly paced. As you read you can feel every emotion they do... at one point,  I had tears running down my face. Only a great book can achieve real emotions. The cliffhanger ending killed me. I want more. Now! Very much looking forward to the next book.
5	1368057600	I'm a major romance reader loved this book wish the second book was out already! My book club enjoyed it too
3	1368057600	I quite enjoyed this story for what it was. A very quick read that didn't hurt emotionally and was just an easy way to pass time. Nice for when you're looking for a story that's not intense but takes you away for a bit. Everything happened very quickly and it was quite predictable but the protagonists were likeable. May or may not read the next book in the series.
4	1367884800	Can't believe I fell for a cliffhanger... AGAINBut it was worth it.Great characters.Great storylineGreat ChemstryGreat read!
5	1367884800	This book I could not put down! I am patiently waiting for the second book to come out at the end of this month.
5	1367884800	Really enjoyed this book.  It is pretty well written, the characters are very interesting and the story draws you in.  Can't wait for the next one!
5	1367884800	To explain how much I loved this story is to put it in this form, I can't even figure out what to say in this review because I loved it so much!  I'm speechless.  First the agreement, making everything feel flawless with no worries to having a couple bumps in the road and then the breaking rules. I can't wait for number two I have to see what happens between Jack Henry and Laurelyn.
5	1367798400	This book is really good and I look forward to book 2. I loved Going Under from Georgia Cates too! Everyone can relate to the characters. Well written.
5	1367712000	Although the premise is not new, this story was very good. I had a very hard time setting it down.
5	1367712000	Such a good book. Turned into a romance novel mixed with erotica. Recommend this to everyone who loves romance noves
5	1367712000	Loved this book it was awesome. I'm so glad I went in knowing I had to wait for book 2 otherwise I would have been upset when I got to the end. I dont' want to say too much about the book as I don't want to spoil it for anyone. This is one I would recommond as a must read. The end of the month needs to hurry up and get here so I can read book 2
5	1367625600	I am left wanting to know the outcome of Jack Henry and Laurelyn. I can't wait for Beauty fro Surrender.
5	1367625600	Loved this book!! Love the characters names Jack Henry and lauralynn:) great love story that you can't put down!! Super excited for the next book to see what happens next!
2	1367625600	I don't actually remember the plot,which doesn't happen often even with the books I dislike,so I would just say that may it is a good book,but doesn't speak to my heart!
4	1367539200	I really liked this story. I enjoyed the 2 main characters point of views, and I thought that they had good chemistry.I also liked the idea of this story. It is different from the other stories that are out there. The one thing that I didn't love was how it ended. It was somewhat abrupt. I look forward to book two though to see how their story continues.
4	1367452800	This was my first book by this author to read. I was unable to put it down. Ended up reading in one night.
5	1367452800	Loved it. Can't wait for the next book to be released. One of the best books I have read recently.  Great read.
5	1367452800	OMG!!!!! I just finished this book and I've NEVER been so excited for a book to come out in my whole book nerd life lol. Georgia Cates has absolutely become one of my favorite authors her work is like just so fricking good!!! Now Laurelyn is such a well written character! Like I LOVED her and what she did in the ending of the book!!! OMG!!! She just was not the typical chick or main character that I'm used to reading about. She is indeed a woman of her word and you can't do anything but respect and love her for that. Jack too is also a well written character and he is a man with a plan that sticks to what works. He is very forth coming and straight to the point.......well until it comes to his mom. But he is such a lovable character and I just can't wait for May 30th to get here! The Christmas gift was wonderful and sweet but I will admit I saw it coming though. That fricking Ben is a mess and such a bish made male smh I don't know who would ever wanna date him he is either blind or clueless lol. That mutha fricking Audrey!!! Ugh! She is a real nut case and my jaw dropped at what she did to Laurelyn! The beach scare was the defining moment for _____ to me in the book lol the club scene with the swingers was pure comedy until ish got "real" lol! OMG! What Jack's ____ whispered into Laurelyn's ear was so informative and I was all giddy lol. But O.M.F.G!!!!!!!!!! When the Jack said "Say My Name" scence happen *swoons* (once you read the book you will understand) THAT part right there is enough alone of a reason to GET.THIS.BOOK! The storyline was amazing, the character development was amazing, the bond between the characters and us readers was sooooooooo there! Stop reading and GET.THIS.BOOK.LIKE.NOW lol you won't regret it at all. I don't hand out to many 5 stars so when I do then the book is a MUST read!Sent From My iPad2
5	1367452800	It was a great book! But I hate waiting for the second book! It took me less than 2 days to read it! So now I have to wait! Please hurry!!
5	1367366400	This was the best book I have read so far this year. At first I thought Jack was going to be twisted and dark. I absolutely love Jack. He was just trying to protect his privacy and his heart. Laurie was sweet but poor. I loved both characters . I can not wait for book two. Jack better come correct and not play a single game. He was the f#!$ up in this story. The female character gave her heart freely.
5	1367366400	Their love story is so precious. I love how in love they are from the very beginning, yet they have this expiration date and vow to appreciate every moment. You really feel everything because of this intense situation and complicated love. Can't wait for the next one!
5	1367280000	Love the book could not put it down....Love the characters so moving....wanted to cry at times .....Cannot wait for the next book to come out.....
4	1367280000	Jack is a millionaire, owning several vineyards throughout Australia - you know he must have a super hot accent! Laurelyn is a singer from Nashville traveling to Australia for only 3 months. Jack's idea is to make arrangements for a short period of time, don't exchange names or anything personal, to have a companion for basically sex. This is the arrangement he offers to Laurelyn & she accepts, the benefits for Laurelyn being she can share many of the secrets of her troubled past, secrets she's never talked about with anyone but she isn't trying to impress Jack since they aren't in a relationship. Jack is surprisingly a good listener & over the 3 months they become very close. I can't wait for the second book because there are a lot of unanswered questions - Jack has companions from his past who seem to want to cause him harm, Laurelyn wants to be a star & doesn't seem to want Jack's money, and most of all what is Jack's problem with relationships, marriage & children? I loved the way their arrangement develops into the most real relationship either one of them have ever had, but sadly time is up. Can't wait to find out what happens after Laurelyn returns to Nashville!
5	1367193600	Wow this book was so powerful. Jack is a uber rich man who has issues with commitment and never plans on love.Laurelyn is a sweet spirit and isn't planning in finding love anytime soon, but somethings are inevitable. This story is so beautiful and emotional.I could literally feel this couple falling in love and the emotional end was amazing! I am hooked and can't wait to see where book 2 will take me. I absolutely loved the author's style and amazing ability to show the emotion in this story.
5	1367193600	Definite 5 star read!  Loved Lauralyn and Jack Henry.  This is one of my favorite books I've read this year. Great story line, flowed beautifully, loved everything about it!  Can't wait for the sequel.
5	1367193600	This story is so romantic. Lauralyn and Jack are meant to be together. Their three months together seemed like years. They share such wonderful times together. If only he would have said "I love you too". I cried at the end when he decides to go home and tell her what he feels to find that she is gone. And the letter just made me cry even more. I hope he finds her to bring her home. They need  to be together. I can't wait till the next book. May 30th needs to hurry
4	1367107200	I cannot wait to see what happens next. I have a great deal of empathy for the both of them. Beautiful.
5	1367107200	I loved this book. I like to call it a twist of fifty shades meets pride and prejudice for the fact that it may have started out with a big shot millionaire with a deal but came out as a passionate love story.  Highly recommend!
5	1367107200	Typical. This is just so damn typical of my life in the reading world these days. Yes, I am referring to myself, not the book. BEAUTY FROM PAIN is a far from typical romantic story with a wonderfully unique premise. What's typical then? I'll tell you what's typical, the lack of resolution, the dreaded cliffhanger that has my soul in knots wanting to know the rest of the story.BEAUTY FROM PAIN is a beautifully written, all engrossing story that explores the journey of a relationship that begins as a no-string-attached fling but ultimately blossoms into something else entirely.Laurelyn Prescott escapes her life as a musician in Nashville, with her best friend, to the "Land Down Under." She is hoping that Australia will help mend her broken heart after suffering a nasty break-up and she plans to do this without the help of any man. That's the plan, or at least it WAS the plan, until Mr. Secret Sexy-Man makes her an offer that's almost too good to refuse... but she has to refuse, right? That's when her spunky and carefree BFF steps in and speaks these awesome words of wisdom: "The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else." Well, I couldn't have said it better myself!Jack McLachlan is, by Laurelyn's description, "hotter than the devil's ass" and also happens to be a very successful owner of multiple vineyards across the South Pacific and Europe. Needless to say, he is a wanted man, but he has issues of his own that prevent him from opening his life and his heart to any woman. In order to protect himself from the complications (that he perceives) women bring to romantic relationships, he has devised a foolproof plan that has worked for several years - anonymous encounters lasting weeks or months, only promising to provide hot sex and the best life has to offer during their time together.Pffft! Sexy smokin' hottie + the time of my life = SOLD! Where do you want me? On my back or my knees - hell, I might even let a man like that strap me to a St. Andrews Cross, but, no worries, there's no cross or crop to be seen in this novel.BEAUTY FROM PAIN is chock full of subtle humor, sexy characters and great one-liners. I even picked up my new favorite phrase--"slut button" Oh! I am soooo using that one again! This is far from being author Georgia Cates' first book, but it's a first for me by this author and you can bet a "roo's ass" (love that) that I will be snatching up more of her work and stalking the release of the next book in the BEAUTY series.Reviewed by I Love Bookie Nookiefor TheRomanceReviews.com
5	1366934400	Can't wait for the second book. The first one was really good. I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 hours.
5	1366934400	I love.loved this book and I absolutely can not wait for the next one.  Both characters had very good background stories.  Georgia gave us just enough to keep us on the edge the whole time.  This was a non-stop read for me, I got through the whole thing in just a few hours.I would and already have recommended this book to my friends.
5	1366934400	I WAS SO ENTWINED IN THIS BOOK I LOVED IT CANT WAIT FOR THE SEQUAL VERY WELL WRITTEN I WILL READ MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR
4	1366848000	This story has several similarities to 50 shades of gray, but doesn't include the submissive, red room of pain angle.  I thought it was well written and the characters were well developed and easily loveable.  I have not heard any news on the second book, but I will read it when it comes out.
5	1366761600	5 starsThis was not only a sexy story but an extremely fun read.It's taking way to long fir the next book. HURRY!!
5	1366761600	I couldn't put this book down.  A GREAT book!  Good story line also. A must read!  May read it again.
3	1366761600	This book had it's amazing parts and some that could be have been better. The writing was at times tiring and you were left expecting more. It needed something fresh since it's pretty similar to other books.
5	1366675200	This is one of my favorite books that I've read so far this year. It really is worth the read & I can't wait for the second book to be released. This story is about Laurelyn & Jack. The story is told from both of their POV's. Laurelyn goes to Australia for three months with her best friend Addison. Jack is a rich business man who doesn't do relationships. He prefers to "date" women for a brief period, is very up front with them & his biggest term is NO real names. After they meet & Jack offers these terms to Laurelyn, can she accept them? He wants to date her for the three months she is there & she's afraid that if she doesn't accept his proposal that she will forever regret it. I love the writing style because I love when the characters are believable. They are both smart asses, which also keeps you laughing. Jack begins to break his own rules and moves Laurelyn into his home after she is harassed by Addison's brother. Laurelyn has been hurt badly by her ex & that is one of the reasons she decides to go to Australia. She feels free with Jack & thinking that this is going to end in three short months, she opens up to him & tells him her deep dark secrets. After a series of events, Jack is forced to reveal his identity but what will this mean for their relationship? What will happen when she reveals her true feelings? OMG....like I said, can't wait for book two.- I want to tell her how her heart belongs to someone she's yet to meet and she'll be loved and adored by one bloody lucky man someday. She'll have his babies just like she told me she wanted to do and he'll love her in a way like she's never known. But I can't tell her these things. And I don't know why.
4	1366675200	Another trilogy that I have to wait for th  next installment. Typical alpha  male. I suggest waiting for the third  book to come out  since  I will be waiting  impatiently for the 2nd book
5	1366675200	Do NOT start this book on a week day because your life will stop existing until you finish it after starting it! It truly was that consuming. It made me laugh and made me sniffle trying to hold back my own tears and it made made me want to wave my hand in front of my face to cool me down. Seriously the character development and their forming relationship was so well done I am in awe. I'm on edge until the next book comes out on May 30. That would be the only downfall I would cite is the ending leaves you feeling hollowed out and your in need of your next fix. Seriously wont regret money spent on this one!
5	1366675200	I enjoyed reading this book and  can wait until the additional one is releases.  If you love romance and can't put the book down.  This is the book for you!
5	1366588800	I'm surprised I got so hooked into Laurelyn & Jack's story. It takes you to a modern fantasy.  I can totally relate to being out of a bad relationship and looking for some adventure.  I only wish someone as hot as Jack came along.  I can't wait until the next book.I like that Laurelyn is a singer songwriter and Jack is very private.  There are some disconnects, or implausibilities but it's a novel - no need to over-analyze just let it sweep you up.
5	1366588800	OMG - this book was amazing - it is by far my favorite book I've read!!! I can't wait for the second one - May is too far away :(
5	1366588800	Compelling book...I LOVED it! Even though the formula is basic...boy is a commitment phoebe and girl has been hurt emotionally in a previous relationship causing much skepticism when it comes to love. But that is where the usual young adult formula ends. The intriguing premise of establishing a three month non-relationship 'relationship' where part of the 'rules' include real names are kept under wraps and at the end of the three months there is an agreement to walk away with no further contact is a new twist on the traditional romance plot. Georgia Cates' writing is very engaging and the characters are so well developed that you feel as is you know them. I like that even though these characters are not completely honest about their feelings to one another, they are both aware of how they feel for each other. In a typical 'romance' there is total denial that just makes you want to scream, but not here...both Laurelyn & Jack recognize their feelings, but they choose not to overtly express them as they had an agreement up front. So, the question is, after spending three months with someone day in and day out, will Laurelyn & Jack really be able to walk away from each other? Or in Laurelyn's case, fly away as she lives in Nashville, TN, USA. Conveniently, Laurelyn just happened to be on vacation/hiatus in Australia for three months from the emotional pain mentioned above when she meets the handsome & elusive multimillionaire Australian, Jack. What will happen? Well your guess is as good as mine because the SEQUEL will not be released until May 30, 2013!!! That's right, it ends on a CLIFFHANGER!
4	1366588800	Well hot damn, I can't wait for the next book (May 30th, hurry up!) I've already marked it's release date on my calendar.This story plays seamlessly back and forth between lighthearted fun and wholehearted romance. After reading the synopsis I was fairly sure I would like this book. It sounded a little bit like Pretty Woman minus the hooker bit. Let it be known that Pretty Woman is one of my favorite 90's movies. It didn't take long for me to discover that Beauty From Pain has more substance, a bit more realism. Not to mention that it is far more sexy.I really liked the characters in this book and I thought them all to be acting fairly age appropriately. Even the characters who we are supposed to dislike fit into a perfect pocket. In all honesty I may have liked to see more drama from outside the inner workings of our main characters, but that in no way diminished my over all enjoyment of this book. But be warned: holy cliffhanger! I did not want the book to end where it did, in fact, I was a little crushed. However once I got over the trauma of the ending I realized that there were to many hints of bits to the story yet to be explored. Really, there was no other appropriate place to end it.Georgia Cates wrote a winner here. She's garnered a new fan in me for sure and I've already added some of her other work to my kindle for future reading.
5	1366502400	I heard so many things first and foremost about Georgia Cates and I'm so glad this was the first book I picked up of hers because I was not disappointed.  Jack Henry, swoon, not disappointing for the male character in this book.  They all have flaws and in the end **Spoilier** they aren't together but book 2 has to lead us there with whatever obstacles there may be, so excited and can't wait to read more!
5	1366502400	I really looking forward for the next book to be released.this minimum word requirement is stupid, really silly stuff
5	1366416000	This was the first book I have read from this author. It came up because it was related to other books I had been reading and I have to say I was presently surprised as to how I grew attached to the characters and the story it was telling.I don't was to spoil anything so ill just leave you w/ this... I got so into the book that I felt like I could feel their pain, joy, and love with them. I cried more than once for different reasons while reading this amazing novel. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
5	1366416000	This book was a page turner... Similar to 50 shades of Grey but not.. Cant wait for the next book!
5	1366416000	This book was simply amazing. I though Jack Henry was a little dense but hey when it comes to relationships most men are. I thought the whole arrangement was a little shortsighted for both involved. I think Ben had some preconceived notions when it came to Laurie...The story was fabulous and the musician idea with the girl was great. I liked it that the girl was musically involved it made the story more for some reason.yummy can't wait for some more of Jack and I am waiting patiently for the next installment. Thank you again Georgia for a really fascinating book..
3	1366329600	I thought that the book was missing in build up and that the storyline was a bit weak. I can't understand the hero.
5	1366329600	Loved loved loved this book. I cannot wait to read the second book. Counting the days till May 30th.  I enjoyed it so much.
5	1366329600	Not sure if amazing is a worthy enough word for this book! I read ALOT of books every week and only add comments to ones that truly deserve them! Cannot wait for book 2!
5	1366329600	I hardly ever give a five star review. There are many requirements I have for a book to even try and score a 4 STAR review let alone a 5.  I keep a list of things that I like or that bother me, and I also do character profiles to make sure there are no contradictions, inconsistencies and to make sure there is true reality in their story and behavior.  After all, I have to believe it in order to read it.Fast forward to this book.....well....I have NOTHING negative to say about this book,  and while I have given some five star reviews that had me complaining about character personalities or behavior, with the exception of Wuthering Heights, I am not sure I ever said that i have nothing to complain about before. Normally I take issue with the annoying female character, or sometimes certain behavior or inconsistencies, contradictions or even issues that flat out make zero sense and add nothing to the "story."  That is not the case with this book, as I felt it flowed perfectly, the female character is one of only 4 I have ever liked, and found the journey both characters took to be quite interesting for both of them.It really is amazing the things that we experience or fear that truly mold who we are, how we think and just what we will do because of it.  The lengths people go through to either forget, move on, prevent or destroy most times know no bounds.Summer flings?  Not an uncommon thing, but rather a very common practice.  While some do them closer to home, and others not so much, that started off this very believable story for me, as they are casual and typically are a "no strings attached" sort of hookup.Then it begins...girl gets hurt, leaves it behind, takes a "holiday" down under with her friend, gets spotted at a bar by a guy who is on a mission to make sure he remains unattached, free, out of love, and doing things on his own terms to make sure that happens.  Nothing new to him, as he has done this twelve times before over the course of four years, but decides it's time to try something new.  Instead of his "few weeks" worth of an anonymous relationship, let's try one for three months.  Enter stage left...the girl from the states trying to run away from her reality and needs a distraction.  Hello, Mate!Now, what do you get when you have a girl on a three month holiday and a guy who is determined to take his anonymous relationships up a notch by trying one for three months?  You have two people spending more time together than they should given that it is supposed to be NO NAMES, NO FEELINGS, NO COMMITMENT AND NO CONTACT AFTER.  And you get a guy who is her distraction and a girl who is his experiment.  Sounds like a recipe for more than they bargained for...Now the rules become blurred and broken by the one person who set them up in the first place and he no longer begins to recognize this "casual affair" as a "fling with no strings attached," but instead it starts to feel "real"....two people truly showing each other the real person....the person who is afraid to fall in love, and the person who wants love but is so afraid to be hurt again she agrees to an arrangement to try and have fun, do something she would never normally do, and do it in the hopes it will help her erase all the bad and the hurt.  He lets his guard down some, as he becomes accustomed to their "relationship" and his secrets start to surface and a piece of his past comes back to haunt him, once again reminding him why he does things HIS way....Slowly as they progress through their arrangement, while Laurelyn goes with the flow adhering to the pace that Jack is setting for them, Jack slowly starts to realize that he not only likes her, but he really likes her outside of the bedroom.  He enjoys her company, he enjoys their conversation, he admires her and truly ends up feeling confused by how much he likes having her around....he's kind of gotten used to it and starts to realize when the time comes for her to head back to the states, he will not only miss her, but he really doesn't like the idea of it....Laurelyn does everything she is supposed to to try and keep things unattached, light and airy between her and Jack, even though she feels herself growing closer to him.  She continues to come off like it is nothing more than the arrangement they made.  While she knows she is starting to care for him, Jack's continuation of breaking rule after rule starts to force him to acknowledge some of his feelings that he has been having that keep creeping up on him.  It is these alien feelings that force him to try and find ways to deny it.But then the time comes and it is time for her to go home, and after a "slip of the tongue" she realizes she has to leave on her terms no matter how much it hurts...even if it means lying to him.But Jack does keep his promise to her...he gives her the best three months of her life, and Laurelyn keeps her promise....LEAVING WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED.But now that she's gone, Jack realizes his feelings for her, especially after her "goodbye" and the fact she left something he gave her behind...it was that moment he realized not just what he feels for her, but that she was truly being honest with him...his money means nothing to her.truly one of the best reads I had the pleasure of enjoying this year.While it ended with a heartbreaking, gut wrenching cliff hanger, well, that is what some of the best authors do...they leave you wondering what happens next and craving more....and I do....Loved this book.
5	1366329600	I can not wait for book two what a read please tell me Georgia Cates is not going to stoip writing
3	1366243200	This book started off well, albeit reminiscent of Fifty Shades, but for me the book fell flat with the lack of adventure/excitement in the overall relationship and the cliffhanger ending at a measly 250 pages.  It seems like it's becoming more common practice for authors to churn out books 300 pages or less, but to me it feels like a shortcut.  Takes some time to develop more depth to your characters, develop your story further, let there be some time (at least a few pages) for a problem to resolve itself and don't just end the story early so you can make more money on the second book (which it seems is really just the other half of the story!).
2	1366243200	Picked this one up based on prior reviews and was disappointed.One of the problems with this genre is the writer's take it far too seriously.  They also seem to like weak little women and tough big men. I'm not quite sure why. It started out well enough - interesting set-up at any rate. A troubled American musician on a winter holiday with her best friend, meets a mysterious billionaire in a small town outside of Sydney, Australia. The musician just broke up with her record producer/lover - after discovering he was married.  This little trip is her method of putting some distance between them. The mysterious man sets up a meeting with the musician after hearing her at a karaoke night. He's stalking out his next casual sex-partner. Averse to long-term commitments - for reasons that are never quite clarified, Jake sets up two week - three month commitments with a lady. They agree to share his bed, have sex with him, get slathered with attention, go to events, etc for this specific period of time. No ties, no strings, and most important of all - no names or contact information is exchanged. He gives them a burner cell phone to contact him on for the length of their arrangement, and he has a similar one. He stalks the lady out, he has a specific type, and makes the deal.&#34;Paige&#34; - our heroine - decides to take him up on his offer. (Which doesn't make a lot of sense when you discover her back story - which is the kid of a single mom and a country music star who doesn't know she exists and never acknowledged her, plus the ex, who she found out was married. You'd think Paige would want someone stable and well honest after all that.)At any rate, the narrative shifts points of view throughout. He said, she said - which takes away a little bit of the mystery - we know too much too soon.  Neither character really rises above the boilerplate tropes - he's a hot billionaire with commitment issues, and she's a 21 year old musician with Daddy issues. And there's not enough humor or wit. While better than One Night with A Stranger, it lacks the sense of humor of 50 Shades.I wish the women in these books were older than 21. Not sure why they are always so young, or why the men are always 10 years older. Nor why the women are always described as small, and the men big. Would be nice to have a little variance. It's almost as if everyone is copying the same formula? Which dates back to the 1980s, at the very least. Judith McNaught wrote a similar book - entitled &#34;Double Standards&#34; which was published in the 1980s. So this dates back before Twilight or 50 shades. In short, we can't come up with many new ideas, can we, ladies?
3	1366243200	Seems the author just couldn't put a good story together.  The book leaves you hanging in the air as it doesn't finish it and you have to wait for the next book to come out to continue story....should have been told ahead so wouldn't have even started reading the book.
4	1366243200	First let me say that I truly enjoyed the book and will be purchasing the next. I would certainly recommend it. But there were some things that irked me...- I've read several books with these &#34;contract&#34; relationships. And I usually buy into it if there's some deep scaring behind it. But I didn't understand Jack's. He's got parents with a good relationship. A normal family. Being worried about attracting gold diggers just didn't seem like a good enough reason for me.- Why can't these couples ever hear each other out after an argument. This is a trend with my reading material lately - where instead of hearing someone out - they'd rather just storm away. So you can sleep with someone, even move into his house, but you can't give him the benefit of the doubt?- Seriously with these cliffhangers! I knew this was a series going in... so I can't complain too much. But does it have to be this &#34;Who killed JR&#34; stunner of an ending? It's maddening!I liked Jack. He wasn't this moody, bi-polar alpha. I appreciated the strength of Laurelyn's character. Even though she's gotta nasty habit of running, instead of facing conflict. At least she doesn't play the doormat. And I thought Laurelyn's back story was very unique... which makes me excited to see where book #2 goes :)
5	1366243200	I liked reading this book. However I felt like I had read this story line somewhere be fore...Fifty Shades. It is different with more feelings than the 50 shades series but a few things were similar. The dominant male, the younger female, the money and fancy places he takes her to, the &#34;this is mine and no one else's&#34; idea from the man, and also the main male character who feels he will never be able to love someone is proven wrong. I did enjoy it and I am looking forward to the next in the series coming soon.
4	1366243200	I really liked this book! It has a lot of the same stuff that the first 50 shades does, but I still really liked it. I normally don't like books that are really similar to others, but this was really well written and the author is great at developing the characters. I would still like to know what causes Jack to approach relationships like he does, if there is one. I will note that this is only the first book, which I like when reviewers note this so I know what I am getting into reading a book.
5	1366243200	this is really more than i expected. Jack and  Laurelyn  captivated me and I just want to find out what happens next. love love loved this one and can not wait for the next book. hurry up
5	1366156800	The wait for book two is killing me! This is such a great love story and I am dying to read the second book.
5	1366156800	I wasn't really sure what to expect with this book, but oh wow! I loved that the setting was in Australia I loved that the heroine was a singer and the hero a winemaker. They had great chemistry. I cannot wait for the next book, I'm anxiously counting down the days!
3	1366156800	This book is written in both his and her perspectives, alternating chapters.  I enjoyed the alternating chapters, and really enjoyed the chapters with Laurelyn.  The only downfall to this book is I was left wanting more from Jack McLachlan.  My visual of him was not 28 eventhough the book states he is 28.  The author made me visualize him as much older and no matter how much I tried I could not picture him differently.  I think the author could have spent more time describing him and making him more appealling.I did like this book and will read the next one in the series because it ends in a cliffhanger!  So, you will see a review of the next one from me.  This time I will have a picture of a hot guy beside me to visualize!See my other reveiws at[...]or visit my Facebook page at[...]
5	1366156800	Love how the story was told from both people involved. Can't wait for Beauty from Surrender!  May 30th can't get here quick enough
5	1366156800	Loved the story. I got so caught up in the story I read it in two nights. A book worth buying. I will read it over and over.
5	1366156800	Great read, couldn't put it down & I'm anxious to read the next book. It can't come out fast enough
5	1366070400	All I can say is that I really, really enjoyed this book and I cannot wait for book 2. :-)  If you loved FSOG you will love this book.
5	1366070400	Such a great book. I am really happy with this book. Funny, cute and sexy. My only complaint is how long I have to wait for the next one.
5	1366070400	I absolutely loved this book! It was so steamy and very hard to put down. I can not wait until Beauty from Surrender is here! Way to go Georgia Cates you knocked it out of the park!
4	1365984000	Couldn't put it down - a friendship and romance tied together under the thin vail of their secrets. Female lead is innocent and her Aussie billionaire is tempting.
5	1365984000	This book was awesome!  I cannot wait for the 2nd book to come out! A true love story. The end
4	1365984000	Really liked the story line. It was a feel good ending and whish it would come true for someone.  Thanks
5	1365897600	I can't wait for book 2 damn you John Henry for not getting there in time. But this story was perfect a little angst but not too much. I loved the read never was I irritated.
5	1365897600	I absolutely loved this book... Jack was a very handsome and particularly blunt man and Lauralyn was a beautiful loving talented woman.  This was a beautiful yet odd love story.. it was an agreement of sorts.. I just fell in love with the characters... I will definitely read more from Georgia Cates
5	1365811200	so i can't really say anything bad at all about this book it is so beautiful and addicting to read over and over, you never get tired of it i swear. also im such a huge fan i belong to the BFP support group on facebook!!! I LOVE IT, YOU ROCK GEORGIA!
5	1365811200	I was reading this in one sitting. It kept my attention and I can't wait for the next one to come along.
5	1365811200	This book is a must read. I loved every second of it from start to finish. It's an awesome love story with plenty of hotness. It's 50 shades ish but different but should still speak to those readers plus more. I mean what could be better than going to Australia for 3  months and hooking up with a millionaire. I finished this book in a day be cause I couldn't put it down.
5	1365811200	I cannot seem to get enough of books like this. Their hot, their heartwarming, they leave me breathless and I'm never sure what's going to happen. I always want to expect the perfect ending, but I can't and sometimes I don't mind and sometimes it drives me bonkers. This is one of those drive me bonkers moments. May 30th is only a month and a half away, but it feels like forever. I cannot wait to get back to Laurelynn and Jack. I would gush more about this book, but everything I have to say gives major spoilers, although in the long run they probably aren't difficult to figure out.
5	1365811200	I truly enjoyed the story from beginning to end. The building of the relationship between Jack and Laurie was intense, fun, and realistic.  I had a great deal of buy-in for their relationship because he allowed her to see the potential of true love. I am excited for what will be the sequel to this novel.  Thank you Georgia for your creative ideas.
4	1365811200	UPDATE: My review for this book is right below. I still think that LIFE, LUST and VINTAGE CLOTHING is the best read out there right now for story, erotica and even visuals of vintage clothing.  But it seems like only a few people are finding it. I did accidentally. If you liked this one, you'll LOVE that one! Says it is the author's first book.Life, Lust & Vintage ClothingIt's almost as if the reviewer who wrote the LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP review wrote much of my own thoughts before I could! I will certainly read more of this author's work (I even loved reading her bio about delivering babies!) But, while I very much liked Laurelyn and Jack and the story that evolves around them, I found problems that sometimes slowed the reading down. Just when a scene pulled me in and got my pulse rate responding, it ended too soon!  I've been posting elsewhere that I'm pretty new to erotica and I can thank the poorly written Shades of Grey for that. (My apology to those who loved it.) And I can thank GREY for my finding Georgia Cates. I also think Ms. Cates needed to have her novel edited (as others have said, as well) since a glaring mistake can stop the hottest of scenes. But Jack and Laurelyn were a wonderful find.  GREY, much as I hated it, sent me back to STORY OF O,Story of O: A Novelwhich I'd read in college.  I've been posting about the writing in that old book.  But another new gem I found is a glittering one.Life, Lust & Vintage ClothingWhy have so few people found this book yet,or so it seems?  But this relates to something others said about BEAUTY FROM PAIN.  I also thought the characters not only sounded older than they were, I WANTED them older, as in LIFE, LUST, etc. (They're in their 30s, if I remember correctly.) I found that book by spending a rainy day searching out more well-written erotica.  The cover and sample pages--with colored images of vintage clothing---hooked me.  So I'm back reading erotica!  And I will read more of Georgia Cates for sure, especially if she finds a good editor!
5	1365724800	Bought as a Kindle book, with a number of others also on Kindle for a friend of mine who really loves the &#34;bodice ripper&#34; type novel. She loves them so that is all that matters
5	1365724800	I've read a lot of fifty shade similar books, and this one is just as good. The characters are well developed and the story line is great!!! Very hard to put down once you start so be prepared!!!!Can't wait for book 2!!!
5	1365638400	I enjoyed reading this book. It reminded me of the song Daylight by Maroon 5 which I love listening to by the way. I bought this book because I loved the author's previous book Going Under. As expected, Ms. Cates did not disappoint. I usually abhor cliffhangers but actually liked this ending. I can't wait to read the 2nd book.
4	1365638400	It was a good read and I loaned it to a friend and she enjoyed it as well. We will be getting the next in series but it is not like &#34; I have to have it now&#34;! I enjoyed the storyline, different kind of love story. Abit like FSoG but not. A good way to spend the day, reading a good hot love story with some sex sprinkled in.
5	1365638400	I loved this Book! I was not able to put it down.  I can not wait till the middle of May to read the second book!
5	1365638400	I just finished Beauty From Pain! I could not accomplish anything until I finished this book. (I might have just spent half of my work day 'looking busy' and actually reading because it was like a drug and I couldn't pull myself away from my notepad) I had a lot of emotions running through me during the entire book. I laughed, I was mad, confused, overjoyed, hurt and then now, anxious to see what happens next. I am very much looking forward to Beauty From Surrender!
5	1365552000	Georgia Cates did an amazing job writing this book. It draws you in and then bam major cliff hanger!! Is it May yet? I need the second book now!
4	1365552000	This was in my "Recommendations" by Amazon and it did not disappoint.  This was a solid and fun first book by Georgia Cates. Beauty from Pain has that fun, flirty with a hint of anticipation that I couldn't put it down.  Laurelyn is a 22 year old musician trying to heal from a bad relationship and Jack McLachlan is an Australian wine maker & eligible bachelor, but both just want to have some carefree fun. I appreciated that I didn't have to wait through the entire first book to get background information to help with the character development like some of the more popular contemporary romance books on the market today.The only reason this one didn't get a full 5 stars is due to some small editing issues.  They were not enough to detract from the story for me, but I think the next one will be more polished.Again, I encourage anyone that loves Michelle Leighton (The Wild Ones), Samantha Young (On Dublin Street), and R.K. Lilley (Up in the Air), then you should feel right at home with these. Way to go G. Cates on this one - You definately have earned yourself a new fan.
5	1365552000	What a beautiful story. Maybe a cliche, but I cannot wait forr the sequel. I hope they find each other and &#34;love conquers all!
5	1365552000	This book is amazing. Such a well written love story..simply one of the best books I have ever read. I can't wait to read the next book.. thank you Mrs Cates for writing this story
5	1365465600	This was a different kind of love story but one none the less. it was amazing. I laughed cried, and cant wait to see what happens next
5	1365465600	I love this story.  I think the sex scenes could be better and I'll admit, from the title I was expecting it to be more BDSM.  Maybe the second book?  If you like the love affair between Christian and Ana, I think you'd like this.  I at times could feel what the characters felt and that for me is a good book.  Can't for for the second book!
5	1365465600	I could not put this one down.  I hate how long it will be until the sequel is out but I enjoyed every minute of the book and hated when it ended.
3	1365465600	This was a pretty good book.  Not the most exciting book as far as drama/romance goes but it was still good. Characters were good, storyline was good, ending was good.  I will definitely be waiting for the 2nd book to come out at the end of May.
5	1365379200	I had this book on my kindle for almost 2 weeks and I want to kick myself right now, once I started I couldn't stop reading it and when you get to end it will keep you wanting for more, I can't wait for Beauty from Surrender!
3	1365379200	There was really no plot. Typical story. It was something to do while it was raining and waiting at doctors office.
5	1365379200	What an easy style to read that you won't want to put this book down!  I downloaded several books in March and didn't read this until yesterday... I am glad I waited almost a month, because now I have to wait for book two!  The relationship between Laurelyn & Jack was heated from the get go, however, because of her previous broken heart, he met his match with her.  Love grows when you least expect it and one of them found out just a little too late. I cannot wait for book two because there are too many questions of minor characters that need to be developed.  Ben... Audrey... her father... and ex. I personally enjoy when the author places main characters POV within a book and Ms Cates did an AMAZING job developing characters that you fall in love with!
5	1365379200	Couldn't put it down! Love the dynamic between the two main characters! Cannot wait for the Continuation of this awesome love story!
5	1365292800	How unusual, a plot with a filthy rich, sexy, alpha male in seek of a powerless gorgeous woman......I did enjoy this book a lot.  It took an overused subject and made it more interesting.  I found I couldn't put it down.  I'm actually looking forward to the next installment.
5	1365292800	First my complaint.....this is another d*** sequel, and we have to wait until the end if May for it.  Seriously!!!!  Why can't these authors wait to release until they have all the work ready to publish???  Having said that, this was a very, very good book by an impressive new to me author.  The writing was extremely smooth....transitions were good....and characters well written.  The book flowed which is very important to the reader.  There were a couple of typos but who cares.  I'm looking for content and storyline, and this book had it.  I loved both characters very much.  The sex was well written and, there was genuine feeling from both characters.....believable.  I loved it, and will certainly be looking for more from this author.  Great job!
5	1365292800	I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. I just assumed it was another love story. While it is, it is much more than that. The book ends with a cliffhanger, but I am just fine with that. I spent the first few days after reading this in a book funk. I totally missed that characters. Georgia Cates has created a wonderful story.
4	1365292800	I don't recall the specifics of this story but, I almost bought the paperback version for a coworker ! I am a tough audience and I look forward to the sequel :-)
4	1365206400	I found this book to be a true love story.  Can't wait for the sequel!!!!  I wonder how the next story will go????
4	1365206400	Rarely do I find a book that keeps me up all night. I couldn't put it down. I laughed, felt frustrated, and sailed through more emotional waves. Georgia Cates knows how to tell a story.
5	1365120000	I loved this book. I read around 6-7 books a week, and yes I am crazy with a full time job and a family! This book I cannot get out of my mind, it is by far one of my favorite modern novels. A great romance with great characters. I cannot wait for the second book!
5	1365120000	I loved this book! I can't wait for the next book to be released! This is a book to be put on you to be read list!
5	1365120000	Best book ever!!!!! Everybody on the planet should read this book...well every grown woman.  Cant wait for the next book to come out in may
5	1365033600	I read this after reading Collide, as it was recommended by Amazon.  I wasn't expecting anything amazing, and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  It was similar to 50 Shades in that he's rich and handsome, sweet, and can buy her the world.  It also is similar in that it evoked those deep feelings of pain, loss, and a torturous love affair a la Christian...But that's where the similarities end.  This was minus the kink factor, but still hot as hell.  I gobbled it up in a day, because I didn't want to put it down.  The only thing that bothered me was that I was not expecting a sequel (I know, read the cover...duh...).  I don't mind sequels, but good lord do they have to make us wait 3 months???  This industry is going to drive me to drink!  Anyway, I don't want to be one of those reviews that spoils the plot for everyone.  This was a great read despite the cookie cutter storyline.  Georgia Cates created a chemistry between the two that makes you forget all that.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.
4	1365033600	It was good reading with a twist to the story. I thought the story was good and it left you hanging to see what is going to happen next. Looking forward to the next book.
5	1365033600	Oh my god....what an awesome book. I totally did not expect it. I didn't read any of the reviews, just saw the consistent 4-5 stars and took a chance. Too many reviewers give away the entire story and ruin it for the rest of us. Anyway, I loved this book! Once I started, I could not put it down. I had to take a break and go grocery shopping, but I sat in the parking lot and finished the book, and ended up going into the grocery store after crying. Lol... I can't hide that. I sooooo cannot wait for book two! Please surprise us and release it sooner than summertime!
2	1365033600	I usually don't write but this book feels like a cheap attempt to copy Fifty Shades of Gray. I history could had been better. Did not quite explain why the characters acted the way they did. Just a sequence of events. I did not like it all  I did no finished it
4	1364947200	Georgia Cates Beauty from Pain (Beauty Series)liked the story but no info that I saw about the title of the next book or when it will be out if not already.  Please send info on the names of Beauty Series.
4	1364947200	This was a really good book.  I did think of 50 Shades and Dantes Inferno, (way better than Dantes Inferno, I did not like that book), but different.  There was no kinky sex in this one, but the emotion was there and the intensity from the H/h was there.  I liked Laurelyn, she was strong and vulnerable, but not whiny. Jack was the same way.  He starts off like the big bad wolf, but even he shows a vulnerable side.  I didn't realize that this was a continued story, so I guess I have no choice in waiting for the next installment.
5	1364947200	Absolutely one of the best books I've read this year!!!!Hot scenes, funny banter. Love this book and cant wait for the next!
5	1364947200	Beauty From PainA-Freakin'-Mazing!!!!I.NEED.MORE.STARS!!!I was completely blown away by this book! I'm still trying to catch my breath. Beauty From Pain is my first Georgia Cates book and I'm pretty sure that I loved everything about it!It's a bit like Pretty Woman meets 50 Shades. Hello!!! The story is not entirely unique but it is super addictive, and beautifully written. I started and finished the book within hours. I.could.not.put.it.down! I love dual POV's! Being in both of their heads...I felt more emotionally attached to Jack and Laurelyn, and I felt like I understood there growing emotions with each turn-of-the-page.It's raw and super sexy...and I cannot wait for May 30th to see where this story goes! This is easily one of my favorites of this year.
5	1364947200	I must admit, I put off reading this, thinking it was just another sexy millionaire story, but book really took me by surprise with all it's HOTNESS, and I could not get enough!I absolutely love these characters. Laurelyn is refreshingly self-assured with a great sense of humour, and brings a sense of fun and playfulness to Jack's life. Jack is, obviously, sex on a stick, but he's not an all-out dominant, controlling Alpha. He is confident and possessive, but he is also funny, incredibly caring and protective of Laurelyn, and goes out of his way to make her feel special, never degrading her and, as he promises her in the beginning, he shows her the time of her life. Laurelyn comes as a complete shock to him, and I loved watching her sneak her way into his life and his heart without either of them really realising it.I was so impressed that Cates was able to give us such an intense story with out all the angst that all books seem to have today.  Yes these characters have flaws and past but they dealt with everything up front and openly, and it made it all just that much more enjoyable.Yes there is a HUGE cliffhanger and I am most definitely ready the the 2nd book Ms. Cates!!!GO READ THIS BOOK!!!
5	1364947200	very different, although expected i enjoyed reading this book very much!! and would recommend it! i cannot wait for the sequel to know what happens after! exciting..
2	1364947200	I wanted to love it, but unfortunately this book frustrated me to no end.The whole proposition arrangement thing was just too similar to FSOG. Why not print out a contract and get her to sign it already? Whilst the whole 'I'm not telling you my name' thing was absurd. If she wanted to find out his name, it wouldn't be hard in a place like Wagga. It's a small country town with a population of 45,000. If you're rich, locals will know who you are.I also found the dialogue between Jack & Laurelyn to be awkward. Jack was too proper, he's Australian - not British! And Laurelyn didn't speak like a 22 year old, she came across as far too mature for her age. And if she called him 'Jack Henry' one more time I was going to throw my kindle out the window. Jack Henry really..?But my real annoyance was at the conclusion of the story, in the fact that there was no conclusion...Disappointed once again!My rating: 2 Stars
5	1364860800	With this book, I took a leap of faith and refused to read the reviews until I was done since the book seemed promising in its description.  I must say, it was the best leap I've taken since Gina Maxwell's Seducing Cinderella!! I'm excited for the next book in the series especially since all the scenes in this book were H.O.T!! I almost want to pole dance now! ;) Definitely worth the purchase and time to read, I can almost guarantee you'll be drooling until the second book releases in May!!
5	1364860800	A-Freakin'-Mazing!!!!I.NEED.MORE.STARS!!!I was completely blown away by this book! I'm still trying to catch my breath. Beauty From Pain is my first Georgia Cates book and I'm pretty sure that I loved everything about it!It's a bit like Pretty Woman meets 50 Shades. Hello!!! The story is not entirely unique but it is super addictive, and beautifully written. I started and finished the book within hours. I.could.not.put.it.down! I love dual POV's!

This is easily one of my favorites of this year.
5	1364860800	Was such a good read...Was totally disappointed that the book ended and that I have to wait for part 2, but I'm anxiously awaiting it!!! Hurry!!!
5	1364860800	I bought this book wondering if I would enjoy it, and I have come to LOVE it. I have re-read the book 3 times already and am already anxious for the sequel to emerge. This is a must-read book!
5	1364774400	It has become one of my new favs... I keep re-reading it!  I can't wait for the next one to come out!
5	1364774400	I really enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to read, funny at times and the characters seemed like real people.  I am very excited for the next book to come out to see what happens next!
5	1364774400	I loved this book!!! I can't wait for the next one!!! One of my new faves!!!! Georgia Cates captured a real love and my heart!
5	1364774400	I enjoyed this beginning series that somewhat depicts the newest trend with the &#34;Shades of Grey&#34; stories. Yes, there is a contract involved, but it didn't contain all that BDSM that seems to be the rage in literature. It was refreshing to read this story about a girl who travels to Australia for the summer and meets a man she falls for &#34;under contract&#34;, but knows that she will only get hurt in the end. Liked how the female lead pulls a surprise move in at the end of novel that will definitely keep me waiting for the next series to continue with. Keep it coming Georgia Cates!
5	1364774400	O.M.Gasmic worthy!  Wow, loved the story overall!  It definitely has the kind of depth that has you thinking of the book days, weeks after finishing it... and has you so obsessed and needy of it that you look up the author every day on your Kindle until you see the second book is available for pre-order.  Yes, this book is SO WORTHY.
5	1364774400	It's really cruel I have to read the sequel now!!!!Finally something worth reading. The book grabbed me and I finished reading it in one day. Their is no other way than to fall in love with Jack Henry and Laurelyn.How do we wait another two months?Highly recommend you will not be disappointed.
5	1364774400	I Can't wait to start the next book if you liked 50 shade you will like this book it rocks
4	1364774400	Beauty from Pain follows Laurelyn Prescott and Jack McLachlan over the course of their three month relationship. Laurelyn is a young, beautiful, talented American musician visiting Australia alongside her best friend, Addison. Jack owns a bunch of vineyards in Australia and New Zealand. He's rich, handsome, and one of Australia's most eligible bachelors. When these two come together for a three month "no strings attached" arrangement, the details of their relationship are crystal clear: no real names, no emotional ties, and absolutely no contact after their three months together is done. Laurelyn is promised the time of her life, and Jack certainly delivers--in ways Laurelyn never could have imagined."This man will be hazardous for my heart if I allow it. He'll use me up if I let him. I know this without a doubt and remind myself of a lesson well learned not so long ago. Never confuse sex for love."Each chapter of Beauty from Pain is told from either Jack or Laurelyn's perspective, so readers get insight into the thoughts and motivations behind the behavior of each character. All the answers as to why Jack is anti-commitment, why Laurelyn's last relationship ended, and their history's are revealed in detail as the story progresses. One of my favorite things about this book was that even though the idea of a three month relationship (under these particular circumstances) seemed a bit far-fetched to me, the intimacy and emotional involvement developed realistically. What Jack and Laurelyn shared was beautiful, sexy, and intense; their compassion and care for each other, heart-warming. They were each strong and amazing characters independently, but together they made so much sense.I can't say enough good things about this book. The writing is excellent, the setting ideal, the pace holds fast and steady throughout, and the characters are perfect! There was not a single moment when I wanted to put Beauty from Pain down. Jack Henry and Laurelyn made me so happy! There are plenty of hot, sexy scenes and sweet moments to satisfy the most demanding romance reader. Although the ending had me reeling, it also left me thinking about what's next for Jack Henry and Laurelyn. I am dying to read the next installment in the Beauty series, Beauty from Surrender, which is scheduled to be released in May of this year. If you haven't read Beauty from Pain yet, make sure to get your copy now!
5	1364688000	Loved this book.. Can't wait to read the next one! So excited to see what happens to jack and laurelyn's love story..
5	1364688000	Jack McLachlan is used to having his women when and where he wants them with only one rule - make no connections with any of them.  He usually gives them about three weeks and then he moves on to the next woman.  While looking for number thirteen he stumbles across a beautiful "yank" with an amazing voice.  He makes it his mission to get her to play his game by his rules.  Laurelyn Prescott just got out of a relationship that tore her apart.  She has now fled the states to join her best friend for three months in Australia.  While trying to escape the unwanted attention from her best friends' brother, she runs into Jack McLachlan; she thinks it's a coincidence but has no clue it is actually a set up.  Will she give into his rules and jump into a relationship with a man that she can know nothing about....not even his name.  Jack is also in uncharted territory suddenly he is making a deal to be with a woman for 3 months ... his longest relationship to date.  He gives her the name Lachlan just so he can hear her shout something similar to his name when he's making her scream from beneath him.  Will the deal last or will the unexpected happen and Jack jump into the first relationship of his life?*Jack: "You'll be surprised how quickly our relationship will progress when there are no silly pretenses.  We come together knowing what the other's expectations are, so it makes things easier, more relaxed.  Our time together is so much more enjoyable because our only motives are to enjoy each other's company.  There's no pressure and it's ... fantastic."*Laurelyn:  "I haven't said yes."  That's me playing hard to get.  He pulls me close and whispers against my ear.  "But you will."Once Laurelyn gets herself involved with "Lachlan," she soon realizes she's falling for the one man she knows nothing about.  As she battles a past of being let down by a father who has wanted nothing to do with her and a past boyfriend who forgot to reveal to her that he was married, she starts to realize that maybe getting involved with a man for only three months is exactly what she needed.  As a musician her feelings come out in the only way she knows how, her music...*Laurelyn: "Music is what feelings sound like out loud.  I sing songs that speak from my heart.  They tell my story, how I feel."As she continues to feel unworthy of being loved Jack will fight for her to understand that she does mean something to him.  As Jack begins to feel emotions that he has never felt before he can't get the one woman who will be leaving in a few short weeks off of his mind.  He finally lets his walls down, but will it be too late?*Laurelyn: "There's so much that's happened in my life to make me feel unworthy of ever being beautiful, incredible, funny, or irresistible.  But I don't want to think of those things.  Not now.  And certainly not in front of Lachlan."*Jack:  "That's who I am to you from now on.  No more Lachlan.  No more pretending."As the last few days of their deal pass by Laurelyn knows she's head over heels in love with Jack, but how does he feel about her?*Laurelyn: "But somewhere between hello and the goodbye I'm unable to bear, I fell desperately in love with you."Will Jack be able to stop the woman that he loves from walking out of his life forever?  How will Laurelyn survive after another crushing blow to her love life?  You will have to wait and see until May 30, 2013 for the follow-up to this cliffhanger in, "Beauty from Surrender."  This book deserves a solid 4.5 and I am highly anticipating the follow up to find out where there love story will go!
5	1364688000	I absolutely LOVED This book.. The characters are unique and the story line was wonderful and different than so many of the books out there like this. I can't WAIT for the next book!!
4	1364601600	I rate this a 4 star because although it definitely kept my attention the entire way through, I felt like it somewhat lacked originality... But at the end it took an unexpected turn so I'm definitely excited for the next book!!!
5	1364601600	Enjoy the story so much.  Can't put it down!  Can't wait until end of May for next series, Beauty for Surrender.
5	1364601600	This was the first book I have read by Georgia Cates and am I am already looking forward to  seeing what she writes next.  Beauty From Pain was well written and sthe author does a nice job in character development. The book is engaging/sexy and seductive.  As you progress through the story, she writes a lot of detail about the main characters so you really get to know them to a point.  Well, I couldn't put this book down! I had to see where it was all going. It is good to be consumed by a story sometimes....and Beauty From Pain is one of them.I also enjoyed how the chapters are in different POV's and it really works well with this story.  The story flows well and the back and forth of the POV keeps you wanting to know more about Jack & Laurelyn.The characters are believable though they do seem older than their ages stated in the book.  As one progresses through the story, one gets a good insight as to how they are handling their "arrangement" and I wasn't overly surprised how it ended but I didn't like how it ended though I thought it wasn't going to end where it did.  It actually didn't end at 100% on the Kindle but rather in the 87% or so.  I definitely don't want the story to end so I was pleased to read there is going to be another book.  I do think there is a lot more we could know about Jack so I hope that is going to come up in another book.I do hope the next installment will be a longer story and I won't finish it so fast.  Well, probably not.  If the next book is like the first I can see myself reading through it in a few nights.
5	1364601600	Wonderful book, but the ending really left me hanging on for a release date of the second book in the series.
5	1364515200	This book was really good. I enjoyed pretty much everything about this book. I am really looking forward to the next one!!
5	1364515200	Loved the story and the chemistry... Waiting for the next book.... can't wait to read what happens next.  Hope we don't have to wait long.
5	1364515200	I only wrote that so others that read this review would know off the bat! Now on to the important stuff. THIS IS AN AMAZING STORY. I thoroughly enjoyed the honesty between two people without titles aka birth given names. I truly felf this couple falling in love. I felt the anxiety at the prospect of being apart as their time was ending.I wished this had been a stand alone story but I will totally follow this continuing story.
4	1364515200	Good love story. A lot of sex. Wow. Read this in two days. Couldn't put it down.  Worth the money
5	1364515200	I can't say much bc I don't want to give away anything! I love a good love story! It kept me guessing!
5	1364515200	I loved Beauty from Pain, this book had it all for me! I'm not even sure where to start! I mean it takes place in Australia, a love story from down under! Laurelyn takes off with her best friend from Nashville to mend her achy breaky heart, come on how many of us dreamed of doing  just that!  Jack McLachlan started out on an iffy note for me, I usually don't like cocky arrogant men. So when he starts paying the waitress to get info on "the American girl" I'm already making him the villain! I find myself pushing Laurelyn Prescott towards Ben Donavon (her BFF older brother), boy oh boy don't want to give to much away! Georgia Cate wrote this book flawlessly, it meshes together so well! The switching from Jack to Laurelyn's point of view was seamless.  I couldn't put this book down, outstanding writing, characters and timing. I love how Laurelyn and Jack's love grew so naturally and seemed so real. I never wanted it to end but even that was flawless, can't wait for book 2! I want to warn you I did laugh, and cry and cry a little more! But then again I cry over just about everything!So now I try to patiently wait for Book 2 Beauty From Surrender, guess you know what I'll be reading May 30, 2013!!!
5	1364515200	This story had me right from the beginning.  I loved how we continued to learn more about the main characters as the story went on.....and the author did a great job of keeping us interested and wanting more.  Looking forward to book #2!
5	1364515200	I loved this book so so so much!The heroin is so fun, she is not afraid to crack a joke or speak her mind! The hero, well I am so in love with him but I often fell frustrated by him. But he'll come around can't wait for the next one:)
5	1364515200	What a joy this was to read. I thought it was a fun, loving but a bit on the short side. Can't wait for book 2.
5	1364515200	WOW!  Best book I've read in a while. I couldn't put it down. It's going to be a long wait until the end of May!!!  Awesome book!!
5	1364515200	Wow! Romance from the land down under! I love the plot and the characters. I can't wait for the next part of this intense romance!
5	1364428800	Love the book can't wait to read more from this author. Will be ready more of her books. Keep up the great work Mrs Cates
5	1364428800	Its driveing me crazy waiting for the next book!!!...I read this book in one sitting and now im sad I didnt savor it!!..Jucy..romantic...just a fun read!!!
5	1364342400	That was by far one of my new favorites!! It was so beautifully written!! The story between Laurelyn and Jack was light, fun loving, intense,super hot and steamy, heart breaking and lots of self discoveries. Every emotion you can possibly think of you can feel in this story!! The only thing that pisses me off hahaha is that we have to wait till May to get our hands on book 2. May!!! Here's hoping for an early release!!! So all in all I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone!!!
5	1364342400	I simply loved this story. Going back and forth with point of view in each chapter is my favorite format. I can't wait for the next book....and I'm sure I'll shed a few tears with that one too. My first book of Georgia Cates, a winner.
4	1364342400	Girl recently broken up goes on a three month vacation overseas with girlfriend who has it together.Girlfriend says &#34;try to get over it.since there's lots of other guys out there.Just don't get your heart set on any one guy because this is only going to last for three months and then you'll never see each other again&#34;. Girl lucks out and finds a rather mysterious but very wealthy guy who also only wants a three month affair and will be happy to 'let it go' once the time has passed. He has no intention of getting romantically involved, just there for the fun and sex.Their proper names are not exchanged.Situation seems fine for them both until near the end of the three months.She leaves for the States with an ache in her heart because she's fallen for him. He's fallen for her, too, but was too hesitant to tell her and she left without a final 'goodbye'. Frantically he hires a detective to find her in the States, but can't even give him her true name. End of book one. Next one comes out in May sometime. Must admit I'm looking forward to reading it.
5	1364256000	Omg, I think this is one of the best books ever. I can't wait for the next one. I love this book. If you love romance novels this is the book for you.
5	1364256000	I loved everything about this book. Great character storytelling and very funny!!! I cannot wait for part 2!!! And I love that the female character was v not whiney!!!
5	1364256000	This book was a bit slow to start, but once we got off the ground i feel completely for the gorgeous and very lustful Australian Jack Henry McLachlan...Three months of romance - so beautiful i fell in love too. The letter she wirtes him is so beautiful, if only she could have said those word to him.. But then there would be no 2nd book...Cant wait for next book - there is no way he will let her get away... for ever... Cummon May..
5	1364256000	I would love my very own Jack Henry, this is such a good passionate romance. Can't wait for Beauty from Surrender
5	1364256000	Georgia Cates is known more for her young adult reads (I am 45, way past young adult), so I was surprised when I found this story recommended to me.  I was at first not sure about the recommendation but figured what the heck.  Well, in the end the surprise was a good one.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters.  What started out as an agreement with no strings, became so much more.  Jack and Laurelyn have something very special that neither knew they really wanted.  I can't wait to see the story continue...  Way to go Georgia, this story was fabulous and I am now a fan!
5	1364256000	I finally find a book that I am in LOVE with...I mean IN LOVE ......and I never once checked to see if there was another one coming out which means I have to wait til May!!! Don't get me wrong ....I LOVE quite a few books but I haven't been compelled to one for quite sometime now and this one captivated me....I started reading the summary on Amazon about what it was about and literally said &#34; great...another 50 shades knock off&#34; N-O W-A-Y! This is such a great read but I'm so impatient it feels like May is forever away but thank you for the preview...and thank you for giving me something that captured all my attention and then some...very talented author....must read!
5	1364169600	Here I am again...trying to find some reason, ANY reason to not give this book a 5 star rating, but that reason can't be found! I always read the summary on a book before purchasing it to read, and even though this book came highly recommended by a friend who has never recommended a book I didn't love, after reading the summary I thought I would enjoy the book but probably not love it, and boy was I wrong! This book went beyond every expectation I had for it,  even beyond the expectations I have to consider a book "great." I fell in love with the characters, especially Laurelyn.  When writing a review I always state the message that came across TO ME, I know everyone gets different feelings and have their own takes on a book, but this one screamed to me to "EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED"  Even the best laid plans can come tumbling down and sometimes they do this in the best way possible. The characters in this book agreed on a "relationship" for 3 months, just 3 months of enjoying each others company that at the time seemed perfect, love was something that each of them, for different reasons chose to leave out of their arrangement, I guess it just goes to show you that you have no control over who, where, when, how or why you fall in love. A great book, and I cannot wait until book 2 of this series is released! Great job Georgia Cates, I look forward to reading many of your other books!
1	1364169600	Guy sees girl, decides he has to have her. Makes bizarre dating proposal with all of his psychologically twisted rules. Girl doesnt want to go along but cant help herself? Seems a lot too familiar to be enjoyable.
5	1364169600	great story / went fast / good characters with some backbone / and on some level we all know these people!
4	1364169600	I think any romance reader that like a good story would like it.  It had a good story line, not just love making.  I enjoyed the mystery in the book.
5	1364083200	This book was so good that I couldn't read fast enough!! I have had to deal with cliff hangers, but this one is killing me!! I borrowed this title, I am here to purchase. I will read and re-read this one!
5	1364083200	Love this story about Jack and Lauren and the contract. I instantly fell in love with the character of Lauren and turned every page wanting more. I have marker my calendar for book 2 and can't wait to see where it leads.
5	1364083200	This is a great story, I love how the characters come to life and you begin to feel like one on them. The bond that grows between Laurilyn and Jack is amazing they develop a relationship although not based on fact, they learn to trust each other. I was very frustrated to find out it was a cliff hanger and now I need to wait till May for the next book.
5	1364083200	I am in love with this book. I loved the concept of the story line and how well each character wasa written. The reader was falling in love with Jack as Lauelyn was, and loving every min of it!! It was a different twist on an overdone concept of rich guy wanting a girl and them fighting back and forth toying with each other's real emotions. This book layed it all out from the beginning and I loved it.Only negative was that it left on a major cliff hanger and now I am stuck waiting another 2 months for the sequel!!
5	1364083200	Get out the box of Kleenex.  Put on an Alabama album.  Settle in.  Read what he's thinking, then what she's thinking, then what they're doing.  Don't know which one of them I loved more.  This one will break your heart.  Great story.  Don't miss it.  Sequel comes out middle of May.  Can't wait.
5	1364083200	My attention never strayed from reading this book.  I might have read it all the way though except I discover at the end that this is part 1.
3	1364083200	Even though people compare it to Fifty Shades of Gray it's really not that much like it at all. But by itself it's a perfectly ok book.
5	1364083200	This book was so good. I was drawn to the characters; the power & the love, 3 weeks is so not enough! I am looking forward to the next book in this series. The story is moving to the States! Oh my!
5	1364083200	I loved it! The release of the next one can't come soon enough. I hope its before May 30th! M
1	1364083200	I usually do some research before I invest in a new book series. I'm embarrassed to admit I got caught up in the hype and jumped the gun with this purchase. I wish I could say it was well-written, I really do. On the upside, there does appear to be an enthusiastic audience for for Ms. Cate's stories. All I can say is one woman's trash is another woman's pleasure.
4	1364083200	Very good book.  I liked the story and the characters.  I only wished I had known at the beginning that it was a two book story.  I was disappointed when the first book left the story hanging.  The second book won't be out for a couple of months.  I would prefer to read the two books back to back without any time between them.
2	1363996800	I am again in a minority with respect to reviews:  I do not understand how this book got so many positive reviews!  The dialogue was pedestrian, the characters were sort of like cardboard cut-outs and there seems to be no real emotional connection between them.  I was relieved to hear from another reviewer that the Australian slang was off -- it did nothing to make the character(s) more believable.  Nevertheless, I kept reading and hoping it would get better but it was blah all the way through.  And ending it with a "cliff hanger" was a bit of a cheap trick.  As one of the few people (apparently) who was unable to finish 50 Shades of Grey, even I can tell that this is a poor attempt to do the same thing.
5	1363996800	I was hesistant to read this at first, but then couldn't put it down after I started. I can't wait to read the sequal!
5	1363910400	Good book for the cost. Enjoyed the charachters and the plot.  Not as predictable as some others of this genre.
5	1363910400	I can hardly wait for book 2 I am hoping I like it as much as this one. I recommend this book to all romance junkies myself included.
5	1363910400	I really enjoyed reading this book...couldn't stop reading till the end.  Anticipating the next book.  Hurry hurry. Write write need it soon
5	1363824000	Jack is a famous bachelor in Australia. Instead of dating and relationships he propositions women. They get him for a limited time but no real name and no long term relationships. Laurelyn is visiting Australia with her best friend. She's not used to getting "indecent proposals" from strange (and sexy) men but Laurelyn can't seem to turn him down. She decides that a meaningless relationship is just what she needs.I loved this premise. Because of their agreed upon terms there is no pretense or illusions. They both go into wanting a physical relationship and they sure do deliver. The chemistry between them was off the charts.But as their three months progress so does their relationship. The more time they spend together the more they begin to enjoy and appreciate each other for more that just the physical.  They both begin to blur the lines on their "agreement."I loved seeing how their relationship evolved over the course of the book. The progression felt very organic and came at the perfect pace.Having the duel point of view only added depth to the story. I definitely recommend this for a sexy read that has lots of heart. I also loved how music played such a big part in Laurelyn's life. Make sure to check out the awesome playlist that Georgia Cates put together. Fans of Katie Ashley, Rachael Wade, and Jessica Sorensen will enjoy this book. I will add there is a cliff hanger (a big one) but it didn't make me love the book any less. I cannot wait to read the next in the series!
5	1363824000	I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down. I smiled, laughed and cried. I've read several books over the past few weeks and this book has captured my heart...
5	1363824000	Love love loved it.  I will be following this author. Could not put it down. Great love scenes. My only thing I would of added was having the leading female a bit more feisty at certain times. I love a book with a strong female lead.
5	1363824000	hot on top of hot! great ending that makes u want more. keep up the good work. just waiting for next book and it seems too far away....
5	1363824000	Georgia Cates creates quite the story here. Book #2 doesn't come out until May, but you are left with a serious addiction to her lead man Jack Henry by the end of this book.LOVED IT!
5	1363824000	I really loved this book, was a hard one to put down. I am now desperate for the next one to come out. Would definitely recommend it!
5	1363824000	I simply loved this book. But a warning to anyone who has a twisted mind like mine: This book is not about BDSM. (I know, right?) I just figured from the title that there'd be some whipping and handcuffs, but the "pain" in the title is more emotional than physical. The sexy scenes were hot, the alternating 1st person narrative was fun to read, and the story progressed as naturally as I could believe a person disconnected from the internet could be. I can't wait for the 2nd book to come out.
4	1363824000	Beauty... Pain... Love... Denial.... This book is almost heartbreaking! How can two people be in such denial of what they share? Lauren is too afraid to show her true feelings in fear of Jack sending her packing. Jack refusing to have areal relationship and admit real feelings can exist inside of him. They are both wounded from different things. They are two people cut from different cloths.... admitting love is the worst thing possible to both of them. Lauren's heart has been deceived in the past. Jack has never really allowed his heart to feel. A three month arrangement brings both of these anti-lovers to crumbles. When their time is up, they both find themselves full of pain and regret. The merging of these two hearts is so gut-wrenching. This story is a train wreck that you want to watch with anticipation. It is almost hard to see these two not finding their happy ending. I could not put this book down. I wanted to slap these characters for denying themselves what was right in front of their faces. I am definitely awaiting the second book in this series with hopes that things will work out the way I would like....
5	1363824000	Goodness gracious what a cliffhanger........I don't think I can wait until May 30th for book 2!  Hoping for a happy ever after!
5	1363737600	I was apprehensive about the arrangement...book progressed just how I like.I can not wait for the next book.  After reading Beauty from Pain I started Going Underby Georgia, which is good but a little more YA.
5	1363737600	great story, kind of reminded me of 50 Shades, Can't wait for the next book to see where it goes from here
4	1363737600	Well it felt like I was reading a little bit of Shades of Grey. Not as hot but some moments worth continuing to read.
5	1363737600	Great book. Can't wait til the second one comes out. Loved how it started out with him not wanting her to know his name. And she goes along with it and doesn't give him her name.
4	1363737600	The idea of the story was novel and very interesting well written. Good character developement and I loved thesetting in Australia. Kept my interest right to the ending.
5	1363737600	I loved this book can't wait for the next one!!!! I thought the characters were great and couldn't put the book down!!!
5	1363737600	What a great story. Loved the fact that they got along. I really am tired of the constant fighting in love stories
5	1363737600	I read the preview a month or so ago and was not to concienced on reading this book, however, when I had nothing to read I though I would pick this kindle versionand actually ready it. I was actually suprised. I would get it a 4.5/5, just because it wa an easy/fast read. It kept me entertain, which is what I am looking for at the end of of the day.
5	1363737600	Anxiously awaiting May to get here for the next book. I hate waiting but I'm sure it'll be worth it.only thing is initially going to reread this just to remember everything now, that part stinks .
5	1363737600	For those people that are tired of having to wait for book two and book three to come out to finish a story, don't get this one yet.  Not knowing it was a serial, I bought this book and loved the story.  When I got to the end I was horrified to find that I must wait months for the next installment -- auuuggghhh!  I am getting so tired of this!!!I fell in love with the characters and their stories.  The only thing I would have changed would be to make them both a couple years older.  Jack Henry seemed more like mid thirties and Laurelyn seemed more like mid twenties, judging by their maturity levels and life experience.  It's a wonderful, romantic story that I would recommend to anyone, but wait a few months until the sequel is out.
5	1363737600	Fun premise. Really enjoyed it. So nice having a strong female character. I am looking forward to the second book.
5	1363737600	The book was really good. The story was so real. I was not able to leave it before read the end!
5	1363737600	I really liked this book and couldn't put it down! I stayed up to finish it and now have the puffy eyes to show for it! I didn't know what to expect, but it drew me in right away. I love the alternating points of view told by Laurelyn and then Jack. The sex scenes are done tastefully and heated without leaving you feel smutty like some erotica books. You definitely feel the tension and heat between the two characters and also feel Laurelyn's hurt as the book progresses.... I can't wait for the sequel. May 30 can't get here soon enough...
5	1363651200	It was a great book.  Even though the ending kind of left off with somewhat of a cliffhanger, I was glad to see the first chapter for the next book at the end.  It was overall well written and made you love the characters in the book.
5	1363651200	So well written. Such an easy read. Love the story line and the characters are amazing. After reading this book you may have a hard time moving on to the next book. I plan to just reread until the next book comes out.
5	1363651200	Oh my... I can't wait to read the follow up.  Great story.  The perfect amount of everything required in a romance novel.
5	1363651200	Seriously the ending made me crave for more!! I can't wait for the second book. Ugh.... loved, loved this book, it reminded me of fifty shade of grey.
4	1363651200	Is anyone else getting a little tired of this rich man getting a girl theme where most of the story is sex, travel, eating out and pampering the girl who is not a prostitute but is by definition? Oh, and little to no actual plot.  It's just that I have read two of these in a row now, and I really do enjoy the story and characters, I just feel a little shallow for not expecting there to be more substance and for buying into the idea that these girls are just living a dream and are not paid sex buddies.  Sorry, I am just wondering as I write this review and liking a story that was mostly just sex.  I used to read love stories and I guess I am missing what used to be called normal relationships.So Laurelyn is propositioned by the very rich (of course!) Jack McLachlan the day she arrives in Australia to be his girl for the next 3 months - no strings attached - at the end, they will both just walk away.  At first she is insulted by the request, but reconsiders and takes him up on his offer.  By the fact that she doesn't reveal all the details to her best friend, such as: she doesn't even know his real name and she is basically a bootie-call, she knows she is making a really bad decision.  Jack has done this 12 times before in the last 4 years, making her number 13, an unlucky number.  Red flags are jumping everywhere.Laurelyn is in Australia with her best friend Addison and staying at Addison's brother's flat.  Addison's brother Ben has an instant attraction to Laurelyn, but she doesn't feel the same way.  Addison is quickly sleeping with Ben's friend Zac, making Laurelyn free to be pursued by Jack.The setting in Australia and the vineyards is fun and romantic and makes a great background to their budding feelings for each other.  The fact that Laurelyn is a pole dancer is also unique.  There is A LOT of sex in this book and predictable plot, but really well written.  Rich guy wants girl for short term and unexpectedly falls for her, but won't admit it to himself.Like most NA there is super descriptive sex that could be used as a teaching manual, some profanity (f-word, gd, sht)  "This bed was meant for making love, but that isn't what we did. It never is" - LaurelynIf you like the New Adult stories by M. Leighton, Abbi Glines, and Shelly Crane then you will like this one.  They all use the very same formula and add their own unique and fun writing style.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (1.99)Would I read it again?  MaybeWould I recommend it to friends? Yes
5	1363651200	I've taken a few days to get my thoughts together on this one. It took me by surprise. When I read the synopsis I thought this should be good and I'll probably like it. Well I was wrong I LOVED it! I loved Laurelyn; to me she was so real. Her situation was a little out of the norm but hey it is a work of fiction. The fact that Jack said they would be entering into their relationship without pretense Laurelyn was able to relax and be comfortable. She did not act phony, needy or whiny (which I hate in a female character). She clearly has a past in which has damaged her but I did not feel she played the victim or dwelled on it. I thought she was strong when she needed to be, reserved with her emotions (or at least pretended to be) she was also funny and sarcastic. She gave Jack a run for his money in all ways. Jack is honest right from the get go about what he is looking for and NOT looking for He finally wears her down and gets her to agree to his little relationship game. Right from the get go Jack realizes that she is very different from his previous women and as much as it scares him he cannot stop himself. Their relationship progresses with some drama along the way. I'm not going to say the ending was any bit of a surprise but it left me feeling pretty drained and quite teary. One of those endings you feel in your gut as you cry. Is it May yet!!!!! Now I'm just waiting on Beauty from Surrender.
5	1363564800	Couldn't  put this book down really enjoy the characters in this book. Summer cant come too soon for the follow up book to this one.
4	1363564800	I really enjoyed Beauty From Pain! The characters and plot were well developed. I really hope that the two main characters find each other and admit they love each other. I give Beauty From Pain 4 stars!
5	1363564800	This book had me from the first page. Laurelyn and Jack Henry's story will suck u in.  You can can defiantly relate to them if you have ever been hurt and loved. This book will leave you wanting more! I am so sad I have to wait until this summer to read book2 Beauty from Surrender! I found me a new favorite author you go Georgia Cates!
5	1363564800	this is one of the best love story I have ever read, next to 50 shades trilogy.  It was heart warming and can't wait for the next book that is coming out on May 31, 2013......
5	1363564800	Jack Henry is a man you can easily fall for.  This book is all about a true love story, with bumps in the road.  Book 2 cannot come fast enough!
5	1363564800	Once you start reading this book, you can't put it down. The second book in the series comes out May 30th, and I can't wait to see the story continued. Georgia Cates has become one of my most favorite authors because of her intelligent story telling from a his/her point of view and the depth she took the characters. This was an amazing read and I put the author up there with my other favorite author, Sylvain Reynard.
4	1363564800	I was impressed with the story line. I actually like that it was a &#34;no personal inof&#34; kind of thing. The ending was good too, I cannot wait to see how the next book turns out. Good job, Georgia.
5	1363564800	Loved this book! Top 10 best books I have read in the last 3 months! Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read more from the author.
5	1363564800	Thus book kept me entertained the whole time. Very well-written. I cannot wait til the sequel comes out! Very impressed!
3	1363564800	I liked it. Some typos and some areas that were hard to understand. Overall, I thought it was a good book and will be reading the second when it comes out in May.
3	1363478400	Reminded me too much of Fifty Shades, but.. now I'm ready to read the next one to keep with the series so it got my interest enough for that.
5	1363478400	Admittedly, this was not what I first expected. Nonetheless, I was hooked from page one. I was delighted to find that the storyline was not contrived and the characters had unexpected depth. I became a attached to the characters by the book's end and was sad to say goodbye. I am anxiously awaiting the next in Cates' Beauty Series.
5	1363478400	WOW! I just can't believe this book. I devoured it in less than a day, really couldn't put it down! I love the story, however clich&eacute; it may sound, and totally fell in love with everything about it: the characters the scenery, Jack's mom (who can't wait to get him married)...Oh, and the sex! Really hot! My only complaint is the wait for a second book. This is what I have most in these series... why do they have to be so spaced out? Anyway, I totally considered it worth my time!
2	1363478400	the premise of this story was promising but the characters were not developed enough to make you care about them one way or another. there were many similarities to 50 shades and the like but the writing was disjointed and overall the book was very disappointing to say the least.
5	1363478400	Loved it very, very much.  I hope there is a sequel because I want to know that they ended up together.
4	1363478400	I'd been anticipating this novel for some time, and it really was as good as I hoped it would be! I really FELT the characters, grew to understand them... Laurelyn is probably my favorite female protagonist to date, because she really avoids the typical "poor me, I'm so sad, there's nothing special about me but Mr. Wonderful over there still thinks I'm hot" image. Jack Henry is... complex. Far more complex than I originally thought, and at the very end of the book, I FINALLY understood him. It's a great story to get lost in, but... I had that gut-wrenching feeling in the pit of my stomach the entire time. It isn't a light read because of the emotions of the main characters, and I shed a few tears throughout. The only reason I'm not giving this book 5 stars is because it reminded me of On Dublin Street, which I loved, but the similarities were disconcerting. Obviously Cates didn't mean to encroach on Samantha Young's story, because I saw that she thanked her in the acknowledgements, but still, the similarities were impossible to miss which made me feel almost guilty because it was so similar to another authors work. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book and will be highly anticipating the sequel. Would I recommend it? Yes. Will I reread it? Probably. A note to future readers: go in open minded and try to ignore the similarities to On Dublin Street, because it will take away that 5-star potential.
5	1363478400	I loved this book! It does take some adjustment due to the weird start of the relationship but it's definitely worth the read!I didn't want to put this book down,not for a second. Lauralyn is a very likable character and while Jack has his quirks, I fell in love with him completely. There are definitely timed ever  I wanted to yell at both of them and time  that I laughed  out loud. All in all, I really enjoyed  this book and would recommend it to people. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
4	1363478400	I really liked this book. It was a little slow at the beginning but once I got through it I could not put it down. I am excited for the next book
5	1363478400	I am absolutely in love with this book and anxiously awaiting the next! I laughed, cried, and was kept wondering what would develop next between these characters. The love scenes were a bonus to the story as well!
5	1363478400	Georgia Cates is fast becoming one of my favorite authors! All her contemporary romances have what I want in a HEA book- great chemistry and romance between the H and h, some angst, and of course, the HEA. This book ends on a major cliffhanger BUT it does not take away from the romance! Fans of GC and HEA will eagerly look forward to the sequel, which is rumored for May 30! I CANNOT wait until then...
5	1363478400	Such a good book. I can't wait for book #2. The author did a great job with the characters. I didn't want to put the boom down. I read it in 2 days! This is a must read for sure.
5	1363478400	This book had me from the beginning.  It is a fun read and super sexy.  I just love Jack Henry!
5	1363478400	Love it, can't wait for the sequel.  I have it in my Kindle but plan to purchase the paperback version as well. The characters were great, and the plot was very interesting. Can't wait to see where we go in the second book.P.S.  The chick on the cover....her fingernails bother me something fierce. Just saying. :-/
5	1363392000	If you love romance this is a must read! It is definatley one of the best books i have read. Very well written! Great Job Georgia I am so looking forward to book two.
5	1363392000	If you like 50 shades you will like this. Can't wait for the next one to come out in May. Good characters somewhat predictable plot but it is so well written that I overlooked it.
4	1363392000	Jack Henry was darn near perfect in my eyes! This book is on the short side and I read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. I completely get how when you read some books the couple and their chemistry doesn't grab you. I've read some biggies that others loved and I didn't feel them. Different things do it for different people. I DID feel this couple. I had tears running down my face the last 20% of the book, so it definitely grabbed me!I loved both main characters and am anxious to see where book two finds them. With her chosen career and being back in America, I think there's just alot that the author can do with book two. That's another thing, some books have a cliffhanger ending and I think, "why does there need to be a second book?" because not enough happened in the first!I didn't feel that way with this one.In my opinion this is not a FSOG wanna be as some have said. I know there's alot of those out there. The only thing they have in common is the man wanting a no strings relationship. Jack treated her well and there's no bdsm or screwed up childhood here. I can't wait for more Jack Henry:)
5	1363392000	UGH! Said I would not read any other series unless they were all published.  I bought this not realizing it was the 1st of a series.  I was so dissapointed that it is to be continued but not that I read it.  It was sooooo good.  I can't wait until the next one.  Actually I have about two others I am waiting on to come out as well.  So with that being said, I will read other series but only if they are all published.  I can't stand the suspense. Thanks Georgia.
5	1363392000	I couldn't put it down!  The story is similar to fifty shades, but this book is better. They need to make this a movie and the second book is not even released yet!  Loved it!Susan
5	1363305600	You know a book has sucked you in when you find yourself trying to read one more paragraph at a red light or trying to sneak some reading in while sitting at your desk at work (and trust me, it's not my lunch hour either). Or better yet, it's time to head home from work but you sit in the parking lot at work in your vehicle trying to finish one more chapter because you know time us limited when you get home to your family. Needless to say, I LOVED this story. My heart was on the floor bleeding at the end for Laureley and I'm counting the days for the 2nd book to come out. May cannot get here soon enough!!
5	1363305600	I would give this 4.5 stars.After reading some really lackluster books recently, this surprised me.  I love this genre of 'new adult' and this is a shining example of it done correctly.  I'm not going to go into the details of the book; the synopsis does that.  What I liked most was the characters and my emotional investment in them.  I could not put this book down...to the point that I woke up this morning with my kindle on my face.I feel like this is the type of ending that a series needs.  We don't know all of their secrets and there is so much more to learn.  I can't wait for the second book.The one thing I didn't like was something common, it seems, in books today.  I am not a fan when every man the female character encounters is obsessed with her.  It isn't realistic and it is a bit annoying.  Granted, it isn't a prevalent in this novel as some in the genre.  We get it...she is attractive.  Not every guy has to be stupid over her...only the main male character ;-)
4	1363305600	I loved Georgia Cates story about (Jack) and (Laurelyn).  This story from Austria is sort of mystery, but OH  what a HOT .mystery.  Georgia Cates is a very good writer--she is a romantic, DESCRIPTIVE, suspenseful, HOT writer.  In this story SHE keeps this couple incognito from each other through the whole book.  They are great together and he is so sexy and they are a lot like &#34;Anna and Christian&#34; in the EL James--50 Shades of Grey story in the sex department.  I would recommend this book for anyone who does not have to go to work the next day.  It is a definite  ALL Night Read!
5	1363305600	I'm pretty critical about books, but this one had it all!  I like a book with alot of steam, good dialogue, and characters I love, and this meet all the above criteria!  My only regret is that I didn't find it until May so I could read the follow up immediately.  This went into my favorites library immediately.
5	1363219200	Totally amazing! Loved the characters and story line! Can't believe she ends it on a cliff hanger! Great book! Bzygal
5	1363219200	Loved this book! Writing is very good and the story is interesting. can't wait for the second part and discover what else the author will bring in
5	1363219200	I read a lot of books where after they finally hook up you are just waiting for something to go wrong, which is the climax of most books. So without spoiling anything for readers, this author kept enough going on in the book to keep you interested even after the first hook up. As for the climax it was placed perfectly in the book to get you crying out in AGONIZING PAIN for the next book!!!! I can't say much more without spoiling the book but the author did a great job of keeping her readers interested until that fatal (me being dramatic) moment.
5	1363219200	Great read! The book made me laugh out loud and shed a few tears. The characters were easy to believe. I enjoyed reading it from both J&l;'s POV.Huge cliffhanger which I did not care for. However I can't wait until May 2013 for the next book!
5	1363219200	I do recommend it to read this book it very good and you get to read his side and her side of the story which is great!!
5	1363219200	I fell in love with the characters.  I hope we finds her and she plays her song for him.Can't wait for the next book.
5	1363219200	This book was a page turner and I am so ready for the sequel. She had him from the beginning...he just had a huge relationship mental block. But he felt love and we all could see that. Everything he did was love. Please hurry with book 2!
5	1363219200	I thought this was a good book, great love story. Reminded me a little of 50 Shades of Grey, but without all the S&M , I can't wait for part two.
5	1363219200	Thank you Georgia! I LOVE LOVE this book. Can't wait for #2. Laurelyn's character was well built and I really enjoyed her southern spunk. I think I am still swooning over Jack. I love how elusive he is.
5	1363219200	Great book! Didnt know it was a series before I read this one but now I Can't wait for the next one!
2	1363132800	I feel like authors should be required to write on the front cover or description that a book ends on a cliffhanger.  Saying something is part of a series doesn't count because most series I read follow a one-book-one-plot format. That being said, I enjoyed this book until it just ended 85% through (and there I was thinking there would be 15% more of plot).
5	1363132800	This book went places I didn't expect but it was beautiful and heartbreaking. Very abrupt ending that will drive  me to drink until the next book is out.
5	1363132800	I love it...I would highly recommned it.  Can't wait till the 2nd book,  I HOPE ITS SOOOON!!!!!Do you think it can be sooner than the Summer as they have planned.?
4	1363132800	I read a lot of romance books and you can get such in a rut sometimes of same story different name. This story is a cure for that. There are a lot of typos but if you can get past that the story id worth it.
5	1363132800	Couldn't put it down and now eagerly anticipating the sequel in May!! What a great romantic love story mixed with some lusty magic :) LOVE!!
5	1363046400	It's a must read! Now I'm definitely taking a vacation to Australia!!! I love this series! I can't wait for the next book.
4	1363046400	Really enjoyed the book, look forward to the next book. Would recommend this book and can't wait for the next instalment.
3	1363046400	I struggle giving the story only three stars because I read it in one sitting, which typically means I love the story so much that I cannot put it down.  I did not love this story, but I did ultimately become invested in the main characters and wanted to know where the story would take them.  At the beginning, the book was average, predictable and a little boring, but after Laurelyn accepted Jack's offer, the story really began.  If you are looking for steamy sex scenes, this is not the book for you.  Scenes were relatively tame compared to Fifty Shades and Bared to You.
3	1363046400	I found Beauty From Pain to be an enjoyable read.  It was an interesting story and didn't stress the reader with a lot of unnecessary details making it too hard to follow.What I didn't like was the fact that the book doesn't end.  Apparently the author wants you to buy the next book in the series.  I will probably do so but it was extremely annoying not to know the ending at the time I finished the book.  I would have given it another star had she finished it in the traditional manner.Not ever reading anything from Georgia Cates before, I'm not sure if she frequently uses this tactic to entice the reader into buying her next book.
5	1363046400	I could hardly put this book down.  Just the right amount of sex, romance, and everything else in between.  I thought I saw at the end of this that Georgia Cates has another one to go with it but I couldn't find anything about it or when it comes out.
4	1363046400	good read, cant wait for the next in series.  But what i really love is the suggested playlist for the book.  This has become kind of a trend for some of the contempory fiction authors.  The authors provide a list of songs that they suggest you listen to as you're reading the book.  This playlist I thought was amazing.  Very well thought out and reflected the emotions in the book very well, not to mention some awesome music. The music was not what i would consider too mainstream; I only recognized a few of the songs or artists.  It's been a couple of months since finishing the book but i still pull up the playlist when i'm wanting something smooth and soulful.  I would recommend that the authors begin to put the recommended playlists at the beginning of the book, especially kindle editions.  I didn't find it until i was finished.  If you're looking for a good, emotional read, this is a good choice.  Just flip to the back and prep your playlist before you get started.  It'll be worth the extra work.
5	1363046400	Read it in a day!  I couldn't put it down and can't wait for the second one to come out.
5	1363046400	Loved, loved, loved this book. I can not wait until the next book. So many things left to close up. The fire, the poisoning, the exes. Can't wait!!!
5	1363046400	LOVED LOVED LOVED this book.Okay, I've been reading a ton & for reference sake let it be said my type of book is the hot, emmotionally damaged, alpha male, rich guy & whomever. So back to I read a ton. I'll be the first to admit when I finish something good I'm left feeling a bit pouty that the book is over & I have to move on to another book. I might have been in that frame of mind when I started Beauty From Pain because it started slow for me. I couldn't tell you when exactly that changed, but somewhere along the way it became a "can't put it down" and then ended with a biatch of a cliffhanger. I am now totes preoccupied waiting for part two & I'm beyond pouty about it! Jack... loved him. My type of male lead. I'm genuinely interested in what his issues are. The cliffhanger, while yes, I know logically that's always where the book was going to end, I was still beyond tormented when it did. Laurelyn, loved her too. I would have done the same thing at the end there & really, isn't that all we want from our "heroines?" To feel like, yeah I'm with you girl. Not "you crazy psycho WHY are you doing xyz"?I'd highly recommend the following series as well. Please be forewarned that as of March 2013 only Mile High is complete. The other 4 series all have sequels pending. Argh!Bared to You series (Sylvia Day)This Man series (Jodi Ellen Malpas)Mile High series (RK Lilley)Knight series (Kitty French)Naked series (Raine Miller)I am already looking forward to rereading this book right before Beauty from Surrender comes out.
5	1363046400	I have never felt that emotional while reading a story! I tried to hold off on reading this because I knew there would be a book 2, but I heard so much about it. Now I am so glad I read it. Beautifully written. Oh how I hope book 2 comes out earlier than expected. I need more.
5	1363046400	Great read! 2 strong characters, but I really liked the heroine. She gave as good as she got. She was not bashful and dependent on him. Nice change from the current reads out there. I honestly can't wait until May 30.
5	1363046400	WOW! This book was soo amazing. Jack Henry is an amazing person and makes you fall head over heals for him! He is so sweet in his own way and honestly, I never hated the main character like I do in most books. It was love in the begining and I can not wait until the next book comes out!!
5	1363046400	Totally caught me by surprise.  I'm loving this story!  Will definitely read again and again!!! I laughed and cried!  I can't wait till May!!! Need to find out what happens!!!!
5	1363046400	This book was so great!  I can't wait for the new one to come out in May, I will be the first to buy it!
5	1363046400	This book was a fairly quick read for me so I do wish that it were longer.  But, I loved the characters and the story.  This one just grabbed me!  I cried at the letter at the end and the ending.  It was not HEA but the author did that to lead into the next book, Beauty from Surrender due out May 30th.  I am not a fan of endings like that because it left you dangling but I get the rationale behind it.  I wonder if this could have been one book?  Although, I would love to see Jack Henry and Laurelyn's relationship grow and see them marry and become a family.  That along with the stalker and winery issues, as well as her music career would be enough for a second book.  But, I definitely need a HEA for these two! I personally think that many authors these days are giving us quantity (trilogies, etc.) but the books are often lacking the quality.  This book had the quality so give it a read!  You won't be sorry!
5	1363046400	I could not wait to review this book. It was utterly amazing and it left me speechless at times. I felt empty when it was over and can't wait until the next book comes out! It was very well written and I enjoyed the perspective style writing from each of the characters. I really enjoyed that it took place in another country, making **SPOILER ALERT** Lauralyn's departure even more agonizing. Knowing that there will be thousands of miles between them that must be bridged, makes me agonize over the next installment! For me, this was right up there with the LOVE story in Fifty Shades and Bared to You series, which are some of my favorite books. Enjoy this escape!
5	1362960000	Wow this follow up was as great as the original.  Am waiting for the next book in the series.  If you enjoy tough love and crazy devotion this is a series for you
5	1362960000	I have to say I was very impressed with this book.  I love it from the very beginning and could not put it down.  Jack Henry and Laurelyn are a couple you will continue to root for and want to see nothing but good come to them.  I can't wait for the 2nd book to see what happens with this couple.
5	1362960000	My friend, once again, recommended this novel to me and ranted and raved.  So happy she did!  It was a very great story, even though it sounds like the same ol' story line.  The way the story was developed and the secrecy was truly great.  I am sooo excited for the next book in the series.  Jack is one major hottie!  A rich man that knows his wine? SIGN ME UP.
5	1362960000	WOW.  I love the controlling man requesting an arrangement that didn't leave her a victim.  She was still very much in control and taking what she wanted from the relationship without being a crazy b*tch.  The characters are lovable, even the ones you hate.  This is my favorite book so far in 2013 and I have read over 50 this year.
4	1362960000	After reading a lot of the reviews, I had to download this one. I really did like this book.  Not quite 5 stars for me.  There was just something missing.  I did like the main characters and the flow of the story.  Jack put me off a bit in the beginning but I warmed up to him as the story went along. I loved his family. I kept wondering how the book was going to play out. When I hit 82 or 83% on my Kindle and that was the end, I think my jaw did drop a bit. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series though.
5	1362873600	I do hate endings that make you need to buy the next book, because they make me feel manipulated, yet I this time it's OK with me. I liked the writing style, reading this book was really smooth and enjoyable, I usually skip over long descriptions and too much detail, so I found this book was just right - nothing to much, but enough to get the pictures in your mind complete and lively. The characters are realistic enough although I've been getting fed up with the &#34;rich guy meets simple girl&#34; scenario, but Laurelyn has this creative edge in her that makes her anything but simple, I really liked that. I am a creative person myself and I could relate to what she was feeling, living in the music and feeling that need to drop everything and bring out the creative project that's taking over your mind. Those moments made her quite real for me.The plot is somewhat predictable, but that's also OK with me in this particular book, I was looking for an easy read, and I found it in this story. The price of course helped me make my decision when I was purchasing it. And I finished reading with a feeling that I got way more than I had paid for, isn't that a pleasurable feeling?I want to thank the reviewers who helped me make my choice, because I spent some really lovely time reading this one!
5	1362873600	I love this book and I love Jack Henry and Laurelyn! I cannot wait until the next installment of this series that will continue us on their journey. A really great read that I thoroughly enjoyed! Fantastic job Georgia!
3	1362873600	Don't like the ending because it's not an ending.  It tries to force you to buy another book to see what happens
5	1362873600	This book was beyond amazing! I couldn't put if down! I absolutely cannot wait for book #2 in this series! WOW. May 2013 can't get here soon enough!!
1	1362873600	I started to read this twice, but eventually I deleted it, as I simply couldn't get into it.  I didn't like the style of writing.
5	1362873600	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I could not put it down! Next thing I know it is 5 am and I find myself disappointed that I have to wait a couple months to read the next book in the series. Highly recommend this book.
5	1362873600	I fell in love with this book, it's great I love these two characters so much ! I can't wait until the next book comes out , it can't be fast enough !!
4	1362873600	Why must all these girls need such strong men?  Well here is another example. But, it is a good story if that is your pleasure.
5	1362873600	Omg I love the freshness and newness of the book. The girls are out going and so into days world. The guy is a guy. Not some older crazy over powering guy that makes the girl seem like she is 5. It's funny and cute and I can't wait until May 30th when the new one gets released
5	1362787200	This is exactly the type of story I had been searching for. The storyline was well written and I enjoyed there been some humor thrown in the mix. I fell in love with the main characters from the get go... I don't often find a book that is hard for me to put down, but I have actually read this one in less than 24 hours.This book is going into my favorites, because the story completely consumed me. I cannot wait for the second book, which I must say was the only disappointing factor in this whole equation... Because truly, how am I supposed to wait until the freaking summer? Damn you publishers!!!
4	1362787200	Holy hotness! I adored both characters and didn't want it to end. *sigh*  Can't wait for the sequel and I'm hoping for a happily ever after for these two ;)
5	1362787200	Where to begin...Nashville hottie musician meets super rich, super hot super secretive wine maker.  A 3 month no strings attached relationship is what he wants and after being promised that it will be the time of her life she says yes.  Now her 3 month vacation in Australia has turned into an arrangement.No real names, just companionship, sex, okay - really hot sex and enough time to fall hard enough to get hurt.I loved this story, but it was a cliffhanger.  I knew it was going to happen, but I still spent the last 20% of the book in tears.  I think I fell madly in love with both of them...
4	1362787200	Well this book was a very pleasant surprise!! It is sort of reminiscent to 50 Shades of Grey minus the kinkiness, though there are plenty of HOT&#60; HOT sex scenes and plenty of emotional turmoil.At first I wasn't too thrilled about the concept, millionaire control freak who wants a relationship on his terms and hell, he doesn't even want to provide his real name to his partners. Control freak much? However, as the story progresses it drew me in. I really enjoyed the story and you get to see why he is a bit protective of his identity.I really liked Jack's character, he is gorgeous, late 20s,sensitive, and learns to genuinely care about Laurelyn and heck the impossible finally happens to him and he meets his game changer.The book does have a cliffhanger, but it frankly doesn't quite leave you hanging. However, I'm definitely interested to see how the story will pan out. I frankly I can't wait to read book 2. So please hurry with book 2
5	1362787200	Laurelyn needs a break from life. She's lucky her BFF has a brother living in Australia. The girls decide to spend their summer with Addison's brother. Addison is quite the player and hooks up with her brother's Aussie friend. Laurelyn is getting over a bad relationship and tries to ignore the interest Addison's brother Ben has for her. It's not hard when she also catches the interest of Jack Henry. This guy has crafted his player skills over the last 4 years, He never gives his real name and has a time limit set for the relationship from the beginning. He promises Laurelyn the time of her life. And honestly if I was her I couldn't have refused the deal either.Ben is not happy about Jack Henry making a play for Laurelyn. He turns into a major ass when he interrupts Jack Henry as he's about to stroke her "slut button" outside the apartment. When Ben later kisses Laurelyn against her will, she accepts Jack Henry's offer to move in with him for the remainder of her time in Australia. He starts to find it hard to be away from her. Even his family pushes him to spend his time with her instead of them.Now, Jack has his reasons for keeping his identity a secret. One of his exe's is bat s*** crazy. I have to wonder if we are going to hear more from her in book 2. But when Jack's father is taken to the hospital for a possible heart attack, he let's go of his need for secrecy and clings to Laurelyn. She gets to meet his family and they quickly fall in love with her. He even finds himself feeling very jealous on more than one account. Laurelyn puts her developing feelings into song. I'm really hoping the author will include the lyrics for her songs in the next book.When Jack realizes he asked Laurelyn for a relationship based on lies, he feels he's as much a bastard as her ex is. This also makes him want to have more then just sex. Now he wants to make love to Laurelyn. This is one of several extremely hot and sweet moments. Now Laurelyn knows without a doubt what her feelings for Jack are and he turns into a confused idiot. He's never been in love before and instead of saying I love you, he tells her how much he's going to miss her. He thinks he has more time to figure out what he's feeling but guess what? He doesn't! And then the book ends and I was like...OH HELL NO!Laurelyn heads back to America broken hearted. The author gives us a teaser for Beauty From Surrender and it's pretty intense. I cannot wait for book two.
5	1362787200	I'm in love with this book!!!!! It only took me two days to read I couldn't put it down. Pleasuring keep us waiting long for part two of this series!!!!!
4	1362787200	I think it was good. I luv it! And I can't wait for part two.luv it luv it luv it
5	1362700800	I wish I hadn't started this until the second one was out. It was good and I cant Wait. HURRY
4	1362700800	Was not expecting this. Much better then the reviews. Can not wait to see lachlans next move! I was taken away.
5	1362700800	Loved the Australian angle to this.  I am waiting for the next book.  These 2 have it bad for each other.  I loved reading about them.
5	1362614400	My only complaint what it went too fast, then I found out the next book of the series wasn't finished yet. I'm hooked and anxiously awaiting surrender. Wish we could just buy the whole book at once, seems to be a trend.
5	1362614400	You fall in love with the whole story!!! So romantic in an awesome kind of way. You won't regret this one.
5	1362614400	This is the book to get, you won't regret it once you start it will be impossible to put down, only thing I regret is that I finished the book in one night and have to wait for the next book, to all the 50 shades of grey fanatics sry I find Beauty from pain to be much better, Georgia Cates has become one of my favorite.
4	1362614400	Jack is everything a woman could want but of course has issues, has completely meaningless relationships where both parties remain anonymous for the duration of the relationship until he grows tired of them.  That is until Laurelyn sings her way into his heart, stubborn hot Aussie in Oz what more could you want? I enjoy it and it was well written, and who doesn't love the Aussie slang? The book leaves you begging for more!
5	1362614400	If you loved Fifty Shades of Grey, then this should definitely be on your must read list.  Rich, handsome man with relationship issues, an emotionally scarred average girl dealing with bad childhood memories.  Past loves interfering in the present as they try to hang on too tight instead of accepting that it is over and moving on.  The characterization was fantastic and I loved both the male and female main characters.  The really unique part that I loved the most was the extraordinary writing style.  This was a continuous story with no backtracking, but was written in a dual first person perspective.  Odd chapters were her viewpoint and even were his viewpoint.  Author gives us nice insight into both characters thoughts without unnecessary repetitions of the plot.  Highly recommend this book and looking forward to the sequel. If you had difficulty with the BDSM aspects of FSOG, then this is a much better choice for you.  Still steamy loves scenes, but no BDSM.
5	1362614400	I can't wait until the next book comes out.  At the end I was actually in tears and now have to wait  : (
5	1362614400	This was my first book by Georgia Cates and I can't wait for the second book to come out.  I love how she told the story from both Laurelyn and Jack's POV.  Laurelyn's character is witty, funny, and vulnerable, but you don't see how vulnerable she is until she spends more time with Jack.  You also see how Jack falls for Laurelyn and sees that she is different from the other women he has been with.  It also shows that three months can have a big impact on your life.
5	1362614400	I found this book completely refreshing!  I loved it!  I REALLY wish other readers would stop comparing books - In my mind, this is a totally new genre.  So I guess I understand the comparisons.  But that would be like comparing one historical Scottish romance to another (just an example).  Yes, Fifty Shades, Crossfire Series, Gabriel's Inferno, Blackstone Affair... on and on. They are all wonderful in their own right.  And I love them all!  What I enjoyed about this book is the refreshing characters.  The story has well developed characters and the ending leaves you wanting soooo much more! Jack & Laurelyn both seem so real to me and just jump off the pages with their sincerity.  I loved Laurelyn's character; strong, beautiful, smart, talented, but down to earth and real.  I could really imagine meeting someone like her.  And the love scenes are HOT!  The sex wasn't so drawn out that it took over the book.  There is an actual story line here... and I'm in love with it.
5	1362614400	Wasn't quite sure when I first started reading this but it kept me so interested that I could not stop reading it. I had to know what was to become of these 2. Darn that Ben but you knew that he was going to make Jack Henry's life miserable. I can't wait for the begiining of the summer so I can continue this story!! It is really a good read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I give it 5 stars as it is that good!! Let's see where this story takes us and if it continues in Nashville with Blake Phillips!!Ms. Cates did not disappoint with this one!! Good job!
5	1362614400	I had a hard time getting into reading the book during the airplane ride.  But when everyone got together then could get into reading the book. Eating on next book hoping :-) they find each other again.
5	1362614400	This was the best book I've read this year!!!! Absolutely cannot wait for part 2!!!! I want to go to Australia now
4	1362528000	As with many of the books in this genre, a young beautiful woman gets caught up with a slightly older, multi-millionaire and enjoys a whirlwind relationship that is based on physical lust, turning into love.  This is one of three books I believe and by the end, you truly want to see what happens.
5	1362528000	It is a page turner I can't wait for May 30th  for the next book to come out .... I loved this book I read it in one day
5	1362528000	I can honestly say that this is one of the best books that I have had the pleasure of reading lately and the only one where I actually look forward to the sequel. I almost wish that I hadn't discovered this book till the series was complete because the suspense is killing me. I hope the sequel can hurry!
5	1362528000	Couldn't put the book down!!! Great read, awesome characters!!! Jack & Laurelyn are perfect  beautiful, complex, secretive, amazing in bed...
5	1362528000	I loved it!! I liked it better than 50 shades and crossfire novels because it was more realistic to me. But I do wish book two was out to buy
5	1362528000	I absolutely loved this book!  Can't wait for the next in the series - the cliffhanger ending killed me!First time reading this author, but will not be the last for sure!
5	1362441600	I simply loved this book.  Was the premise the most realistic one out there?  Absolutely not, but that made it all the more fun.  Georgia Cates wrote such this beautiful tale of love sneaking up on people.  Two broken people from halfway around the world, finding each other and discovering themselves at the same time. Here are some of the things I really liked about this book:*Jack and Laurelyn were both really likable characters, despite their flaws.  Trust me, they had flaws a plenty.*The book alternated points of view by chapter.  This gave us glimpses into what each of them was thinking, but in a very easy and fun to read way.*Ummm, yes this book may cause your Kindle to smoke due to some very hot scenes.*Silly as it may be, the fact that very early on in the book Georgia poked fun at her own genre made me smile and actually made me look at the book a bit differently.*The secondary characters, though not overly present, added an interesting dynamic to "their" story.  I would say this was especially true for both Ben and Jack's mom.*The ending.  Well, not really the ending, but the fact that Georgia's sneak peak after the book ended made all the nervousness I felt reading the last chapter go away.  This is a two (maybe three) part series, so it was not all tied up in a pretty little bow.  Many authors would have left us completely wondering if there would be a next book.  She gave us just enough of a glimpse that I was able to turn off my kindle with a smile on your face.If you like contemporary NA romances with a ton of heat, likable yet broken characters and "this could never happen but *sigh* I wish it could" premise, this book is probably for you.  I am so looking forward to what happens next.I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
5	1362441600	I absolutely loved this book.  The angst, twist and turns. I cannot wait for the next installment in this Series!!  Job Well Done
5	1362441600	I love love loved this book!!!!  I read a lot and this has become my new favorite book!!  I fell in love with the characters.. they had such great banter and you felt what they were going through.  I'm absolutely in love with the way this author writes!  I need book 2, like yesterday!!!
4	1362441600	Can't wait for the next book! I find myself checking the new release list to see if the next installment comes out earlier than announced.
5	1362441600	Stumbled upon this book decided to read it. To my surprise I loved it!!!! I fell in love with both Jack Henry and Laurelyn. I can't wait to continue reading the series.
5	1362441600	I know this book is reminding everyone of 50 Shades, but I really loved the story. It was so moving and sweet and yes I'm buying the next one when it comes out. No, I didn't buy all of the 50 Shades because I thought it was blah.
5	1362441600	The best way to describe this story is hot! This steamy love story left me wanting more. I can't wait for the sequel.
5	1362441600	I finished up this book late last night and then tossed and turned for about an hour because of the CLIFFHANGER ending! Yes, Georgia Cates wrote an awesome book. It's definitely NOT for younger readers due to sexual content and the language that is used.Laurelyn Prescott and Jack McLachlan have a similar relationship as some certain characters in "Fifty Shades" but I really liked this author's approach better.  The first few chapters were a little slow for me but after that I was absorbed in the story.  The passion and  the emotional journey for both characters will have you wanting more.  My eyes were misty near the end and it left me breathless.There's just something to say about a book that stays in your mind all day.  The author really made the characters believable and I'm hooked.  I cannot wait until the next book comes out later this year.  I highly recommend this one if you haven't read it yet.
5	1362441600	I absolutely LOVED this book. LOVED the way the author jumps right into the story line of these two characters that are amazing together! Also love that the author chose to make the characters fun and easy. No long lasting arguments or two people running away from each other due to fear of commitment. These two characters are reality of what it takes to make a relationship work.....have fun together, take care of each other, and don't waste precious time arguing over petty things!!  Will be waiting impatiently for the rest of the story!!
5	1362355200	I'm very glad I decided to read this book.  It was a very good read and I finished it in 2 days.  The cliffy ending is torment but knowing that book 2 is coming out soon is a little bearable.Yes, their story is very unconventional and fast.  What girl in their right mind would up and move in with a guy she barely knows or make an agreement with?GUESS WHAT?..IT DOESNT MATTER...ITS FICTION PEOPLE!!! Go with it and have fun!!  I did and I'm glad.  Heck at times I wish I was her.  Great story to read..the sex is fantastic between them.Anxiously awaiting book 2!!!!!
5	1362355200	Definitely in my Top #15!!! I love the characters and the raw emotion that they have for each other. Why does it always come down to someone leaving...?
4	1362355200	Started slower than I expected but I really enjoyed the story line. Wish it wasnt such a long wait for 2nd book!
5	1362355200	Wow...This was one of those books I just didn't want to put down.  I loved the concept, entering into a relationship with a complete stranger for three months, then walking away...no strings attached? Intriguing... I was hooked right from the start, I loved Laurelyn, I loved Jack, I loved their back and forth.  I loved how their &#34;no strings attached relationship&#34; changed by the end of the book.  So did mine, as I was crying when they had to walk away from each other.  I totally fell in love with these characters and I can no wait to read the next book by Georgia! Beauty From Pain was indeed a beautiful read for me.
4	1362355200	Let me start off with saying that Laurelyn kicks ass!! I really really liked her. She was so down to earth and relatable, her banter with Jack was sexy & witty. I really loved that she was able to call herself a "ho" and see things for what they were. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, because I refuse to read reviews or any sypnosis for fear of running the storyline.So I was a little disappointed when I initially started reading this. I found myself thinking "dear lord, another freakn billionaire with a contract" haven't I read enough of those already!! But decided to tread through it, and I must admit it was good. A bit predictable, and boring in parts.. Was it great?!? Uhmm no!! But it was good enough to finish and invest time and money to purchase book 2, when its released
5	1362355200	I couldn't put it down and was so sad when I was finished. Fast read, well written with good plot. I would definitely recommend!
4	1362355200	I enjoyed this book very much!!! Story line & characters pull you in to this untraditional romance! Well written & can't wait for next book!
5	1362355200	I fell in love with this book and can't wait for the next one to read!!! Amazing characters and amazing love story...one worth the time to read!!!!  The pages instantly grabbed my attention and I was hooked...
5	1362355200	I read this book in 6 hours and wish I had known I would have to wait 2 more months for the second book! Amazing love story! Great read!!!
5	1362355200	This book was one of four that I downloaded on to my Kindle.  The first three I could not make past the first few chapters before I had to set them aside.  From the moment I started reading Beauty from Pain I was hooked.  The book was well written, flowed beautifully and was believable.  To be quite honest, I was unable to put the book down and finished it same day.  It is rare for me to fall in love with both of the main characters but that happened for me in this book.  I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.
4	1362355200	So I absolutely love this book, I am very anxious to see what happens in the next book can't wait!!!!! But info wish they would've described better how Jack ans laurelyn looked more than they did, makes it more realistic to have a real visual in your mind, but I absolutely lived it... great storyline :)
3	1362268800	After seeing all of the 5 star reviews, I was so excited to read this book, but after reading it i was disappointed.  The book didn't grab me from the beginning & I felt as though it moved too slow.  I was also annoyed that the book ended at 85% & the rest were thank yous & excerpts from two books.
5	1362268800	Loved this book.  Read it in one day. Easy read- kept me interested. Character development and story line are great. The last few chapters were really excellent as Laurelyn was struggling with leaving. The emotion was gripping. There were some misprints/grammatical errors but that didn't change the impact of the story. Bottom line- good story - much like Bared For You. Only disappointment - book 2 isn't out yet.Can't wait to see how (or if) they get together - but we all know they eventually will.
4	1362268800	I liked the way she developed the characters. The book made my heart hurt the way it ended. I look forward to the next book. The concept of getting something beautiful from pain is lovely the way she wrote it.
2	1362182400	A bit disappointing as there was no closure at the end. Instead of wanting to buy the sequel it makes me not want buy it. I suspect the other books end similarity.
5	1362182400	NO! NO! NO! Not another AMAZING book with a cliffhanger!! Geez, & I have to wait until Summer before the 2nd book is released!! I'm NOT a happy camper!!! Okay, with that said, this book was freaking FANTASTIC!!! Ahhh, Jack Henry McLachlan, Australia 's most eligible bachelor, who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, & who also happens to have relationship issues! He happens to take extreme meassures to avoid the hassle of a normal relationship so he arranges relationships with women like they are some kind of business deal with &#34;no strings attached&#34;! He doesn't want long term relationships so he lets the women know right up front that the relationship is short term, usually, 3-4 weeks at the most & they agree! No real names are used with either side & they play by HIS rules!Jack Henry McLachlan sets his eyes on American musician, Laurelyn Prescott, while she is spending 3 months in Australia with her best friend Addison Donovan! His world & his game changes once he begins his 3 month affair with her! Their chemistry was Smokin' Hot...did I mention SMOKIN' HOTTT!! ;)My kindle was on FIRE, literally!!! I could feel their connection to one another..SIZZLING HOTT!!!I really liked all the characters in this AMAZING book & I'm hoping to learn more about them in the 2nd book! Shew, I don't want to wait until Summer for the next book! That's such a downer for me & I'm not sure why I torture myself with these books knowing I have to wait for the next one to be released! I'm saying this now...IM AN ADDICT! THERE, I said it!!!! I'm a freakin' book addict...& I'm proud of it :DI Guess I Need To Add Yet Another &#34;BOOK BOYFRIEND&#34; To My Long List!!! &#34;Jack Henry&#34; ;))))LOVED! LOVED! LOVED!5 AMAZING STARS!!!!
5	1362182400	I just loved the story.  I couldn't put it down.  I felt what each character was feeling throughout the book.  I cannot wait until the second book comes out!  Counting down until its released.
5	1362182400	The best part about the book was the beginning, the worst was the ending....ugh I have to wait until May to find out what happens with Jack Henry and Laurelyn????? This is absolute torture I tell you.Seriously, I truly enjoyed this book, so much so that when it ended it made me sad. I haven't had that experience in a while and it only ever happens with the books I absolutely love.It took me a while to like Jack Henry, he started out as such an aloof and cold character. At first he almost seem like a serial killer picking his next victim I wasn't sure that I was going to enjoy him as a character, but then he progresses into this protective, possessive, and very dominating character (which always works for me) he's passionate and compassionate it almost doesn't fit with the cold and calculating way he has of dealing with relationships? I hope that Ms. Cates will have some sort of explanation for why he is like he is, after all there is no history in his family to make him so jaded and cynical.Laurelyn, I fell in love with her character right away. She is so likable, quick, witty, bratty, smart, passionate, talented, independent. I love how she takes that flying leap into their relationship. I especially like how she gives as good as she gets with Jack Henry. He is very dominating, yet although she lets him dominate her she doesn't let him control her. I don't like female characters that bow down to their male counterparts in books, I prefer the give and take of characters and I love independent strong female characters which Laurelyn is.Ms. Cates did a nice job with this book and if you like a good story with some smoking hot bedroom, kitchen, living room, opera houses, scenes then this is your book. I recommend it!
5	1362182400	I really fell in love with Jack & Laurelyn!These two characters are Beautiful, Sweet, and Complicated.Laurelyn is a talented musician on holiday with her best friend in the Lovely Australia. Hello!! Can we say Yummy Australian men with Drop your Panties Accents??? Yes on all counts I Shout!!! Jack Henry is the Epitome of Scrumptious, Naughty man, wealthy, established to boot.(waggles brows) You can't help but Want to rip his clothes off and do Deliciously Fun things to him. Let's just say Laurelyn is one Lucky gal. This book is not a Gooey Love story by any means but you want it to be and by the end you see the Hope that it might be a Helluva lot more. Our Jack wants Fun No-Strings Sex Plain & Simple, our Laurelyn always hopes for real love in the back of her mind but she gives in to this Sensual Charmer and has a mighty Fine time if you catch my drift. (winks) Oh Boy does it get Steamy in more ways than one. There is so much to Jack & Laurelyn's story than what I've stated here but you know I can't give away all the Enticing & Juicy bits now can I? Wouldn't be fair... so Grab yourself a COPY TODAY because you know you Want to read those Luscious secrets and I mean Come on it's a Georgia Cates book!!!!!!!!!!! The sequel will be even Better I know it.
5	1362182400	I absolutely loved this book. I can not wait for the next one! Is it May yet? I hope Beauty from Surrender lives up to this one.
5	1362096000	This was a very good and well written book.......(JACK HENRY) I liked that this story was believable and I love how she wrote it. This book made me laugh, cry and (hot)...lol.  I wish it was longer swooon.....I have already recommend this book to my friends and I can.....not.....wait....for the next book......May 30th please come fast......
4	1362096000	Beauty From Pain was a good book.  It moved fast, kept me engaged and had a sweet and sultry romance.  For some reason I thought it was going to be "50 Shades of Grey-ish" but thankfully it wasn't.  I guess I assumed that because of the word "pain" in the title.  Georgia Cates creates a story filled with believable characters and even some suspense. I would definitely pick this up if you're a fan of romance.
5	1362096000	One of the best books I ever read!!! I will be on pins and needles waiting on book 2!!!! I love everything about it. It's a must read!!!
5	1362096000	Beautifully written, never a dull moment. Must read, will not be disappointed, can't wait for the second boom. I need it now!!##
5	1362096000	Love love love this book. This book is well written and the characters just flow. Jack henry is my new book boyfriend.  I read a lot. Stuff like fifty shades, this man, Dante's inferno etc. but this book really stands out doe me. I like that the characters know what the situation is from the start. Not until lines get blurred and feelings take over do we see our characters start to realize what has happened to the relationship they thought they were in. Cannot wait for book two.  Everyone should read this.
5	1362096000	This book caught me off guard. After reading the reviews, I wasn't expecting to get that into the story, as this is not my normal genre. I usually read more erotic and alpha male type romance novels. Let me tell you, I couldn't put this book down! When I had to put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it back up. The lead characters were developed well and you were constantly on the edge of your seat to see what would happen between them. Jack Henry is a man to love, even if he seems like an emotionally detached rich guy in the beginning. Laurelyn wasn't too strong nor was she weak--just the right combo of having a spine but showing Jack her real self.I loved the conflict between Jack and Ben. The only thing I didn't love is that Laurelyn is a little too perfect, but I guess reality isn't something we need to read about since we live it every day!The worst part of the book? It ended unresolved! Now I have to wait until May to continue watching this romance unfold! It's pretty obvious how this next book will end, but I'm hoping there are lots of twists and turns.Well written, loved everything about it! Great job, Georgia Cates!  :)
5	1362096000	I read every word and did not get bored. Fun summer read or cold  rainy day  book.  Ant wait for the next one!
5	1362009600	Georgia Cates has an easy to read style that made this a quick and fun read. I prefer this to the long-winded run-on sentences used by many authors in this genre. She does a nice job of setting the scene and slowly fills in each character's traits as the story unfolds.When Jack McLachlan first watched Laurelyn Prescott get out of the car and described her as "wearing a satiny floral one-shouldered dress belted at the waist and mile-high heels" I had to wonder if she was going to be able to pull off the Male Point Of View. She recovered nicely however from that "unmanly quote" and did a great job writing both points of view. In fact, it was right up there with my new dual POV sex-filled favoriteMy Nights With Kate, which also features a rich, out of this world lover named Jack.I loved the sex scenes as they progressed. Jack had his little quirks and things that he liked a certain way but nothing too over-the-top strange. He seemed to prefer it hard and fast, but as long as that's what she was into it's all good. The best part of the whole book though, is how Laurelyn beat him at his own game. Right from the start, she knew how to handle and control him. It was awesome! Both characters were pretty advanced for their ages considering Jack was only 28 and Laurelyn seemed more like someone in her late 20's who had been around the block and heard it all before. But I guess some 22 yr old's have the love games all figured out by that age. (I sure didn't!)I'm glad to see these multiple POV books doing well, I love the format. Excellent work Georgia and I look forward to the next installment!
5	1362009600	I cannot wait for the next book! A definite read! I could not put it down. I recommend it to everyone.
4	1362009600	At first this book really bothered me, I liked it but I didn't I couldn't make up my mind. But as the book began to progress I really started to love it and love the male character. By the end of it I was almost crying. So yes, it is a love hate kind of relationship but I recommend it to everyone!!
4	1362009600	I loved this book. You start off with the premise of a smutty novel, then develop it into a love story. It is a total cliff hanger at the end and now I am patiently waiting the next book. Great job on this one!
5	1361923200	Yes, that's right, i wish I could give more than 5 stars.  I really, really liked this book.  I've read other reviews that compars it to the 50 shade series but I have to disagree.  It may have a few similarities but not many.  I will warn you though that is is the 1st book on a series and has a cliffhanger like you won't believe.  I'm highly anticipating the 2nd book and it can't be released fast ebnough for me.  The characters are very likable and the plot is great.  Georgia Cates is a very talented writer.
4	1361923200	Couldnt put it down! Will be checking out other books from this author now. Loved it, couldnt put it down!
5	1361923200	Oooomg...spent weeks looking for the right book..if u Iove romance,comedy,realness. great This is the book for u..Great book....now gotta wait for the second..uuugh
4	1361923200	Started off a bit slow but turned out amazing. Glad I kept up with it. And now I can't wait for the sequel!
5	1361836800	Really enjoyed this book! I laughed and cried. Can not wait for the next book to come out!  A must read.
5	1361836800	Really enjoyed this story!A little bit depressing at moments, but all in all, a real page turner.Can't wait for part 2!
5	1361836800	You can tell from the beginning of this book that things are not going to end the way Jack a.k.a Lachlan has planned.  All he wants is to get the beautiful girl he sees on stage singing to agree to be his for the 3 months he's in town and then walk away never to be heard from again.  Sounds like your typical dating arrangement right?  When Laurelyn a.k.a Paige first meets and hears Jack's proposition she is offended and refuses to even entertain his offer.  However since Laurelyn is suffering a broken heart from back home and will only be in town for about 3 months herself, she decides to take a chance and take Lachlan up on his offer.  The condition is though, Jack will not give her his real name as he fears what might happen if she discovers who he truly is, so the game of lies and deception begins.  Jack is now Lachlan and Laurelyn is Paige.  Their relationship is actually very enjoyable and you start to think early on that Lachlan is an idiot if he doesn't fall for Paige, but Lachlan is set in his ways and does not think there is room in his life for work and love and closes the doors on any future with Paige.  Sadly for Paige even though she told herself to not fall for Lachlan, she can't keep her heart from breaking the rules, so as their time together nears it's end her heart starts to break with it.  Lachlan although he knows he feels different toward her than any of the women in his past "relationships" he refuses to acknowledge what he is feeling is love. Lachlan may not have enough time to understand his heart before his future walks out the door with no way to find her.
5	1361836800	I really enjoyed this book. It had a lot of the same aspects that I found enjoyable in fifty shades of grey this wasn't as good as fifty but a really fun good read with very likeable characters and some great sex scenes
5	1361836800	A beautifully written book. I enjoyed it from cover to cover. Jack Henry is a complex character with lots of underlying emotions brewing within. I am definitely ready for the next installment in this series - the release date has already been entered into my "countdown!" I definitely would recommend this one. BONUS:)))) The author is from Mississippi.
5	1361836800	absolutely amazing, dying for the book in may! beautiful story about bringing 2 people to love each other under abnormal arrangements, i loved this book, definitly one of my faves!
5	1361750400	I am soooo gonna mark the days on my calendar until May 30th when the sequel comes out.  I loved this book...mainly because it takes place in Australia and I can just hear that accent everytime he spoke....dreamy:-)I LOVE reading and this book had me feeling all sorts of emotions...especially being very frustrated at the end, or lack thereof!  May is just too long to wait to get this resolved!!!Great read and very enjoyable.
5	1361750400	Beauty from pain was just that.  This book tells the story or Laurelyn and Jack Henry who agree to a no strings attached 3 month relationship during her 3 month vacation in Australia.  They don't even know each other's real names until well into their arrangement but that doesn't stop them from doing the very thing they both vowed not to do which is fall for each other.  This was a wonderful story which showcases the author's ability to create deep and meaningful characters that you just route for.  I found myself being their cheerleader and hoping they can work it out.  But now I'm stuck waiting for the next installment and I feel wretched about it!  At least there will be something to look forward to in my summer reading list!
5	1361750400	I CANT PUT INTO WORDS HOW GREAT THIS BOOK IS, I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANY ADULT. CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE IN MAY!!!!!!!!
4	1361750400	At first I hated switching back and forth between characters but I started to appreciate it as the story unfolded.  I actually enjoyed this book and am bummed I have to wait for the second book.
5	1361750400	I loved the book&#8230;couldn't put it down deff worth the read and the money. Buy it you won't regret it.
5	1361750400	This book was a complete and total surprise.  I adored it!  I highly recommend.  Though I read it in one day and am so sad to be done.  Dying for book 2!
5	1361750400	I started this book with no expectations it I was blown away. I cried and laugh. With every page I read I became entranced by the story. I would recommend this book.
5	1361750400	This book was the best, could not put it down.  Loved every part, never a boring moment. Cannot wait for the next one to come out!!!
5	1361750400	I could not put this book down - read straight through - it was perfect.  This book grabs you from the first chapter and doesn't let go.  The way the characters of Jack Henry and Laurelyn play against each other is at times frustrating, hilarious, gut wrenching, and makes you want to have a relationship just like theirs.  I can not wait for book #2 in May 2013!!!!  Georgia Cates - you did good!!!!!
5	1361750400	This book draws you into the charaters - I even found myself chocked up at one point.  Cant wait for #2!
2	1361750400	I was really excited to read this book but honestly I wish I hadn't. It was almost exactly the same as 50 shades of grey without the suspense and intense romantic scenes. I was disappointed.
5	1361750400	I have to say that I didn't know what to expect from this book. I could never get into the vampire books that Georgia Cates wrote, but I really liked her book Going Under. Well Beauty From Pain is a home run. I think that she's really found her voice and has grasped the art of storytelling from beginning to end. I was swept up immediately and there was never a dull moment. I read it through in about a day. Really enjoyed the characters and the ending of course leaves you wanting the sequel (rant: which is kind of annoying because it's such the norm recently and there are all these cliffhangers out there and I just want to know the endings!!! Can't we get back to telling a story in one volume?)It gets five stars from me because I can't stop thinking about it.
3	1361750400	I read Beauty from Pain after a long and hard week of life in general and this book is exactly what the doctor ordered.  It&#8217;s one of those stories that are fun and sexy with a touch of angst.  What&#8217;s not to love about a handsome and wealthy Australian that promises to make the next three months the time of your life?  I read this book in a day and it was totally worth my while!Yes, it&#8217;s predictable and the plot isn&#8217;t necessarily unique because this story has been done before in different variations.  However with that being said I loved this story a lot because sometimes you need this type of book to help take the edge off and put a smile on your face.  What can I say&#8230;I thought it was fantastic!It was nice to see that Laurelyn was an outgoing, spunky and laid back heroine as opposed to meek or shy and that&#8217;s a refreshing change. Jack is your typical rich and dominant gentleman in search of companionship and Laurelyn is the gal he aims to proposition.  Of course she says yes because what gal wouldn&#8217;t and what starts out as no-strings-attached relationship quickly progresses into something more.As the story moves along, secrets are revealed but not all, feelings are shared and those intimate moments will make you wish you were Laurelyn!  The story doesn&#8217;t wrap-up nice and neat because it leaves you on a cliffhanger!!  I kept hitting my kindle in hopes I would find another chapter but sadly that wasn&#8217;t the case and I have to wait until May for the second book in the series, Beauty from Surrender.My final two cents: This is the perfect book to take your mind off your troubles because it&#8217;s fun, light and you&#8217;ll love every moment with Jack!!!  Let the countdown begin for book 2!!!
5	1361750400	I really loved this book. I didn't know what to expect when I bought it. I could not put it down! Can not wait for book #2.
5	1361664000	A really good read. I like this story and the characters. I can't wait for book 2. Not DBMS but still hot sex.
3	1361664000	not a happy bunny as  we have to wait for book 2 to be published whenever that is  all i can say i loved reading it found it a bit short .
4	1361664000	First book by this author and it was great ... Passion, funny, sad it has it all ... Can't wait for the next book to come out!
5	1361664000	The clich&eacute; storyline of a young girl falling in love with a millionaire who only wanted sex isn't new. It's been done dozens and dozens of times before but Beauty From Pain hits it out of the ball park. I devoured this book and the characters. I found myself falling in love with not only the male lead, Jack but also the female lead, Laurelyn. She might be my favorite female character in a book I have ever read. I was smitten with her from the first page. I love how funny she is and her character quirks and fun personality came through on my kindle. I felt like I knew both characters very well; not only who they are but also their families.Laurelyn is coming out of a bad break-up and decides to go with her best friend to Australia for three months to stay with her friend's brother while trying to recover from her broken heart. Their first night in Australia, Laurelyn meets Jack. Jack is Australia's most Eligible Bachelor. He doesn't do relationships; he does "companionship" for 3-4 weeks at a time not sharing real names or information about one another. When Jack sees Laurelyn he is determined she will be his #13 companion. The two agree in three months when Laurelyn is back in the states their "companionship" will end the two will go about their lives as if they never met.  Right away Jack treats Laurelyn differently than he did with the other 12 woman of his past. As the three months their feelings start to change and this "companionship" turns more into a relationship that both can never forget.I cannot even tell you all how much I loved this book. I was not expecting much because of the clich&eacute; premise of the book but Beauty From Pain took me far away from the clich&eacute; and became its own. I don't think I have fallen in love with the female lead before in a novel. I loved everything about Laurelyn. She was innocent but not TOO innocent; she was sweet, and pretty but unrealistic pretty. She was a real. Jack also won me over. He didn't want just a girl to sleep with, he wanted a relationship without complications and that is what he was accustomed to until he met Laurelyn. He is a good man just a messed up way to think of what a relationship really is. Their sex scenes were steamy but not vulgar. The pole dance scene was extremely sexy (way to go Laurelyn), and each time Jack called Laurelyn his "American Girl" my heart swooned for him.Both characters dramatically changed with their three months together. Their moments were sweet and tender and I wanted nothing more for both to reveal their feelings for one another. I just kept waiting and waiting for the moment to happen. The ending leaves on a major cliff hanger, yes it sucks... I am not going to lie, it sucks hard, but knowing there is a cliff hanger I still would have read this book because I adored it so much. The author gives you the first chapter of book two and it helps ease the pain you will feel when the book ends. May of 2013 needs to hurry up and get here!!Beauty From Pain blows any other millionaire falling in love with a young woman novel out of the water. The characters and storyline were deep and emotional, I felt connected to both characters from the starting page and their relationship completely realistic. This is definitely on my favorites list and a necessary reread over and over again.I give Beauty From Pain 5 Stars!** Side Note** Laurelyn is a musical nut and discusses a lot of her feelings through song lyrics. The author created an amazing soundtrack I love. I highly recommend listening to each song on the soundtrack and falling in love with the book all over again while listening to the music.
3	1361664000	I really enjoyed this book. I would have loved to have given it all 5 stars, but, I am not. The only reason why is because the author failed to state that this is going to be a series and left you right at the cliff. I really do not like it when an author does this. It drives me crazy. Unless you are able to wait until May to find out what is going to happen, don&#8217;t bother to read it. I am not sure if there is going to be just one more or two more. I wish that this was mentioned in the beginning or under &#8220;more details&#8221;.
4	1361664000	I really did enjoy reading this book however I was really disappointed with the ending. To me it felt a bit....rushed. There was something missing. Hasn't put me off reading the next one though. Can't wait!
5	1361664000	Great & different love story. Characters are interesting with many facets. Wish the whole story was I'm one book, hate to wait for sequels.
4	1361577600	A refreshing surprise packed with music as well as the developing relationship. Always appreciate when a work has minor characters such as friends and dynamic family members that help to color and define the main ones.Loved how the phone pics played out in several areas.However, it doesn't feel as if the writer has been to Australia. The characters' isolation while germaine to their agreement and the developing trust and emotional intimacy aside. The locale scenes were so limited they read as if from a tourist guide.The novel was so packed I wasn't upset at the ending. Will read Surr....
5	1361577600	Can't wait for book 2. Loved the story, different from a lot of books that are being published these days.
5	1361577600	I have to wait until WHEN!!?? For book 2???? I need book 2 now! LolI loved this book! Absolutely loved it. Characters are great, plot is somewhat predicable but still great, sex scenes are hot and fabulously written, great chemistry between the two leads, lots of wine, and a serious cliffhanger at the end.Started this novel and last night and finished just a bit ago. I wanted to read straight through but of course had to go to work lol >_&lt;Can't wait for book 2!
5	1361577600	I'm just tired of this whole having to buy a couple chapters at a time. Release a BOOK, charge what you want and I'll consider it, but I'm done with this format!Loved the book...yeah, will buy the next one to see what happens...love the characters.Just tired of buying books and then waiting 4~6 months for the next one.  Totally forgetting what happened after reading another 4 to 6 books in between.And paying $4 to $8 on sale, each?  Kindle price?!
5	1361577600	The dialogue sparkled, the amazing hot sex scenes sizzled, and I LOVE it. What more can a reader want? This is the kind of story that stays with you because you can't stop thinking about it. This is insanely addictive. beautifully sexy, and BEAUTIFULLY PERFECT!Ms. Cates is a remarkable writer and I cannot wait to read the continuation of Jack and Laurelyn story.
5	1361577600	Did not want to put this book down.  I fell in love with Laurelyn and Jack.  Their story made me smile, laugh, and cry.  The ending was extemely frustrating!!  I can't wait for the next book.
5	1361491200	Alot of readers have suggested that this is a 50 shades knock off.  Boy are they wrong.  Jack Henry is not overly dominate nor is there any BDSM in this novel.  This novel has a quick character development with steamy, steamy scenes.  Yes there is alot of sex in this book, however that is the basis of their relationship from the beginning.  I am anticipating the second book in March.  Yes this book leaves you hanging at the end.
5	1361491200	Where oh where do I start??This is the first book I have read by Georgia Cates and I have become an instant fan.I love the simplicity of the agreement between Jack and Laurelyn. They both know what the expectations are and neither have a problem.  There are some situations that come up, but are handled quickly and in an adult manner.I love that Laurelyn keeps Jack on his toes. Jack is used to a particular woman and Laurelyn is completely different.The love scenes between these is very intense and sexy. They don't play games with each other. Jack is always wanting Laurelyn to know how much he wants her - in bed and out of bed.Georgia Cates does a beautiful job of pulling you into this story and keeping you there til the end.  Every scene and moment is so visible because of her writing.Beautiful story!! I can't wait to see what happens next!
5	1361491200	I love it -  this is the first time I've heard or read a Georgia Cates book. I was so in to the book at page 1 and found myself reading and reading until I finished it.  I was surprised witht the ending and can't wait to get my hands on the next book. I liked the story line and found myself being pulled further and further into their lives.
5	1361491200	Love love the story and the characters, I can't wait wait for the next book to come out. One of my fave read this year...a must read.
5	1361491200	I really, really loved this book.  Great characters and I didn't' want to put the book down.  A beautiful story about the path two people take.  Sex, love, some suspense.  An absolute must read.  I don't know how I am going to wait until May for the second book in the series.
5	1361404800	This book was so deliciously good from start to end! I loved the hotness Jack portrayed and his directness! I can not wait for the second book to find out what happens next with all the characters!! I even cried!! Ugh, c'mon May 30th, I need more!!!
5	1361404800	This is the first book I have read by Georgia Cates so I wasen't sure what to expect.  Well ladies, I am sooooo glad I stummbled upon this little treasure because it was AMAZING and freaking fantastic!!!I was a lover of the 50 Shades trilogy, so much so that I've read it 3 times...sick huh:)  Since then, I haven't even come close to finding another book that "does it for me"....until now.I was in love from the very beginning.  I was completely caught up in Jack and Laurelyn's beautiful journey.  I had so many different emotions running through me page after page.  They made me laugh, they made me sad, and they most definately made me cry.Jack, you are incredible.  I could ring your beautiful little neck for letting Laurelyn slip through your fingers but, somehow I know you'll set things right again...and I will be there front and center waiting.Laurelyn, you are smart, and fun, and witty, and extremely talented.  You are beautiful inside and out.  You are a bright, shinning star.  Don't lose that sparkle that makes us love you so much.  Hang on sweetie...Jack will get his head out of his a**!Jack's family...Henry, Margaret, Evan, Emma,and Chloe, I love you all.  You are an amazing support team for Jack and Laurelyn and I hope to hear more from you in Beauty from Surrender.  To Evan (Jack's brother)  I loved this quote..."you don't always know the true worth of a woman's love until it becomes a memory."  You brought tears to my eyes.Georgia Cates,  I can't thank you enough for sharing Jack and Laurelyn's story with us.  I cannot wait until Beauty from Surrender is released.  I have a feeling it will be just as amazing as Beauty from Pain.
5	1361404800	Great book!  I can't wait for the next one.  I saw a lot of mention about 50 shades & Crossfire series but this one is nothing like it.  The main characters are very likeable and you aren't constantly thinking they need tons of therapy.  I highly recommend this book.
5	1361318400	I very rarely read a book and have even the hint of desire to reread it right there plus I even bought songs mentioned in the book! I loved this book and cant wait for the next one to come out!!!!
5	1361318400	I really loved this book! I thought it was going to be another Fifty Shades of Grey rip off, but it wasn't. Laurelyn is a funny chick! She doesn't take things too seriously and she made me laugh several times while reading the book.If only there were guys out there like Jack Henry! Not the 'agreement' part, but just the way he treats Laurelyn. He sounds like a dream! And having millions of dollars doesn't hurt!Thank you Georgia! For writing a fun and sweet romance novel! I was getting tired of the 'slutmances'!!
5	1361318400	This was such a beautiful story and we're left with a cliffhanger that left me gripping my iPad so tight on the edge of my seat!!! These two characters quickly became a couple of my favourites. The way their relationship started was unconventional but it worked and there was less drama between them since the lines were clearly there. It as brilliant. They were just together and had fun and fell in love somewhere along the way. Must read!!
3	1361318400	I don't get all the hype and the 5 stars ratings. I mean, the writing was decent enough but the storyline? I feel like I've read it before. Overall, it just didn't feel original. I think it could have had so much more potential but it fell flat for me. I don't know, maybe it's just me but I'm tired of reading about alpha male who are possessive. I'm not saying the hero was all possessiveness... he certainly had some great qualities but I'm just tired of reading these types of stories. I suppose if this had came out prior to Bared to You or Beautiful Disaster then yeah maybe I would have given it a higher rating. I don't want to bash the author because I do think her writing style is great but the storyline was unoriginal and needs some spicing up. I just remember thinking while reading the book that I've read it before. Maybe not the exact same events but something similar. It was really hard for me to get through this book and I honestly did a lot of skimming. I guess my expectations were too high considering it's on the top 100 best sellers for contemporary romance. It was just missing something for me. Maybe other people might like it but it was not for me. 3 stars
5	1361232000	This book isn't the best writing and the sex scenes are lacking but it's a great story.  I enjoy the emotion the author evokes from the two main characters and am bummed at having to wait months for the second book.  Georgia Cates has the innate ability to tell a story much like she was a friend talking to you.
4	1361232000	I read a lot of books.... but most of us do I think. I rely a lot on reviews when purchasing books, so I hope the following will help those of you who are like me.Genre: Romance. If I would classify a sub-genre I would give it a mix between New Adult and Adult Contemporary with a dash of Erotic for good measure.Storyline: I'm not going to detail the storyline since a lot of other reviewers have already. What I will say is this: rather than filling the story with a lot of what's trending out there in this genre right now, superficial conflict, misunderstanding, and silly emotional misinformation between the main characters that could be easily be resolved with a simple conversation and then that is used as filler to push along a sub-par story arch, Ms. Cates uses true internal character conflict to move the story while developing the characters. Love this. I hate mentally yelling at books when the characters are too stupid to deserve each other because they can't communicate. This book does not do that. Conflict arises and it's faced head on. The tension comes from the internal, personal reasons and reactions of the characters rather than that of the superficial issue at hand. It takes talent as a story teller and author to be able to understand this difference and bring a story like this alive without it sounding contrived, tried, and manipulated. I really liked the way Cates played out the struggles between the characters and it seemed real. I thought it was well done, especially for a self-published author.Writing style: Ms. Cates did very well. The narrative transitions were smooth and fluid. I enjoyed the dialogue. I didn't come across anything choppy or disjointed. There were no blatant spelling errors or grammatical errors that caused my attention to deviate. Again, for a self-published author this is a big plus for me. She used an editing service and it shows. I think more self-published authors should.This book is the first in a series or "volume". So, expect to not have the story resolved.Overall, I enjoyed this book and look forward to the next installment.
5	1361232000	I wasn't really sure if I would like the book that much before I read it but It was every good! I can't wait until the second books comes out! It is going to be hard to wait until the summer to find out what happens!
5	1361232000	This book is so worth the read. I couldn't put it down.I loved how the story is set up to tell both sides of the characters. I understood them better.Can't believe the second part doesn't come out til May!! such a long time to wait.
5	1361232000	Read this book in a day with 14 month old twins running around. I totally fell in love with the characters and with the cliff hanger at the end i was left wanting more. Even thou the author gave the 1st chapter to book 2 you couldnt help but want to jump online to see if the book had been leaked anywhere. I found out upon looking on the facebook of the author that she expects the 2nd book to be out at the end of may. BUT she said that shed love to have it out sooner given everything goes right. Im looking forward to book 2!
5	1361232000	I loved reading the book; a serious page turner for sure. I downloaded the book on a whim (not a typical read for me) while waiting at the airport.  I couldn't put my reader down.  I got to the end of the book and only then realized the book was part of a series not yet released. Immediately I searched to discover that Beauty From Surrender won't release until May 2013.  Ack!  Can't wait to see what happens with Jack and Lorelyn.  The May 30 release is on my calendar. Hurry- up Georgia!
5	1361232000	I didn't not think of any similarities between this book and any other.  Yes, I agree with another review that said it had been done, but being in awe does not describe how I felt while reading this one.I loved reading both POVs because I was able to get a feel for the characters true feelings, expectations, thoughts, etc., etc.  I can understand why Jack doesn't want women to know his true identity and Audrey is a clear enough example of that.Highly recommended to those of love love.
5	1361232000	This book was so hard to put down. It's hard to put into words. I read a lot and this is by far a fav of mine. I'm a huge fifty shades and bared to u fan and this one is now on my top 5 list. Can't wait for the next book 5/30/13 to far away. I will say wait to read until u are close to this date since it ends with u breathless and missing the characters.
5	1361232000	This is by far one of my favorite books this year- I know the year just started but it's one that will stay on the top!Laurelyn is one sassy chick I love her and I respect that she followed the "Agreement". She did everything right. Jack well he didn't seem to follow one of his own rules when it came to Laurelyn but unlike the other companions she could careless about his money. Throughtout the book each of their stories unfolds and you can help but root for them to have a HEA. I am hear to tell you the ending is anything but! It was a fabulous ending but a heart breaking one at that. Author Georgia Cates gives us a taste of the next book that is due out in Summer 2013- I am hoping for an early release as Laurlyn & Jack will surely haunt my thoughts until them.Follow My Blog at iloveladyporn.com
5	1361232000	Thus is definitely a different type of a type relationship but it worked for them. They are ment for each other. I can't wait til book 2 in May
5	1361232000	This book is definitely a must read!!! I love the direction it took, new and fresh!!!!  May cannot come soon enough, I am hoping that this is not a three part series because I am about to burst waiting for May, I dont think I could take another break from Laurelyn and Jack Henry!!
5	1361145600	I really enjoyed myself.  Very nice storyline.  Can't wait to read the second book  Very excited to what will happen next
5	1361145600	Buy this book!!!  The leading man &#34; Lachlan/Jack&#34; is sexy, rich, mysterious and total alpha male.  And believe it or not the leading lady &#34; Laurelyn/Paige&#34; is smart, sexy, and interesting.Summary:  Laurelyn Prescott and her friend  Addison travels to Australia to spend 3 months with Addison's brother Ben. A sexy mysterious man Lachlan/Jack proposes a 3 month deal to Laurelyn. For 3 months he will fulfill all of her fantasies and desires.  The catch is he will not reveal his real identity and after the 3 months the fantasy is over for good.This book does leave you begging for more.  I cannot wait for the next one in this series!!!
5	1361145600	I just happens to stumble upon this book and had no background or recommendations.  There were a few times when I thought come on!  But end the end I was crying and couldn't help it!  Not sure if that's more to do with me or the book but either way it happened.  I read a lot and all in this general genre and none of them have made my cry.  Wonderful story I can't wait for book 2 I hope its out soon!
5	1361145600	Such a wonderful love story.  I can't wait for the next book to follow.  Waiting will be very hard for me.  I'm confident it will be worth it!
5	1361145600	This was a great book. I loved the sasiness of laurelyn, she was a well developed character with daddy issues. &#60;3 that lol. Can't wait for the next book to find out that happens!
5	1361145600	Beauty from Pain had REALLY high expectations to live up to first of all Georgia Cates is amazing and I wouldn't expect anything but greatness from her, second this book has been in the Amazon Best Sellers since it released so obviously people were liking it, third the cover and blurb you just expect the book to be awesome after that, and fourth my bookie friends kept talking about it, so when I had a free second to read a book of choice (aka not a review book) I felt it was time to pick this one.And guess what?...Beauty from Pain lived up to its very high expectations! I was pretty much in love with it from page one. The storyline had be page-turning and I just couldn't get enough! I read this one from cover to cover and it is no short book that's for sure!Laurelyn and Jack have beautiful CHEMISTRY. OMG get ready for the gushing. She is so amazing and he is just SO HOT. I would take him in a suit or casual wear any day. They are amazing characters and I think you just got to crack open the book to find that out for yourself!The three month deal is so weird but as a reader you just go along with it to see how it could possibly go and it works for a time but you kind of know in the back of your head that its got to turn into more. i mean these characters are just way too perfect for each other. So you keep reading because you have to figure out how this relationship is going to continue after the three months! And now I wish I was still reading!Georgia I CANT believe that's how you chose to end this! Like Seriously could you kill us a little bit nicer next time. That was brutal! But I guess thank you for the sneak peek into Beauty from Surrender because I might be knocking on your door tomorrow if you didn't do that. I really don't know if I can wait until May 30th to get Beauty from Surrender! I might internally combust before then!
5	1361145600	I couldn't put this book down!! Loved the way it was written. The story was different and sad I have to wait until May for the second book.
4	1361145600	Loved this book.  Loved the characters.  Loved the storyline.  Loved that it was told from the perspective of both main characters. Basically, I am just really anxious for Beauty from Surrender, to be available.  So hurry up with that Georgia.  Please. :)
3	1361145600	From the reviews that I read prior to purchase I hoped for more. I enjoyed the story until three quarters of the way through when I thought it became trite. As for the ending well it was sudden and felt like there was a page missing so I checked and no that's all folks. I liked the characters they were interesting but needed fleshing out more. As for Jack Henry I thought there was ample room for further development and less of the sex scenes would have provided room in this book to get to know him better. We need to know why number 12 feels so angry, why Laurelyn's Mother is so useless and what her record producer is feeling?  Hopefully the next book in this series will do all that and more as the ingredients for a great book are there they just need embellishing.
5	1361145600	A great story about what going on vacation to a foreign country can do for your love life and what finding someone who finally treats you like you really are somebody feels like. Well written, amazing detail, amazing story. It's going to kill me to wait for the next one!!!!
5	1361145600	I absolutely loved this book!! The chemistry between Laurelyn and Jack really makes this book awesome.  Laurelyn is a great female character....she is never annoying.  Jack is so very scrumptious!! I could not put this book down, I was hooked from the very beginning.  I am really hoping I don't have to wait long for book 2.....Beauty from Surrender.
4	1361059200	This was definitely a great read. I really loved Jack and Laurelyns relationship! I loved how it started and how it transformed into what it was! I am disappointed at the fact that I have to wait until May for the sequel. This is an overall fantastic read w/lots of emotions and definitely some turmoil!
5	1361059200	I can't believe I have to wait until summer. I want to read more about Jack and Lauralyn, what a beautiful heartfelt story. Love is truly random and it hits you when you least expect it. Both characters are not looking for love, they steer clear from it but Cupid comes in and shoots them both. This is a must read!
4	1361059200	I have to say I liked this books preview when I read it. And it did not disappoint!! I'm not much in telling you about the story because I'm a firm believer that you should always read it yourself and make your own decision. All in all great book & looking forward to book 2. Only complaint book 2 is not out until May 2013.
5	1361059200	By far my new favorite book. Looking forward to the next book. It's a little fifty shades but better. A must read.
5	1361059200	Can't wait for next book!!! Was really a decent price. Awesome story couldn't put it down. Can I get an alert when it's ready???
5	1361059200	After reading the premise for the book, I thought I would give it a try. It was a good deal for a novel so why not. Well, I was thoroughly rewarded for my $3.99. that came out of my account. What a treasure of a book. Not only was it hot ( you can find that anywhere) but even more surprising was how moving, funny, sensitive & heartbreaking this novel is. I completed it in one night because I just could not stop. When finished, I was sobbing & snubbing like a baby. I promise you, for those of who are 50 Shades and Bared fans you will LOVE this one. No spoiler here, just a guarantee that you will be extremely pleased.One tip... Even though this is a novel, part two is due to be out some time in May. Ms. Cates could not finish the story in one. So if you are one of those who hate two parters, you may wanna wait a few months.
5	1361059200	This was my favorite book so far it was more down to earth of what could happen in real life it was wonderful!!!!
5	1361059200	Review from Natalie @  [...]Beauty From Pain is the first book in the Beauty Series by author Georgia Cates.Jack McLachlan is a sexy, Australian millionaire. He prefers to play by his rules and only engages in short-term relationships. The wine-making magnate has made a game out of his no-strings attached relationships. He enjoys having a beautiful female companion without any romantic complications.Jack McLachlan has successfully kept his no-strings attached relationships rules intact&#8230;.short-term and no real names&#8230;..until Laurelyn Prescott enters his life.Laurelyn Prescott is a beautiful, feisty American who is temporarily living in Australia for the summer. Perfect scenerio for Jack McLachlan, right?Well, not exactly.Laurelyn turns Jack&#8217;s world inside out and has him questioning the no-strings attached rules he has firmly kept intact.Jack slowly starts breaking his own rules and finds himself seeing Laurelyn as more than a short-term fling. He finds himself wanting to get close to her and even allow her to know the real, Jack Henry McLachlan.How close will Jack allow Laurenlyn to get?This book was absolutely breathtaking! Jack was sexy, magnetic, and surprisingly caring. The sex scenes were erotic and definitely delicious:) Laurelyn was beautiful, fun, and feisty as hell! The dynamics of their relationship made for a serious page-turner of a book! I honestly couldn&#8217;t put it down!Georgia Cates&#8217;s writing flowed effortlessly off the pages and made the book worth every second! The ending leaves you with quite the cliffhanger but nonetheless, desperately anticipating the second book in the series!Buy Georgia Cates&#8217;s Beauty From Pain today!
5	1361059200	I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did.It was beautiful, funny, hot, sexy, romantic and not cheesy at all, thank goodness! I fell in love w/ Laurelyn and Lochlan. They weren't too over the top so it made the story more believable. I so can't wait for the next installment to come out!!
3	1360972800	Really 3.9 STARS....There is no other book that I've read this year that has frustrated me so much as this one. I really wanted to love it based on the reviews (amazon reviewers usually never get it wrong)but mostly based on the story line!  How can you go wrong with an American girl going to Australia of all places and falling for an Aussie! I mean WOW! And further the premise of a love affair taking place for three months and not knowing who the guy really is! I mean could a girl hold her heart back and walk away from that! Wow Wow!  But this book had me so frustrated from the beginning. I liked the middle to end better but here's my problems with it:1.  I wanted more detail.  The scenes were just getting juicy and then bam! what! change to something else. With more details they could have been so much better. More details in the next book please.2.  Though I did love how the male lead was developed, as I was reading I imagined an older 30's - early 40's male - not the 28 year old he was suppose to be.  I think it was the way he talked, not like a 28 year old would... just couldn't wrap my head around that.3.  Lastly, Ms. Cate's needs an editor!!!  It's very frustrating reading and running into grammatical errors, etc. Also, I agree with another reviewer (Adelin from Australia) that said ..."I truly believe together with the story fleshed out, and a good editor, your next book CAN be a best seller worldwide."  I totally agree with Adelin. I absolutely love the idea around the story of Jack and Laurelyn. There were good moments in the book, some even great but I just hope it's told better in the next book.Would I recommend:  yes with reservations.  If you can overlook the grammatical errors you might enjoy this unique love story.
1	1360972800	Wow!  This book was right up there with 50 and bared to you.  It kept me wanting more and as I finished it I am so very craving more.  I can't believe I have to wait until May!
3	1360972800	Seems like I've read books like this in the past . But will read the next book. There might be a twist in it
5	1360972800	I absolutely love this book. I was hooked from the beginning. I so can't wait for the second book to come out.
5	1360972800	I bought this book for my kindle yesterday based on reviews. I remember someone saying not to start the book at night unless you want to stay up all night reading. Well, I should have listened because that is exactly what happened! I could NOT put it down. I laughed, I cried....it made me feel and I absolutely loved it!!! I can't wait til May to read the next book!
2	1360972800	The story is ok.... BUT as an Australian with more than a little contact with rural Australia, the smattering of random Aussie slang was really irritating.-  No Australian man I have ever encountered would ever have an internal dialogue that revolved around whether he appeared to be a 'chickie babe'....-  I don't want to be overly negative, but if you are going to set a story in a place and you want to make 'cultural references' they need to be accurate ie a Cricket Test match goes for 3-5 DAYS - you can't find out the final score of the Boxing Day Test on Boxing Day!I didn't hate the story but I really found myself doubting whether the author had ever been to the main setting of the book....
4	1360972800	I don't usually read romance because is always predictable, but the heroine in this book captured me from the start. I like the fact that she is smart, funny and talented. The book is written at a good pace. Looking forward to part 2
5	1360972800	I am so anxious to read the second book and I was so readyto pre order it and I can not. It comes out May 30 this year but there should be a way to pre order the book. I so want Laurie and Jack to be together. I pray he finds her fast.
5	1360972800	This book is amazing, I wasn't able to put it down, now I'm on my second reading of it.  I don't know how I'm going to make it till May.
5	1360972800	This was a great story! I can not wait for part two to see how Jack and Laurelyn's story continues.
5	1360972800	I was given Beauty From Pain as a gift and was thrilled to get it.  I had just come off of reading some really heavy books and was looking for something fun and sexy to lift me out of my book funk.  This book did it for me.  I love books that have great banter, some jealousy, and mild angst and this book had all of that.  I will be buying book two when it comes out!!  Great job Georgia Cates!
5	1360972800	Beauty From Pain is really a beautiful winner story. To tell you the truth, There are so many unbelievable things in the plot that you might end gaping your mouth at the audacity, or courage, of the writer. There is no way that so many perfections can be in one person like talented musician Laurelyn or millionaire winemaker Jack. There is no way to believe that such a relationship with all the right coincidences can be pulled up and succeed. But, the plot is written so well, unlike many other ridiculous weak plotted millionaire and billionaire stories. The storyline is so interesting, that you don't really care about all the unbelievable unreal stuff going on in there, and you just read and read and enjoy the experience till the last moment; when you get really disappointed for getting to the end of it!! Why?! Because suddenly you get to the end of the book and discover that it is not the end. Even worse. You have to wait another three months in order to get to know what happens next with our two heroes. This really sucks... Because I don't want to wait...
5	1360972800	I am so blown away by this book that I'm not even sure how to put it in to words.Beauty from Pain is so unlike anything else I have ever read. Yes we may have the broken heroine who is struggling to deal with a painful break up, and we may have the sexy billionaire, but apart from that everything else is so new.Laurelyn Prescott is embarking on a three month trip around the world to Australia with her best friend, Addison. They will be staying with Addison's brother and forgetting about life back home. Just what Laurelyn needs - a break, the sun, a bit of fun with her best friend and NO men. With some wise words from Addison, their journey begins."Listen to me, Laurelyn. The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else."Jack McLachlan. Jack freaking McLahlan. I absolutely loved him. He was the rich and sexy billionaire owner of many wineries across Australia and New Zealand but he doesn't like the world, or his 'companions' to know this. He is a mystery to woman and that is exactly the way he intends to keep it when he meets Laurelyn one night in a bar.They agree on 3 months together. Nothing more, nothing less. This is perfect for both Jack and Laurelyn, Jack because he doesn't have time in his life for more and Laurelyn because she will be returning home to the US after this 3 months and will never have to see him again. It's all very simple, 3 months, no sharing personal details of each others lives - including names, and by the end of it they will both walk away never seeing each other again. Easy, right? I'll let you find out.."Baby, you've screwed my mind without touching my body."This was one of the sexiest books I have ever read, but there was so much more to it than just the hot and steamy scenes. I felt real, heavy emotions whilst reading this. All the way through I was almost pleading and begging Jack to just give in and say to hell with his three months and I was never sure whether I was going to get my way or not. It does leave off in a cliffhanger but thankfully we are given the first chapter of the next book, due out May 20th, so you can definitely see the direction the book will be taking. I can not wait to get back to some more of Laurelyn and Jack."Loving him will forever be my Beauty from Pain.
5	1360886400	I cant even start to describe how amazing this book is. It brought feelings out of me that i didnt know were there. As i read the last few chapters of this book, i cried so much. I felt the pain inside me, as if like i was going through the situation that they were. Cant wait for the second book to come out
4	1360886400	The beginning was a bit weird for me at first but for some reason I couldn't put it down. And I'm very thankful I didn't!
5	1360886400	This book had me from beginning to end~could not put it down~basically ignoring my husband, kids and dog~loved everything about it! Cannot wait until Book 2~
4	1360886400	loved the book, the only bad thing was the endingggggggggg!!! you are so cruel Georgia!! The writing was wonderful, easy to read because Lauralyn talks like a real woman. Just loved the book.
5	1360886400	I just finished reading "Beauty from Pain". Oh, the angst....I LOVED this book, I started reading it yesterday and tonight, found myself barreling to the finish to see what happens, praying for some divine intervention for Laurelyn and Jack. And, now an anguished wait for the sequel.  I read early summer for the release....can you make it early Spring?I thought both characters were so well developed and I loved the humor and the understanding and the passion between them. The sex scenes were so hot and well written and superbly done. The dialogue was snappy and smart.I so wish I could give this more than 5 stars. PLEASE hurry with the sequel!Just one last note....while I loved the book, and I mean LOVED it, the model on the book cover was NOT Laurelyn, the hair color was too light and Laurelyn would not have those fake nails the model is wearing.  I don't judge a book by it's cover, and this may seem inconsequential, but I do like a visual that relates to the story. The pose is great, but a different model is needed.
5	1360886400	Ugh...to have to wait for bk 2 is soooo rough! Great book, can't wait to see Jack track her down!
5	1360886400	I read it in 24 hour. I could not put it down! I didn't know what this book was about. But, it didn't take long to get me hooked! Now I can't wait for the next book...
5	1360886400	Can't wait for the next book in this series.  There's bound to be real drama since the main character is going to have to fight for true love on a different continent than he's use to.
5	1360886400	Bravo to Georgia Cates!It was a random pick yet a wonderful discovery. Very unique storyline! I'd recommend this all romance readers!
5	1360886400	This book was fabulous.  I can not wait for the next book in the series.  I really enjoyed the main characters.  I enjoyed the book being told from both her side and his side.  It is always nice to know what those male characters are thinking.
1	1360800000	God I loved this book. I thought it as very well written. I cried and couldn't put but down. I would recommend everyone to read it.
5	1360800000	This is how a book should be written! I'm so in awe about the characters. I love that the female character is witty, sexy, fun and can hold her own. She's not some feeble little mouse, not saying what she thinks. And the male character is strong and able to see she's special. I love reading stories that the female is so alive and feisty. Also the love scenes are amazing and fun. I can't wait for the next book. So hurry  !!!!
4	1360800000	Read this book has everything you could want in a good book. Drama,love,hot sexy Aussie,stalker bitch, killer cliff hanger!!! Hurry up may30th for next book. Started reading this yesterday & stayed up all night reading. Wish I had a Jack Henry yum.!!
5	1360800000	I have been looking for a good author for months. Linda Howard is my favorite, so it is hard to find someone close to her writing, but this book did.
5	1360800000	OH.MY.GOD!I loved this book. Normally I hate anything that is set in my own country. Know all about it so no interested in hearing suburbs I have been too! Which is why an overseas book appeals to me more. But thought I would give this one a go. FELL IN LOVE! I often wonder how women actually fall into these lives and there are women out there who this actually happens to (lucky things) And yes to fantasize how then and what that would be like - mmmm well I wouln't say no!This book was exactly how I love my stories to be. Hot alpha male who knows what he wants and a female character who is just not free and easy. Starts off like a perfect deal but then emotions come into it. They always fall really hard.Give the book a go. Great story - different being centered around the wine industry.You won't be sorry that you read this.
5	1360800000	I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read more about John Henry and Laurelyn. LOOKS LIKE JOHN HENRY IS COMING TO AMERICA!!!!!
5	1360800000	Read this book in one day! Can't wait for the 2nd one to come out in May. Keep them coming Georgia :)
5	1360800000	Review originally posted on Goodreads.com, February 3, 2013:This is the first review I've ever written, so my enthusiasm and love for "Beauty From Pain" must be obvious. It was also my first read of a Georgia Cates novel, and it won't likely be my last. I ADORED everything about this novel, except the ending (or lack thereof), so I give it 4.998 stars for its extraordinary birth of a sexy, sweet, sensual, romantic love story.I almost waited to read Beauty From Pain because I saw it is the first book of a new Beauty Series. After sampling it, however, I just couldn't stop...it's THAT great. The first paragraph from Jack McLachlan's perspective completely mesmerized me. I stopped at that moment and bought the book because I knew then I was in for a great literary ride.With all the hand-wringing and lamenting about cliffhanger endings, I must note that the few pages leading to the novel's end brought a surprising upswell of tears for me...and I didn't like it. But my HEART knows that Laurelyn and Jack Henry's story continues, and that makes waiting for the next book tolerable.
5	1360800000	I saw this under recommended readings and I read one review. That's all I needed, and after finishing the book, I was not disappointed. It's an incredibly great story with a lot of high points and not too many struggles, which I appreciate.Georgia Cates wrote some incredibly sexy scenes and the book had a great flow to it. Nothing felt out of place or disjointed. Laurelyn and Jack Henry's progression from friends with benefits to love, is smooth and easy to follow. I can sing nothing, but praises for this book and I am very excited for the sequel.ETA: I loved how every other chapter was written in Laurelyn and Jack's perspective. Made the story that much better.If the glowing review didn't do it, I highly recommend this book.
5	1360800000	Wow what a great book! I couldn't put it down and now I hate that I have to wait a month for the next one. You will love Jack yum yum! The heroine is awesome too, not annoying and totally loveable. An amazing read full of lust, steamy but real sex, love, and heart break!
5	1360800000	sweet and endearing and so easy to fall in love w/ Jack Henry! The story is so believable that you can feel the attraction/want/need radiating off the pages!
5	1360713600	I loved this story. I can't believe the ending and now have to wait patiently for the book 2 in the summer. I'm left hanging and wanting for this couple to reunite. Jack was an ass for thinking he was not falling for her. Typical until it's too late. But, I have faith that he'll find her in the states and bring h back into his world. They make a great couple.Looking forward to additional books written by Ms. Cates. Love it....
3	1360713600	I did not like the beginning of this book.  The whole don't tell my your name I won't tell you mine seemed silly and why in the world would a supposedly intelligent woman fall for this kind of pickup scenario.  Cause it screams...YOU ARE A HOOKER!!! So does accepting expensive gifts, and having him peel off bills for you to go shopping.  Sounds like Pretty Woman right?  AND SHE WAS A HOOKER!!! I have to say though, to my shame, that I was sucked in and came to like this couple.  While this didn't blow me out of the water, I will give the author another shot and buy the sequel.
5	1360713600	I loved this book! I can't wait to find out what happens with the rest of the series! Way to go Georgia!!
5	1360713600	I've been having a hard time finding good books lately after reading 50 shades triologies,  crossfire triologies, release me series to Collide series so I am glad that I came across this book.  Both characters I could see were hurt. Jack's hurt by decieving women that uses him bc of his fortune and Laurelyn is hurt by not having a father figure and an decieving ex. I absolutely love this book I personally fell in love with these two main characters and even cried when Laurelyn cried.  I cant wait for book 2 in May.
5	1360713600	I love that this book is set in oz. I love the charcters and the story is wonderful. What a predicament they find themselves in. The book had to end the way it did but waaaaa...I didn't want it to stop. Can not wait til the next book...what a cliff hanger!
5	1360713600	Big props to this author for a great romance!  It's fun to see a great singer-songwriter-performer musician as a heroine.  Liked my three-month trip to Wagga Wagga, Australia along with the American women friends.  The smart, hot winemaker and hort scientist hero, Lachlan, carries his weight in the alternating POV chapters.  Lots to love about this book!  Like other reviewers, I read into the wee hours to see how it would end.  Thank you for reasonable, fair pricing!
5	1360713600	I can actually say that I loved this book ,but now I've got to wait until late 2013 for the second book.  Come on don't make us wait before I forget about it. Hint Hint.Loved the book and couldn't put it down until the end.
5	1360713600	What a great book!  This is the first book I've read by Georgia Cates, and I loved it!So the storyline sort of reminds me of fifty shades of grey in a way, and I don't mean any of the Kinky stuff either.  We've got the wealthy, handsome, bachelor, We've got the sweet girl, then we've got a set of rules and regulations.Aussie, Jack McLachlan prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they're always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.Enter #13, Sweet American girl, Laurelyn Prescott, a musician from Nashville, visiting Austrailia with her best friend for the next 3 months.Perfect hook up right?  Spend 3 months with a beautiful woman, spoiling and seducing her, and then in three months she's gone half way around the world!  The perfect fling!Except Laurelyn is far more amazing than Jack ever imagined, and his world is flipped upside down by his need to be with her.  Laurelyn is equally rivetted by this hunk of man she's struck a deal with.How will this all play out when their time is up!What a great flippin' story!  I really enjoyed it and finished it very quickly!  Now I'm dying because I didn't realize it would be a cliffhanger book!  What happens next!!!  I have a pretty good idea, but dang, I wanna know now!!!  lolCan't wait for the next book, I'm counting down the days!  :)
5	1360627200	I was totally taken in by this story and CANNOT wait until the next one comes out. If you like 1st person narratives but are always wondering what is going on in the other person's head, this is your book!
5	1360627200	I tend to only read books written in first person...helps me connect to the main character.  I enjoyed this books format - all first person but one chapter was Laurelyn's view and the next was Jack's (alternating).  Brilliant!!  I could connect to both and feel their emotions.  I can't wait for the sequel(s).  Unfortunately, it won't be out until summer and I'll be on a reading hiatus for baseball season.  Looking forward to it in the fall!
4	1360627200	So I feel bad giving it 4 stars but for me it could have been sped up a little more. I felt like it was a tad slow and that was okay, I still really liked the book and the story and the characters but it felt like it was drawn out and I think that was because of the second book needing a story. All in all it was very good writing and I look forward to the next book!
5	1360627200	Wish I could give this more than 5 stars! Totally enjoyed this book from start to end. Please hurry with Beauty from Surrender! Just can't wait to continue this story. :)
5	1360627200	I'm not one to give spoilers..., so I won't. But, I laughed, I was embarrassed for the characters, fell in love with the music I couldn't hear, and felt devastated. It had me trapped the whole time and now I have to wait for the rest of their story. That's the only annoying part. I definitely recommend this book!
4	1360627200	laurelyn Prescott is travelling to Australia with her best friend Addison. Laurelyn is glad to be away for the next three months after her disastrous love affair. Addison's brother Ben is in Australia on a wine science program, so she and Addison are going to stay with him.Laurelyn can tell instantly that Ben is attracted to her, but no way is she going there. Addison has paired up with Ben's friend Zac. Leaving Laurelyn trying to avoid Ben's obvious interest. The first night they are out in a club, where Laurelyn gets up to sing, as she is a musician by profession, and its an open mic. But someone else has become focused on her. Jack McLachlan a wine making millionaire. Jack has come to Wagga Wagga for the next three months, and has come to the club to look for a woman, who might be willing to spend that time with him.Jack doesn't do relationships, he has short term partners, whom he has a special arrangement with. He doesn't ask for their real name nor does he give his. It's all about sex. He does like to spoil the lady of the moment. But when their time is up they go their separate ways. Usually these relationships last a matter of weeks. But this will be the longest time he has asked a woman to be with him for three months. Laurelyn has already garnered his interest, he is determined that for the next three months she will be his.This is part one, of Jack and Laurelyn's story. The next is due this summer. A bit too long of a wait IMO. I liked this book it was well written. I thought the secret identities was a weak plot device, especially as Jack was a fairly famous personality, and darling of the newspapers. So trying to keep his real name and financial status a secret from the woman of the moment seemed a bit silly.Having said that Jack was a dream character, he's hot and sexy, but really attentive. Laurelyn was a very likeable character as well, I could see how she was agreeable to Jack's proposition after her previous bad experience, a no strings attached affair sounded great to her. Plus Jack being totally gorgeous sweetened the deal. I liked the chemistry between them, and the sex was passionate. This does end on a sort of cliffhanger. But I will be reading part two.
5	1360627200	I was so impressed with this book I don't even know where to begin, so let's begin dashing Jack...Jack McLachlan - urbane, extraordinaire ...cultured and refined, suave, sophisticated obscenely rich...has an aversion to marriage and personal relationships, used to getting what he wants when he wants, no woman has resisted his overture, none was able to say no when he offers a month long romance ( that's right, 30 days and that's it!)hot sex and expensive gifts and be treated like a real princess under one stipulation, he will not tell his name or anything about him and he does not want to know anything about them either. His own set of rules and everything ends at the end of the 30 day term, he won't be seen or be heard of again, then goes and hops to the next conquest...that's until he set eyes on charming Laurelyn. He was so sure he can entice her with his enigmatic charm he proposed his usual game with the same rules for the duration of her three months stay inAustralia...Only this time he has no idea he's met his match.Laurelyn Prescott - a beautiful all american girl, a musician, sweet, beguiling, despite her not so happy childhood she turned out to be well grounded, level headed, smart, intelligent,(and pole dances too!) unpretentious and unassuming who captures everyone's heart without even trying.Having her heart broken once, Laurelyn decided to join her crazy best friend Addison to Australia to visit her brother Ben and stay with him for the next three months. On their first night they went to a club on a Karaoke night,got up and sang after a few drinks and there he caught Jack McLachlan roving eye. So taken with her he used all tricks and wiles he knew to find out anything about Laurelyn and eventually got a dinner date with her. Jack doesn't go beat around the bush, tells Laurelyn flat out he wants her and want to spend the next 3 months with her, he'll make all of three months the best she'll ever have and make her dreams and fantasies all come true. In exchange, he will not tell her his name or anything about him and does not want to know hers either. At first Laurelyn was aghast, taken aback and felt insulted with the Jack's audacity and outrageous proposal, she got up and left Jack feeling bereft, wanting and more determined to pursue her.And so begins the rousing and exciting game...he sends Laurelyn bouquet of flowers and an array of breakfast delights and expensive champagne to share with her friends she's staying with the next morning with a card he signed from Lachlan. Believing she made a point and that Jack conceded, she accepted another dinner date and there Jack convinces Laurelyn the benefit of spending 3 months full of bliss, hot sex and romance, a promise of treating her everyday like a princess. To  make her agree to all this, he tells her half truth about being employed in the wine-making business(half truth since he didn't tell her he owns a large number ofthe wineries across South Australia and New Zealand) He tells her when the three months is over so are they, he will move on and so will she and because there will be no identifying information about him, she'll have no way to contact him, ever! he will not contact her and that's the way he need things to be.Somehow, when she had the time to think about this mad idea, no matter how shocking, bizarre but interesting and fascinating, at least she thought she knows how things would end, there will be no chance of broken heart, it would be the best three months of her life, Laurelyn agrees. When Jack tells her Lachlan wasn't really his real name Laurelyn in turn gave him a fictitious name, Paige Beckett.And so Paige Beckett and Lachlan Henry embarked into their affair... unknowingly, he breaks one of his rules by taking her to one of his vineyards,gives her a tour and takes her to the wine cave and there he fulfilled one of her fantasies...it was soooo hot and unforgettable!...and so is the next three months full of bliss indeed, intense amazing sex and romance, ooh yeah! So unassuming and beguiling, Laurelyn got Jack eating off of the palm of her hand, she got under Jack's skin she's all he could think of, couldn't think straight, his mind is full of Laurelyn's image,so consumed with the desire to spend more time with her he's broken all his rules.All too soon the three months end is looming ahead that signifies the end of their affair, Jack loathes to think about it and dreads it...so does Laurelyn...neither one of them know how to go about it, that is, to stop the unstoppable.I like that there's an added intrigue and mystery to this story that will keep you wondering and not just their exciting adventure and their sex scenes so hot and sizzling!. I don't want to give away the story but it's a two part and of course the ending is such a cliffhanger! I guess the author wants to somehow tries to make up for it and so she treats us by letting us take a peep to a few pages of the 2nd part...and it looks so promising!Read this, it is fun and such a teaser, I highly recommend it! It's fresh and a clean story, no BDSM, just a sweet simple love story between a man and a woman.And I promise it's nowhere near any of the three different books another reviewer mentioned was copied to create this. As a matter of fact, all those three books mentioned have one thing in common...a despot, an overbearing, arrogant, domineering and abusive men!
5	1360627200	Well done! If book 2 turns out the same, it will be well worth the wait....and I hate waiting! I was impressed with how chapters alternated between characters and stayed in the moment to give you a full perspective.I have to say I liked this a lot more than 50 Shades since the characters were more believable.  So tired of 23 year old virgins.You won't be disappointed!
5	1360627200	This is a great story. I really loved this book. Do not pass it up . The characters are so lovable. And the chemistry between them is amazing!!
4	1360540800	Great first book of a series. There's lots of info I can't wait to see how it all plays out. Thank goodness Laurelyn is a good hearted character. Now Jack's relationships are strange. Would really like to understand that more. Poor rich, hot bachelor?!
5	1360540800	I absolutely fell in love with the characters!! I was hooked after the first chapter! I can not wait till the second book comes out!
4	1360540800	Good read, HOT,funny, sad & loving. I hope it works for them, because they LOVE each other. Can't wait for the next book.
5	1360540800	I thought this was a great story. Yes, many similar story lines have been done, etc., but this one still had some uniqueness to it. I must say, I like Laurelyn more than most women typically given her role in stories like this. Even more so than the Ana Steele-Grey ...........  GASPThe book kept my attention and I couldn't put it down.I'm looking forward to the next book in this series.
5	1360540800	I always read the reviews before buying any book and when I see 90+ 5 star reviews out of 100'and the reviewers rave about the characters and the story, well then I'm sold.  This one caught my interest from page 1 and held it till the very end ( which I will warn is NOT the end, but a cliffhanger, but that's OK because I'm not ready to let go of Jack and Laurelyn). I will, however, have to wait till summer 2013 for the answers.Jack and Laurelyn have an unconventional relationship / agreement, in which they agree to spend Laurelyns 3 month stay in Australia enjoying each others company with a no strings attached affair.  They each use boggus names to keep their anonymity so when they part ways, it would truly be over and neither one could look to continue the affair, staying somewhat detached in the process.  Well it was a well laid plan at first, until each starts  to feel more than expected and that's when the story gets even more interesting.  We watch as they both start to feel an undeniable pull towards each other and Jack stars to loosen up on his rules and one thing leads to another and, without going into details, i will just say that they have incredibly hot sex and i fell in love with them even more.This story is sweet and sexy with a bit of suspense and, especially toward the end, a lot of emotion and angst.  I cried at their impending separation and route for them to get their stuff together.  Cant wait for sequel.....
3	1360540800	Larelyn and Jack are a good match. She's a free spirited soul, and for a millionaire he's pretty laid back. But both have issues. She has a famous dead beat father. And she just ended a relationship that was a complete lie. She's a talented musician, writer, singer who fell for her producer. But, she didn't know he was married with children. She leaves the States with her friend to visit her brother in Australia. Now Jack is a wine vineyard millionaire who has no interest in serious relationships. He makes arrangements with women  to have short term relationships for a month. Never knowing each other's real names. He wants to have a three month this time and chooses Laurelyn. She agrees. In time, they of course find themselves having more feelings for each other than they would like. Can he get past his fear of commitment? That pretty much sums up the story. I liked it but it lacked that little umph you need in a story. I like Jack. He always stays the gentlemen women crave. But he also possesses that, "Your mine! And no-one else will have you," vibe. My kind of guy. I would definitely read the next book, but again, I wish there was just a little more UMPH to the story.
4	1360540800	Yes the premise is really good, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this because I dislike over descriptive books BUT it REALLY needed MORE of the story fleshed out! A good editor would have ask CATES for more, so Georgia, please, please, get one. E.G. One minute JACK HENRY and LAURELYN would be standing talking and the next lying naked on the bed, sure I'm paraphrasing but you get the idea. I would have LOVED more thoughts on the scene wear Laurelyn danced for Jack Henry, it gets hot but NOT SMOKIN HOT!!! I truly believe together with the story fleshed out, a good editor, your next book CAN be a best seller worldwide. Oh and maybe it's because I'm Australian but back off on the Australian idioms - I URGE you!! Daks? (How old are you, that was used in the 80's), Brekkie (never used that much) and so on...
5	1360540800	If you loved Fifty shades, Gabriel's inferno/Rapture and the Crossfire series you will love this book too. The only thing I didn't like was that I have to wait until sometime later this year for the next book in the series.
5	1360540800	Loved this book! Georgia you've got a good one here and I can't wait for the next one! Get it, you won't be disapointed!
2	1360540800	I liked the premise of this story. Who hasn't wanted to get away from everything after a bad breakup and especially to Australia. But this one just didn't do it for me.  Yes it dabbles in the ero romance genre, however it seems like Cates just strung a bunch of sex scenes together with very little time given to the the lead up. Another annoying abrupt ending. Supposedly part of a(nother) trilogy, but if there was a cliffhanger - it wasn't exciting nor enticing, so we'll see.  Maybe I'm missing something but it just seemed too formulaic to me.
4	1360540800	This was better than I expected. Now I can't wait for book 2. The book was not only entertaining, it had a lot of hot romance! It was just fun to read. It made me smile mostly as the book progressed. The characters emotions were right on target. This one was just fun.
5	1360540800	WOW........I felt it all...every single emotion.  So well written.  A beautiful romance between two strong characters.  The characters were developed in such a way that you fell in love with them.  The POV switched back and forth so that you got to know them both.  I usually do not like it when authors do that, but I LOVED it here and it added so much to your bond to them.  I did not expect the ending, I am still reeling from it and am chomping at the bit for the next one!  WELL DONE....  A MUST READ.
5	1360540800	This book was juicy. I love how the agreement made in this book wasn't like the other books when contract are being made.I can't wait for the second book hopefully we find out more about Lauralyn's life.
5	1360454400	I absolutely loved this book. The evolving intrigue of the Alpha-male with Laurelyn and the heavy sprinkling of sexual chemistry makes this a very captivating read. I couldn't put the book down. Just bummed to realize the sequel is not yet available.
5	1360454400	I read this book in one day!! I couldn't put it down. Great writing, can't wait for the next book.
5	1360454400	Sweet and sexy! I read this book in one night. I can not wait until the next one comes out this summer! Must read!
4	1360454400	This book is about a rich billionaire who meets an American girl.  She is in Australia for vacation or 3 months. He has a proposal for her. No strings attached kind of relationship until she leaves. They have a lot of sex in these 3 months. Very steamy. I really hate it when books leave you wanting more. The 2 nd book is not out til summer. So it's a little frustrating. Had I known I probably would have waited.
5	1360454400	This book was soo amazing. i read it in less than a day because it was soo good!cant wait for the second book to come out!!
5	1360454400	Georgia Gates one word describe thise book, "HOTNESSS", loved every minute of couldn't put it down. I fell inluv with the characters especially Jack & Laurelyn, this book will keep you wanting more even when it ended. Simply superb...cnt wait for the next installment to be released.
5	1360454400	This is a beautiful story! Will read over and over. I love Jack Henry can't get enough of him. Need 2nd book NOW can't wait!
5	1360368000	This book was a great read. The characters were well defined, but the author still leaves some mystery for the next book. Highly recommended.
5	1360368000	Ever since we had fifty shades by E L James and Bared to you by Sylvia Day- one of my favourite authors, there are a lot of these kind of stories from other Authors aound that just dont rate it for me.THIS IS SO NOT THE CASE WITH THIS STORY. I loved everything about this book. The Cover was amazing( and for those who know me know a cover is one of the deciders for me some of the time)I think Georgia got it so right. I loved that it wasn't just set in America like so many before it from other authors. It was set in Australia so my interest was picqued. The descriptions of the settings was right and i felt like i could clearly see the picture that was painted.I loved Laurelyn Prescotts character and her friend Addison. These girls go to spend the summer with Addison's brother Ben for the summer. Laurelyn is not looking for romance and is here to think about her future, and to get away from her mums insistance on meeting her real dad. Laurelyn bumps into Jack McLachlan in a bar and the next night at a function to which she agrees to go out with him for dinner. Jack makes an offer to Laurelyn for her to spend the next three months together no strings attached and no first names...I couldnt put this book down once i started it. It took me 5 hours straight to read it all. i CAN'T wait for the next book to come out. If you are a big fan of contempary books you have to read this one.
5	1360368000	Love shows it face when you least expect it.  They thought they could spend 3 months and then walk away, it just couldn't happen.  The experience, the intertwined sweet wanting for more each day had me hooked with this book.  I cannot wait for the next one.
4	1360368000	OMG!!!!!! HOW CAN YOU LEAVE US HANGING LIKE THAT?!?!?!?!As you can tell from my initial reaction, I was not happy about the way this book ended. But I knew before starting it that this was a series. And I also had gathered from previous reviews, there was going to be a cliff hanger. So, it is my own damn fault and now I just have to deal with it!Jack does not do relationships. He has too much to lose by getting involved with someone that knows everything about him. So, he has worked out the perfect plan. He &#34;dates&#34; women for a set amount time and after that both parties walk away. Oh, and did I mention these women do not ever get his real name or any other personal info about him?Lauralynn has just arrived in Australia when Jack sees her for the first time. She is everything he is looking for in his next, um we shall just call them a companion.  He devises a scheme to ensure they meet and he proposes his dating scenario to her. And surprisingly, she agrees.This chemistry between these two is smokin'. This book is definitely not short on the smexy scenes.This book truly has it all and would have been a 5 star read and on my faves shelf had it not been for the cliff hanger. I understand that authors like to drag out the story and keep us wanting more but needless to say it is very frustrating for the readers!I would recommend this book, however please be advised the next book is not due out until sometime this summer.
5	1360368000	Georgia Cates known more for her YA books sure can write a sexy adult contemporary book!  I started this book not sure what to expect and LOVED it!  I couldn't put it down!*sigh* Jack Henry McLachlan is just dreamy.  It also helps that he's HOT, ridiculously rich and one of Australia's most eligible bachelors!  Laurelyn Prescott is an American girl on vacation for the next 3 months with her best friend Addison.  She is a rising musician trying to get away from her life in Nashville.The night Jack is on the prowl looking for his next "relationship" he hears Laurelyn singing and when he sees her he is determined that she will be the next one, his number 13.  He meets Laurelyn and proposes a 3 month sexual relationship where they don't know each others real name and at the end walk away from each other.  Jack promises Lauelyn the time of her life with traveling, gifts and an intense sexual relationship.  Laurelyn is extremely attracted to Jack and thinks why not?  She's only in Australia for 3 months and not looking for a relationship.During the 3 months Jack "Lachlan" and Laurelyn "Paige" actually get to know each other and Jack's walls are quickly breaking down.  He's breaking all of his own rules with Laurelyn and before you know it the 3 months come to an end.  Will Jack realize that he's falling in love with Laurelyn before it's too late?  The book is told in alternating POVs, which I loved and it does end on a bit of a cliffhanger.  Still I LOVED reading about Jack and Laurelyn and CAN'T WAIT for Beauty from Surrender!  Easily a 4.5 star read!!
5	1360368000	I am not going to write a long drawn out review as soooo many others have already done this to death. But I will say this book is Fabulous and I was hooked right from the beginning. The writing is sensational and sensual. The storyline is a little predictable but written at a fast pace that putting the kindle/book down is impossible. Laurelyn and Jack are the main characters and I loved them both for their individualism. Read this book when you know you've got time to immerse yourself in their world and shut everything else out!
5	1360368000	Okay, I'm usually first to complain about books that don't end at the end of the first book, and I swore off getting suckered into buying any more of them but....maybe because it was an Aussie man (where do they hide the ugly men in Australia?) or I wanted to torture myself but I ended up buying this book knowing full well that there would be a cliffhanger.  Soooooo I read the ending first, knew how it would end and then began the book.  Of course this formula has been done to death, predictability is obvious, but I still enjoyed this book.  Possible Spoiler Alert!!!!I feel it's safe to assume that there was no Mrs. Robinson in Jack's past...he's not a broody, tortured man with a dark past...just one, who for some reason (perhaps his wealth) doesn't want to commit.  I don't believe some deep dark secret will be exposed in the second book.Laurelyn pretty much laid everything out on th table about her past...I do believe her mother will be a stumbling block for Jack in book 2.  finding her shouldn't be too hard because he does have the name of Blake Phillips...so I don't this a reunion will be too far into the book, sooooo, we're left with watching how this whole thing will play out.I read the book in one sitting, it was charming and witty banter flew all over the place.  All in all, I really enjoyed the book.
1	1360368000	*Might contain spoilers, please beware!*I started this story with high hopes due to the fabulous reviews, but the more I read, the more puzzled I became.This is yet another 50 Shades knockoff, and though I love the possessive billionaire trope, this just didn't hit the spot, mainly because even though the words are down on the page, the story simply feels empty. I couldn't get involved in any situation. Not excited when Jack propositioned her. Not sad. We can never really see some great chemistry between them to begin with, and there were simply no high stakes for anyone. Things passed so quickly and almost uneventfully, with very few descriptive tags that really told me how our heroine felt about all this. This is the beauty of 50 Shades and Bared to You. We get excited along with that "inner diva"! We quiver with the reference to "Angel" because of the emotional connection formed with the characters.There was nothing in there to connect to, unfortunately. The hero isn't remotely sexy or truly mysterious (even when he refuses to disclose his identity (the fact that he OPENLY refuses to disclose his identity just takes all the mystery away. Hey, call me Lachlan, but I'm not really Lachlan, it's just so you can call me something. I want to keep my name secret. Duh?), and aside from the name issue, I was quite confused at the anticlimatic way that the heroine learns his true name, and he then realizes that she doesn't care about it. So why had he worried about it so much? Wow, because it was stupid since the beginning? Again. Completely anticlimatic. All the other events that happen in the story have been so done previously, that they don't hook you to the point where you have to keep reading and find out the rest. And after an entire book of blah and very, very plain conversations like: "I'm at the airport." "How long does it take you to get here?" "Not long." "Okay...." etcccc), this book stops at a cliffhanger? As though NOW I am supposed to get interested to what even happens to these people, and shell more money?I finished this book, because I paid for it, but it didn't really get better, nothing surprised me, nothing moved me, and I might have just been staring at a blank page for the "effect" it had. Sorry. I don't like putting down an author's work. I love books and love authors, but I want to be honest here since a lot of people keep buying books based on reviews up on Amazon, and lately the finds I have discovered (a lot of them 4.5 and 5 star reads) have been woefully bland, unoriginal, and lacking zing. If this book might have had three stars on average, I might be leaving a three star review, but the hype totally raised my expectations and not a single one of them was met. Not a sexy hero. Not a fun heroine I could really like. Not a charming secondary character. Or a truly deliciously erotic sex scene. Every aspect of this book to me was blah. :(
5	1360281600	Loved everything about it.  Ready for the next one! Sexy, funny, and an easy read. Chemistry between these 2 is hott.
5	1360281600	I just have one question; why do i have to wait for book 2 until summer 2013?  I hate when I read a GREAT book and then have to wait months to read the final outcome. By that time, I've moved on to the next book and lost interest in the story.  With all that said, in my opinion Beauty from Pain was excellent! I couldn't put it down.
5	1360281600	This is definitely a must read story!!!!!! I can't wait to start the next one "Beauty From Surrender".  This was so good, I read it in one day!!! Great job Georgia Cates keep up the great work!! No pressure their lol
5	1360281600	I can honestly say this book has given me the classic book hangover.  Which doesn't happen very often for me.  This story is about Laurelyn and Jack.  Laurelyn is on an extended vacation with her best friend Addison.  They are staying with Addison's brother Ben for three months in beautiful Australia.  Laurelyn catches Jack's eye out one night.  He wants her to be his companion for three months in his idea of a relationship.  Three months no real names, no strings, no expectations, and ending the relationship with no further contact.  Laurelyn is nothing like his previous companions and he finds himself breaking his own rules.  His American girl.Have I said how much I adored this book.  Beauty from pain  by Georgia Cates was such a beautiful story.  I loved Laurelyn and Jack they really fit together.  They had some ups and downs of course.  They were honest with one another.  The arrangement worked for both of them in more ways than one.  Jack was so sweet and loving towards Laurelyn.  I loved him.  Laurelyn brought the best out in Jack.  Now I wish I could describe the emotions I went through while reading this.  I can't seem to put them into words.  The usual I laughed I cried and then I laughed some more,  doesn't seem to fit the bill.
4	1360281600	I thoroughly enjoyed this journey of characters. The end left me hollering for more. Waiting impatiently for next book to come out.
5	1360281600	This has become one of my favorite books I have read such an interesting story I just couldn't put the book down. May 30 sounds way to far to read the next book I will count stating today!!!!!!
5	1360281600	Enjoyed this very much. Downloaded at 7pm finished at 12:45 am! Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to continue the story! Descriptive but not overboard on love scenes.
5	1360281600	Loved this book.  The author did another great job.  This was just a feel good, no extreme drama and I loved it.  I'm giving it 5 stars and I put it in my
5	1360281600	Ok it's my first review and I read ALOT first off what I LIKE.  I like the realness that the characters share. The "misunderstandings" are resolved whereas in other books it leads to crazy conflict.  I like that the ending had to happen the way it did. No way around it. I like that she called his hand. Take that Jack!What I didn't like.. waiting till summer for a sequel. The ever present references to Fifty shades example.."fair point well made". It's a strong book no need to lean on fifty.In conclusion, it's a good read and I enjoyed it.
5	1360281600	I could not put the book down.  I love it and I don't say that about many books. Hell I hardly write a review. But oh my!!! Romance, steamy sex scenes and a gorgeous alpha male (not completely over the top). Well written...not crazy sex like I have been reading lately. Can't believe I have to wait until the summer for the next book. BUMMER!!!!!!
4	1360281600	Beauty from Pain is a very enjoyable story with flawed, loveable characters, and a romance that really sucks you in. I loved the teasing banter between our hero and heroine. They made me smile often and laugh out loud at times. I am so invested in their relationship, I really can't wait for the next book in the series. I am in this predicament with several series at the moment -- waiting VERY impatiently for the story to be continued -- but this one is really on my mind. I want a fantabulous HEA for Laurelyn and Jack, and I want it now! LOL
5	1360281600	Loved this story! It never gets dull. would highly recommend this book. If the sequel is anything like this book, then we're in for a treat.
5	1360281600	Oh boy..I'm almost done with this book...I like the story...but I didn't realize that this was a series (even though it says so in the title description-lol). I almost don't want to finish it! When does book two come out? I made the mistake of reading the Crossfire series w/o realizing that the thrid book wasn't released and it's killing me! I hate not completing stories lol.Finished the book...and love it! Love the second one too...Beauty from Surrender and now I'm off to read Beauty from Love #3 :)
5	1360281600	I have read just about all books in this category.  This one was a little bit different which is good. I love how it is placed in Australia. How long must we wait for the sequel. This is my problem I read these books too fast. I could not put this book down. Read it in 2 days.  Now I have to wait 4 months or so for the next book.  How does one remember all these books?? I would give this book a try. It is a light little read. Jack Henry will be another character that all women will fall in love with.
5	1360281600	Wow, I am officially hooked on Georgia Cates.  The writing in this book is incredible.  I LOVE Jack Henry and want to see how hard he fights for her love.  I cannot wait for the next one.  Thank you for taking me on this romantic ride!!!!
5	1360281600	OK so I thought this was going to be 50 Shades of Grey but it was not, I could not put my kindle down.  I loved everything about Jack Henry and Laurelyn.  Cliffhanger but DEAR GOD it was worth it!!!!! Read it and you will not be disappointed
5	1360281600	Amazing book!!! I couldn't put this book down, outstanding writing, characters and timing. I love how Laurelyn and Jack's love grew so naturally. I never wanted it to end but even that was flawless, can't wait for book 2! So happy to have got Chapter 1 of book 2!
5	1360195200	I really enjoyed this story and looking forward to the continuation. It made me laugh a lot. The characters are extremely likeable. I've read too many books where I want to slap the hell out of the female character. Not Laurelyn. She's awesome! Jack is pretty adorable too.:) I highly recommend reading this story.
5	1360195200	So this is my first review ever. It will be short, but I had to write that I loved this book and I can't wait till the next book comes out. I will be reading this book over and over again. That's how I know I loved this book.
5	1360195200	While, initially, I was skeptical of Lachlan/John Henry's appeal, he quickly won me over with his honesty (ironically)!  He is gorgeous, generous and sweet.  Laurelyn (great name) is a sweetheart and deserves her HEA.  I very much look forward watching her talent grow as the H/H relationship unfolds/evolves? in book 2!  I love country music, so I hope we spend a bit of time in Nashville in the next book!  Although, all thing should lead back to Australia!  After all, the Maclachlans are fun and I am sure Audrey has more evil up her sleeve.  Btw, Ben is a complete creep (sorry Addison) and so deserves his comeuppance!All in all there are many elements to appreciate about this novel and few, if any, negatives.  One reviewer gave three stars because the story &#34;has been told before!&#34;  Uh, excuse me, but how long have you been reading the romance genre?  So what, If told well, with enough uniqueness to set apart, I'll read this story over and over again!  There are plenty of books published that are not well-written or developed.  I embrace those those that lead me to scaring my puppy when screaming &#34;Nooooooo&#34; as the curtain on the first act falls!
5	1360195200	I love Laurelyn. There have been soooo many women in the books I've read lately that are weak, immature, insecure, fickle, and/or just plain lame. Not this one. She is herself the whole time. And when she does the inevitable and lose her heart to Jack, she owns it immediately (no playing coy or being in denial). I love that she's a talented musician. I love that she can work a pole like a pro.I love how we were not subjected to her constant thinking of how someone as unattractive (she's not) as her can land someone as hot as him. Nope. She doesn't do that song and dance and it's so refreshing! Thank you for that alone, Ms. Cates!Possibly spoilerish...Obviously I want them together, but I hope Ms. Cates gives Laurelyn a chance to become successful as a musician; I hope we see her journey on this road to stardom. I am feeling that this will happen, and I can't wait for book 2 to see her career blossom and to see Jack ache for what he lost.
5	1360195200	Jack is used to spending weeks with a girl then leaving her in the past. He likes it that way. No commitments, no fuss. Just use the girl for what she is worth and leave her behind. The "girls" never know his name and it keeps things nice and neat in the end. This way of life has worked perfectly for him for the past few years. That is until Laurelyn walks into his life.Laurelyn is taking some "me time" and spending the entire summer with her best friend in Australia. Little did she know that a few days in and she would be given a proposal that would change her whole summer and quite possibly her life. When presented with the decision of getting to spend 3 months with a gorgeous man, what's a girl to do? Well accept obviously!BEAUTY FROM PAIN is like a cross between PRETTY WOMAN, INDECENT PROPOSAL, and unicorn tap dancing on a double rainbow. Why a unicorn tap dancing on a double rainbow? Cause that would be freakin awesome right? Mix those 3 together and you have this fascinating book with all its sexy glory. And this book is hot...like scorching hot. These two are like friggin rabbits...constantly going at it. Kudos for their race horse stamina.Even though Jack is confident and sure of himself, I started seeing some of his barriers fall when around Laurelyn. He thinks he is protecting his future from becoming prey to a hectic, time consuming lifestyle that revolves around his work, leaving no time for a wife and family. But in all honesty, he is truly hurting and lonely. He just hasn't noticed it yet. Once Laurelyn storms into his life, her sunshine breaks through his tough exterior and shows him that maybe having someone to love wouldn't be so bad after all. But his pride and thick skull may jeopardize happiness and love from ever happening.This is one heck of a story people. I actually stopped myself from finishing the book last night...giving me time to have the story last a little longer.I was just so scared for the book to end. But as soon as I get to the end I see that there will be another book. Yes, the story will continue on. Yes, we will have more of Jack and Laurelyn. Oh but that girl better make him work for it. Ummmmhmmm. Most definitely he needs to work for it.BEAUTY FROM PAIN will have you smiling one second and hot and bothered the next. The scenes are hot and continue to get hotter as the story progresses. And in the end, if you are not teary eyed, there is something wrong with you. Get this book today...read it, devour it, immerse yourself in it...and I promise you will be handing over your first born just to get your hands on book 2, BEAUTY FROM SURRENDER. Yep, it is that good.
5	1360195200	Really enjoyed reading this book -- stayed up late to get my HEA.  WHAT!!  A Book 2 coming this summer!  At midnight I'm running to my (getting longer and longer) list of sequel books I need to remember to get when they come out.  NOTE TO AMAZON:  Somehow come up with a way to remind us all when the next book in a Series we can't miss comes out.  Maybe a little box to check in the review area DO YOU WANT TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN THE NEXT BOOK COMES OUT.  Meanwhile, I think everyone will enjoy reading this Book 1.
5	1360195200	I'm not going to drone on and compare this book and tell you why it was so great.....it jut was great! I LOVED IT. could not put it down and read it in one night. I don't care if I read the same theme in 20 different books if they are all well written it is worth the read. JUST FANTASTIC
5	1360195200	Beauty from Pain has saved me from my book slump. A book slump isn't good for a gal like me who reads 4-5 books a week. It kinda sucks but Ms. Cates and her amazingly sweet and sexy story has rescued me from Kindle boredom.  Read this book today! Hit one-click and don't look back... Now I must go and patiently wait for the sequel. ::twiddles thumbs::
5	1360108800	Great book but I hate reading a book that doesn't have a ending and they make you wait for the next book to come out. Really this sucks. Couldn't the Arthur just write a hole book.I'm
5	1360108800	Ms. Georgia did a most amazing job developing her characters and making me fall in love at the same time they did. I thoroughly appreciated the fact that the "misunderstandings" weren't strung along for endless chapters and yet still allowed for adequate relationship build up. Nothing felt rushed and nothing lacked development - Naturally Perfect (So difficult to accomplish). Not necessarily an original story but very cleaverly told with a perfect flow.
4	1360108800	I really enjoyed this book and the concept behind it.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the author tended to make Jack seem much older than 30.  The way he spoke came across a little too stilted and formal at times.  Other than that it was good.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends.
4	1360108800	I LOVE THIS BOOK,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO READ.TO ME IT HAS A LITTLE TASTE OF FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AND A TOUCH OF PRETTY WOMAN . I CAN'T WAIT FOR PART 2 TO COME OUT I WILL BE LOOKING FOR IT. I HOPE HE FINDS HER AND SHE GOES WITH HIM AND THAT THEY LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MY HEART CAN TAKE ANY MORE CLIFFHANGERS. I AM ALL ABOUT LOVE AND HAPPINESS. THAT WAS THIS BOOK IS ABOUT. 5+ STARS. KUDOS TO THE AUTHOR
5	1360108800	Yes, I said it and I mean it. Add me to the list of readers who think this book is FABULOUS. I never heard of the author when I found this book. However, I too will wait very anxiously for the sequel to Jack and Laurelyn's story to continue. Hurry, PLEASE!!!!Jack 30, handsome, sexy, tender, kind, filthy rich Alpha Male, has met his match in an American girl(seed of a country/western superstar) who is probably destined for stardom. Laurelyn is an american (23 year old) who after having her heart broken by her music producer/married man, travels to Australia with her best friend for 90 days.On day one she enconters her Aussie(soon to be lover) in a hallway. He stages the whole meeting and she "seems" oblivious to his fabulous looks and voice. However,she thinks it was a fluke and moves on. The next day she enounters him at a wine tasting event. He (Jack) goes into action and makes sure she sees him, spends time with him and blocks the other male who would like to make her acquaintance more intimately..Ben. The  plot thickens as Jack makes an "indecent proposal" and she blows him off..somewhat. Determined to have things his way, by any means ncecessay, Jack and Laurelyn begin a journey. By day 89 they both have forever been changed by an encounter that started out as "the ultimate fantasy down under".Great love stories are a hopeful romantics dream read and this story left my heart racing and a smile as wide as the Grand Canyon on my face.I hope you will read it and love it as I do...
5	1360108800	This is the best book I have read in a while hands down!!! I suggest you start it early in the day unless you want to stay up all night reading it like I did. I honestly could not put it down! The pacing was great. I just wanted to keep reading to find out what happens next. I hope she releases the next book soon... I definitely put this book near the top of my favorites list!!! 5+ stars buy it you will not be sorry!!!
5	1360108800	Was a bit hesitant to read this book but so very glad I read this.  It's a great romance story coupled with great chemistry.  Can't wait for the next book!! What a great book!
5	1360108800	Loved this story! Can't wait for book two!  I was sad when it ended its going to kill me to have to wait until summer to read book two! If you love a good love story read this book! You won't be disappointed!
5	1360108800	I read this based on the positive reviews and 5 stars. I loved it! Sad that's over and I'm so anxcious for the next book.
5	1360108800	OMG!  This is a must read!  I could not put this book down!  I read it until midnight because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen at the end.  Of course, there is a cliff hanger at the end so now I have to wait for the next book to see what happens.  Please hurry with that! I loved the story line.  The story starts out as a "no strings attached" relationship, but then the characters develop feelings for each other and you want them so bad to get together.  Hopefully they do in the next book.  Buy it now!
5	1360108800	I loved loved loved this book! Very well written. Kept me captivated until the very end which was @ 3:00 in the morning! I can't wait for the 2nd book
5	1360108800	Georgia, Georgia, Georgia!!!!! I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!! :)I so could relate to the main characters Laurelyn and Jack. I felt and talked alot like her back in my earlier single days. I could really see myself taking Jack up on the crazy offer after living in Sydney for 3 years. Yes there is something magical about the place and so safe it just made sense to me. Loved the story and cannot wait for book 2!!!! I hope it is as great as this one!!!!Thanks for the Alpha Male angle..... can never get enough of those!!!!Cheers,Kara
5	1360108800	I loved this book, could not put it down, highly recommend others to read it. Good to find out that it is part of a series.
5	1360022400	This book is so good, I just couldn't put down. This book is sexy, romantic and refreshing. I fell in love with the two main characters: Jack Henry and Laurelyn they have grea chemistry, wow ! I can't wait for book two. I have read all of Georgia Cates books, and they are all awesome.
5	1360022400	Loved this!! I expected much of what we've come to read these days .. Rich hot guy blah blah.. Nope! So much more!! It had that but it was different. The heroine was amazing and jack mclachlan *sigh* ... Read this book it's worth the torture of waiting for the next one.
5	1360022400	I don't usually leave reviews, but I wanted more stars next to this title so others would be more willing to enjoy! Great book and I couldn't put it down!
5	1360022400	I really enjoyed this book and will definitely buy the next in the series an  look forward to its release.  I never write in depth reviews that could potentially give away spoilers.  Just buy the book I promise you will not be disappointed!
5	1360022400	Very few books draw me in like Up in the Air, All In, Gabriel's Inferno, Bared To You, etc., but this book did. After reading This Man earlier in January, it was hard to find characters and a storyline that would keep me up all night, but  thanks to Georgia Cates, I now have Laurelyn and Jack. This story had me riveted from the first page when Jack proposes an unusual arrangement to Laurelyn upon her arrival for a 3 month summer visit to Australia. She accepts and they embark on a HOT relationship. I won't call it a romance because neither one agrees to that, at least at first.  Both the characters have some serious issues but I don't want to give away any spoilers.I loved the Australian setting but I will admit I had to look up a few slang words.Sanger- sandwichOldies - parentsColdie - beerBrekkie - breakfastThere is a cliffhanger ending, of course, but the author treats us to a delicious Prologue. The sex between Jack and Laurelyn is super HOT but I really felt a connection between the two, thanks to Ms. Cates' writing. More Jack please! And make it quick!
5	1360022400	So far THE best book I've read in 2013.I couldn't put it down!  And the end, oh god, WHY?!I'm definitely looking forward for the next one.
5	1360022400	I am a super, super picky reader and well over the 'young adult audience' but I seriously L-O-V-E-D this book!  AMAZING!  So very worth the read...you won't be able to put it down either.  Cannot wait for the next in the series!
5	1360022400	Georgia has done it again.  She sucked me in, made me laugh, cry and fall completely in love with this couple.  I adore reading about messy couples and this was just that.  A messy relationship that started out strange yet simple.  I will be waiting online refreshing amazon the day the sequel comes out.  Can Not wait for it :)5 FULL starts without hesitation :)
5	1360022400	A did the preview before purchase since it had little reviews but those few left a lot of reasons to say why not I'll try it.....WOW! So glad I took a chance, I really enjoyed every part of it. I know this one is going to the top or even best sellers soon! Can't wait for Beauty#2 :)))
5	1360022400	LOved it! Read my full review here @ liezel77.wordpress.comI tell you, the sexy, alpha-male, millionaire bachelor looking- for -female- companionship just keeps on getting better and better. This one really blew me away. I loved everything about it! I loved how music from  various genres was so involved in making this story just perfect. And for once I loved it was more of a romance and not some sort of BDSM relationship.
5	1360022400	I was very surprised at how much I liked this book because a lot of this genre that is currently out seems very repetitive and a knock off from FSOG.I liked that the story took place in Australia and that the characters develop more than a sexual relationship.  I can't wait for the next installment.
3	1360022400	This story was a quick and easy read.  The story was basic to say the least.  It was very easy to predict what would happen next.  I feel the main reason is that this type of story has not only been done before but, it has been done much better by other authors.This story came across as a poor attempt at Fifty Shades of Grey, Bared to You and Beneath this Man.  It seems this Author was trying to jump on the Contempory Erotic Romance band wagon but failed to meet the high standards at which the other authors in this category are regarded.There are a few reasons that this book is a fail for me.  First, I didn't feel with this book.  Throughout all of the situations that arise, they happen and are over just as quickly.  So, I couldn't feel the power of the situation or how it could possibly have bothered the characters that much.  But, then it was over and they just moved on.  There was no flow to the events that took place.  They met...he propositioned her...she acted offended...then she accepted...he had "rules"...then he broke them for her...identities needed to be a mystery...then they weren't...they got over it...ex comes to "visit"...they aren't supposed to fall in love...they have a "profound" moment...I feel the author told the story too quickly and moved from one event to the other without enough detail to make you feel the story.There was no detail in explaining any of the events that take place so I found it hard to put myself in the story and really feel.  They have lots of sex but there is no detail to it, no feeling or emotion so I couldn't feel the intensity of the moment which is what I thought the author would have wanted.  The main male character was supposed to be a strong, confidant, established, wealthy Alpha male but, his behaviour wasn't consistent enough to make me feel his intensity either. He doesn`t battle with his emotions enough to make you feel that he`s struggling with his new and apparently unwanted feelings.The main male character is where I saw the most similarities with other popular stories.  That bothered me because an Author should be able to tell a story without copying another.  "Jack Henry" just cannot be compared to Christian Grey, Gideon Cross, or Jesse (Lord of the Manor).  .There were some parts that were direct lines from other books I have read and that bothered me and could be affecting my over all opinion on this Author and her quality of work.  Ie: the 3 month "arrangement", a certain car comment, making her "come hard", not wanting to love, being extremely wealthy and wanting to take care of her and give her everything during this arrangement.I am confused as to how this book has gotten such high reviews.  This type of story has been done, and done better.  I will not say don't buy this book but, if you have read Fifty Shades of Grey, Bared to You or This Man Trilogy you will be very bored and disappointed with this book.  This book doesn't come close to meeting the standards of those books.  With some originality the idea of this story has some potential.  I didn't skip ahead but, I didn't feel anything at all.I gave this book a 3 because I didn't hate it but it deserves a 2 based on the fact half of it is the work of other authors!
5	1360022400	Jack Henry is quite the character.  Lauralynn is so innocent and I am really looking forward to book 2.  Another great read, quick and easy.
5	1360022400	While I am really getting tired of this whole book premise of worldly older guy and young naive girl, this book is a little bit different.American girl goes to Aussie for a break from her life and meets the country's most eligible and wealthiest bachelors. He likes no strings attached brief relationships a la 50 Shades.The book is very well paced with characters whom you easily become attached. If you are shopping in romance, this book will not disappoint!
5	1360022400	Great read, great plot and can't wait for more. Both characters were amazing and it felt like a true story... when is part 2 coming?
5	1359936000	I bought this book for the cover and book title alone I was completely hooked instantly I love both povs...I fell completely in love with the main charactersCant wait for book 2!!!
5	1359936000	I love this story! I loved that Jack Henry Isn't a complete jerk in his dealing with Lauralynn. In his situation he certainly could be and I think most authors would have set him up to be more of a dirtbag. I think he is very lovable and I can appreciate that and I think it is refreshing. Bravo for a well written and well edited book. Definite recommend!
5	1359936000	First time reading a by Georgia Cates. I was impressed. I like  it because the  lead wasn't an arse an d showed hos feelings just always at the wrong time. Really looking forward to book two! Also plan to check out other  books by Ms Cates.
5	1359936000	As crazy as the story seems from the beginning, you can't help but fall in love with it.  If you loved Fifty Shades, you'll love this.
5	1359936000	This will be short and exact. Great book, story, plot, characters, funny, sad, intriguing. I loved all of it. II wasn't aware it wasn't a stand alone book and now I am so bummed that I have to wait for more books.I totally recommend you read this book. You will love it
5	1359936000	"Baby, you've fuc8ed my mind without touching my body."I am on a book high after reading Georgia Cates Beauty From Pain. High...yes this book was some of the finest Kindle Crack I have ever devoured. There are only a few books that make it too my all time favorite's shelf...and this is one of them.Laurelyn aka Paige is an attractive twenty-two year old aspiring country music artist, avid pole dance exercise enthusiast and happy-go-lucky sort of person (she somewhat reminded me of Mary from the movie Something About Mary.) Laurelyn and her best friend Addison take a much needed vacation all the way around the world in Australia. On her first night out on the town she meets Jack aka Lachlan.... who stalks her like a hunter selecting its prey. Jack is a super attractive, Aussie vineyard owner who wants nothing more than to add Laurelyn to his no strings attached anonymous piece of ass list. Laurelyn is super attracted to Jack and has no idea he is Australia's most sought after eligible bachelor. Jack lays his cards on the table by offering Laurelyn a relationship "agreement" with promises of the slamming sex and fun while she is on holiday with the expectation of nothing more. Laurelyn dives into this relationship understanding that she will cease to exist in Jack's life when her three month trip is over and they part ways. She doesn't think she will fall for Jack since she will be going back to the US. Jack is thrilled that she agrees to their commitment free relationship with a firm expiration date in place. She didn't expect that her heart would ever turn into emotional road kill. He didn't think he would ever want to settle down...and this is their story.I have to say I LOVED this book. Cates writing style is brilliant and engaging... and awesome steam factor. Read this books now...if you can deal with a cliffhanger ending. Cates published the first chapter of book two...which will hold me over. Ok...truth be told I'm dying for the next book. Cates is a writer to watch and this book effing rocks!Review appears on Goodreads and Amazon.
5	1359936000	I highly recommend this book!  We are involved with the characters and enjoy the development of their relationship! unfortunately we have to wait several months for book two but I know it will be worth the wait!
5	1359936000	Soooo good! Couldn't put it down. Their story  was truly different than anything I've read here on my kindle!!! Loved it.
5	1359936000	I had never heard of this author but I liked the description of the story so I took a chance and bought it. Boy was I surprised, this book sucked me in from the very beginning! I had no idea it was the first of a 2 part series so now I'm anxiously waiting for the next book to be released! Everything about this book worked for me, great characters, interesting setting, hot sex, and I liked how the author changed the POV from one chapter to the next. You always knew what Jack and Laurelyn where thinking. Great read for a cold snowy day in the mid-west!
5	1359936000	This is a book you won't want to put down! I loved it from beginning to the end. I can't believe I have to wait till early summer to find out how it ends...... So not fair! So I hope Georgia Cates finishes it early! (PLEASE)
5	1359936000	This book has it all and I am in total LOVE with it. I can not wait for the second book! Make this a must read for a hot, steamy leading man with equally hot and steamy love scenes.
5	1359936000	This is my first book by this author and boy am I in love. I really enjoyed this romance and I don't know how I'm going to be able to stand it until I have part two of this tale on my Kindle! It had me right from the start, and I could not put it down, not even for the Super Bowl, Beyonce, and yes the commercials and the 30+ minute black out could not compete with this story. There are so many things left unanswered: What happened to the last real relationship that Jack Henry had 4 years ago before he got to number "13", Will Laurelyn unite with her sperm donor, and is it a mere coincidence that Ben and Addison's family are also in the wine business-inquiring minds must know. Also, something tells me we have not seen the last of Ben or Audrey; I could even see them teaming up and trying something crazy. I have a strong feeling that Margaret is going to make sure that Jack Henry and Laurelyn end up together, I just can't wait to follow the journey that gets them there! Hurry Georgia, I can bearly wait :)
5	1359849600	So I bought the book not knowing what to expect, since it was the first time I had ever purchased anything from the author. So I decided to throw caution to the wind, the title sounded pretty good so I had to see what it was about and at the time there were like zero reviews to look at.I am so elated that i got it because it is fan-freaking-tastic!!!!!!!I was completely caught up from the beginning always wanting to know what was going to happen next. I could not put the book down! I was completely consumed by the story and the characters.I had lots if emotions running through me during the entire book. I laughed, I was mad, confused, overjoyed, hurt and my heart did the little flutter thing.I had no idea the book was a series and when I got to the end not knowing it was the end I was completely flabbergasted!!!! I kept going back saying  NO WAY!!!! That cannot be it!!!! I need more like NOW!!!!Jack.....oh jack.... I love him!!!!!!Ben....I want to kick you in the ball sack:)Laurelyn.... You know how to change the game and you rocked at it:)I don't want to write about the story because I could go on and on and I do NKT want to give anything away. I want you to read it and I know you will love it!!!! Nothing better than a hot man being beat at his own game!!!BUY IT!!!!!READ IT!!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!~ Happy reading~
4	1359849600	Jack McLachan doesn't do relationships, but he does do short term, mutually consensual sex affairs. In fact he's done those twelve times in the last four years. Laurelyn Prescott does relationships, that is until she discovers that the one she thought she was in is a lie.  When she joins her best friend Addison for a 3 month visit to Australia, relationships aren't on her agenda. She prefers to find romance in a good book."...pick up where I stopped on the slutmance I`d started earlier."Laurelyn is a singer, whose mother has a history of addiction and neglect and her father is someone she refers to as the "sperm donor". She was the result of her mother's fling with a famous country singer, who chose not to be a part of Laurelyn's life.Addison's family owns vineyards in California and her brother Ben and his friend Zac are students studying wine in Australia. Addison and Zac strike sparks off each other immediately, Laurelyn and Ben, not so much.  At least not on her side, leading to a little bit of drama. Addison welcomes a short term fling and knows how to keep Zac from taking her for granted. Laurelyn is a bit skeptical on her friend's strategy."You know me. I don't want to be that girl, the one who wears out her welcome." Right, because dude doesn't owe you anything after he gets in your pants.From the moment Jack spots Laurelyn singing in a bar he is impressed and utilizes both his brain and wallet to learn the necessary information to arrange for their next "coincidental" meeting. His proposal: three months of mind blowing sex and a fantastic time followed by a parting of the ways. Not least of which is one of the important rules of this game; anonymity. False names, no important shared details of their backgrounds.  Laurelyn is still smarting from her last disastrous breakup, and is hesitant to enter into such an unconventional agreement.  Although Addison offers another one of her pearls of wisdom,"The best way to get over somebody is to get under someone else."Who can argue with such sage advice? What starts out as the perfect uncomplicated set up quickly becomes complicated. Realizing that they both enjoy more than a little off the charts sex (and there is plenty of that) they reveal more details of their histories and truths about themselves than they intended.  Thrown in the mix are a couple of ex's who want back in, Jack's meddling family and Laurelyn's daddy issues and there is plenty to keep a reader interested.What happens when the agreed upon three months is over, and both find that they are not ready to say goodbye? Cates has managed to create interesting, intelligent, humorous and sensual characters with Laurelyn and Jack.  Their relationship develops at just the right pace and there is enough heat to satisfy the appetite. I am not normally a fan of cliffhangers and sequels, but this is one series that I look forward to continuing.
5	1359849600	I cannot wait for the second book, I love this book I cried laughed and cursed the author when I realised I was gunna have to wait for the second part :)
5	1359849600	This one just about blew me away. It took me by surprise - I loved every second I was with this book and couldn't put it down. There's also a major cliffhanger to leave you desperate for book two.Well, this one came out of nowhere for me!! What an amazing story - it just blew me away. It totally consumed me - I was engrossed from the first word right through to the very end and, yes, there's a doozy of a cliffhanger to keep you hanging on for the sequel which is not due out until the summer. How can I wait that long?? Why?? I need it now!!The Blurb sums it up pretty well - Jack McLachlan, Aussie mutli-millionaire vineyard magnate, arranges his short term `relationships' to avoid emotional attachment. He gets his companions to agree up front to his proposition - he promises them a great time in exchange for a time limit and no real names. Laurelyn, an American girl staying in Australia for 3 months, is perfect. Jack is very attracted to her and she's got her own expiry date - a ticket back to the USA. She fits the bill beautifully and, after a bit of deliberation and some delicious encouragement from Jack, she agrees to his proposition. So, they assume the identities of Lachlan and Paige, agreeing to 3 months together and the time of their lives.Jack McLachlan - oh, be still my beating heart. I fell hard for this man and I really thought I wouldn't. I thought he'd be cold, selfish and controlled but he's not any of that. He's warm, friendly, loving, caring and very, very sexy. I loved this Aussie and could just hear that delicious accent every time he spoke!! He's got a big, loving family with a Mum who wants nothing more than to see him happily married with a brood of his own which is exactly why he's keeping his companions away from her! He's rich, he's one of Australia's most eligible bachelors but he likes to keep his private life very private and he likes to remain in control and set a time limit - no emotional attachment involved.Laurelyn is a lovely heroine - she's open, engaging, a little bit guarded and she's about to be swept off her feet by Jack. She knows this relationship has an expiry date and is determined not to fall for him but, the more time they spend together, the deeper she falls, despite her resolution not to care for him. She's got a dark and troubled past and has just got out of a bad relationship and Jack offers her everything she could ever hope for but with a time limit.They shared some really delicious sex scenes and this erotic, not kinky, and what starts out as just sex slowly turns into lovemaking and the scene when they are obviously making love for the first time is really very special and had my eyes misting a little. But Jack is determined that this companion, like all the others, is temporary, just number thirteen in a long list and that he will move on after she goes home. He's also falling deeper and deeper and the ache in his chest when he thinks she won't be there is becoming ever more painful but will he wake up and see what is right in front of him before it's too late??Of course, there's a mother of a cliffhanger that will have you screaming for more! I absolutely loved this and I need the sequel right now!! I really don't give that fifth star out very often but this is special, a fantastic romance for all of you that love those Fifty Shades style trilogies and it's only my second 5 star read of 2013 and Jack McLachlan is a new book boyfriend to melt into a puddle for!5 big shiny stars!!Our precious time together feels like a candle with wicks burning at both ends. Once the flame meets in the middle, we're over. I'll never see him again, or hear his laugh or touch his skin. I'll never share a bed with him again. Am I prepared for it when that time comes? I don't think I am, but it doesn't matter if I'm not. It's coming, and I'd better figure out how to get ready.
5	1359763200	I absolutely love this book!!! I have read many books and this is definitely in my top 10. I CAN'T WAIT FOR BOOK 2!!!!! I hope they get their HEA!!!!
4	1359763200	The hero and heroine were nuanced and interestingly flawed. I had hoped for more from secondary characters who were somewhat one dimensional. I wanted to know why Laurie gravitated towards a friendship with Addison. What happened specifically to turn Jack Henry into mister anonymous?Was it one failed romance or a series of gold diggers?
5	1359676800	Wow. Some of the scenes in this book are so real it was like I was actually watching them unfold. It starts off great from chapter one and never gets dull. I really appreciated some of the things the author did in this book that are so off the norm from every other book. I don't want to give anything away but the way the issues with #3 were resolved was refreshing. You'll understand when you read it, which you very much should. Right now! I hate when conflicts are long and drawn out, it makes the, unbelievable I think. This book was super hot without being smutty too. Two words, pole dancing.Pick this one up, you won't be sorry. Be warned though, cliff hanger ending but that seems to be the story of my life lately. Every book I read leaves me hanging. Ugghhh!
5	1359676800	I purchased this book with no reviews to go by, because it sounded interesting.....it was awesome! Loved, loved, loved it! Can't wait till the next one!
5	1359676800	I really enjoyed this book and the relationship with Jack and Laurelyn slowly falling in love. A fantastic book and I can't wait until book 2 comes out so I can finish falling in love with these two characters.
5	1359676800	I need more stars! Pronto! Georgia Cates once again has reminded me why I love her...Laurelyn and her best friend Addison are in Australia.  Laurelyn had three months. Three months to forget about her heartbreak, the lies and heal.  What she did not count on was Jack aka Lachlan and three months that would change everything!I cannot even begin to explain how much I enjoyed this book! No instant I have to be with you here. The story developed and you watched the love story unfold page after page. The witty banter, her bringing out his playful side. Perfect! Also the Aussie lingo in book... I confirmed with my girlie, spot on!Laurelyn was hurt and insecure. In her relationship with Jack you see her become bold and daring. I loved the growth in her character. Swooning sighs and awhhh....Jack Henry. He has been added to my list of book boyfriends. He is just enough "caveman" and "sweetness". It was fun to watch him change from page to page. I have to wonder though what more we have behind the surface. All the rules and protection. It makes me think we have so much more to learn. I gave up sleep because I could not put this book down. I went thru so many emotions in this book.. shed a tear and broke my heart. It was fabulous. Oh and please let me tell you... Cold showers are needed at various times.  I did mention Jack just happens to book boyfriend material, right? lol! The other characters are great too. Addison is a great friend. Jack's family I want to go hang out with them. They love him and want his happiness. His Mum's a gem! What I am trying to say is.. Read this book. Georgia Cates can we speed up book two please, sugar on top! I need my Jack Henry back pronto!"I didn't love you the day I met you, or even a month later. But somewhere between hello and the goodbye I'm unable to bear, I fell desperately in love with you."
5	1359676800	I absolutely loved this book and I was hoping it would never end.  I am really happy there is a sequel and look forward to it coming as soon as possible.  There were many moments in the book that were "sigh" worthy and I was wishing Jack would just wake up to himself and his feelings and realise that Laurelyn was the only one for him.  I loved the writing style from Georgia Cates and will definately be looking at her other works.  Very enjoyable read, thanks.
5	1359676800	This is such a beautiful book, I fell in love with the characters right away, Laurelyn and Jack are a breath of fresh air.. I could not put this book down, I finished it in one day.. I love the chemistry and playfulness that they have for each other and I can not wait to read the second book, I feel like my heart is on hold until I get to read the rest of their beautiful story! Don't think just purchase this book and thank me later. Fall in love like I did!
5	1359676800	Wow what a wonderful surprise downloaded it last night without reading reviews but based on a recommendation by AestasBookBlog and figured I would read it at a later date . Well my curiosity got the better of me and before you know I am totally engrossed and 7 hours later ,no sleep I regretfully have finished this wonderful book . My only complaint is that I hate cliff hanger endings but that being said I.highly recommend this book and look forward to its sequel
5	1359590400	This is book 13 for me for 2013. How symbolic (you'll get it when you read the book). This is the first time I have purchased a book with no reviews and read it first (and reviewed it first). I was a little apprehensive starting it last night, but by past 1 this morning and again at 6:45 a.m., I was obviously over my apprehension.I loved this book. It was well written. And had a great story. There were a few typos, but not too bad. The story flowed well and kept you engrossed in it. It was sexy, seductive and sweet all rolled into one. Just what I was looking for since the other books I have been reading this year have been lacking.The one thing that kind of had me gasping for air was that the story was practically over at 83% on my kindle. Usually, I look to see how far I've gone to see how much more there is to anticipate. This one tricked me. But at least there is a teaser for book 2. Looking forward to reading it in the summer.
5	1359590400	I was tempted to give 4 stars because of the cliff hanger ending but couldn't do it because it was so beautifully written. This book was engaging from the first page. Ready for the conclusion like now :)
5	1359590400	After dealing with heartbreak, Laurelyn and her best friend Addison, go to visit Addison's brother in Australia for 3 months. At the beginning of her trip, Laurelyn meets Jack aka Lachlan which sparks the beginning their agreement for a three month affair that turns out to be so much more."I didn't love you the day I met you, or even a month later. But somewhere between hello and the goodbye I'm unable to bear, I fell desperately in love with you."I loved this book so much, I think that both characters complemented each other really well. And I liked that this wasn't an insta-love book. This book made me feel a bunch of different emotions (meaning it made me tear up a couple of times). I think that Jack Henry had the perfect amount of alpha maleness and I can defintley say that Jack Henry is added to my collection of book boyfriends [;Oh and BEWARE this book has a sequel, I kind of assumed that it was going to be a series about different characters, but I am happy that Laurelyn and Jack Henry's story is going to be continued even if I have to wait till the summer to read it. All I can do now is count down the days....*originally posted on goodreads
5	1359590400	Once again Georgia Cates captivates us with her mad skills.  I wasn't sure I was in the mood to read one of those rich playboy books and while the synopsis didn't sound half bad I still questioned the cliche of this kind of story.  But it was Georgia Cates writing the book and she hadn't let me down yet so I decided to give it a shot.So glad I did.  While it may not have been the most prolific or profound piece it definitely was captivating.  As she always does, Cates fleshes out two intriguing main characters.  I wasn't as taken with her secondary characters as I usually am (Cates has a gift for making the secondary characters as interesting as the main characters), but I don't think they were as necessary in this book because Laurelyn and Jack Henry are so great others would just distract from them.One thing that does need to be pointed out is that this is a TBC book.  The good news is that book two will be out in the summer (at least we don't have to wait a full year).  I can't be too disappointed since I selfishly wasn't ready to say goodbye to Laurelyn and Jack Henry.(No he didn't give me permission to call him by both names but if he knew how much I love him he wouldn't mind ^_^)
5	1359590400	Georgia Cates is a master author! I have read all of her books and so my expectations of her books are high and every time she out does herself! This book is sensual, emotional and relateable. Georgia writes in a way that brings you into her characters thoughts and emotions, so that you feel it too. I reccommend all her books, Going Under and Shallow!
5	1359590400	I loved this book.  It is my first book by Georgia Cates and it won't be my last.  It is so well written.  I loved the characters and the story.  Cannot wait for the second book.
