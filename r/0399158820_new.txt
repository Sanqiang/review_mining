5	1405296000	Love J.D. Robb,s books.
3	1404950400	&#34;J.D. Robb&#34; (Nora Roberts) continues her series of science-fiction police procedurals (which started out as also romance novels, but that aspect has died back to the occasional sex scene) with, by my count, #36.It's the year 2060, and Eve Dallas, homicide lieutenant in the NYPSD, catches another case. A young mother of two has apparently been the victim of a mugging-gone-wrong, but subtle clues suggest that this isn't the real story. As Dallas and her usual supporting cast unravel the case (and others die), a tale of greed and pride is exposed. In the end, more than one perp must be caught without tipping off the others; as so often in the past, Dallas uses herself as bait to draw out a deadly killer.The sexual violence that was common in the early books has, thankfully, gone by the wayside and the crimes motivated by other things. Dallas's supporting cast continues to be fascinating, though there are times when it seems as if Robb spends too much effort trying to work as many of them as possible into the novels, as if they were some kind of &#34;Oz party.&#34;But the puzzles remain interesting, the writing spare and open, and the plotting reasonably taut. As long as Robb keeps writing the books, I'll keep reading them.
5	1404691200	Love all her books about Eve and Roarke.  Sometimes, I get lucky, and figure it out early but most of the time it is near the end.  Like the fact that Roarke is always there to save Eve at the end.The language sometimes is bad but it is supposed to be 2060. I was raised in the 40s and 50s and still do not allow that four letter word in my house.  I skip over those parts and still enjoy the story.
5	1404691200	Love this series
5	1404691200	All of the In Death series are great reads. I would like to see them in a tv show. Just as J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts as written them.
4	1404691200	like the charactersplot a little thinmain character very funny not real complex.  ill read another from this author
5	1404604800	All her books are great
5	1404518400	Great boob.  Easy to read and you really don't want to put it down.
3	1404518400	Not a bad book on its own.  As part of the series seemed like a lot of slightly changed scenes from the previous books.  Feels like this series has lost it's edge.
5	1404432000	As always, J.D.Robb does not disappoint.  Very good read.  I would highly recommend.
5	1404172800	Love all her books
5	1404172800	Awesome.book
5	1403740800	I love these books.  She is an awesome writer.  I have read them all and cant wait for the news one everytime they come out.  Great read
5	1403395200	I love all of J D Robb's books & this one did not disappoint! I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
5	1403395200	This whole series with Eve Dallas has had me hooked from the start. The cases that she takes and the way she handles them then works them out is great. Also the relationships she has with people is entertaining. Now I am reading the next one!
2	1403308800	A future cops and robbers, very unimaginative plot line.  Finished it because I felt obligated, not because I enjoyed or was engrossed in the novel.
5	1403222400	I've enjoyed reading each and every one of the JD Robb series futuristic murder mystery books.It's always fun to see how Eve will once again solve the case and how she goes about figuring out who done it.  Her rich, Irish husband, Roarke, sounds deliciously handsome.  He usually helps Eve solve cases in some way with his talents, money, holdings, or clout.The gizmos used to solve the cases and in the murders themselves are futuristic but not unbelievable.The characters and their camaraderie are fun to read and Lieutenant Eve Dallas once again takes a licking and keeps on ticking.This one won't disappoint.
3	1403136000	So an accountant gets murdered and Eve Dallas goes about investigating and mostly interviewing other accountants and....zzzzzzzzz.  Okay this book was not my favorite in the series. You might like it though if you find financial stuff interesting. The actual murder mystery was pretty boring, but what kept me going was the back stories of the regular characters, who I always enjoy reading about. There's a funny scene where Eve's cat Galahad disses her because she smells like another cat.I've been going through the In Death series and most of the mysteries are very good. Some of them are so compelling and edge of your seat that I've lost sleep.  Hopefully, the next one will be back up to speed.
3	1403136000	It wasn't a book I hated to put a side for a while.  I usually pick and choose what this author writes.  I find her books move a little slow.
5	1402963200	I have collected and read all of the &#34;In Death&#34; series by J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts). This is a really great series set in NY with a tough female homicide lieutenant.
5	1402876800	I have not read a bad Eve Dallas book.  J.D. Robb writes a wonder mystery and always keeps you guessing who the bad guy is.
5	1402876800	I've read them all and this one was just as good as all the &#34;in death&#34; books before it. Worth it!
5	1402617600	I'm a big fan of Dallas and Rourke, love the way they work together in JD Robb's books.  Can't wait for her new one.
5	1402617600	These books are really great. I think she really has a knack for murder mystery and I have enjoyed the last three books I read.
1	1402185600	This has to be the worse and most boring book I have ever read.  Probably will not be reading any more of J.D. Robb.
4	1402185600	Another great one from J.D. to add to my collection, which has reinforced my wish to read more of her work
4	1402185600	enjoyed it very much but in some ways not up to the standard of some of the earlier books ...at times seemed to drag on a little too much
5	1402099200	Another outstanding story with depth from all characters .Eve and Roarke are at it again. There love jumps off the pages.
5	1401926400	As usual. I love the Eve Dallas series. Each one keeps me reading to the end. I look forward to watching Eve and Roarke work together, the super geek & the by the guts cop, find the killers
5	1401926400	The In Death series is a fascinating series.  I've read them from the beginning, and have enjoyed each of them.  I recommend them to anyone who likes detective stories, with plenty of twists.
5	1401840000	I have every copy of every book in this series and even re-read them sometimes. I think Eve Dallas is one of the most complex, intriguing fictional characters to come down the pike in ages and I would never dream of not getting the next book in her on-going adventures as a murder cop in future New York City.
5	1401753600	I just finished this newer addition to the Death series by J.D. Robb. I own the entire series and anxiously await the one coming out in the fall. They have all been the type that you just can't put down!  Robb never disappoints in this series and I hope she keeps them coming!
5	1401408000	I waited several months to read this book as I try to save and savor my J. D. Robb books.  I always enjoy reading them and the stories and interactions are consistently good.  I am looking forward to reading the next in the series.  I have them all up to this one and this was my first kindle J.D. Robb book.  I kind of miss the hard cover on my book shelf but totally love reading on the kindle.
5	1401321600	J.D. Robb does it again.  Love how she always figures it out AND catches the bad guy with her own style and flair!
5	1401235200	I started reading this series about a year ago and finally got through and this was the last (unless she has published more in the intervening months). I love this book, these characters and it is wonderful how Robb is able to make each book as good or better than the last. I look forward to much more of the same.
5	1400976000	Another winner for JD Robb. She never fails to deliver an exceptional storyline. When I first started reading this series I had yet to here if some of the "futuristic" technology, yet now I see it in everyday life. I look forward to seeing what else comes to life and I definitely look forward to the ever evolving story of Eve Dallas and Roarke. Can't wait to see what's next.
5	1400803200	I have read all of this series and even though you don't have to absolutely read them in order u then.  Now I'm just writings on getting the next one!!&#128512;&#128515;&#128516;
5	1400716800	This is my favorite author and I almost have all of her books in this series I really enjoy Eve Dallas and her wonderful husband
4	1400630400	Always different, always entertaining, always very readable.  I have the whole series, can't go wrong with J.D. Robb and Roarke.
5	1400371200	Once again a wonderful story line with Eve and Roarke! Can't wait for them to start a family, hopefully sometime in the near future.
4	1400112000	You will love it. Eve is looking for a killer who kill an accountant. Eve hit the internet  with the  "The Flying Baby".
5	1399420800	I enjoy the suspense and how Dallas and Peabody have evolved along with the other characters. I have now got most of the J.D.Robb series, either in paper form or on my kindle. I am now anticipatingly awaiting for the next in the series.I have read most of the books several times and always cry when Coltrane dies, (Morris's love).
5	1399334400	I love J.d. robb death series and enjoy following all her beloved people in the book they become more real and develop more personality with each book.
4	1399161600	Great story once again Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her team of experts of the NYSPD and her faithful and loving husband set up a well devised plan in capturing not only the man who murdered 3 people but also in apprehending the head honcho who through his greed and stupidity managed to embezzle funds and hired a crazy maniac who killed without any guilt or remorse. Eve and her team including Rourke took down the whole organisation.I like Eve's character she's an excellent cop and always ensures her team are praised for a job well done. She has heart and soul and is very humble. She doesn't like to be praised and perceived as a wonder cop but that is exactly what she is. She always stands by her team, friends and husband and most of all she stands for the victims.
5	1399161600	Love all the IN DEATH series books by J.D.Robb...aka Nora Roberts.....Each book has a stand alone story and she adeptly fills you in on the pertinent "back story" characters each time...but doesn't take a lot of repeating for those who are reading in chronological order. The back story is what keeps me coming back for more. The characters evolve and relationships form and get stronger....love the consistency.  Excellent as always.....
5	1398902400	Love all of the In Death books.  A friend loaned me one some years ago that was 3rd in the series and I fell in love with the two main characters (Eve and Roarke) and I was so intrigued as to how they got together that I purchased and read the 1st two as well as the 3rd again and I was hooked.  Each story stands alone but once you read one or two you'll want to read them all. Each book is a different murder case to be solved by Lt. Eve Dallas which is why they stand alone.  But they also tell the continuing life stories of main and supporting characters: their lives, their loves and losses as well as their histories and what makes them what they are.  You'll come to love them all.  Somewhere around book 18 I realized I'd missed two in between so I ordered those and started reading from book one again so I could read them all in order.  (I have since re-read this series a few times.....they never get old.
5	1398729600	As always, another amazing book by my favorite author. I am patiently waiting for the next installment of the series.I hope they never end!
5	1398729600	I love the JD Robb series, and this one was very good.  I like them better when Eve and Roark get along well.
5	1398643200	I wish the in death series could go on forever......... Always a great story about Dallas, Peabody and their family and friends.
5	1398297600	I love this series of books (in death) This book has a great surprise for those who have read the other books. I think it is one of the best in the series.  Good reading!
5	1398297600	If you are a long time fan of Eve Dallas or a new comer, this is another GREAT read!  I find myself anticipating future books, as Robb never disappoints in this series!  Get this one fast!!!
5	1398211200	I have read every J.D .Robb book about Eve Dallas, Det. and everyone of them has been outstanding.  I can hardly wait for the next book to come out.  Sometimes five stars just are not enough.
5	1398211200	The story lines are always good and keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters make you laugh and cry. ;-)
5	1398211200	I am absolutely enamored with this series... I can't put them down!!! I also can't wait for the next book.
3	1398124800	I have read J. D. Robb's entire &#34;Death Series,&#34; and I have to say this one really missed the mark.  It seemed that Eve's character was totally off in this book as well as her millionaire husbands.  Toward the end of the book when they talked about Roarke coming to the rescue they said he sprang like a Panther in all the other books he was described as a Wolf.  It seems to me that someone other then J.D. Robb wrote this one.  It was the only time I have been disappointed with a J. D. Robb book, sorry :(
5	1397865600	Eve, Roarke and crew always delight me as a reader. I enjoy the mystery and suspense, as well as the love between Eve and Roarke. J.D. has given Eve such a depth of character that makes me wish I had just a drop of her tenaciousness, care for others, and desire to avenge the victims.Her plot for this book was really great, it kept me in suspense until quite late in the book (which is good) and then I just rooted for the White Hats to catch the Bad Guys.If you like cop stories, soul mate love, and a great read, you can't lose with this book (or any of the others).
4	1397865600	A different type of story that brings Eve and Roarke together for a case. It drug in a couple of places but overall, was very good
4	1397865600	Love this series...I hope there are children in the future of thisseries! Peabody needs them too... Best murder mystery novels to date.
5	1397779200	I've always enjoyed the "In Death" series of books from the very first book (and there are a LOT of books). The main characters are so well drawn they feel like friends. However, when I have to wait for a new book to come out, its like not being able to visit good friends. Then, they are back and I cozy in for a good murder mystery and storytelling of very good characters.I'm glad so many characters that have been left out for so long are back. Like Mavis, Trueheart and more. I'm hoping they continue to make appearances more often. I had stopped reading these for awhile as these other characters were missing for too long and the stories became rather the same each time. This shows that a good murder mystery (one of the better ones) with more of the characters has made a comeback.
5	1397520000	J.D. Robb writes another fast moving page turner. Eve Dallas, Roarke, Peabody and the other well formed characters are on the hunt for a killer, who keeps escalating in violence. In addition, they have to find a hacker and the mastermind behind it all before Lt Eve Dallas is his next victim.
5	1397520000	Love R D Robb's books.  Can't get enough.  These books are suspenseful, addicting and thoroughly entertaining.  Highly recommend , you won't be disappointed.
5	1397433600	As an Eve Dallas fan, I am always pleased to read MORE of her story. Please don't stop writing. My only question is WHY aren't there any Eve Dallas movies yet??
5	1397433600	Another great Eve Dallas novel.  Everyone is different, unlike another author I can mention whose plots are always the same - rich person falls on hard times, recovers from it, falls in love, and has a kid.
5	1397260800	All of this series is fantastic. I would recommend  any of these books. Eve Dallas and Peabody solve these with there wit
2	1397260800	I have been an avid Death series reader for ten or so years.  The first bunch of books in this series were amazing.  I couldn't wait until the next book was released.  It's not like that anymore.  I occasionally buy a book from the series, this was that occasion.  It's the same old story line with the same old predictable plot.  I bought this book in December of 2013 and just finished it (April 2014).  I became bored reading it so I stopped.  It doesn't grab you and hold you  until you finish reading it.  The last book I enjoyed was NY to Dallas, the few before that were so so, the ones after that are also so so.  I truly hope that Nora Roberts (JD Robb) steps up to the plate and gives this series a story line it deserves.  I know she's capable of it, but I think that she's publishing books so quickly and using ghost writers that this series is lacking in quality.  Nora if you are reading this, this series needs your magic touch!
5	1397174400	This book is another JD Robb success...I love the series I thought the price and the shipping were very good for this book.
5	1397174400	I am a full fan of J.D.Robb and I anxiously await every book she publishes.  You can never be disappointed with her books they snatch you up and draw you in until you feel as though you are living the story with them.  It is always a page turner and a hard to put down.  I have burned quite a lot of midnight oil reading her works and I am never unsatisfied.  I just wish there were more.  I have read every In Death book available.  I know the author deserves a life and I cannot expect her to constantly write but the waiting is torture.  Although I will willingly do it.
3	1397001600	a book written for for an audience in 2014 but takes place in 2060. the difference of 46 years very minor. the author should have stayed in 2014.
5	1396915200	I have all of her books as J.D. Robb and love them.  I order them as soon as they come out on paperback.
4	1396915200	I already need my next book fix. I think I am an Eve Dallas and Roarke addict. I can't get enough of them.
5	1396742400	I have followed Eve from the beginning and her story continues to bring me back. She continues to grow and amaze!
5	1396569600	j d robs is a really good writer. she makes you feel you are part of the story the in death series is very good.
5	1396569600	I love this series, have since the day it started! I love all the Characters, and was hoping someday a series would come out, but the author is brilliant! Eve is so funny in her own way! Peabody couldn't have been matched better! I feel like I know these characters inside and out! I am not able to read much due to eye issues, but when I do, these are the books I prefer to read, I hope the series continues for years to come! Highly recommended!
4	1396396800	I admit I do not know I got this book...it was in the group with the other hard cover J,D, Robb &#34;Death&#34; series...but I had a stay in hospital of 8 days and when out never went back to reading...so when I saw it last week I read it &#34;just to be complete&#34;. A straight forward story not terribly exciting but then its about a account's death and lets face it a RC Priest has a more excitement in his life than an accountant does. But the story moves along with 2 additional victims to factor in the case..I did not stay up all night to finish it because something about the writing was &#34;out of kilter&#34; and I don't know exactly what it is.. yes it bothers me , is this the high point of Robb's writing, its demise?  OK all this sounds at best a neutral review BUT BY ALL MEANS BUY IT  Dallas has a case and is on unfamiliar ground so she needs AND asks for outside help. The clues are in the paper trail so some may consider this tedious and a drag, but read on a learn how twisted finances can be when they must be covered up...it will make you appreciate the recent Wall Street  the people who untangled it.
5	1396310400	I always enjoy J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts). Her imagination is amazing. We are blessed with being able to read the results.
5	1396310400	Loved it.  Another great read by a great author. I can't wait for the next book to be released soon
5	1396224000	Her books are futuristic, however with that said they are believable futuristic.  I really enjoy her books and can't wait for a new one to come out.
5	1396224000	I enjoy reading JD Robb's &#34;in Death&#34; series with Eve Dallas and all of her cast of characters. It's futuristic but in a believable way, without needing a dictionary for made up words!
5	1396137600	Once again a 5 star delivery. J.D. Robb writes wonderful, full bodied crime stories. Always giltz, glamour and sensuality mix with complex characters. Although these characters run through many books you can pick any title and start reading. Definitely not fluff.
5	1395705600	I have become a big fan of all the Eve Dallas series and I am reading them all in order.
4	1395619200	If you know anything about the 'in death' series, you know there's a lot of them. This is one of the better and while they are decent stories standing on their own, starting w/the first is my recommendation to get the history of the main characters. Though you may get bored after about the 10th or 15th...because they all are about the tough female cop, loved by everyone that knows her, especially the perfect, insanely rich man. Setting is about 50 yrs in the future.I use to read this series; but, I just stopped and found other authors to follow for a couple of years. Just recently picked series back up and did notice Eve has softened a bit...which is good news because her 'tough-as-nails' personality became obnoxious and repetitive.
5	1395446400	These books aren't great literature but guarantee to keep you entertained and reading. I have hooked on this series of books since reading the first oh so many years ago... If you like the mixture if science fiction, police procedural and romance, you will get hooked too. I strongly recommend that you read it as a series because there are &#34;hooks&#34; in each book that are referred to in the following book. It isn't absolutely else entail that you read them serially but they will be more enjoyable if you do.
5	1395360000	I did not realize I was five books behind in the JD Robb series, so I had to order the last five since New York.  Am having a wonderful time catching up on Eve, Roark, and Peabody, along with others.  The movie rendition in the book with the actual murder is a lot of fun and has carried through the next three books.  At one point a move was going to be done about Eve Dallas--never heard anything else about it--will certainly be first in line to see it when and if it ever happens!  Happy reading--don't miss out on the new installments!
5	1395360000	Newest in the IN DEATH SERIES.  NORA ROBERTS is J.D. ROBB.  SHE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  A GHOD READ AND A GOOD PRICE.  CAN BUY IN ADVANCE AND IT ISSENT WHEN AVAILABLE.
1	1395273600	I have read all of the "In Death" Series, and have noticed an inconsistency in both the writing and editing of the series.  This will, unfortunately, be the last book in this series that I will purchase.  Instead of evolving the characters have devolved.  I believe the author have lost interest in this series and if not she have definitely caused her readers to lose interest.  This was a complete waste of my money.
5	1395273600	This book is excellent and well written. I would recommend it it other readers who enjoy reading books by JDRibb
5	1395187200	JD Robb is always a good read.I like to read this series in order. Helps with the underlying story of the characters, but each book stands alone. Series is about a murder cop in the future and her life and the murders she solves.
5	1395187200	Enjoyed the entire &#34;In Death&#34; series. Every character jumps off the page; She-body, Trueheart, Mira, Feeney, especially Eve and her Irishman Roark
1	1395100800	I bought this book, figuring that I could count on so many readers and good reviews.  It was horrible.  The whole thing was totally unbelievable, the &#34;heroine&#34; too good to be true - beautiful, the subject of a movie, hyped by media, and married to - what else - a handsome, multi-millionare who loves her and has plenty of time to solve her crime and literally catch the bad guy. This is the most boring book I've ever bought.
5	1394928000	Very few authors can write a series this long and still make it interesting.  Ms, Robb can and did.  This book is an exciting read, never boring, and takes well loved characters through a good mystery.  Well done
5	1394841600	I have enjoyed these mystery series always pulls me in starting on page 1 all the way through to the last page.
4	1394755200	Still a good yarn, but I skip over the &#34;heated&#34; bits. How often can we read the same drivel about how gorgeous Roarke is! I love the plots, and she is an excellent writer, but I could do without the play-by-play in the bedroom!
5	1394582400	I'm reading this book now can't put it down if you ever want to read good books get J D Robb series but please start with the first one so they will make since to you hope you enjoy them
3	1393977600	It wasn't terrible, but there was too much jargon and not enough action. Page after page of detailed explanations of the financial stuff had me skimming past several pages at a time. The author could have cut at least 50 pages of filler out of the book. There were no surprises and ending was anticlimactic.
5	1393977600	Will continue to read this series, one of the best detective books out there to read. Should have many more.
5	1393804800	I really enjoy all of the JD Robb series & I have a hard time waiting for the next one to come out.  Nora Roberts is so incredible in her writing & but I super enjoy her JD Robb series the best!
5	1393804800	I love this series. It's different and inventive and a little sci-fi. I would recommend this book. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
5	1393718400	I love this series, great books, love the characters. I have all of her books. Can't wait for the next one
5	1393632000	Fast paced with good characters and plot twists. Everythingkept moving and kept me glued to my Kindle.  A satisfying read for a stay-inside day.
2	1393632000	I've been a huge fan of Robb's In Death Series and never thought I'd ever be giving any book in the series 2 stars.  But I've found the last few books in this series, including this one, increasingly disappointing.  Eve has definitely lost the fiery spirit that she's always displayed and has fallen into an attitude of immature, sullen pouting.  Roarke no longer exhibits his characteristic strength and self-confidence but has become annoyingly docile and almost subservient to Eve.  Eve and Roarke's stories and relationship (which has lost its spark, and I'm not talking about the sex) are central to the series, but a large part of the interest in the In Death books for me has also been the growth of the many secondary characters who have unfortunately all but disappeared in recent books.  I'm sorry to say that I'm undecided as to whether I'll continue spending time and money to read this series.  I assume that, with the number of books generated by J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts each year, she's got a stable of writers cranking them out for her.  So, J.D. Robb needs to either take a page from Eve's book and kick some formulaic writer's "rear end" or just reveal the candy thief and end this series -- not with a bland, uninteresting whimper, but the way it deserves!
4	1393027200	I am a die hard fan of Eve Dallas and I enjoyed this book. J D Robb seems to be filling out some of the minor characters andshowing the growth of the characters and the interrelationships of all the players especially Eve and Peacock. If you are just starting the series go to the beginning book; then you will be able to see the maturity of the main characters evolve. If not it is a well written mystery!
5	1393027200	I have read every book in the series and I continue to enjoy everyone.  The characters are so developed and the interactions are getting funnier and funnier.  I also love the futuristic twist.
1	1392768000	one of the ones I really didn't like at all!!! boring, and I have all of her books. Hope thenext one is better.
5	1392681600	Love this series! Always gets better and better! Can't wait for the new one, own every single one so far!
5	1392681600	I have read everyone of her books and keep reading every new on as soon as they come out. Love Eve Dallas !
5	1392595200	As with the entire series I am enjoying reading this book. Eve, Roake and Peabody will always get their man!
5	1392336000	All of the Death series books are very good. I have read them all in the order they have been written and found them all to be well written and easy to follow. I also hope that in the future we get all the advances that J.D. Robb writes about in the book. I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.
5	1392076800	J.D Robb comes thru again I love the writing style and description of New York in the 2060's wonder if it will be some what like that
5	1391904000	J.D. Robb in death series are always sure to entertain.  Characters are fun and it is always interesting to see what they are doing in each new case.
2	1391817600	I've read the whole series; this one was a distinct letdown. Too much accounting, motive for murders weak, weak conclusion.
5	1391731200	I am a Dallas fan and J. D. Robb is excellent at bringing life to her and Roark.  Very exciting stories.
3	1391558400	I love this series, but the finale handful of books do feel ghost-written. I don't like conspiracy theories on this stuff, but there's just something &#34;off&#34; with the prose. The mysteries themselves are fine. It's the prose and character interactions that feel fraudulent. I hope the next book fixes that error.
5	1391558400	I have read the whole series. I don't tire from her stories. The only question will be if and when they get pregnant, what calamity will be created then.
5	1391472000	I love all the in death series. I thoroughly enjoy the characters evolving and growing. The mystery is engaging. I like trying to figure out who did it. These are easy read books which after a long day at the office is just what I need.
5	1391385600	JD Robb never disappoints. Even though this series is based in supposed 2059 now into 2060, they are great!! Makes the reader feel as if they are there. I can actually see what the possible future may be like. We never know what the detectives in these books will encounter.
5	1391385600	This book was maybe not quite as bloody as some of Robb's other &#34;Death&#34; series, but it is much more entailed.  The involvement of the &#34;money&#34; world was fun and different.  You get to see how much Eve has grown with letting &#34;friends&#34; come in closer.  Her relationships are much more developed, - especially with Roake -  in that we feel they have all aged with us.  Things have grown in the &#34;bullpen&#34;.My only concern is that I had to stop reading Calculated and go back and read &#34;Celebrity&#34; before going on with Calculated.  I am glad I did, I think maybe these were written as one book and later separated.  Not to worry, they both were wonderful.
5	1391212800	I have read every one of the Eve Dallas series, and I cannot wait until the next one comes out each time.  I pre order as I know without question it is going to be an excellent read.  This one was just as much fun as all the others.
5	1391040000	As usual, Eve Dallas kept me engrossed and entertained.  The In Death series continues to be my favorite read. I'm waiting for the movie!
5	1391040000	Absolutely love her series!  Have the whole set and can't wait until the next one comes out.  Hope the series never ends!
5	1391040000	I own 30 books in this series.  I love them and read them often enough that I just purchased 10 of them for my kindle that I already own in paperback.  I recommend them to anyone interested in cop stories or wonderful characters.  I love following their careers and lives along with the current story.
5	1390953600	This series is a favorite and am always anxious to see what murder Eve Dallas has to solve next.  Enjoy the relationships with her family and friends.
5	1390953600	Reading about Eve Dallas and Roarke never gets old.  Each story is it's own with just enough catch up background narration to remind of the important things.  I look forward to every new book and cannot imagine them every coming to an end!
5	1390867200	I am addicted to J. D. Robb's In Death series.  Cannot wait for the next one to come out.  Love how the relationships keep building.  Love them!
5	1390867200	Nora has done it again, another great mystery with plenty of suspense. Always enjoy her books her stories in these books are fantastic.
5	1390867200	J. D. Robb tells the best detective story with Lt Eve Dallas.  I have read more of her books and I looking for more.
5	1390521600	I love the Dallas stories, always a good murder mystery with humor, and a little sex. Waiting for the next book!
4	1390521600	It surprising to me that she keeps writing these, but not that surprising that I keep reading.  This series might be her best work.
4	1390435200	Each&#34; Eve&#34; book is similar yet different.They are easy reading when one needs to unwind and clear the mind. Always thrilling!
5	1390262400	I love Robb's &#34;In Death&#34; series.  These are some of the only ones I buy as hard copy, Kindle and audio.
5	1390262400	This book was written by one of my favorite authors. It was in good condition when it arrived with no wear and tear. I will definitely purchase more used paperbacks on Amazon. They are much more affordable for me!
5	1390262400	i love this author jd robb and her books i know she is nora roberts but i love her as jd robb the most she cant write them fast enough for me i've read everything shes wrote and am waiting for her new one coming in february
5	1390176000	J.D. Robb has done it again!  Always enjoy her work and this is no exception.  I enjoy the continuity of the characters in the series.  Look forward to the next one!
5	1390089600	Calculated in Deathby J. D. RobbEve Dallas must solve another murder case with the help of her team and husband, Roarke. This time someone is killing to hide their embezzlement and shady money matters. There&#8217;s fast paced murder and exciting twists that will keep readers engaged. Eve&#8217;s ability to &#8220;stand for the dead&#8221; and provide justice for them, all while dealing with her own baggage, makes this series a must read.Calculated in Death is one of the latest in a long line of Eve Dallas books and stories. Yep, I&#8217;m a fan and have read them all. While it isn&#8217;t necessary to read all the books in order to appreciate Calculated in Death, it certainly enhances the reader&#8217;s understanding of the characters and backstory.J.D. Robb&#8217;s books are one of my &#8220;one click&#8221; purchases and are keepers! If you enjoy gritty police drama set against a sizzling romance which takes place in the future, you will love the Eve Dallas series.
5	1390089600	This one kept me interested from the first page. I love the way the story developed. Definitely a good read.
5	1389916800	I'm not sure who is my real hero - J. D. Robb or Eve Dallas. I have all the books in the &#34;In Death&#34; series.
5	1389744000	I have read in death since book one, and can't stop now! I enjoy every book more than the last. I love the developing characters and hope they keep rolling off the press!!!
4	1389657600	When an auditor is murdered, Eve Dallas and Peabody try to findout why she was killed.  Was she threatened?  Did someonewanted to have their books fixed and she didn't want to?  Andwhy did they take files?  Was somebody trying to hide something?Worth a read.
5	1389657600	I received the book on time. I read all her books in order so I have not started on this one yet. All her books are good and I recommend it to whoever is following her series.
5	1389571200	J.D. Robb is one of my favourite authours, and Eve Dallas a favourite character.  I have read and enjoyed this entire series.
5	1389484800	We always think we have every step set out , no way for any thing to go wrong, and will never be caught, because we are so clever, but so stupid . Because there is always some one who is cleverer than us.
3	1389398400	I have read all of the Eve Dallas books, and found this one to be slower than others of the series.
3	1389139200	This title has all the elements I've come to expect from the series.  Having read all of the preceding books, I was pleased that backstory was kept at a minimum.  There were plenty to examples to keep the reader in  the 2060 era.The plot was tightly woven.  Dallas, with the help of Roarke's skills, followed the money, identified the villain, and then laid out a set up at the end.  The climax wasn't a surprise, but was still satisfying.  I recommend it for series readers.
5	1388880000	I absolutely love this series. This book does not disappoint. If you are looking at reviews of this book, you probably haven't read the rest. Take my advice and start from the beginning. The whole series is amazing.
5	1388880000	If you haven't read the series.. start at the beginning but read them all. You get personal with the characters - she's got them so fleshed out that I can see them in my head when I'm reading. Kindle has all of the books available - they aren't all available in hardback or soft copy. I love this series!
5	1388793600	Awesome book-couldn't put it down!  J.D. Robb is Nora Roberts at her best!  Be sure to read all the &#34;In Death&#34; series!
3	1388793600	I have read all of the In Death books. And this one is boring. Not a page turner. Nevertheless, I did finish it. Worth reading if you are a fan of JD Robb and do not want to miss the events of Eve Dallas's life.
5	1388793600	I Love J D Robb writing this storyline.. Eve Dallas & Roarke Rock!! I wish Some of these books were made into movies... Highly suspenseful. Very exciting!
5	1388448000	I have read most all or her books and I will read the rest. I love Lt. Eve Dallas, Roarke , and all the officers. They work so good together.
5	1388275200	Another wonderful installment in the Death series.  Eve, Roarke, Peabody and the rest of the gang keep everyone guessing as to who dun it?
4	1388188800	It's a good read.  As always too short but I was glad to see she didn't go as in depth about her childhood this time.
5	1388188800	i love j.d. robb and now i have almost all her books on cd's.  love listening to them in the car on long trips
4	1388188800	I found this book to be not quite as exciting story wise as past books but very worth a read for Robb fans.
5	1388016000	This is another great book in the Eve Dallas series - I love these books - they are so enjoyable and the cast of characters are very interesting
4	1387756800	I love the series. She has developed the characters very well. She always comes up with clever storylines.  Lt. Eve Dallas never let's us down.
5	1387670400	Another book by JD Robb that I've thoroughly enjoyed.  I've never been disappointed in any of her stories and wasn't this time either.
5	1387497600	I'm a fan. On to the next one!! Can't wait to get started. I love reading and was so sure it was going another way when she stuck the flying baby in there!! Brava.
4	1387411200	I have read many of J. D. Robb's &#34;In Death&#34; books.  I like reading about the future and enjoy the people in the books.
4	1386979200	As always it's a good read.  It's an easy read but the plots do get a little repetitious, would like if they had more of the "off planet" story line.
5	1386460800	JD Robb continues her &#34;In Death&#34; saga with yet another winner of a book. Even this far into the series, she still manages to keep the story fresh and not repeat herself.
5	1386460800	I love all the J.D. Robb books. This one is no different. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
4	1386460800	I had read some of the reviews of this book on line and they weren't very favorable.  However, as I am a fan of the &#34;group&#34; I still had tobuy it.  I do not  agree with the reviews at all.  After all the negative reviews, I found it quite good in keeping with the other Dallascharacters.
1	1386115200	They said the book was Used_Like New. Its the worst book I have even gotten. It looks like it got wet and all the edgesare torn and worn. I will never buy from these people again. I just got it today.
5	1385856000	Eve, Peabody , Roarke, & the rest of the the In Death characters are so easy to believe in. Love this series!!
5	1385856000	I have always loved the series, I'm so glad she still has the magic. I will be so devastated if she ever drops the ball.
5	1385769600	THE ROBB SERIES OF WEMONS MISTERY SERIES HAS HAD ME FROM BOOK 1. ALL THE LADYS HAVE BEEN WELL DEVELOPED.
5	1385683200	Another awesome installment in the In Death series. Love these characters. The only way I'd like it better is if there was more Man is lol
5	1385596800	Awesome of course!!!! You get no less from J. D. Robb. Have read  them all so far.Great series. Bravo!
4	1385424000	I like her good cop characters and Roarke and Eve's attitudes and lifestyles in this futuristic world of high tech.
5	1385164800	Love J. R. Robb and the &#34;In Death&#34; series.  Always keeps me interested and wanting to rush to the end
3	1384646400	An off-day for Robb and for Eve. Neither hits their customary stride in this work. I read this one because I have read all of the Eve Dallas books and there is usually some development in the Roark/ Eve dynamic that makes the read worthwhile. Didn't find that here. He is still the perfect man, not that that is a bad thing, but he understands her better than she understands herself and that is getting a little tiresome. Surely she knows that she functions more effectively with a little rest, a little relief from her aches and pains, a little food in her body. Starting to feel a bit like a parent/child dynamic; Eve is clearly in need of a soother and a super-hot shower.
5	1384646400	Another excellent book by this author. I love her storylines. Very easy to read and fall in love with the characters in the story.
3	1384646400	Good but not her best! Same sort of storyline read several other times. Bad guy, big op, etc.. Worth the read if you are like me and out of books. :)
4	1384214400	This is not the usual imaginative crime for an Eve investigation, but still a good read. I missed the supporting characters in this book too
4	1384041600	The Book got here today. So I came very fast. But I was a bit surprised that there was only one CD. Its a 12 hr book so there would normally be 10-15Disc. Then I started looking at the package and I guess I ordered it in MP3-CD. The back of the case says I need a different CD player. I tried for a few hours to copy it to regular CD's, but all I could get to copy was the 1st CD. The case has a number or web page I can use for help. So I am going to check that out tomorrow.
5	1383523200	I love Dallas, she is simply amazing. Can not stop reading the in death series and waiting for the next
4	1383436800	If you're looking for not too deep and just entertainment, the Eve Dallas books are good. I've enjoyed most of them.
5	1383350400	Fabulous as always.  JD Robb's In Death series never fails to deliver a fast paced story that thrills and enough romance to keep you reading. I love how the characters become your friends as well as Eve's.
4	1383264000	J.D. Robb's &#34;In Death&#34; series of books are hard to put down once I get started.  Each one gets a little more edgy
5	1383264000	Another favorite author I cannot get enough of.  I have had my eye on this book but too impatient to wait for paperback.
5	1383091200	Have all the In Death books either in hard, paper or kindle.  Always a joy when the next installment comes out.
4	1383091200	This book is true to form for this author.  It's fast paced, filled with action, but made humane with familiar characters.
4	1382918400	Just never get tired of Dallas and Roarke, et al. Eagerly awaiting the next one in the series. That's really all I have to say at this time.
4	1382918400	I have always enjoyed JD Robb. Stories all have the background of a beautiful love story mixed with murder & sin. Still a fresh story with each book.
1	1382832000	Book arrived quickly but was not the edition advertised--left me holding the bag as this was a replacement for a destroyed book. I couldn't wait the extra time it would have taken to return it.
3	1382745600	I have all the books I had to make myself read it.  I would prefer a great book once a year than just something thrown together.  And I am a huge fan!
4	1382659200	This was up to the usual good standards of a J D Robb book. I have enjoyed collecting the entire Eve Dallas series.
4	1382572800	J.D. Robb creates a new mystifying /criminal situation whilst cleverly introducing  snippets of background history of the ongoing characters. The story line is complete within itself but It would be very enticing for first time readers of the Eve Dallas/Roarke series to  read previous issues to discover the character's past in more detail. Thoroughly enjoy the raw committed love that shines through.Thankless in Death is about to be downloaded!
5	1382486400	Don't you just want to be in the inner circle!!!  You feel sorry for those that aren't. This didn't quite hold as much excitement, but still a must read.  You need to be there and learn what is going on with your favorite LT and Roarke.
5	1382313600	Love all of the Eve Dallas books. This one did not disappoint. The baby scene was awesome. The Roarke factor was steamy as usual. Both futuristic and realistic. Well done.
5	1382313600	love all the books written by Robb. a must read series. I encourage you to read this book. I enjoyed it.
5	1382227200	This book was a great book to read Actually I read it in one sitting, She is an excellent writer and knows how to keep the suspense going.
5	1382054400	I love all of the &#34;...in Death&#34; books.  This one, once again, kept me up late at night because I could not stop reading!!
5	1381795200	Love the characters in this series.  JD Robb, aka Nora Roberts knows how to make you relate to her characters.  You get to know and love them.
4	1381708800	J D Rob 's Death series always delivers interesting characters, good old fashion who summit in a slick futuristic setting.
5	1381536000	I have everyone book in the series and love everyone of them. I find myself getting so wrapped u p in the characters I tend to ignore the real world.
5	1381449600	I love the &#34;In Death&#34; series. The characters are well-rounded and draw one into the plots which are always just convoluted enough to keep one's interest. As well, the dialogue is often amusing and sure to catch one's attention. Any of these are a great read!!
5	1381449600	Never disappoints. If you are not up to date in this series I highly recommend you start from the beginning. The stories and characters are exciting, intelligent, and even sometimes sexy. I'm so happy a friend introduced me to the series years ago!
5	1381276800	One of the good ones..but then most of the books by J.D. Robb are good.  I always look forward to the next ones.
4	1381190400	Another good J.D. Robb novel. Not her absolute best, but enjoyable none the less. Would have liked more interaction between characters but if you like crime novels, she is still the best.
1	1381190400	This book was so boring I could not finish it.  I will not buy another J.D. book, I did not care about the victim or suspects.No excitement at all!
4	1381190400	In true J.D. Robb style, this book shares another installment in the life of Eve Dallas. This plot was better than most.  The character development was good and added to the storyline.
5	1381190400	I really liked this book, I could hardly put it down! You can never go wrong with JD ROBB! I know you will love it.
2	1381104000	I was disappointed in this book in the series...it just did not have a focused interesting story...I slogged through just because I'd purchased it but will think twice before buying another in this series.
4	1381104000	As the series goes on and on, Roarke is a bit over-involved for a civilian.  Each book finds hi doing more and more police-type work.  Induct him already
5	1381104000	Well written, suspenseful, a great addition to the series. I , love the tension between Roarke and Eve, work and home.
5	1381017600	J.D. Robb has out dun herself yet again. Intertwining past with present and mixing in just the right amount of amusement.
5	1381017600	I have enjoyed every one of J.D. Robb's books. I was hooked after reading one.It is difficult to put the book down once you start reading.Great suspense!Great romance too!!.
5	1380931200	Nora Roberts hits a home run again with Dallas and the gang. Great read. Her books always have you guessing.
5	1380844800	Have read all the In Death books & look forward to the next one!  J. D. Robb never fails to deliver!!  Eve, Rourke & crew are awesome!
5	1380844800	Yes, I gave this book five stars.  It has everything you expect.  An excellent heroine in the form of Eve Dallas, a great story with lots of action and a little romance thrown in.  J.D. Robb is the best.
5	1380758400	as is always, Calculated in Death was a good read. J.D. Robb books are books I always look forward to. It helps me escape and takes me on an adventure.
5	1380672000	Absolutely loved it! You couldn't put it down.  As usual, it was mailed quickly and very well packaged.  As described
5	1380672000	J.D. Robb is still going strong. I can't believe the things I don't get done at home because I have to finish the book.
5	1380672000	My very upmost favorite author.  Never disappointed in any of her novels.Characters are real and story line in full of details, really draws you in.  A must have for any Nora fan.  An enjoyable reread.  Thanks Ms. Roberts for another wonderful visit with Eve Dallas.
5	1380585600	Love Love Love this series!! I have almost read them all! Can't get enough of this series! You will love it!
3	1380499200	I judge a book by whether l can put it down for another time while I'm not finish reading it. I set this book down twice. It has a good flow of writing so I wasn't stumbling over poor grammatical errors. If I read from beginning to end in one sitting, then the book usually rates five stars unless it is short stories.It is an ok story to read but the suspect turned out to be too easy, too early in the story. I expected a twist to another deceiver, not the obvious criminal. Oh well, this book works well for people who like to sensor books. It should pass the tests.
5	1380240000	Love this series! Can hardly wait for the next one!  Delivered to my kindle with no problems. Thanks to Amazon & J.D./Nora
4	1380240000	I should have known something would happen that would interfere with the movie premiere. Silly me for thinking that Eve and the gang could have a night out on the town enjoying the excitement and hype of the premiere dressed in their glitterati with the flashbulbs blasting away. Wait a minute, what was I thinking? It's Eve so OF COURSE, it would happen and I really think Eve prefers it that way. With Calculated In Death, Eve and her team are investigating the death of an accountant who also happens to be the sister-in-law of a judge. At first glance, it appears the murder is due to a random mugging, but Eve quickly picks up on clues left at the crime scene that lead her to believe the murder was actually a professional hit. Once again, Eve quickly pieces together clues that lead her and Peabody to the killer.Not enough Roark or Summerset in this story, unfortunately, but one of my favorite parts of the book involves a scene with Eve and Summerset after she comes home pretty banged up after a foot pursuit with the killer gets ugly. Summerset actually convinces Eve to take a blocker and she actually listens to him! I was so shocked that there wasn't more of a fight. Is Eve getting soft where Summerset is concerned? Is she starting to care about him? Nah, probably not, but as much as I enjoy their snarky poke and jab sessions, I love love love the scenes where they actually have a civil conversation and where there's a hint of some compassion, empathy or other human emotion. Just a hint, however. Anything more wouldn't be believable. Then again, anything is possible. They certainly have come a long way since the early books, where their animosity was mutual and vibrated off the pages with a such a resounding energy, that it was impossible to misinterpret the depth of their dislike of one another as anything else.I also enjoyed that Eve didn't seem to be as haunted by the demons of her past as she usually is. I won't go so far as to say she has finally turned a corner, but I think she has a much better handle on it than she realizes.Overall, a very good and entertaining installment that delivers the usual blend of mystery, thriller, romance and humor. I am looking forward to the next offering as Roark's family from Ireland is coming for a visit and I so enjoy seeing Eve try to navigate her way around what having a family means.
2	1380153600	I keep waiting for the old spark to come back to this series; however, it hasn't happened with Calculated in Death. It's the same old, same old only this time the bad guys are accountants.  Again, Eve is not the strong, self assured woman we met when the series began.  She talks a good game but now heavily depends on her perfect, rich husband to do her job. He identifies the killer, upon Eve asking him "which one would you give the hardest look?"  This is something the old Eve would never have done.  She is supposed to be the leader in the homicide department, not some wimp asking her husband "who done it."  Roarke not only manages every aspect of his own business empire, but now he is a champ at his wife's job. Maybe Eve should be taking dictation for him.  I keep saying I am so done with this series and so far, I have continued to keep reading, hoping against all hope that the old Lt. Eve Dallas surfaces and once again, stands by her own convictions and makes her own decisions and conclusions. The supporting players are getting less and less story time as well. Peabody is an interesting and solid character and now she has become comic relief to Eve.  Maybe Ms. Robb should rename the series, The Roarke Show.
5	1380067200	She is one of my favorites.  Storyline and content is not for everyone.  Most enjoyable with strong characters for those who like police based stories.
4	1379980800	J. D. ROBB's, Calculated in Death, keeps you reading on and on. This book is one of the few that you don't want to put down. Along with her husband, Roarke, and Detective Peabody, Lt. Eve Dallas investigate the murder of a young book keeper. Her body found in the lobby of an office building that has been renovated. Her neck broken. This murder leads to two more brutal killings. Someone has broken into the computer files of WIN, Corporation and has used it for their own profit. Who is this person or persons? The killer must be someone of above average strength to break the neck of Marta Dickenson. This well written book will keep your interest. Rated for mature readers. Language and sexual content. DP
5	1379980800	Have read every book in the series. Love the progression of the characters......and the story-lines never disappoint! Can't wait for the next one!
5	1379980800	Kept my interest all the way.  Includes both the mystery at the beginning and also some romantic aspects.  Many details given about the crime scenarios so that the reader is also trying to solve it early on.
4	1379894400	Eve and Peabody again fight the bad guys in future NYC . And Roarke continues to love finance, electronics and most of all his cop, Dallas . Fast plot, hot love, lots of fun.
5	1379894400	I love any book by Nora Roberts aka JDRobb. The in death series have evolved the relationships well. Am hoping Peabody has a baby next ;)
4	1379894400	JD Robb as her per usual. Good read. All her stuff is great. Prefer her in this penship vs. the other.
5	1379894400	I was &#34;hooked&#34; on the first IN DEATH book and have them all. Great to see how the clues and suspense continues to the final culprit!capture or death. I recommend  J. D. Robb to all mystery lovers. They are never boring and it is fantastic to see how all the clues come together.
5	1379721600	Another great story of our awesome Roarke/Dallas duo. Glad all character paid a visit so keep up with them too. Keep them coming please! Thank you Nora.
5	1379721600	I really enjoyed this book.  I've read all of them and sometimes Eve's back story of gets retold over and over but this one did not.  It was fresh and very interesting.
5	1379548800	I read all of the Death books and loved all of them.  The love story between Dallas And Rourke is wonderful.
5	1379548800	Anyone who enjoys murder and/or mysteries will enjoy this well thought out murder mystery by one, if not THE best storytellers of our lifetimes. Thanks again for another wonderful story!
5	1379548800	Was awesome I couldn't figure it out normally i can. was awesome. I love the dynamics between eve and roarke now since New York to Dallas Im glad they back to normal.
3	1379548800	There are well over 1,000 reviews of this book already posted so I won't reiterate the plot etc. I had this on reserve at the library after being a bit disappointed with the previous book and finally got around to reading it.My biggest issue with this book had to do with the characters. Part of the charm of the series is the interaction of the various characters and I thought that was lacking in this book. There was a lot of Peabody-Eve interaction as they worked together to catch an out of control killer, but very little of the other characters. I did appreciate that Robb (Roberts) didn't rehash Eve's horrible childhood again-if you read the series you are well aware of what happened with Eve (especially after reading one of the last few books), but rehashing it over and over gets old.  I would like to have seen more of Sommerset in this book as he is one of my favorite characters, but his role was pretty much non-existent. Roarke and Eve have one of the great fictional love affairs, but sometimes Eve grates on me with her self-absorbtion. She did seem to think about Roarke a bit more - his feelings and thoughts than some of the books, but sometimes I wonder exactly why he loves her!I will read this series to its bitter end, but am hoping the next book improves in terms of the characters that we have followed for some 35 plus books being more visible.  I may be in the minority, but at times Eve really gets on my nerves with her self-absorbtion. By now Eve should be more than her job and should be able to see she has more value than just her job.  I get the feeling if she ever was fired or couldn't be a police detective that her whole being would crumble into nothing.
5	1379376000	As always Eve and Rourke are a delight to visit. Always a great read, and a suspense filled one. Seeing the ever expanding emotions and continued evolution of Eve's world is great. And Rourke's just a delight from tip to toe as always.
5	1379289600	JD Robb never lets you down!  It was a great book comparable to others in the In Death series. Great!
4	1379116800	Lieutenant Eve Dallas is called out to where Marta Dickenson's body was found, dead of a broken neck.  The set-up appeared to indicate a mugging, but the first responding officer was dubious.  It quickly becomes a high profile case as Marta is the sister-in-law of a sitting Judge.  As Dallas and Peabody investigate further, they discover a cast of suspects that all are a little shady.  It takes the help of Roarke to explain the business aspects as well as digging deeper to find out who crossed the line into murder.  Meanwhile Eve tries to forget that she must attend the premiere of the film based on Nadine's book about a former high profile case.  Number 36 in the Eve Dallas series.I think this may be the first book in a while where I wasn't certain of the killer or, rather, the man behind the killings.  As usual, my favorite passages are the updates on the various characters who populate Eve's world.  The killer in this one is menacing, yet isn't seen until the very end of the book.  Roberts is a fantastic writer who knows her characters, knows her audience as well.  4.5 out of 5.
5	1379116800	I have read all of the Eve Dallas books and always like following how she builds her case . The description of brutality of people is so good that you feel you are able to visually see it in your mind .Eve's continued uncomfortable reaction to Mavis & Leonardo's baby is humorous to read about.  Excellent read.
5	1379116800	J.D. Robb is one of my favorite authors.  I usually read most book on my kindle but make an exception when it comes to her books and buy each of her new ones to add to my collection.  So far I own every one of them!  If she ever stops writing, I will start over with her first one and read them all again.  If you have never read J.D. Robb but enjoy murder mystery, suspense, action and a touch of romance, I strongly encourage you to check her books out.  Once you do though, you may be hooked!
5	1379116800	I collect all JD Robb`s books, and this is one of my favorite books.Eve and Roarke make progress in the books, for example, Eve is getting treatment without much defense, not like in the first few books they have to argue about the medication a lot,and I think that`s a good sign because that means she actually consider Roarke`s feeling and make some concession.And they are looking forward to Thanksgiving that they are inviting Roarke`s family from Ireland to their mansion. It would be very sweet story I hope I will read that part in the next book.Without questioning, Roarke is as usual very useful in this book because the murderers is in the money world, and Roarke has the talent in numbers, and he really enjoys poking other company`s accounts, so his thinkings in the book is very interesting.He quite enjoying helping his wife`s case which is very sweet and romantic.Talking about the case, Eve`s job is very risky, she often got hurt during on duty and this book is not exception. In this book, she injured by catching a flying baby which the bad guy throw to make escape!She went down hard and hurt her tits and bottom. She don`t want Roarke worry too much, so she make many funny conversations about the progress, and that`s the highlight of this book.By the way, I like the map in the bottom, that is very hilarious image in my head.The dream about catching flying babies is also make me laugh!All in all, this is a easy book compare with delusion in death witch contain a lot of death.......so I am quite comfortable to read this book, and really enjoy it!!!
2	1379030400	This ain't Eve. Roarke feels off too. Everything's a tad off. A tad nicer, a tad calmer, a tad, well boring. I don't know that it's ghost written or if Ms Roberts is more worried about Boonesboro. I am sooo glad I waited for the reduced PB/Kindle price.
5	1378944000	It took me a while to get into the book as this is the first one of J.D. Robb I've read...but once into it, I found it difficult to put it done to get anything done around the house.....can't wait for Thankless in Death!!!!!!
1	1378944000	I've not read other books by her, and don't plan to.  IF they are anything like this one, then becoming a best seller has only to do with devising a low bar formula, and repeating it.Whole sections of her conversational interactions could likely be substituted in other....I can't call them books-----conversations.Her mind is bereft of narrative. She's not an author she's a hyper talker with heaven knows what goes on in her brain while she's writing down her conversations.Awful, just awful, and speaks to the low level of our masses who make these things top the charts.
4	1378944000	I love J.D. Robb and all of her characters in the &#34;In Death&#34; series.  Most of the time, when I start one, I can't put it down.  I'm enjoying this one, but it's not as riveting as most others have been.  Since it is taking me a while to get through it, the long list of suspects is getting confusing.  That being said, if you love Eve Dallas, Roarke, Peabody and the rest, it's worth the read.
5	1378857600	I read every installment of the In Death Series as soon as it comes out because I love the courageous Eve Dallas and her dashing, helpful husband.  The murders affected me very much because these murders were particularly selfish and wasteful.  As usual Eve &#34;stands for the dead&#34; brilliantly, and with the help of her talented husband, and her engaging team, unravels the mystery and selfish motives of the killer.  I would have liked more time with Eve and Roarke together, but this is a complicated mystery and that that took up most of the book.
5	1378857600	I have read every In Death book, and 98% of Nora's other books. I do believe this is the first review I've written for her, because there are so many that cover exactly what I would say anyway. However, I laughed so hard at one point, I had to put down my kindle, reread the scene again, read it to my son, all while laughing.Nora Roberts, if you by some fateful chance read this, you are a bloody genius! I loved, Loved, LOVED the scene with the mom and her son who had a cold. OMFG I rarely laugh that loud while reading, but you got me. Totally, completely got me. In fact, I would cook you dinner or bake a cake for you as well. Thank you so much for all the many, many hours of enjoyment, entertainment and inspiration to try. And for the Really Big Laugh. F-ing priceless. Mom's around the world hail to you, hahahahaha.
5	1378771200	Love all of the &#34;In Death&#34; series.  Hope JD Robb continues writing this series, never really liked sci-fi but I do love these.
5	1378771200	Calculated in Death was great book by jd robb as always, a great read cant wait for the next as soon as possible.
5	1378771200	If you've read the series, you know what the book is like. If you haven't read the series, it's about a New York detective named Eve Dallas who solves murders in the year 2060.The only thing I don't care for in these books is the amount of sex Eve has with her husband (Roarke) and all the steamy details. I just skip over those parts.
5	1378684800	I love how they love each other. Reminds me of my husband and me.....back ion the day. 38 years and 1 extraordinary child later and still goin strong. I agree would love to see them have a kid.
4	1378512000	If you like the In Death books by J. D Robb, you will like this one. Once again Eve comes through .  This book is good, I have read most of the In Death books. This book is not a favorite but was worth the money. Now I want to read the next one.
5	1378425600	The first book I read was the third liked it so much went back & started from the beginning. I have read every book. It is like following a family. Its so much fun to watch Eve deal with the loyal friends she has acquired. All these books are great reads start at the beginning watch as Eve & the people around her grow. Its gradual & does not jump around.
5	1378339200	LOVE the in death series. The last couple books were goods but really enjoyed this one. The development of the characters if great! Cant wait to read he next one!
5	1378252800	I am new to the J.D. Robb books, but have found them to be very good reading. Delivery was fast and book was in very good condition.
4	1378166400	Another good mystery from JD ROBB!  Always enjoy the mix of mystery, Sci-Fi, and personality that the author puts into the stories, and the character development of Eve Dallas.
5	1378166400	While this installment is not my favorite in this series, I would still recommend it to anyone.  But it's part of a series, so start with book one, Naked in Death, if you're going to start reading this Nora Roberts series.
3	1378166400	Ms Roberts has gone back to basic which is very good. I've not been enthusiastic over her books for sometime. I thought she had lost her mojo. I'm glad to see that Roarke & Eve are the stars again and there chemistry is sizzling once again I only gave this book 3 stars since some parts are long winded and tended to become a bit boring. I've been a fan of the "in death" series from its inception and I'm glad Ms Roberts is returning to her original format.
5	1378166400	Great book. exciting !!!!!  Well written concise writing . Lots of plot twists and a surprise ending. Really fun read !!!
2	1378080000	I have read and own EVERY book in the J.D. Robb "In Death" series.  I, too, felt that there wasn't enough character development.  I agree that Dallas appears to be getting coarser than more refined, considering Roarke's charming, diplomatic, constant influence. Not much was written about McNab, Peabody, Feeney, Summerset, Baxter, Trueheart.  I was reading the book while watching an episode of Homeland on T.V.  Next to Homeland, the book was boring.  Too many accounting references, not enough script describing 2060 futuristic scenes.  I, too, think the series needs a new twist, like Dallas getting promoted and pregnant (promoted first so she's not running the streets catching babies in the air while pregnant). This series still has lots of room for development,... have Trueheart fall in love with Nadine...cop versus news reporter as a subset.  This book was just not up to snuff and a disappointing experience.  I'd like to see another scenario with the banter between Summerset and Dallas, ending with Dallas illustrating to him that she really appreciates all the little things he does for her in some criminally dramatic way. In some books in the series, it is evident that Summerset has come to admire and respect Dallas, but aside from the kudos she gives Summerset in her thoughts for taking good care of Roarke, Dallas never expresses an appreciation for Summerset looking after her, too, despite the snarly banter. Was this really written by Nora?
5	1378080000	Fans of Eve Dallas will be glad to know she is still the same cranky cop we know and love.  Hollywood wants to celebrate her but as usual she can't be bothered by glitz...she has a killer to catch!  Another great read by the best author in the biz.
5	1378080000	Great characters.  Hard to put down.Can't wait for the next book to be released & to see where the story goes!
1	1377993600	I'm a BIG fan of the series and have read all the books in it-twice! That level of familiarity with J D Robb's writing style means that I'm able to speak with some confidence when I say that this book was most likely not written by her. The writing style/dialogue was completely off, and that matters a great deal when the characters are so well defined, well developed and most importantly, familiar. All in all, it was a jarring experience.I'm going to give her upcoming book a try but may have to say goodbye to the series if it's also like this one. And I say this with a great deal of sadness.
5	1377993600	I read a lot. I read a lot of watered down and mistakes ridden books. Then sometimes I hit a jackpot and read books or series like this. Apart from perfect spelling, diction and grammar, the plot is nothing to be sneezed at.As usual we have Lt Eve Dallas and her dish of a husband (Roarke) and the gang of NYPD bullpen where she is lord of the manor. The victim in this case was just an accountant doing her job, and she was killed to stop a greedy smarmy of a man from being exposed. She was a wife and mother of two and that family was deprived of their bedrock. Then we have a slew of suspects, and it is an art in pure form to read and watch as Eve sieve through them and got her target.We also must not forget the interaction between Eve and Roarke in their home. It is heartwarming to see skittish Eve start to become comfortable in her skin as Mrs Roarke. Oh my, the tender moments, the deep love between these two, and Roarke devilishly throwing in words like 'it is something to bear in mind with our own kids', and I thought Eve will blow a gasket! But she restrained herself.Excellent read from a classy author, no less. Looking forward to the next 'In Death..' book.
5	1377993600	this book, as all her books are, was a great read & kept u interested to the end !! Can't wait for the next one.
5	1377907200	The J.D. Robb in death series grabs your attention from the first page and keeps you guessing to the end.Just enough levity blended with mystery to make the perfect read for anyone that loves a good mystery without the gore so many writers use.
4	1377907200	I love to read mystery/cop thriller stories and this one doesn't disappoint!  I have read all of J.D. Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) "In Death" series and this one continues the story line that I enjoy.  I like to follow a character's life in a series.  It's kind of like a good TV show that you want to watch every week to see what happens next.Eve and Roarke are brilliant (and beautiful) together and make a great team.  It's also fun to experience a little bit of the future in 2060.  I want a flying car and a hologram room so I can go to beach any time I feel like it!I'm glad that Nora is a very prolific author because I am looking forward to the next installment of Eve and Roarke!
5	1377907200	JD Robb is one of my favorites - as is Nora Roberts - and I always get her new books as soon as they are published. I don't think she has ever written a bad, boring book.
5	1377907200	You just can't go wrong with any of these. They are always exciting to read. The characters are so well defined.
4	1377907200	good and interesting flows with the series.  It is in keeping with the series she is writing.  I enjoyed the details.  It wants you to read the next book.
2	1377907200	I'm sorry I read this; half way through I started scanning.  Very little happens but there are copious, long streams of the hero's thoughts, copious notes on research into possible suspects and an endless stream of visits to the suspects.  Often it did not seem realistic and although it seems to be set well into the future, it feels like the present despite occasional strange (futuristic?) terms leaping off the page or a car levitating over another.  I did not much care what happened to any of the characters -- they did not get under my skin.
5	1377907200	Whether it is as J.D. Robb or Nora Roberts, I am always extremely please with the plot, characters, story line and settings.  The slightly into the future of the Lt. Dallas books, the excellent character development over the series and the true to the &#34;heart&#34; of the story line makes each outing great fun.
5	1377907200	I just love the In Death series!  I am never disappointed!  I have read them all and loved every single one!
5	1377820800	Good book written in great style. All characters so real to their development. Can not wait till the next which is coming out soon!
5	1377734400	As always, J.D. Robb has done a great job in continuing the series. I like the way Eve and Roarke keep expanding their relationship with each other and their friends.
3	1377648000	I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the essense of the In Death series was missing in this one.  Did RobbRoberts really write it? Interesting enough read, but not what I have come to expect from this series.Not enough of the supporting characters, pretty blah type of crime, lack of the witty banter between Eve and Peabody, Mavis barely shows up, etc.  It almost seemed that it was time for another In Death novel and this one was thrown together to meet that need.  Hope this is not the start of a trend, as I love these books usually.I can recommend it to read as a mystery, but not necessarily as an In Death mystery.Helen Hubbard
5	1377561600	I enjoy these 'Death' books and wonder how Nora Roberts can think up such detailed story lines... look forward to each and every and not disappointed yet.
5	1377475200	I can't wait for her next book to come out....Looking forward to the next one...Keeps you on the edge recommend to all
5	1377475200	Scottoline continues her Series with another Thriller. She never lets her Readers down.If you've not read her 'Death' Series, start at the beginning and read them all.
5	1377475200	Great book. Another eve Dallas hit.As usual her writing puts me in the book, like a fly on wall watching everything first hand.
5	1377216000	J.D. Robb's books are the best!  I have read every single one of them. There were a couple out of the whole lot that weren't quite up to par but on the whole, she rocks!!!  I read it in almost one sitting and then wish the next one was out already.  Love, love, love her series.
5	1377129600	I read every book by this author.  Can't wait for the next book. I like the way DALLAS always figures out the bad guy.
5	1377129600	This is my first book by this author.  So glad I purchased this.  The write up on it was excellent.  Suspenseful.  Great well written book.  Enjoyed it.
2	1377129600	I LOVE all these books.....have not only READ every one of them but have KEPT all of them......but I am half way through this one and it is SO slow I am considering not finishing it.  So far, the only interaction between Eve and her husband are the sex scenes rather than the interesting and complex relationship they have had in past books.  And there are so many suspects from all these different firms (all with 3 names) that I am having trouble keeping up with them.  PLEASE tell me it gets better.
3	1376956800	As an avid reader of the 'in death' series, this installment left me waiting for the appeareance of the real cast of characters. No fire and ice betwen Roarke and Eve, especially when Eve is attacked with a stunner in the back before getting knocked down and smacking her head onto the concrete. It seemed totally out of character for Roarke to watch the incident on the televions newscast and decide Eve was ok because of the expression on her face once she sat up. Not at all a normal reaction from a man who idolizes the ground his wife walks on.Time to wait for the next installment and hopefully all our favorite characters will be back in character.
5	1376870400	J. D. Robb never fails to intrigue us and makes you want to keep reading. This book is a must read!
5	1376870400	I've been reading her series for about 10 years and they never disappoint.  This one was different as the suspects all seemed to have alibis or lacked motive.  I liked the way she caught the baddie in this one too.  More professional an outcome I think.  Can't wait for the next one out.
5	1376784000	I've read all of the Eve Dallas books from day one, and can't wait until the next one. Nora Roberts is brilliant no matter what she calls herself.
5	1376784000	If you like Eve Dallas, this is a great read, just like all the others. I never read a JD Robb I didn't like.
5	1376784000	I love all the JD Robb books. A little mystery, a little sex a lot of money. The &#34;In Death&#34; series is so good. It takes you through the gamut all the way to the conclusion, which isn't always the one you think it is going to be.
2	1376524800	More of the usual.  This formula is getting pretty thin, you can't tell one book from the other anymore.  Roarke does half of her work, then she sets up a huge confrontation where she puts her ass on the line to catch the bad guy and prove she is a bad ass.
5	1376524800	Once again Robb has kept me wanting more! I hate the end of her books as I want to start another right away! Eve and Roarke don't disappoint in this book. I love that he is very involved in this case, helping Eve catch someone who thinks they are superior in every way. Eve makes being a detective both exciting and glamorous.If you like the ..in Death series you will like this one. Next please? (Hurry)!
5	1376524800	I have over 37 of J.D. Robb's books and each one is like having a friend come to visit in the guise of Eve Dallas.  And the plots are fun and interesting.
5	1376524800	I will read anything by this author, she is my absolute favorite.  All her books are page turners.  Hard to put down.
5	1376438400	Keeps you reading every second. Another greaf J . D Robb novel.  This story had the right amount of suspense and drama. It had an unexpected ending when the killer was revealed. One of the best of the series.
5	1376352000	I have a collection of J.D. Robb books and always enjoy buying them used. My budget only allows so many purchases, so I can depend on Amazon for my movies and books.
3	1376265600	It seems the last few In Death books have been lacking something, excitement maybe? I have been a Robb fan for years, dutifully buying each book as soon as it comes out to continue reading about two of my favorite characters Eve and Roarke, but lately I have been disappointed. I usually read these books in a few days, but with the recent one's I'm not in a hurry to get to the end to find out 'who done it'. I keep reading them though in hopes that I find that spark again.
5	1376265600	I really enjoyed the book! It was a well developed plot with interesting twists! As always I loved the interaction of the characters!
4	1376265600	I look forward to each new book in the series and Calculated in Death is much on the level as the preceding ones.  I prefer to forego the detailed sex scenes and just shim over those embellishments to get back to the nitty gritty of the case involved.Dallas has evolved into a character that I like: a person of strong character and morality who has a close relationship with her husband, who maintains leadership with insight and respect for her partner and those under her supervision. Oh, she has her moments when she can be stubborn or peevish, etc., but she is decisive, intelligent, and cares about what truly matters.The other standing characters are also interesting, quirky individuals who give color to the series without being obnoxious or totally weird.In this book, Eve, due to experience and insight, quickly knows that a mugging death is not a mugging.  Things just don't add up.  She is trying to make the connections and is beginning to see some possibilities, when there is another death that firms up her suspicions.  But, to get solid evidence and to understand just what is behind the murders, she needs Rourke's (her husband's) expertise in business, figures, etc.Okay, this is not a top notch suspense nor a deep dark complicated mystery.  But it is a good read and well written with believable characters.  Soooo much better than the many stories I have read with heroines who supposedly are strong women, but who turn out to be ridiculously stubborn, whiny, wimpy, and so hung up on their personal problems, I find them unlikable.If you enjoy or want a quick or light who-done-it or police procedural you will probably enjoy this book.  There are references to previous cases (books), but you can manage without reading the many other books in the series.  However, the development of Eve Dallas from the beginning to this point has been interesting and you may find you want to start at the beginning of her saga.
5	1376092800	Thank you for such quick service.  I appreciate it very much. I will look for your items whenever I need something.  Thanks again
4	1376092800	J.D. Robb always keeps your interest until the very end.  A nice book to read on a hot summer day.
5	1376006400	Read all the books in this series.  Even get the paperbacks and read them again.  Its time tp Promote Eve Dallas to Captain Make her the Commander of her Unit, and let her run the special cases.
3	1375920000	Lt. Eve Dallas at her best, the faithful and smart Peabody by her side and the omnipresent Roark once again get their man, each one doing what they do best. As always the heat is great between Eve and Roark but somehow in the last few books is gotten more intimate, sweet, especially by Eve, spoiler alert..... Roberts slips in the dialogue Roark talks about when they have children of their own........
5	1375920000	Another great "In Death" book ! The author continues to create an exciting mystery with each book in the series. equally exciting , is the back story of Roarke, Eve and Summerset and we should also include the furry Galahad!I always look forward to this series . I only wish the author could write faster.
4	1375747200	if you have read any of the &#34; in death&#34; books, you know they always bring solid entertainment. this one will not disapoint. it reads quick, but also lets you fall int the story.
5	1375747200	I have never found a disappointing book in the death series.  I have read everyone and always keep checking to see when the next one is coming out.  I am a huge fan.
4	1375660800	I read and re-read every J.D. Robb novel. NY to Dallas was one of my all time faves.While this one was good and showed some development of our family of characters it otherwise seemed a bit flat! It was not hard to pick out the bad guys and their reasonings ( if one could use the word) seemed rather sophomoric. Perhaps Ms Roberts needed a break from the deeper, darker ventures.Still worth the read!
3	1375660800	Have read every "in death" novel. I usually finish each novel in one setting and have been very sad when each is completed . Always anticipating the next. But I have to say I found the writing and dialog to be very tedious. I had a very hard time finishing the book. I suffered through it for over a week just because I was determined to see it through. By the end I didn't care who did what...as long as it ended. Very disappointed but hoping next will be back to the caliber expected.
5	1375574400	I've read all the In Death series and I think this book was a bit better than the last one.  I told a friend about these books and she is starting to read them now.  She already asked for the second one, so I think she is getting hooked.
3	1375574400	The books are written primarily for a female audience, so some of my observations and reactions, as a man, may skew from the expected demographic norms. My comments are also based not on any specific book but the series.SPOILER NOTATION: I worked hard at not including any spoilers in my long review. That said, I offer the following:1) I name the killer in one book. However, the plot reveals the killer early on. In this book, the WHO is not important; HOW the killer is caught, is. As such, I do not feel that knowing the killer up front is a spoiler.2) I mention some background info about Roarke, and other instances, like mentioning a grief-stricken character. But are such instances a spoiler? While I do not think so, I appreciate that others may disagree.3) So, if you want NO plot info about this long series, please be advise to proceed no further!WHAT I LIKE:Above all, I like that there are SO many books in the series. I listen to the audiobooks while working, and find the familiarity of one-after-another comforting. I enjoy how layers of the primary characters are revealed as the series continues, and how the characters deepen.I think the books are well written, and often enjoy the wording and phrasing. There was only one book that I found tedious (so much so that I never finished it: SALVATION).In PORTRAIT, we discover a lot more about Roarke and his Irish past. The scenes where his finds his long-lost family are deeply moving (and it is curious to the extreme that the author has no other scenes quite like this in the long long long series). I re-read over and over the pages with Roarke and his mother's sister. Just lovely. (Curious, too, this book is the only one not in unabridged audio format.)The primary characters. I like `em all, and delight when they enter a scene. It is like a dear old friend stopping by suddenly. Yes, please come in! I even enjoy minor reoccurring characters such as Crack (another side of him is revealed in PORTRAIT, and is quite touching). With the audiobooks, I love the voices. The narrator does a great job.The mysteries are, generally, of interest.I enjoy the endless bickering between Eve and Summerset. CAVEAT: It makes all the difference that the two secretly admire each other (but will never admit this).Some readers have stated that they cannot see why the Dazzling Roarke would have married Eve. But their attraction makes perfect sense to me. Each had a very similar - and spectacularly bad - childhood and this, from my viewpoint, creates a unique bond between them. Moreover, most women would, ah, defer to the Mighty Man but I can understand how Roarke would be highly attracted to a woman who was not easy, not deferential.While Eve is normally prickly to an extreme, and often outright abusive (see below), the author occasionally reveals that Eve actually has a kinder side - a rare pleasure.  In PROMISES, Eve is generous and tender towards a grief-stricken Morris. In INDULGENCE, Eve surprises Roarke, early in the book, with a thoughtful, wondrous anniversary present.Above all, what engage me are not the mysteries but the characters. They feel real - a great testament to the author.DO NOT LIKE:GET THE GIRL SOME SLEEP. Geeez, Eve's compulsive workaholism is painful. Painful! Her constant lack of sleep, and aversion to sitting down and having a decent meal, or fun, becomes tiresome in the extreme. In the extreme (I almost gave up on the series because of this).The sex scenes. I cringe. If I were reading the books I could just easily flip through the sex but I am listening to the audiobooks. As such, I have to leap up, run over to the computer, and fast-forward though the scenes. Mind you, I am not a prude, hardly, but such scenes make me feel, I dunno, like a peeping Tom. I know Eve and Roarke so well; it is painfully uncomfortable being a voyeur to their intimate acts. (That said, I enjoy it when Peabody refers to sex, obliquely, with McNab, and Eve invariably cringes.)I know that 90% of homicides are committed by men, so the fact that the vast majority of In Death killers are men is statistically normal. Still...I yearned for a bit more diversityAnd speaking of diversity, Eve's world is awfully white. Hello? In NYC? I mean, her mostly white world might make sense if the series took place in some small Mid-West town, but NYC? Yes, yes, I know there is the occasional person of color (or of Asian descent, or gay), but these little bits of diversity are just that: little bits. This is SO not NYC. The city has always been incredibly diverse, and there is no reason to think it will not be fifty years in the fixture.I cringe every time Pepsi is mentioned. How much did the author earn from this incessant plug?The books take place in the future. While there are a few futuristic touches (I especially like the droids), the sensibilities seem very 1990s. If you look at the VAST differences in how women are treated in just the last fifty years, it is impossible to imagine that in fifty years hence women will still be treated as they are today, and still fighting for equality.Cars & Equipment. Eve's endless fighting with very bad computers and very bad cars simply makes so sense. Obviously, Roarke could have effortlessly resolved these issues (he does, at looooooong last, get her a good car). Yes, Eve would have pitched her usual fit, yes, they would have fought - yawn - but in the end she would have accepted these necessary gifts. Indeed, it makes no sense that Roarke would not have fully outfitted the whole NY police department with top-of-the-line computers (a great tax write-off, too).I know Eve is supposed to be tough. But there is a HUGE difference between tough and abusive. And Eve often veers to outright abuse. In one book (INNOCENT) she hits Roark right in the face, drawing blood. And for no reason. When he asks why, she casually replies: "Because you are a man." Huh? Huh? Imagine the reader outrage if the roles were reversed. In VENGEANCE, Eve interrogates Summerset and is INCREDIBLY abusive. I cringed. There are, too, countless small scenes where Eve is not just being tough - which I can admire - but outright mean and abusive. Above all, I dislike how often Eve is abusive to Roarke, verbally, and am surprised how many readers overlook this.Roarke becomes, I dunno, almost like an accessory to Eve. This reduces my appreciation of the man. I would have enjoyed learning more about his world, his friends, and his struggles. While he is endlessly helping Eve with HER work, comforting HER after she has nightmares, tending to HER wounds (both physical and mental), Eve rarely offers same. This also reduces my appreciation of her (and of the author).Roarke becomes friends with Eve's friends. OK. Where though are Roarke's friends (see above, also)? He seems to have but one friend, Brian, who lives in another country.Roarke and Eve are written as The Great Love Story. Really? Their relationship consists of three aspects 99% of the time: Sex. Fighting. Working together to solve a crime. Sorry, but this conveys little depth. To me, countless small, seemingly mundane things, done with consideration and real warmth, are what make for a great relationship. The Roarke and Eve relationship lacks this distinction. Even after the zillion sex scenes I cannot recall that the two ever just laid in bed for an hour after climaxing, and simply talked, laughed, and gently touched each other. No, they finish quickly (it never seems to take much time), and Eve usually jumps up and goes right back to work. In short, they seem to have sex; they do not seem to make love.Early in the series, too many primary characters (Eve, Roarke, Peabody, and even Mira) were In Danger, and the potential victim of X killer. Oh no! But, I loathed this. Luckily, the author later decided to expand the hit list and our beloved friends were safe from imminent danger, although it seems like every third book Eve is in danger. Boooooring.And, how many times do Eve and Roarke have the exact same fight when Eve puts herself in danger? These get really old really quick. In NEW YORK, the two have another huge fight and I yearned for Roarke to just say: "You know, I put up with a lot. But I have had enough of your abuse whenever I express concern for your safetly." I yearned for him to then just turn, and walk away. Of course, I do not blame Eve. I blame the author.My biggest complaint? There is no pay-off. A great story needs a great payoff. We want the girl to get the guy, the poor person to win the lottery, and the honest politician to vanquish over evil. While Eve always gets her man, the stories then abruptly end:* A particularly egregious example is in TREACHERY. After a long long long build-up to catch the bad guy (well, bad girl, one Renee Oberman), Eve confronts Oberman, the two engage in a (highly improbable and ludicrous) fistfight, and the books ends. That was it. I gasped. Where was my pay-off? Where was THE great scene, one I had waited for through the whole long long long build-up, for Eve to confront Oberman in an interrogation room as Oberman tried to weasel her way out of trouble, and as Eve, evidence by evidence, boxed Oberman into a tight box? Where was the scene with Oberman, shrieking, being handcuffed and carted off? Where was the sad scene where Oberman's esteemed father learned the terrible truth of his daughter? Where was the scene with Nadine putting the right spin on events?* In MEMORY, Eve tells a moving story to Roarke about when she was a child, and in the care of a horrible foster mother. A boy across the street did a nice thing for Eve - the first nice thing anybody had ever done for her. Then the foster mother, secretly, did a terrible thing to the boy. Eve knew the truth, and, as a scared young girl, did nothing about it. OK. But...it would have been nice at the end of the book for Eve to have found the boy, now a man (which Roarke had offered to do), and reveal the truth.* Also in TREACHERY, Peabody meets with the very angry mother of a police offer killed in the line of duty. We readers know differently: the officer was killed by other officers. This is later proved by Eve, who mentions getting a posthumous commendation for the officer. OK. But it would have been deeply moving to have included a scene at the end where Peabody meets again with the mother to present the award - and the truth regarding the courage of her daughter.Anyway, these are but a few examples; all the books are like this. I yearn for more closure, to learn about the After of each case, and of situations introduced but not followed up. Sigh.
5	1375488000	I love love love JD Robb books, I have read them all. And I will continue to buy them as she writes them.
5	1375488000	I don't know how Robb can keep coming up with the stories she does.  I certainly hope she doesn't run out.
5	1375401600	J D Robb has done it again, writing a story that is impossible to put down until you finish the Book. I highly recommend the book and thank my anonymous person who sent it to me.
4	1375142400	The progress of Dallas as an officer of the law would lead to the obvious question; when does she her promotion to captain ?  The storyline and its development are good.  An entertaining read.
4	1375142400	Having read all of her books about Rourke and Dallas, this was another great addition.  I look forward to more additions to come.
5	1375142400	As All ! I really like all of Nora Roberts (AKA ) J.D. Robb books. I thought this one was good. Can't wait for the next one.
5	1375142400	As always J.D. Robb never disappoints!  I truly love this whole series and I am addicted to all the characters!  Just the right mixture of mystery, romance and bad ass women!  I am always looking for the next book in this series!
5	1375056000	This is the ultimate J.D. Robb.  I love Eve Dallas...always smart, funny, and consistent!  The work is suspenseful and exciting!
5	1375056000	Not sure why others say this one just isn't up to Nora Roberts usual standards, I thought it was very good, as they all are. I have the entire series, all in hardback, & I reread them every few years. There has only been one of the series I didn't care for, can't remember the name just the plot. This book was another that was hard to put down. I like most of her books but the Eve & Roarke series is by far my favorite. Keep it up Miss Roberts!
5	1374969600	I just LOVE the &#34;Death&#34; series..love the characters..stories keep you wanting more. I think I've read every one..Highly recommend reading the series.
4	1374969600	A good read, but not the best of the serries. I will still recommend this to anyone who wants to spend a Summer day relaxing and reading.
5	1374969600	As with all the Death series, Calculated is a winner.  Gritty police procedural with all our favorite characters back for an update.  Though this is very much a stand alone novel, long time fans will get so much more from the back story.  I've read them all (some more than once) and theyre all a thrill ride.
5	1374883200	I LOVE this author. The characters, story line & suspense makes intriguing reading.  Hard to put it down.  The addition of romance & humor just top of this excellent book
3	1374624000	I will be upfront and say I have been a fan of this series for many years, and have read almost, if not every, book within it. I am not a fan of romantic novels, but love the characterizations, etc. that are a huge part of this series. The book is no where near the best of the series, and if you are not already a fan, it would be best for you to start near the beginning of the series and work your way through. Every book has references to past events that may confuse someone who is new to the series. This novel is easy to read and still enjoyable, just not up to the standards set by the rest of the series.WARNING: SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERTI was really disappointed by this one. I am getting bored with the formula; oh, Eve is going to serve as bait for another serial killer? Oh, Roarke gets the evidence with his fancy, magical, perfect computer skills? Oh, Eve gets her butt kicked and refuses to go to the hospital for it?I know it has to be getting hard to come up with fresh plots for this series. The mystery of Eve's mom has been resolved. The mystery of Eve's father has been resolved. The mystery of Roarke's family has been resolved. A huge part of the appeal to this series, for me, was the constant confrontation with the horrors of their pasts. Now that just about all of it has been resolved, will the series just become another Nora Roberts romance series?The series needs a serious shake-up. Maybe a sister comes out of the woodwork. Maybe a major character dies (although it would be hard for that one; it would have to be someone very close to Eve without overdoing it. Morris, maybe? And then you can replace him with someone who really doesn't like or respect Eve, so she has to butt heads with this new person in every book?)Maybe Eve could sustain a very serious injury where the recovery becomes part of the books - if I remember correctly, everything we have seen up until now is either treated on-site or they are on their way to the hospital at the story's end.Someone has to be ghost-writing the stories now. In this novel, there are two references that made me stop and just stare in confusion at the book. One was the reference to Africa referring to it as a dark place; another was the reference to getting beat in a woodshed. Eve is famously ignorant of history, are people still getting beat in woodsheds at the time of the events in the series? The other major characters don't seem to feature as prominently as they have in most of the older books.
5	1374451200	Title: Calculated in DeathSeries: In Death bk 36Author: J.D. RobbGenre: Murder Mystery, Futuristic, Romantic SuspenseOn Manhattan's Upper East Side a woman lies dead at the bottom of the stairs, stripped of all her valuables. Most cops might call it a mugging gone wrong, but Lieutenant Eve Dallas knows better.A well-off accountant and a beloved wife and mother, Marta Dickenson doesn't seem the type to be on anyone's hit list. But when Eve and her partner, Peabody, find blood inside the building, the lieutenant knows Marta's murder was the work of a killer who's trained, but not professional or smart enough to remove all the evidence.But when someone steals the files out of Marta's office, Eve must immerse herself in her billionaire husband Roarke's world of big business to figure out who's cruel and callous enough to hire a hit on an innocent woman. And as the killer's violent streak begins to escalate, Eve knows she has to draw him out, even if it means using herself as bait. .When it comes to murder mysteries no one does it better than J.D. Robb. On top of the mystery of trying to figure who the murder is we get to see the people we've come to love just as much as Eve and Roarke....though lets be honest we all want out Roarke.The latest case to fall on Lt Eve Dallas's desk is that of a mugging gone wrong...or so it seems. It doesn't take Eve very long to figure out that the mugging was in fact staged and the victim not a random person. As she pulls in her team to solve the murder she quickly realizes she needs the help of her expert civilian consult in all things money related aka Roarke.I have to admit this book had be guessing right up until she figured out who the murderer was. And then as she began to pull the pieces together as to the why and how, and how to she was going to nail him for everything.I really enjoyed this book and the twists and turns it took...there were a couple of conversations I really liked this one being my favorite though..."They all live within their considerable means, or so it appears,"Eve said as they got off on her level of the garage. "And according to what we'd call their privileged or semi-preivileged lifestyle. And that lifestyle includes spouses, fianc&eacute;es, lovers exes, LC's - and you bet your ass, sidepieces.""You don't really think that mouse bait Pope has a sidepiece.""That type can surprise you and bang like a drum.""Have you ever been banged by mouse bait?""No." Their footsteps echoed. Somewhere on a higher level, someone gunned an engine. "But Mavis dated this guy for a while back in the day who looked like one of those garden gnomes. She said he went at it like a rabid mink. Don't trust appearances.""That's true." Peabody jumped in the car. "Take McNab. He's aborable, but he's got that skinny frame. But he can go like a turbo thruster.""Jesus, Peabody. I don't want to hear about McNab's thrusting abilities.""They're exceptional. Just the other night, he-""Don't, don't, don't." Eve slapped a hand at the corner of her eye when it twitched, then bared her teeth at Peabody's muffled chuckle."You did that on purpose.""I just wanted to see if it still worked.""It'll always work. Just like my boot will always fit up your ass."It's because of conversations like this between Eve and Peabody and the relationships she has built with the other members of her family that I keep coming back to this series.One of the things I liked a lot about in this book is that we get to see a slightly different side of Roarke, and I really liked that. He showed Eve a side that I'm sure she's seen before but is new to us the reader. I enjoyed seeing how Eve reacted to this side of him and how it made her that much better as a person.I will say though that of all the endings to these books what happens at the end of this book in regards to Eve and Roarke is by far my favorite of all the books. It's so them and one hundred percent perfect.If you're a fan of this series then you won't be disappointed with the latest installment. Calculated in Death lives up to the promise Robb gave us when she hooked us on this series back in book 1 Naked in Death.If you haven't yet picked up this series then I suggest you give it a try.Grade AReview by: Heather[...]
2	1374364800	No spark or interesting sidelines, basic outline as in all her books.  Characters are dutifully brought out but with no freshness or even depth of character.  Seems as though the author is tired of writing these novels and is just fulfilling her contractual obligations to crank out another book.  Disappointing as I have thoroughly enjoyed many previous books.
5	1374364800	it is a great book I love all her books, would really like to be a proof reader for them.
5	1374192000	As usual this book was as good as all her others. I love her sense of humor and the spellbinding plots. I just hope she doesn't run out of ideas.
5	1374105600	I love how Eve is evolving.  She's still displays her tough cop persona, but is showing more of her loving side.  I sincerely hope that J.D Robb decides that Roarke and Eve need to get pregnant before this series comes close to ending.  Would love to see how they would be wonderful parents regardless of their own horrible childhoods.  I also think J.D Robb could truly add some fun humor to the books with Roarke and Eve expecting a baby.  Please tell me I'm not the only devoted fan of the death series that is eagerly awaiting this to happen!  Calculated in Death was yet again another great read.
5	1374105600	Big fan of this series and always the right amount of mystery, drama, action, and sex. Looking forward to Eves next case.
2	1374019200	It's finally happened.  I skimmed over giant parts of this book.First, it had to do with finance.  When anyone starts talking about finance my eyes glaze over and my mind wanders.  Of course, there wasn't tons of detail to bore me to tears, but it wasn't a motive that interested me.  And it dragged on for sooooo long.  Dallas kept going over the details of the case to everyone and there was very little deviation.  Even her psych consults were useless.  Mira was there just to confirm what Dallas had already come up with.For once, the happenings apart from the investigation were more interesting, but we didn't get to dig too deep into those.I'm sad that I didn't get into this book.  I hope this isn't a sign of times to come.
4	1373932800	Good reading for the beach, or wherever your travels take you. J.D. Robb has gotten her second wind on this series.
5	1373846400	I have read all of J.D. Robb's Death mysterys an she still manages to delightfully surprise and impress me. Her characters continue to grow and develope. The plots are quick and smart. Eve and Roarke are reminisant of Tracey and Hepburn. J.D. Robb delivers a fast fun read.
5	1373846400	JD Rob and Lt Dallas never disappoint. This is a great book, with good twists and turns and added suspense.
5	1373846400	Great book!! I've read some parts over again and again.  there is something about j. D. Robb books that I cannot put down. I have all her work and reread a lot of them,  too.
5	1373673600	I love the books with Eve Dallas and her husband. Always a good read.I have read of them,and I am looking forward to the next book
5	1373673600	Once again J.D. Robb creates an exciting and entertaining story that you can't seem to put down. I loved it and am looking forward to the next dose of Dallas.
5	1373587200	Great series one of the few I keep up with! Nora Roberts/J.D Robb is a favorite of mine.Also helps she a hometown girl =)
5	1373587200	I have read all of the In Death books and I have loved them all. I love all of the characters and it is always fun to escape into this futuristic world.
5	1373500800	If  you have followed this series, you will like the latest book.  Eve and Roarke solving crimes is always an interesting read!
5	1373500800	Good for all lovers of mystery and comedy and romance! You get it all!!  Fast paced easy read you can't put down!  Best mystery novels ever and placed in a future setting you can see, hear, taste and smell!  JD Robb is fab!!
5	1373414400	Enjoyed reading the in Death series... Love Eve's tenacity and Roakes caring nature. Hoping that they will soon have a family. Though I understand that if this happens the series will end... a dilemma indeed.
5	1373241600	I have never been disappointed in any of JD Robb's books!  I always look forward to her next In Death!
5	1373241600	This is the latest in my favorite JD Robb series.  I have collected all of them and have even reread the entire series.
5	1373155200	I thought this was the best of the last few books. It gave me a little bit of everything.  She writes these books with every imaginative woman in mind.
5	1373155200	I totally enjoyed &#34;Calculated in Death&#34; - since I'm a die-hard J. D. Robb fan, that's not surprising.  This one delved into the financial world so Roark's expertise was highlighted.
3	1372982400	No change in the story line, same old same old, starting to get real boring, bad guys, and good guys and sex.
1	1372896000	Who wrote it ??I eagerly await each new book, and look forward to immersing myself into the story of Eve & Roarke.Not this time... this book really missed the mark, unfortunately for me I bought it when released saving it in anticipation of upcoming holidays, an uninterrupted read ....  The story line was weak and boring. I would normally lose myself in the book and finish it over a weekend, it has been 3 weeks and I still have the final couple of chapters to go.Please bring back the magic of Eve & Roarke !!!
5	1372809600	Thoroughly enjoyed this book for the second time.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story that's well written about individuals who (if you've read the previous books) you've come to love, enjoy and could respect.
5	1372723200	I started reading J.D. Robb 4 years ago when I had an auto accident and was stuck in bed for awhile.  I have now read everyone of them and I can't wait for the next one!
4	1372636800	I look forward to every book written by J.D. Robb. This was no disappointment. It wasn't, however, one of the best, but certainly a good read.
5	1372636800	Nora Roberts does it again! I absolutely love the &#34;In Death&#34; series, ALL of them! This latest one is just as thrilling as the others and I never get tired of reading about Eve & Roarke, Peabody and McNab, and all of the other cast that are woven expertly into each story line. I'm a huge fan and will be for life. I've never read a J.D. Robb book that I didn't like.....
5	1372550400	I waited and then couldn't wait any longer to continue the &#34;in Death&#34; series of JD Robb!! Always an excellent read. Left me wanting the next one, Y.S. Bedford TX
5	1372550400	As always JD Robb has out done herselfRorke & &#34;his cop&#34; are fabulousGREAT read could not put it down
5	1372550400	What I love about this book and the series are the characters, the way they have grown over the years and especially the humor that is thrown in and just makes you laugh while their is a crime to be solved and the interaction between the characters.  Love Mavis and all the rest.
3	1372550400	ONLY BECAUSE I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE PLOT. I FIND THIS TYPE BORING. I DO LIKE HER BOOKS THOUGH JUST NOT THIS PARTICULAR PLOT.
2	1372550400	As we know, J.D. Robb is the pen name of Nora Roberts for the Eve Dallas novels.  I think she must have been vacationing when she wrote this story. It lacks the snappy dialogue between Eve and her police cohorts. And maybe just because its happened so many times before but the hot sex between her and Roarke is getting pedestrian.  I know we are heading towards the two of them having a baby.  PUH-LEEZE don't do it!  Have her miscarriage or something.  Eve Dallas too softened will be just like any of a number of serial woman characters in today's world of novels.
2	1372550400	First off, let me say that I've read the In Death series faithfully since the beginning. The last book bored me, but I was hoping this one might pick it up a little bit for me.Nope! This one was even WORSE! Too much time spent re-hashing how broken up the victim's family and friends are over her death, whereas in previous books, Ms. Robb used other ways to create sympathy for the victim and the victim's family and friends. The dialogue between Eve and Roarke and Eve and Peabody seems stilted, the "jokes" forced. There is no witty repartee. It is all flat and lifeless.And the worst part is that there seems to be NO editing done to this book. I lost count of the number of times there was missed punctuation, sentence fragments, and other basic grammatical errors. It seems even more glaring to me because, if it has J.D. Robb's on name, then the story and editing should be top notch, not this amateurish drivel presented here. Ugh! I'm not sure if I want to even read any more in this series after two horrible books in a row...
5	1372550400	This has it all!  Romance,  Intrigue, Mystery, Desire,  Love  and  Wishfullness! Makes you eager for Nora Roberts' New Book! Please!
5	1372464000	What can I tell you.  J.D. Robb has a secure place in my heart.  I love the entire series and has yet to read a book from the In Death series that I did not enjoy.  I may not be a literary expert but I know what I like.  And I really like this series.
5	1372377600	I love Nora Roberts/Jd Robb. I have never been dissapointed. Always dissapointed when I finish because I have to wait for the next. Constantly looking for one I haven't read
5	1372377600	Great book . Loved every page. A bit more sex in this one. Very well done. Will recommend it to friends.
5	1372377600	I want to be Dallas, you just don't know what is coming next,, can't get enough of the in death series
3	1372291200	I could tell from the start in 'Calculated in Death' that this book was written by someone new.  The characters personalities had changed, some more than others, and the writing needs a little more polish.  It feels like a first effort at writing a novel.Eve was softer.  She did not treat Peabody like crap, something that disturbed me very much in the last few books.  She also laughed a great deal more and only pointed once.  Theses are changes I was hoping for, because I felt she had become harsh to the point of unlikable, but this Eve has gone too far to the light side.  She was not only less tortured by her past, but seemed downright cured of it.  Her emotional state and relationship with Roarke were perfect - and they are one couple who wallow in not being perfect.  No fights, no stubbornness, no forcing Eve to eat, sleep or take care of herself.  Who are these people?The good news is that Peabody is also changed.  She is no longer a whining, self-doubt machine that I desperately want to shut off.  She had more confidence in herself and no longer 'squeaks' back the order when Eve gives her more responsibility.  A squeaky cop is a weak cop, and our Peabody finally gets the respect she deserves from the writer of 'Calculated In Death."What was missing was the growth in characters.  Eve always learns something about herself and/or her relationship with Roarke in every 'In Death' book.  That was sorely missing here, making the book feel more like fluff.  What also made the book feel more light weight were the useless paragraphs where we learn all about the art of organizing one's stuff.  It was boring to read and had no bearing on the plot whatsoever, and it went on, and on, and on... {Yawn!}.  Fortunately, the book became more exciting shortly after the drivel, so I will forgive.  Please don't do it again.The plot was a little weak, became quite predictable, and that scary sense of urgency I always felt with the previous books was missing, but  I still enjoyed it.  The banter between Eve and Roarke still sparkled, but the love making seemed to have lost some of its heat.In conclusion, this book was hit and miss for me.  A Freshman effort for someone to be sure, and I will be expecting improvements in the next book and a lot more polish on his/her writing style, but overall, I'm pleased with the more respectful Eve, the more confident Peabody and the always droolworthy Roarke.
4	1372204800	Another adventure of Eve and Rourke and friends. Could have developed the bad guy's character a little more. Good Read
5	1372204800	J.D. Robb/ Norah Roberts  Futuristic Police Detective Eve Dallas and her wealthy street-smart husband never fail to entertain! The New York of the future is  still a crime-ridden place. This book delivers a wild, fun, engaging, complex story that keeps you turning pages until the very end.
4	1372204800	It was a little slow starting, but picked up speed.  It got a little too much on the financial side, but I would recommend it to anyone.  Can't get enough Eve Dallas and Rourke
5	1372118400	I am addicted to the In Death series. Great story.  Read in 2 days.  Would have only been 1 day if I didn't have to sleep!
5	1372118400	Have read all the death series but this was the best.  Could not put it down at all, carried my Kindle with me everywhere.
4	1372118400	As usual, another wonderful In Death story with the indomitable Eve Dallas and Roarke. No matter how many of these books the author writes, the tension, the murder mystery and, especially, the dialogue NEVER GETS OLD! These books are classics and ones I re-read often.
5	1372032000	Can't wait for these books to come out.  It's funny, but I don't really like Nora Roberts books, but I love her style of writing is this series.
5	1371945600	ANY Nora Roberts fan will love this book.  As usual, she keeps you guessing until the last minute and Roarke is my dream man.  Sorry, Dallas.
5	1371945600	I got this for my Kindle and had forgotten I have this in hardcover. It didn't matter because it was still a fascinating read. I have no problem reading her books over and over again.
4	1371945600	Typical Dallas and Company story.  Some nice twists.  And the internal politics is always fun!One small complaint that I have is that if you consider the series as whole the sex scenes are repetitious and I find myself skipping over them as irrelevant.
5	1371859200	As always, this JD Robb books grabs your attention from the very beginning to the very last word.  Love the way she keeps your mind working in figuring the logistics of the crime and apprehension of the &#34;bad guys.&#34;
5	1371772800	I have every single one of Nora books as j d robb as enjoy every single one.  She never fails to make the story individually unique.
5	1371772800	Calculated in Death is yet ANOTHER great read!  I continue to be amazed at someone who can write such a long series of books, and STILL come up with fresh, new plots!  Trust me, read them ALL, in order if you can.  You're in for a real treat!!
5	1371686400	enjoyed it as always...reading her newest book is like meeting with an old friend !  I can't wait for her new one coming out in Sept  already pre-ordered
2	1371686400	Sad to say, this has got to be the very worst In Death book of the entire series. The glaring mistakes and difficult-to-follow characters in Delusion In Death were somewhat off-set by the blood & gore which I tend to like in a movie or a book (makes me a sicko, I suppose) but Calculated is a long drawn-out, plodding & boring book and I still haven't quite finished it but I'm getting there, I think.Too many times the F*** word is used by all the characters and there is simply no Zip to this story. I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only reader to feel this way but I'd rather none of us did. Robb/Roberts is putting too much on her plate and needs to back-off and write a few really good stories rather than the many not so good. They are all starting to sound the same and are on a fast moving downward spiral. (Whiskey Beach is another example of samo-sameo and I didn't even buy that one after I read the preview.)I sincerely hope Robb/Roberts gets her act back on track because I very much enjoy the In Death series but not if they keep going in the direction. I'm wondering is She actually wrote Calculated? It just isn't her usual zippy style.
4	1371686400	I have read the whole series and throughly enjoyed all of them.But the newer ones are more proceduralsand have a raunchiness to them that I find disappointing.Mz Roberts earlier fineness seems to be fading.I will continue to read this series even with the disappointment.
5	1371513600	j.d. robb as always writes a good book. I love this series and have read them from the very beginning
3	1371513600	I have read the entire series, and I am afraid the stories are so &#34;formula&#34; that they are becoming boring.  Eve should have been promoted to Captain after all the murders she has solved!
5	1371427200	If you like this series you will love this book! Eve and Roarke are perfect for each other. Add in a little murder of course made a killer book!
5	1371427200	For anyone who loves the JD Robb series, the newest book to the series is fantastic! I absolutely love the development of Eve and Roarke through this drama-filled novel.
5	1371340800	Eve and Roarke get better and better. I always look forward to the next book in the series. The author keeps the stories fresh, complex, and interesting. The story is 3D and the characters have depth. I love how other stories are tied in and the follow up on the lives impacted. I am waiting for the next book.
5	1371254400	The character seem so real and the plot is well written. I wish they would make a movie or a TV series out of the Death series!
5	1371168000	I love ordering Nora Roberts books from amazon because they are delivered instantly to my Kindle and i don't have to wait.
5	1371081600	Great story and great book.  Amazon delivered the ebook to my Kindle quickly and I really enjoyed the story.  I love JD Robb and her writing.  Thanks.
5	1370908800	I was going to wait for the price to come down. No, really. I was. (Are you laughing?) For what I paid for this book, I could have had two or more inferior e books. Luckily for me, it's J. D. Robb, so I got my money's worth. I've read every "In Death" novel at lease twice or thrice, but I believe this may be one of my favorites. The scenes between Eve and Roarke zing, make you smile the first time and the fifth. Peabody is at her best and we get a glimpse into Summerset's day. ( spoiler alert: even gazillionaires have laundry. Who knew?) The criminal is pompous and stupid (not a spoiler...this plot is rife with stupid,pompous characters.) I love this book. I'm sorry. Am I gushing? Yeah, I am.http://www.amazon.com/Marita-Baxter/e/B00L1CZOS4
5	1370908800	As always i love JD Robb's writing i can not put the book down says it all right very good book
5	1370908800	I fell in love with Eve and Roarke and eve Summerser in Vengeance in Death. I was then on a quest. I hunted up all of the books in the series up to that point. It was about 20. I spent an entire week immersed in the world created by JD Robb, barely coming up for air. My husband felt neglected but he got over it. I introduced him to the audio books and while he still favors The Odd Series by Dean Koontz, he had good things to say and looks forward to her books (he does fast forward through the love scenes). I have introduced many people to JD Robb over the years and nine have been disappointed.
5	1370822400	The series is better than any tv series ever on TV. She keeps her characters growing and their lives are always action packed. Hard to put down!
5	1370736000	Love all J.D. Robb books. Enjoy Eve's thought process. Her mix of street smarts and then her bafflement over most things female. Would like more of Mavis and Bella. Can't wait until Eve and Roarke have a Bella of their own. Can just see Sommerset babysitting
5	1370736000	You can't lose with an Eve Dallas book. If you have never read an &#34;In death&#34; book start at the beginning. You need to meet all the characters and build the story. J.D Robb (Nora Roberts)  is much more interesting in these futuristic homicide detective books. I love her historical romances - but these I will reread over again!
5	1370649600	love this series and can't wait till the new ones come out. have them all. trying to get hard cover for earlier copies.
5	1370649600	Well written with some twist and turns - J D Robb (Nora Roberts) is a very good write and have enjoyed most of her works
5	1370649600	I love all of the In death series, Can't wait for the movies to come out.  I would recommend this book to all of my friends
5	1370649600	Love the Eve Dallas and Roarke characters.  All the regular story characters make it a reunion with each new book. How Nora keeps coming up with each new &#34;..... In Death&#34; story is beyond me.  I sure hope she's got a bunch more in her mind yet to write. I can't read them fast enough and then am so sorry when I've finished the book. Even got my spouse into these &#34;... In Death&#34; books and we each eagerly await the next one.  Please don't stop now.
5	1370649600	I just love this series. With 36 books so far, you'd think something would start to ring as d&eacute;j&agrave; vu or just plain old boring. Not with these books and not this series. It seems every book I read there's always something new that just makes me laugh. It definitely wasn't the hardest case Eve has worked on but the crime was pretty ballsy. I loved the world map quips of Eve's ass. Too funny and I can't wait for more!!
4	1370649600	I haven't read many of  JD Robb's books published under the name Nora Roberts but I love the Lt Eve Dallas series.  This book didn't seem quite as fast moving or intense as the previous books. Not sure what was missing but I wasn't as excited to get back to it each time I picked up my e-reader. Still I will anxiously await the next book.
5	1370563200	alway entertained with the in death series can't wait until new book arrives. Hated to put it down, lasted 2 days and I was finished.
5	1370563200	I have read all of the Lt. Dallas books.  I love murder and mystery books and having the future aspect involved just makes it that much more interesting.
5	1370563200	Read J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts, stopped several years ago, due to same plot, same result.  This book was a pleasant change for me, however same plot/same plot
2	1370563200	Rather boring and repeat of other &#34;Dallas&#34; books in content. Getting in a rut.Needs a variation on the theme as still enjoy the characters.Would love Eve to get pregnant , that would  come as schock
4	1370563200	I really enjoyed this new book in the in death series! JD Robb pulls you into each and every book of the in death series.
5	1370476800	I happen to like reading Nora Roberts books and the characters in her J.D. Robb seriesare always good..I liked this one a lot.
5	1370476800	Loved this book and the series. I have yet to become bored with the story line of J.D. Robb and Lt. Dallas and Roarke.
3	1370476800	I had been saving this book to read at the right moment, knowing there's not another coming any time soon. We had a couple of nasty, cool, rainy days and I thought that was the perfect time to curl up with some hot cocoa and my favorite cop. Was I ever disappointed!! This is the most I have ever paid for a book on kindle and I wish I could ask for a refund. I will not give away the plot. That's not how I write my reviews. I will say, however, that either this book was not written by J.D. Robb, or something happened to her on the way to the computer. I ignored the negative reviews I read because I have always believed in judging books myself. I should have listened. In this story we get a Lt. Dallas I didn't even recognize. Sure, she still has her feud with the vending machines, although not as violent as usual. She also enjoys her run ins with security droids. But she is so calm, so mild mannered, so blah...this was not the nasty, snarky, badass, kickbutt cop we all know and love. Even those love scenes between Eve and Rourke lack the usual heat and passion we have grown accustomed to. Even Eve's usual banter with Summerset feels subdued. The usual supporting cast is more on the sidelines than is customary. The ending felt rushed and forced, and it felt like the story could have used a few more pages.I finished the book because I'm cheap. I paid for it and darn it, I was gonna read it. Besides, I was hoping it would get better. Bottom line...either the author is bored with the character (which is too bad.I could read forty more books in this series), or, someone other than J.D. robb is writing the stories. Whatever the case, I hope this is not the last of the "in Death" series, but I do hope the next one goes back to the Eve Dallas and friends we know and love.
5	1370476800	I have always been a big fan of Nora Roberts, Her J.D. Robb books are always page turners. great read.
5	1370476800	I love the stories and how all the scenes are described down to the smallest detail. This has been the most entertaining series I have ever read. I hope there are many more to come.
5	1370390400	a great read as always the author pulls you into the story in the first few pages and keeps you there on the edge till the very last page.
2	1370304000	I was frankly disappointed by this book . Having followed the In death series from the first publication, this is the first time I have ever been bored by the predictability of the sequence of " dramatic?? /unlikely" events , which lead up to the usual happy ending for Eve and Rourke and/or a taste of a sequel!!!I feel the series has lost it's magic, and unless MS Robb can come up with some new slant, , it will become history of the future.Perhaps she should pursue the issues around Eve's childhood, and have her and the glorious blue eyed Irish Magnate finally embark on PARENTING!!Wow, what a mess those two will do with raising a family.
5	1370304000	I love this series and have re read all of them!  Can't wait for the next one to come out!
4	1370217600	I usually love these books and can't wait for the next. I guess I am not  that into numbers and the business of accounting. I got bogged down in all the business talk but stayed with it  and enjoyed the last third of the book.
5	1370217600	My husband and I both read the JD Robb books.  We love all the characters and get kick out of the &#34;cop speak&#34; and slang that Eve uses.
5	1370217600	This book was outstanding as usual. Lots of action packed reading. I want able to put it down once I starred reading it. My only wish is that they could write books fast enough to keep up with my reading! You will not be disappointed when you read calculated in death it is just as well written as all the other JD Robb books!
5	1370131200	Another great book by Nora Roberts. Dallas and Roarke never get boring. The bad add cop and her hodgepodge of friends and her cops. I love the series. Two people who were born with nothing and no one who find each other and make both love and work successful. Any In Death series books are great and if you haven't already started reading them you are missing out
4	1370044800	Overall good book.  Not as gory or crazy as some of her other plots.  I so enjoy these characters. Read it and enjoy.
5	1370044800	I had been collecting this author for a while.  Now I am reading the books in sequence start to finish.  Awesome read!
4	1370044800	While all these books follow the same pattern, I like the characters and look forward to finding out what the author is going to do with them next.
5	1370044800	terrific book very exciting. -JD Robb has done it again. can't wait for her next one to come out! :-)
1	1369872000	I've read 100 or so crime thrillers like this book over the past year, and generally enjoyed them all. But this book was terrible, the characters were horrible. What is a 'link? So much weird terminology. I skimmed the last half since it was unbearable.
5	1369872000	Not sure why the other reviewers didn't like this installment. I think we found out who the perp was earlier than usual, so this one focused more on how they caught him/them and less on figuring who it was, but not to an extreme level. The method wasn't catchy or unusual or techie, but it doesn't have to be - it's still murder, and that's still Eve's job. I do wish the brother had shown himself as stronger and more resilient at the end - in a way, I identified with him a little bit - but in an odd way, I understand that he almost couldn't be any other way. I just think he's not going to be able to save the business unless he grows backbone, but that's irrelevant to the general plot, so not harmful to the book in any way.  I liked it. I only wish I had someone like Roarke in my life!
4	1369785600	As always the author does not let the reader down! True to the characters and In Death series! Definitely recommend!
4	1369785600	Held my interest long after I finished the novel. I read a great deal and this book was well worth my time. Captivating!
3	1369785600	I have been a huge Eve and Roarke fan since the start of the series and I loved the early books, but somehow, the most recent ones don't seem to be hitting the mark. Calculated in Death is one of the worst ones in the series. It feels as if Robb had a good idea that she just couldn't translate well into a coherent book. And the mention of Eve's battle with Cassandra (it took place in Loyalty in Death) in the book, only took me back to the time when the series was more gripping. I can go back a hundred times and read about Roarke hanging from the crown of the Statue of Liberty but I can't re read Calculated in Death. I am hoping the next one, Thankless In Death will redeem the series. I don't want to give up on Robb.
5	1369699200	I've read every one of J.D. Robb's Death series books.  She can't write them fast enough for me.  I love Eve Dallas and all the characters in these books.
5	1369699200	Always J.D.ROBB at her best. Been a fan of hers for many years. I highly recommend all of her work.
4	1369612800	Since I am already a fan, I enjoyed this very much.  There wasn't much in the way of revelation about either Eve or Roarke ; they are settling into marriage and continue to work together well.  All the usual characters combined to solve the murder.  Good job all around.If someone hasn't read one of this series before, I don't recommend starting with this one--you really need to know the backstory to appreciate the characters.  Read Naked in Death first.
5	1369612800	Once I started reading I could not put book down. Like how characters are evolving with each book. Cannot wait for next one.
5	1369526400	I am a huge fan of j.D Robb, been reading her books for years!!!! i cannot wait for the next one!
5	1369526400	Good read.  I wish I could just cut and paste my comments.  This is a pain I have like 200 more to do.  I feel like I am back in Jr. High doing book reports.
5	1369526400	True Dallas!  A page turner. I like the growth you see in Peabody and how the whole team is becoming more family.
5	1369440000	I'm addicted to the series.  I've read them all, and this one was just as entertaining as the others.  Looking forward to the next one.
4	1369440000	Characters are clearly described to create a visual image. Action is well portrayed. Relationships are also well described and easy to relate to.
4	1369440000	Maybe not her best but definitely an excellent read, with JD Robb you can always rely on familiar characters and settings that pull you right into the story.
4	1369440000	great as always.  can not wait for the next installment.  just wish she could write as quick as I read
4	1369440000	Eve Dallas always sees more than the obvious.  This time is no exception.  I like the way her dreams are being used to work out her crimes as well as her issues.
5	1369353600	What more do I need to say? I love the Series, JD Robb or (Nora Roberts) is a great writer. Reading a Series about the same characters is my Most Favorite way to read. And I received it even Quicker than expected! Being disabled, I enjoy being able to order a book online & having it delivered to my Door!! Thank you to Check It Books!!
5	1369353600	J D Robb has done it again ! I loved this book. It was a definite page turner. I couldn't wait to see what happens next.
5	1369267200	The whole J.D. Robb, &#34;In Death&#34; series is some of the most entertaining reading that I've read in years!  Love them!
5	1369267200	Can't wait for the next one to come out!!!  My friends and I keep trying to decide who should play Dallas and Roark in the movies.  These books would make great movies.  My favorite mysteries & characters!!!
5	1369267200	I always look forward to when J.D. Robb comes out with a new &#34;In Death&#34; book.  Intriguing and one really becomes attached to the characters.  I started reading these books years ago and they remain on the top of my list!
5	1369267200	I love all of J D Robbs &#34;death&#34; books.  I almost feel like I know all the characters.  Cannot wait for the next one.  My fear is that she will stop writing them some day.  They have a mix of mystery, and romance that no one else has.
5	1369180800	Will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Eve Dallas, Roarke, Peabody, and all the characters keep you  entertained as always.
5	1369180800	J.D. Robb once again keeps the delicious intensity of drama roiling throughout the entire book, the emotional and interpersonal relationship growth between the beloved characters somehow gets richer, she never once disappoints regarding the futuristic high-tech developments, and the suspense regarding solving the crimes seems even more elaborate and death-defying for Lt. Eve Dallas. J.D. Robb never disappoints!!! Five full stars for this one!
5	1369180800	I enjoyed this mystery.  The mounting tension throughout the book made it difficult to put down.  This is a good read.
5	1369180800	Ms. Roberts delivers once again in her Eve and Roarke series. I have all of them and she one of the few authors I won't trade off.
5	1369094400	I like anything J.D. Robb.  The characters and the atmosphere are vivid and so easy to follow.  Feels like you are there.
4	1369094400	I love my J.D Robb books, i was a little dissapointed i expected more murders. The book was good and funny always is, I am definetly looking forward to her next one. I read all In Death books while i was pregnant with my daughter and haven't stopped since.
5	1369094400	An excellent read. I love all her  &#34;In Death&#34; books. She is an awesome futuristic cop with a &#34;hot&#34; husband!
5	1369008000	I will read any any story written by Nora Roberts, whether she is writing as Nora Roberts or JD Robb. I have never been disappointed and am glad I read this one, too!
4	1369008000	Love her books and this one is no different.....however I'm waiting for the book where baby Belle has a deeper impact on Dallas and Roarke.
4	1369008000	J.D. Robb always engages my interest. I love the emotions, the character dynamics, and the fact that I can reread the story, even though these are mysteries and I know the results, I can still enjoy the trip, the relationships the assembly of the story. However, this story's ending was a bit anti-climatic. Fizzled a bit when I was hoping and expecting kick ass. I KNOW every story needs a unique ending, but it doesn't mean I can't feel somewhat let down.In addition with the preview that Eve would have to enter into Roark's world I was expecting her to have to shadow him a bit more and be a part of his meetings and work. Maybe since he engages himself in her's so much that it would be nice to see her being inserted into his.
5	1369008000	I always like the books with Lt. Dallas in them.  This was a good read and as always looking forward to her next book.
5	1368921600	I just love the characters in this series of books, especially Eve Dallas and Rourke.  Even the rest of the repeating characters are great.  They all have a particular part in the couple's lives and are present in all the books I have read so far.  I plan to eventually go back to the very beginning and read every one of them.
5	1368921600	The world of Eve Dallas and her multi-billionaire husband in the future is an awesome read.JD Robb (Nora Roberts) always entertains with her futuristic police procedural.  I find the characters believable and would love to meet them.
4	1368921600	This  book took a little time to get into but once I did I was hooked.  Love Nora Roberts/JD Robb!
5	1368835200	Needless to say I have read all the J.D. Robb death series so far and can't wait for another.  These books keep the same people and you feel you know them.  They are fast moving and very well done.  I love the marriage between Roarke and Dallas it has very different twists and turns but shows great love.  The book is great at holding your interest and I can't wait for the next in this series.  I just love everything about this book and highly recommend it.  You will just fall in love with the characters.
5	1368835200	J.D. Robb always sends out a great story, and this is no exception!  Action, plot twists, and seasoned with a healthy dash of humor.  A winner all the way.  I also love to see how the characters have evolved throughout the series.
5	1368835200	Once again Eve Dallas, along with Roarke and Peabody, takes death down. Fast paced, smooth flowing as all of the J. D. Robb(Nora Roberts) tales unfold. Another of the great stories that you hate to put down until the end.
5	1368748800	I have read all of the books in this series and always eagerly await the next one.  There is humor as well as a great cop mystery set in the future.
4	1368662400	This was a fast paced murder mystery with twists and turns. I enjoyed it, front to back.  I enjoy the Eve Dallas series and can't wait for the next.
5	1368662400	I have read the whole series and never tire of the storyline or characters. Way to go J.D. Robb. Keep it coming.
2	1368662400	Too much boring stuff about accounting and business and it just seemed repetitive. Not a plot that I cared anything about!
5	1368662400	Eve and Roarke have arrived at a point of perfect harmony...I'm looking forward to the next step in their relationship!
5	1368576000	great story as always, Dallas never fails and Roarke is as delectable as dark chocolate. I thoroughly enjoyed this story.
5	1368576000	Absolutely a great book. But all her Dallas books are great.  I love Dallas, roercke, mcnab and Peabody. And all the other characters.
4	1368576000	This one was an action filled book as a lot of the J.D. Robb books usually are and I was happy to see that trend continue. The writing was concise and fast paced.  It continues to surprise me how many ways there are to kill a person. It seems that some people don't go for the easy kills.The team work to get the case solved was written very well and the characters were developed. It is always interesting to see, how with each book, the characters get a bit more developed and back story to them. It makes them refreshing and they don't get boring :)It was nice to see Eve squirm in Tina's presence for her preparation for the screening. I love that no matter what situation Eve is in, she is still Eve and she doesn't get spoiled with it. Her character remains hers: uniqueThere wasn't too much in terms of what was happening with Eve and Roarke and that was a bit disappointing. However, there was enough to keep me satisfied until the next book comes out. If it is one thing I have learned, it is that with some books, there is just enough until the next book. While in others, once I read it once, it is so good that I have to re-read it again. :)
5	1368489600	I really enjoy how the continuing characters evolve both emotionally and in their relationships to each other over the course of each book. At the same time they stay true to the personalities already established in the previous books. You don't have to read the books I order but if you do, you will see the full picture of a possible future and how these people learn, grow, and change. The mystery in each book is intriguing so if you like to solve puzzles,you will enjoy any of this series.
5	1368489600	As always I am thrilled to read Eve's adventure and can't wait for the next one. It was a great story, fun all round.
5	1368489600	I love these books,I wish there was a succinct timeline though.i have read most but can't find the one where Summerset's daughter is involved
3	1368489600	Enjoyable read. Same standard as all the other &#34;in death&#34; books I have read.Novel could more appropriately been called &#34;Insufficiently calculated in death&#34;.
3	1368489600	The futuristic angle was a bit different.  I had already figured out whodunnit prior to her letting the cat out of the bag.  It kept me reading more out of curiousity.  It definitely was not one of her better books and I thought she moved around too much and left things hanging.
5	1368489600	As always the best read and hard to put down and sad when it is finished. But the best books always are the finest reads
5	1368489600	This was a great book as always following the adventures as Dallas solves yet another murder.  It was the first time I bought it on Kindle and loved it.  Used it on my i-Pad and it worked great with the Kindle app.  I highly recommend the book.
5	1368403200	I'm not sure why this book got so many bad reviews. I really liked it. As always it was great to spend time with Roark, Eve and all the cast. I did like the fact that time & space wasn't wasted on describing all the characters yet again. All the faithful fans know who they are & those picking up this series should start from book one and read forward so they will know. I have been a long time Nora Roberts fan and was not disappointed at all. Patiently waiting for the next one! Bring it on.
5	1368403200	Once again J.D. Robb nailed it. An excellent read and a must buy for J.D. Robb fans. Full of suspense, excitement, and of course romance.
5	1368403200	Love this author and all the books under this pen.Always looking forward to the latest Eve / Rourke saga's.
4	1368403200	I always zoom through the Dallas/Roarke books and this one was no exception.  Good read.  I am looking forward to the next one as soon as possible.
5	1368403200	I really enjoyed this installment in the Eve Dallas chronicles. One of my favorite parts is when she asks Roark something and he has an unusual reaction.The other is Eve's football catch.  Sorry, I don't want to give any parts of the story away. This book was a little  different than the others but I enjoyed it.  I think you will too.
4	1368403200	Having read all of the &#34;... In Death&#34; books, I found this book to be somewhat of a disappointment. The story line wanders around a bit and that makes it more difficult to follow. Besides the usual interaction parts related to Eve And Roark, the characters who are involved with the main theme are never clearly presented as what role they have in the story. To me the main plot wandered around too much. And when the third theme, (the movie that was done about the Dallas story), gets mixed in with the first two themes, the story lost its intensity  and for me, confusion was the result. Nevertheless, given how many truly good books she has written in her career, she is still my favorite author. My conclusion would be that ...&#34;ya can't be perfect all the time!&#34;
5	1368316800	I buy the &#34;..in Death&#34; books as soon as they come out.  I have never been disappointed. The relationship between the two main characters is what keeps me coming back.
4	1368230400	I love all jd robb. I always want to use the word  vid. Seems so appropriate,  need more of her
3	1368230400	Comfort in sameness...still fun to read. I'll keep buying them as long as they keep coming, enjoying that real coffee.
5	1368230400	I am in love with the in death series. This book was just another great addition. I can't wait for the next one to come out. I'll be very upset when she stops writing.
5	1368230400	I love all the JD Robb books.  This is just another great one in the series. Keep on writing and developing the love story between the Lt. and the &#34;criminal&#34;!
5	1368230400	My wife like this author and has ordered many books by  J. D. Robb and thinks they are great, thanks.
5	1368230400	I love this series!  JD Robb is wonderful and she hasn't written a bad book yet.  The Death series and the way she weaves the stories around Eve, Peabody, Roarke and the rest is amazing and addicting.
5	1368230400	Just love this series. Always waiting for the next to come out. I complete a book reading at one setting.
5	1368230400	JD Robb brings her A-Game once again! I love the cast she has created. I say cast because I get lost in the fantasy that plays in my head when reading an "In Death" book.
4	1368144000	Another reason to visit the old friends from the In Death series. I did not find this book to be as well plotted or exciting as most of the others. Didn't feel like there was much character growth either. All in all rather boring.
5	1368144000	As usual, Nora Roberts as J.D. Robb does it again and writes us a book that's creative, moving, uninterruptible, and full of our most favorite characters we've come to know with a very special fondness that only Nora Roberts can consistently create.  Of all the &#34;In Death&#34; books (and I've read them all) this is one of my favorites.  Nora Roberts is an enviable talent who provides us with the very best fictional entertainment, both in the J.D. Robb series, as well as her writings as herself.  She has never disappointed me and as an avid fiction reader, I confess I cannot say that about any other author (and I read many).
5	1368144000	Yes, she is Nora Roberts in disguise, but this series of books is SO fabulous!  I will read them as long as she writes them.  I find myself unable to put it down, and can read one in 2 days, but then I end up waiting impatiently until she writes the next one.  Following Eve and Roarke's life is gripping.
5	1368144000	I loved ALL of J. D. Robb's death series. Have shared my hard back books with friends, most ofHer novels I have on my Kindle.
5	1368144000	Another wonderful thriller.  I count on JD to give me mystery and to have a good plot to go with it.  Love Love Love her writing.
5	1368144000	Det Dallas is a awesome character and her personal development and growing ability to trust others is great to follow. A really good redemption story, especially the relationship between she and Roarke. I've read the entire series at least 3 times.
5	1368144000	I love all the In Death books and as soon as I see one available I download it to my Kindle.
4	1368144000	I enjoyed this novel, as I have enjoyed all of the Eve/Roarke series.  If you follow this series, or even want to read the novel as a one-off, it is worthwhile.
5	1368144000	Have all her books, but missed this one through my book club. If you are a JD Robb fan you don't want to miss any of her books.
4	1368144000	I love the technology they use to solve the crimes.  Like all the characters and enjoy how they work together.  Have read them all and am rarely disappointed.
5	1368144000	I really love the different writing of J.D. Robb.  I like the futuristic twist in these books and I really think they would make great movies!  I would highly recommend J.D. Robb books to anyone who likes mystery and romance all in one!!
5	1368057600	I love these characters and cannot wait for the next installment.  I wish that &#34;Naked In Death&#34;, the first would be put on the screen.  I can even see the people who would play the parts.  Christian Bale would make a fabulous Roarke and Charlize Theron would make a great Eve Dallas.  Have read everything Nora Roberts has written with the exception of the newest one which I haven't yet acquired.  Teri Ferguson
5	1368057600	Once I start reading an In Death book everything else just doesn't matter except for feeding my Labs. The story pulls me in, I feel like I'm right there for every step. Driving home from  Destin FL. I saw a young women sitting up on her balcony reading the hard covered edition of this. This story line with such wonderful characters will always deserve 5*
3	1367884800	Person murdered, crime solved.  I could have easily skipped this one in the series.  I was bored; nothing unusual about this story.
3	1367798400	Thirty-sixth in the In Death romantic suspense series revolving around Eve Dallas, a lieutenant on the NYPSD, and her hunky billionaire husband, Roarke.My TakeI'm bummed again. There wasn't as much Roarke, almost no Summerset, very little of her coworkers, her friends are mostly a cameo, and the premiere was a bust. Yup, barely anything about The Icove Case premiere, and I was so looking forward to all the pre-premiere activity with Eve getting ambushed by her friends, more snark about her dress and the jewels and the...you know...what we've become accustomed to In Death.Bits of fun with Dallas and Peabody's exchanges...although there didn't seem as many of those. It's pretty much the same `ol, same `ol with Roarke's help on the computers.I did enjoy Roarke's comment, I mean, who knew Roarke could ever get this comfortable in a cop shop...:"I'll be playing with my friends."That said, it was so sad with one man too selfish to consider how his actions affect others. The trauma and loss he inflicts. It is an amazing bit of detective work. I can never figure it out, and I'm always amazed by how she gets there.The StoryIt's a conundrum from the start with political considerations--having a judge for a relative always raises questions.A greedy selfish man thinks nothing of having people killed because they'e become inconvenient--they may discover what he's up to.The CharactersLieutenant Eve Dallas is one of the best of New York City's police. A homicide cop married to one of the world's richest men...and the most gorgeous...Roarke. A very supportive and understanding husband who does what he can to protect her, as well as play with her friends. Galahad is their fat, fussy cat. Summerset is Roarke's factotum with his own private war with Eve.Detective Delia Peabody is Dallas' partner and friend who gets a chance at some undercover work. McNab is a very colorful EDD cop and Peabody's significant other. Morris is the chief medical examiner requested specially. Captain Feeney heads up EDD and has a cameo. The detectives in Dallas's department include Baxter and Trueheart, Jenkinson and Reineke, and Carmichael and Sanchez. Yancey is still their sketch artist. Commander Jack Whitney is her superior. Officer Turney is first on-scene at the first murder.Dickie Berenski is the chief lab tech and very good at his job. When he can be bribed into doing it. Not a friend. Harpo is brilliant with fibers. Dr. Mira is a psychiatrist and another of Dallas' friends. And still force-feeding Dallas herbal teas! Dennis Mira is her sweetheart of a husband. Reo is a prosecutor who works with Eve frequently.Nadine Furst is the top reporter for Channel 75 and the author of the book on the Icove case (see Origin in Death, 21) which will premiere in this story (at last!). Eve makes scant use of her. Mavis, Bella, and Leonardo are more of a cameo in this.Bradley Whitestone is one of three partners in a financial group, The WIN Group. Jake Ingersol and Rob Newton are the other two. Jasper Milk owns the contracting firm where the first body was found. Sasha Kirby of City Style is the designer. Her partners include Angie Carabelli, Holly, Clare, and Latisha Vance.Alva Moonie is a former society girl who has settled down. Cicily "Sissy" Morgan is her housekeeper...and saviour.Marta Dickenson, an accountant specializing in audits, is married to a judge's brother, Denzel Dickenson. Judge Gennifer Yung is Denzel's sister. Doctor Daniel Yung is her husband. Sly Gibbons is Marta's boss. Jim Arnold and Chaz Parzarri are accountants who were in an accident in Vegas. Lorraine Wilkie is another accountant. Josie Oslo was Marta's assistant.Candida Mobsley is a high society idiot whose trust fund Marta was auditing. Aston is the assistant trying to keep a rein on her mouth; Tony Greenblatt is her personal finance manager.Stuart Brewer is a senior partner of Brewer, Kyle, and Martini, and he agrees with McNab. Tuva Gunnarsson is Young-Sachs' administrative assistant. Carter Young-Sachs has the title of chief financial officer. Ty Biden is the slightly sociopathic one. Sterling Alexander, a very self-officious blowhard, and the self-effacing Thomas Pope are half-brothers--although you wouldn't think it to look at them or listen to them--in the real estate business. Clinton Roscoe Frye does security work and played semi-pro football. Not a particularly bright man.Brandy Dyson is Carter's ex, and man, can she dish the dirt! I like her. Chuckie`s the one who became a momentary football. Mormon and Drumbowski were the ambulance attendants who got "replaced". Milo "the Mole" Easton is a famous hacker.Marlo and Matthew from Celebrity in Death, 34, pop in with Julian Cross and Mason Roundtree.
4	1367712000	I enjoy reading the J.D. Robb series of adventures simply because they are a quick read with some interesting turns and twists.  Yes, they are often very similar but hey, so if life.
5	1367712000	i love this book jd robb never disappoints .  i couldn't put it down until i finished it.. can't wait for the next book way to go
5	1367712000	I love to read anything by Nora Roberts. You feel like you are there with the characters. The descriptions are so vivid you live the story. LOVE IT!
5	1367712000	I have read all 36 books and can't wait for the next book to see how Eve Dallas works her magic.
2	1367625600	No spark, too much tech, not enough of anything!!! I had to make myself finish it. Very disappointed .But, just cannot stop reading them.
5	1367625600	J.D. Robb has done it again.  Lt. Eve and Roark are at their best, and he is doing a great job of taking care of her.  If you like her other books, you will love this one
4	1367625600	I always enjoy these books. They are fun to read about the future. I have read all of the books by Robb. They are about a mystery and the love life the police and a rich man.
5	1367625600	Another good book in the death series!  As always, I can't wait for the next in the series to come out.
5	1367625600	J. D. Robb's style of writing keeps you wanting more even after you have finished the book. Her characters are strong and human. I recommend her books to anyone who enjoys suspenseful, delightful and entertaining novels.
5	1367539200	I have been hooked on the &#34;In Death&#34; series since they first came out.  I read them slowly because I know it will be awhile until the next one!
5	1367452800	I could not put it down, read it in two days!  This  was one of her better books and I like all of them!.
3	1367452800	I enjoy the J.D. Robb books, but this one felt rather dull and phoned in.  They had the requisite little moments, but really, it was a ho hum addition to a fun series.
5	1367452800	This series of books is my all time favorite. I have read every one of these. I never can wait until the next one comes out.
5	1367452800	I started the Death Series after accidentally reading one of the more recent books.  Now I buy them for my kindle when I am unable to get them from the library.
5	1367452800	Awesome book, I look forward to seeing that J.D. Robb is coming out with a new book. Just wishing to see Eve become pregnet
5	1367366400	Always like these books as they are a bit edgy - with a look into the future. Recommend for those who like a mystery with a different angle.
5	1367366400	Being a J. D. Robb reader and having read everyone of her books, I found this a good read.  I recommend CALCULATED IN DEATH.
5	1367366400	I love the &#34;In Death&#34; series, and this one wasn't a disappointment.I love Eve and Roarke, and I love Peabody and McNab, and the rest of the crew.Like the others who reviewed though, I see changes, possibly a promotion coming for Eve. There was a lot of focus on how well she did her job, and others getting promoted in this book. Maybe, I think!
5	1367366400	At first this book seem to start off slow.  Not like normal. Not like the typical JD Robb books.  I am playing this again in hopes that I can pick up on a few things that I might have missed.I loved the book, but this could have been better.
4	1367366400	I read the reviews before reading this and I usually never do that.  Nora Roberts aka J.D. Robb writes ALOT!  So when people expect EVERY book to be even better than the last, they get upset if it's not.  This wasn't a home run book in this series.  The people are a little stale.  I'd like to see the next step for Roarke and Eve.  Surprise pregnancy anyone?  That'd be some funny stuff!  I hate to say it...but the stories I've liked the best is when one of the characters we know and love are in danger.  (Demented mind here I know) Still.. it's a J.D. Robb book, which means for me it's a must read.  It was good, just not her best.  Bring on the next one!
5	1367366400	I try to read everything written under J.D.Robb.  Can't get enough. Don't recall any blantant typos in this book like I have on almost all the other kindle books I've read.
1	1367280000	I found this book boring.  The plot was very weak, as the criminals were all stupid and made mistakes that were so basic that Barney Fife could have caught them. The book takes place a few years in the future and I could not figure out what that added to the plot. Even though I like science fiction,it took away from the plot for me.  It made the story less immediate and less real. I came fairly close to finishing the book, but the plot was not believable and the story so tedious and unimaginative that I gave up at 77%.  I have not had the urge to go back and finish it.
5	1367280000	I love Eve Dallas.....she makes the ride worthwhile...mystery and romance all in one great book..wish they would turn them into movies...
5	1367193600	ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK AND HAVE GIVEN THEM TO MY DAUGHTER FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER TO READ SOMEDAY AND REMEMBER HER GRANDMA.
4	1367193600	As always JD Robb delivers a great story. For Nora Roberts and JD Robb Fans, this was a good read. The story flowed smoothly and great characters.SAE
4	1367193600	Reliable and enjoyable addition to the series. Looking forward to the next installment. Good choice for Kindle as it is a story that travels well.
3	1367193600	Not the best Robb, not the worst. Didn't finish in one night, but definitely readable. The series is just getting a little tired, predictable.
5	1367193600	This was exciting and romantic at the same time, always enjoy the chase. It is like getting together with old friends.
5	1367193600	I have read all 41 In Death books and have loved everyone of them. I highly recommend them to anyone. Dallas is a strong female character that you can't help but like.
5	1367193600	as always a great read, I have this entire collection and am always looking forward to the latest in the series
5	1367107200	This book continues the story of murder with Dallas and Peabody handling things in their normal tough way. These stories never bore me and I wait for the next book to come out!
5	1367107200	I like when Nora Roberts writes as JD Robb. There is always lots of good 'meat' to the story. I would recommend this series to anyone that likes a strong storyline.
3	1367107200	I thought the book was too heavy on police procedure. Too many words that finally got to a point of interest.I would recommend with reservation.
4	1367107200	Love her books, but this one was slow to catch me. An innocent accountant gets killed and pulls Eve, Peabody, and the rest of the crew into a world of the lazy, rich, company heads, financial fraud, and killing.
5	1367107200	I love the characters of Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke. Each of Nora's novels give you another insight into them and their lave story all entwined in a murder mystery. The two characters grow with each story as all of us develop with our life experiences.. But Eve and Roarke do it in a very dynamic way. I try and extend my read of these novels out but I always get captured and usually finish them in 2 to 3 days.
5	1367107200	As usual J. D. Robb did not disappoint. I'm hooked on her &#34;In Death Series&#34; and as soon as her books come out, I get them and read them. Love that  Lt. Dallas and her hubby work together on cases,especially when she needs his tech expertise.
5	1367107200	Great book! I like the way you immerse yourself on different topics! Love it!!!!!!!!!! The first one involving Roake world!
5	1367107200	all ways  waite for next book.  Her books always keep me guessing  up to the very last of the story as to the kiler realy is.
5	1367020800	I am amazed at how the characters in this series develop and maintain consistency. This is an excellent addition and keeps your interest.
5	1367020800	I will always buy J.D. Robb.  Can't wait till she makes Captain; gets pregnant; and Ian & Peabody get married.
5	1367020800	my favorite cop book from the future.  look like it might be where we will be in 20 years sadly
5	1367020800	I think I havee read the entire series and this one is one of the best.  A quick read and I can't wait for the next book.
5	1367020800	I love all the &#34;In Death&#34; books. This book has one of those plots that really causes a sense of disgust at the way some people (both fictional and in real life) can be so cold-hearted and self-centered. I enjoyed it very much.
5	1367020800	Another awesome read from JD Robb. Exciting, twisty suspense for Eve Dallas and crew. A true page turner. Well written, with wit and humor which are the hallmarks of Nora Roberts' books!
5	1367020800	Although this book didn't have the twists I have come to expect with Dallas, I did thoroughly enjoy the book!!  This is a continuation of the Rourke and Eve love story mixed with the most excellent murder mystery that keeps me coming back for more!!I did start back at the beginning by reading Naked in Death, and it hooked me all over again!!  This is the second time I have read the series, and the first time I have read them back to back.  O.M.G!  I love this story line!!Nora, keep it up!!
4	1367020800	Love all J.D. Robb books.  The futuristic detective is always a great read.  Can't wait for the next one, hope it's soon.
5	1366934400	I always love reading about Dallas & Roarke.. I will be looking for the next one. We need one with Roarke as the main character for a change. Like when he found his Aunts. How about it? I hope I don't have to wait long for the next one..
5	1366848000	This book is very enjoyable. Amazing how she can blend mystery with just enough humor to keep you truly interested. So dark at times and so lighthearted at others. One of her best.
3	1366848000	I have read all her books, but this book is not up to par. I still pick up and read her first few, and I still enjoy them very much, always like a first time. All other books have a good plot, twist and turn, but this book doesn't have that rush.I hope her future books have lot of mysteries, and all the old characters. Without those, this book is very dull and life less.She is one of my favourite author, and this book is not like her first few books in "In Death Series."
5	1366848000	I always enjoy the story.  The futuristic setting is a kick.  But I think I really read the series to see how Eve and Roark are evolving.  Relationships are well done for all the ongoing characters which makes for cohesiveness in the series.  Calculated in Death had a richly developed plot which kept me hopping to keep up.  Still there was plenty of time to keep the reader (me) aware of what was going on in the ongoing characters lives.
5	1366848000	Another great book in the &#34;In Death&#34; Series. I love her books and they just get better with each one. You can start from any place with her novels but it is best to start at the beginning.
5	1366848000	I am hooked on this series. I am reading as much to see if I can figure out who the bad guy is before Lt. Dallas as I am to see how all the other characters are evolving.  Can't wait for the next one to see if Truehart passes the Detectives exam!
5	1366848000	Can an &#34;In Death&#34; be anything but spell-binding? Of course not! Don't start it until you won't be interrupted cause it's GREAT!
5	1366848000	The series members have become part of the family. I can't wait to see what happens next.There was always another book readily available for me to pick up and continue reading.What an excellent writer!
1	1366848000	I like mysteries, and I like NYC-based stories, as that is where I live.  This book, set in the future for no apparent reason, is boring.  It lacks suspense. Has no twists.  Is filled with unnecessary details.  Has so many characters it is impossible to keep track of all of them.  And the ones I can remember don't ring true.  I have not ready any of the other books in the series, and having read this one, I won't be reading any more.  A big waste of time!
5	1366848000	I like this book.  It is an easy read. I didn't experience any slow parts.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read JD Robb.
2	1366848000	Was this book really written by J.D.Robb?  Something was missing. The characters names were the same but they were not the characters I know.  This is the first J. D. Robb book I did not care for.
5	1366848000	As always Nora takes you into the world of Eve Dallas, and you never want to leave. The only part you will hate is waiting for the next book to come out. I have yet to to dislike a Death Series Book. I hope to read Eve becoming a mother one day soon. Oh what fun that would be.
5	1366761600	I have a copy of EVERY J. D. Robb's books.  These books are always different and fresh and I have &#34;grown&#34; with all of these characters. You dont have to read them in order but it helps because you can see how far Eve has come with her life and the great guy she met who helps her along the way.  My favorite was &#34;new york to dallas&#34; and  &#34;survivor in death&#34;.  If you love futuristic books and great characters I recommend all of these books.
5	1366761600	I always look forward to a new installment of Dallas, Roarke, Peabody et.al. and this one did not disappoint - but then - they rarely do. And once you have started on this series you just HAVE to know what happens next. So - already looking forward to the next.
5	1366761600	As usual I'm NOT disappointed by this book. Can never get enough of her books an can't wait til the next one comes out
5	1366761600	I love all JD Robb books and can not waite until the next one come out my granddaughter gave me my first JD robb book and have been reading her eversince. I tell all my friends about her.
5	1366761600	You can't go wrong with a Dallas and Roarke book.....JD Robb has another hit on her hands....love  allthe interplay between the characters.
4	1366675200	This read quickly, I save the &#34;In Death&#34; and all other Nora's books for vacation and sick day reads because I know I won't put them down till I am done. I enjoyed revisiting the characters in a new book but the plot left me a bit lukewarm. Still it was Nora's clever writing and even at her worst that's pretty good. I love the series - this was good but not the best of the series.
4	1366588800	My only problem with this book was the anti-climatic ending.Could have had much more action but it did resolve logically.
2	1366588800	I am a fan of this series. The interactions between Eve and Peabody, her relationship with Roarke, and the interesting minor characters in the investigation are what make the books fun to read.Not so with this book.  Pages of dull characters, no funny moments.  Even the crime itself is uninteresting:  an accountant is murdered to cover up some shady financial crimes.  The details of the fraud are vague, and the investigation sounds like pages and pages of the same information, with characters who all sort of swirl together.  Roarke discovers almost right away who did it.  No suspense, no twist.Even the parts about Eve's relationships with others are kind of cut short.  Her character is what keeps the books interesting, but this was like a book with a head cold:  everything was kind of dull and blunted and moving in slow motion.  Even the climax of the book was unexciting, and she never even described the takedown of the mastermind behind the plan.I kept reading, waiting for the good part, but it just never came.  Nora Roberts can definitely write, which is why the book got more than one star.  But this was not her best.
5	1366588800	Outstanding!  All the usual mystique, cunning, sexual allure and interpersonal play that has become Roarke and Eve.  I just love each reading!
5	1366588800	Interesting plot, creative crimes. It moves the continuing story along. I'd really like to meet Roake. I love this series.
3	1366588800	I bought the first JB Robb book (Naked in Death) when it was published in 1995 and have bought every book in the series since then as soon as it hit the bookstands.  At best, this book was "ho-hum".  There was very little excitement, the murder case was boring and the interaction between Eve and Roarke has turned into a mellow-married couple (which I guess is reality).  Peabody was just Peabody and the other characters were non-descript.  It wasn't a horrible book - it just didn't have any "I can't put this book down" moments.  In fact, I put it down so often it took me almost a week to read it - which is very unusual for me!  I thought after almost 20 years of reading this series, I was starting to get jaded.  So, I went back and re-read Naked in Death and Glory in Death (Books #1 and #2) and what a difference!  Those had the much loved sarcasm, excitement and gripping murder cases.  Hopefully, the next book in this series will give us the "yippee" moments again because this one certainly didn't.
5	1366588800	I very much enjoy the characters in all the Eve Dallas books.  The plots are well thought out and I never can figure who did it until the end
5	1366588800	J. D. Robb's portrayal of the characters throughout the &#34;In Death&#34; series just keeps getting better. The story lines are interesting but it's the character growth that I love.Keep them coming J.D., please.
4	1366588800	Not the best in the series but a good read . . . a little bit too wordy in explaining how the banking world works - more Roarke than Eve . . . but always good!
5	1366502400	I just love Dallas and all the other characters. I can't wait for the next book. I wish Nora Roberts could write faster.
3	1366502400	Book was overall pretty good but would have been better with more interaction with the rest of the cast in the series such as Mavis, Mira, McNab, and Feeney. Otherwise it was a good story and a nice book.
5	1366502400	have enjoyed all of her books that i have read.So has all of my friends. good, good, books for all to read.
5	1366502400	I love the Eve Dallas series. I can't wait for the next one to come out. Eve and Roarke are great characters. I love the way these two compliment each other. I have read the entire series once and many of the books a second time. Keep writing.
5	1366502400	Even though there are over 30 books in her "In Death" series, each one is fresh and different and riveting.
5	1366502400	JD Robb always writes excellent books. I have read all of them. She never disappoints. I am eager to read her additional ones to come.
5	1366502400	JD Robb can not write these books fasr enough for me.  I love the futuristic theme but also love the simple interaction between Dallas and Roarke!!!!!
3	1366502400	I'm a long time fan of the 'In Death' series. However this book bored me so much I never finished it. Where as in the pass, I used to pre-order the new books and read the whole book on the day I get it.
5	1366502400	As always i loved it. I was worried when i read the reviews but im glad i read it, nora never disappoints me!
4	1366416000	Always a good read.. Good airplane book. J.D. Robb weaves an interesting assortment of characters into her stories but keeps the favorites true to form.
3	1366416000	I honestly can't think of what the story was about. I really like all the Eve Dallas books, but right now, this one escapes me.  I can't say anything bad or good because I don't even remember reading it.  I know the murder victim was an accountant and that's it.  I hope future Eve Dallas books go back to being &#34;page turners&#34;, but this one didn't do it for me.
3	1366416000	It has some satisfactory interludes of Eve & Roark, as well as sustaining moments with all our stable of cop characters.  However, I found the ending unsatisfying since the author if not the executor of the murders is never brought into focus through a final grueling interview at cop central so that his full horror of &#34;calculated&#34; cruelty can be explored and understood.  Even though I have read and reread the In Death series, and can qualify as a devoted fan, I have to admit that this installment leaves the reader hanging a bit at the end.
5	1366329600	Her stories are always entertaining and exciting.  Her interactions with her fellow officers and her husband are very very interesting.
5	1366329600	WELL WRITTENgood story line, good character and she is a favorite .have read all her books and enjoyed them all
5	1366329600	Eve and Roarke are still the most fascinating couple in mysteries. So afraid of the day when Nora retires and there are no more Eve Dallas adventures!
4	1366329600	I've read all of JDRobb's books and this one is just as good as the others.  Looking forward to more.
5	1366329600	I enjoyed reading this book.  As is typical with the majority of this author's novels, the story is engaging from start to finish. There was only one disappointment for me as I read the book, and it relates to the &#34;Vid&#34; Premiere. I will not share my specific thoughts because I do not want to give away the ending.  As always, the portrayal of the loving and protective relationship between the lieutenant and her husband, Roarke, is one of the highlights of the book
5	1366329600	absolutely love Jd Robb. This book was fantastic. Would recommend it to all. Can not wait for more of the series
4	1366243200	Interesting story with twists. Kindle version was a bit difficult to try to go back and re-read character descriptions. I always need to refresh my memory because there are so many suspects.
2	1366243200	I found the book ponderous - had to turn a lot of pages before anything happened. Don't think I'll read  anymore Robb books.
5	1366243200	I own the whole series. Love it. Great writer. I lose myself all the time in this writers work. GREAT
5	1366243200	I love all the JD Robb books from the first though the last I will continue to read them. all.
5	1366243200	All of J.D. Robb's In Death Series are excellent.  I have read them all and always look forward to the next one.  You are normally surprised at 'Who Dun It'!
5	1366243200	Wonderful book, such a quick read, hate it when I get to end, because I have to wait until her next book.....
5	1366156800	Another great read from J D Robb. I enjoyed this story as much as all the other Eve DALLAS books. So much so that I read it from beginning to end in one session.
5	1366156800	Always a great read. Love Dallas and Rourke!  All the friends are a kick to catch up on.  I enjoy the stories and times of  the NYPSD.
5	1366156800	Always a pleasure to read another Eve Dallas mystery..JD Robb never disappoints.....looking for the next book. Already anticipating a good read. Thanks!
4	1366156800	Great read.  Love J D Robb and her in death series.  Don't know how she keeps the plots fresh but I love them.
5	1366156800	Once again, I've enjoyed another in the &#34;In Death&#34; series.  The only issue I've ever had with these books is that I have to wait too long for the next one to come out.  However, the waiting is worth it as I always find these books entertaining and appealing.
5	1366156800	The book is fast-paced, with just the right amount of wit, sarcasm, and the good-'ol dynamics of everyone. It took me sometime to get the title of the book though *wink*
4	1366156800	Nice, simple detectives story in the city of New York. Very easy reading.Too straight forward, fully expected, too little drama or suspense.
5	1366156800	Another great in death by JD Robb.  Land deals gone bad, fraud and murder are included in this Eve Dallas book.
5	1366156800	I have never read a J.D. Robb that wasn;t good, always my favorites, a very good writer.  Her books make you want to keep reading to find out how the story ends,
5	1366156800	Loved this book and I have read every book in this series by JD Robb/ Nora Roberts. I would recommend this book to any one who likes a mystery. It is set in the future, so it is interesting to see the gadgets we might have in the future.
5	1366156800	Keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns of this great story to read
5	1366156800	I have enjoyed reading all of the J.D. Robb books with Dallas as the main charter, especially married to the beefy Irishman!!  Woo Hoo!!
5	1366156800	I love the In Death series of J.D. Robb. they are very well written and so exciting it is hard to put down.
3	1366156800	Not as interesting as previous ones in series. The ending was an afterthought. Hope the next is better than this.
5	1366156800	J.D. Robb delivers with her latest in the series. She never fails to include humor, reflection, and romance in her characters while maintaining the flow of the plot. Great book.
5	1366156800	It's an easy fun read that follows all the other &#34;in death&#34; novel. Great characters that continue to keep one's interest.
4	1366070400	Ponzi  scheme gone wild, Eve Dallas rocks, as usual! Hard to put book down in the end. As most of the Eve Dallas series this is a must read.
5	1366070400	Her books always keep me glued to them. I can't get enough of Eve and Roake. They are by far the most interesting couple I have ever read about.
5	1366070400	J.D.Robb never disappoints me. Good story with all the main characters included even the cat. Always romancing with Roarke  and funny interactions with Summerset and Peabody. Never tired of this series.
3	1366070400	The first four books of the series are the best. I like how they keep adding ppl to their lifeNora Roberts / nd Robb are the best
5	1365984000	Like all of the IN Death books it was great, I have read the complete series and like all of them
5	1365984000	have followed since the beginning and this is another in a great series with all the same cast and easy to follow
4	1365984000	I've read just about every story JD Robb has written about Lt. Eve Dallas.  This wasn't the best story in the series but I will still buy her next book
5	1365984000	J.D. Robb's &#34;Death&#34; series always seems to be top of the line reading, and this latest book of the series is certainly no exception!  I've read every one of these books, and I haven't been disappointed.This latest endeavor is actually one of her best yet.  I've always found the workings of Eve Dallas's mind fascinating, and especially like that the main character, Eve Dallas, is portrayed as a strong, gutsy woman doing a difficult job successfully.  This book held my interest right from the start, and also seemed to be more intricate in its workings than some of the others.  I love a book that makes me think, and this one did.Of course, part of the fascination of this series is the love between Eve and Roarke.  Happily, that's as strong as ever, and the characters of Sommerset, friend and major domo, and the cat, Galahad, always add some comic relief!I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery and an entertaining read!  Keep writing these J.D.Robb (Nora Roberts)!You keep on writing, and we'll keep on reading!
4	1365984000	I liked it but it wasn't as suspenseful as other Eve Dallas books.  I am sure it is difficult to maintain a high level in all books.
5	1365984000	As always J.D. Robb gives us a great read, yes all of her books contain the love of Roarke, Peabody and the whole crew. But it's the murder the who done it, it's the future, without the Jetson`s .  I would love for her shake it up a bit, Maybe Eve getting pregnant wow that would make her and Roarke crazy as murder continues in NY.  Let Peabody shine  allow her to do the work as she consults with Eve ,because being parents will be crazy for the whole cast in the books, but Eve and Roake will be a true hoot.  As always  a great read.  So I will b waiting for the next.l
3	1365984000	I love this series and bought this one expecting the usual high standard. This one was a bit disappointing probably because less Eve-Roarke action and teamwork. Also missed the other characters like Summerset and Mavis who only appear very briefly in this book and who usually add comic relief.
5	1365984000	We have the entire series of  J.D. Robb's &#34;In Death&#34; series audio books.  Both my husband and I enjoy listening to them when we drive to work or are travelling.  It makes the ride go by faster.  What's not to like about Lt. Eve Dallas, Rourke and the entire NYPSD team and friends / family?  There is crime, love, mystery, humor -- very entertaining. The series begins in the year 2058 and spans over a couple of years.  It is best to listen (or read) the entire series in order but each book can also be enjoyed as a stand alone book.  I hope J.D. keeps writing this series.  We don't want it to end!
4	1365897600	I really enjoy this series, and Calculated did not disappoint. It was not the most riveting book in the series and seemed to be shorter, but was still great.
5	1365897600	Great story line, not to much graphic sex and story flows well. Always enjoy this author regardless of which genre she writes.
5	1365897600	As with all the In Death books, I truly loved it. Can't wait for the next one.All the characters are just great. This author is fantastic.
5	1365897600	Eeve Dallas, Roarke, and the gang ROCK as usual! I always enjoy J.D. Robb books and own all of them
5	1365897600	Loved the book. We get to see eve develop her soft side. It's like I get to know her a little more each time
5	1365897600	Fast paced, holds your interest.  Didn't want to put it down.  J. D. Robb is one of my favorite authors.
5	1365811200	I have enjoyed every one of J.D.Robbs (aka Nora Roberts) books.  They are fun, semi-science fiction, and they have always held my interest.  I look forward to each new story about Eve Dallas, Rourke, and the ever faithful Peabody.  I also like how Eve is becoming a little softer in her relationship with her friends - like she's becoming more of a complete person.  I know somewhere there has been mention of a TV series, but I don't think I'd watch it because they could never find the real actors who could be &#34;them&#34; and all the other wonderful characters I've come to consider personal acquaintances!  (Besides, I have seen how they messed up with Bones, but that's another review of a different genre.
5	1365811200	Nora Roberts never fails no matter what name she's writing under! If you haven't read her In Death series, you're missing out! Get Naked In Death and get ready for a roller coaster ride!
5	1365811200	Fans of this series will be really happy with this latest installment in the series. It has all the elements that we've come to expect and love about Lt. Eve Dallas and those in her futuristic world. There's the ongoing romance with her mega rich and gorgeous husband, the witty and hilarious rapport with her steady but delightful partner, Peabody, and a case with a slate of suspects that's awfully fun to watch Dallas unravel. Many of the other characters we enjoy are part of the story in meaningful ways and this one ranks in my top ten in the series.The highlight for me is the return of the partnership of Eve and Peabody. Their snappy and pithy dialogue comprise some of the best moments in the book. While I enjoy it when Roarke is part of the investigation, I much prefer it when he's secondary to Peabody in the nuts and bolts detective work. She has a really great moment in helping to solve the case near the end of the story that you don't want to miss.There's a huge cast and it's sometimes hard to keep up with them until you get further along in the series. While the mystery isn't the most chilling, the events leading up to the climax are pretty intriguing. I really liked the dynamics between the characters and, of course, the time in Interview. I enjoyed this book and felt like I was back in the familiar.
4	1365811200	Enjoyed the book even if it is similar to her other books. I had stopped reading these books because of that but when I read this one I remembered how much I like them
5	1365811200	J D Robb is another one of my favorite authors. I read both her Sci-fi books and regular books. This latest one was a good read and I enjoyed it very much.
5	1365811200	Always writes a great book.  Love the characters and am always sad when I finish the book.  Can't wait for the next one.
5	1365811200	Never boring, JD Robb (Nora Roberts) always seems to give the reader another excellent story and I often will go without something new to wear for her new book in hardcover.  If you want great reading entertainment, READ THIS BOOK!
4	1365811200	Yay... another J. D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) novel... Calculated In Death. This time, Dallas is tagged on a woman's death that looks to be a mugging gone bad. Her body is found on the street at the base of a set of stairs leading up to a building in the midst of remodeling. But Dallas and Peabody find evidence that she was actually killed inside, and the street scene was staged as a diversion. Further investigation reveals that in her job as an auditor, she had just been given three new cases due to an accident with the original auditor. Dallas wonders if perhaps she was killed to cover up fraudulent activity that an audit would reveal. Roarke finds proof of the cover-up, and a couple more deaths related to the audits confirms that Dallas is on the right track. But she needs to figure out who is calling the shots before she becomes the final victim.Calculated started off slower than I'm used to for an In Death novel. In fact, I was thinking this might be the first non-five star review for a Robb novel I've had. The pace picks up as the story moves on, and by the end it's back on track for the type of writing I've come to expect from Roberts. I like how she's taking some of the edges off of Dallas via her relationship with Roarke, but not so much that she loses the essence of what makes her who she is.When there are 36 titles in a series, it's not a surprise that one or two don't quite work as well as the rest. Actually, I'm more surprised that Roberts has been able to keep the quality so high for so long. Calculated In Death may not have been one of my favorites, but it's nowhere close to making me reconsider my priorities in wanting to read every new installment as soon as it's available. In fact, I'm already waiting for Thankless In Death due in September. :)Disclosure:Obtained From: LibraryPayment: Borrowed
4	1365724800	I love this series and its characters. However, this one seemed a little light on character development. Enjoyed it anyway and will read the net one too - this one felt like the lull before the storm. Hopefully, the next one will be a dramatic storm.
5	1365724800	Excellent book added to an excellent series.  Each and every book is always a good re-read.  Looking forward to the next one!
5	1365724800	A typical J D Robb mystery. Murder mystery and twists and turns. All the characters live up to their reputation  An enjoyable read that J D Robb's fans will devour.
5	1365724800	Another wonderful J. D. Robb book.  I just love Eve and Roark and the other characters in these books.  Can't put it down.
4	1365724800	From Love Romances & More Reviews4 HeartsWhen you have thirty-six novels in a series, you would think the stories coming would be dull and pretty half-heartedly done but that is not the case with J.D. Robb's latest installment in the critically acclaimed In Death series. This time Lieutenant Eve Dallas has to solve a murder that is just the tip of an iceberg especially when she has to wade through the world of corporate finances and rich family money. This is a master storyteller at work when ever you open one of the In Death books. I always enjoy this author's stories in the series and CALCULATED IN DEATH was no exception. The story starts off slow so be warned it takes a bit of time for the real meat of the story to get there. Stay with it and you will find yourself glued to the pages before long, like I did. I couldn't put the book down; even to sleep a few nights as I needed to see what happens next. This series is like eating just one potato chip. You can't have just one, you need to eat more and that is no exception for this one. This is an author who knows her world, her characters and the story lines are always so intriguing that the reader never gets bored by them all.CALCULATED IN DEATH is a wild ride from start to finish and I wanted to read more after that last page was turned. The world building in this series is amazing. I am actually in awe of the author for keeping all the details together and the reader gets to see Eve slightly out of her depth in the world her husband lives and breathes. The way these characters grow, it is a joy to see. Each book, the reader sees a new dynamic or strength in the bond between them, either with Eve and Roarke personally or with their friends and co-workers. This is an author who lets her characters shine and shine they do. Ms. Robb has a wonderful way of engaging her readers with her books and you can't help but fall under that spell.  CALCULATED IN DEATH may not be as emotionally charged as her past books were but it doesn't lessen the enjoyment in her latest addition. The reader will enjoy the byplay between Eve, Roarke, Peabody and other secondary characters that we have all grown to love. With some surprising twists and a few plot points that the reader may unravel before the story, Ms. Robb delivers a satisfying read in her In Death series. Now if only I can wait for the next book...
4	1365724800	Caluclated In Death.  Good Read.  I enjoy all of the IN DEATH series.  Recommend reading any of them.  You will enjoy.
3	1365724800	This one was not as good as some of the other books.  I always like the characters in this book.  There was something missing in this book.  I cannot actually point it out.  I will still read the next death book.
5	1365724800	Same formula as other Dallas novels but still interesting. I've been reading them for years but always want the new one
5	1365724800	J. D. Robb (Nora Roberts) has completed another intriguing episode, entwining the professional and personal life of Eve.  While keeping her main core of characters, she adds one or two others that will eventually end up in her &#34;band&#34;.  If you enjoy reading the J.D. Robb books, you'' certainly need to add this one to your list.
5	1365724800	Waiting for the next book. Just can't get enough of Eve and Rourke. Have read everyone written. Hope to be reading more soon.
5	1365638400	As always a great read from JD Robb. I loved the story and the way Eve always gets her man...the excellent one in Rourke and the rotten, evil ones. Keep them coming JD! I will ALWAYS buy them and keep them and re-read them!
5	1365638400	'Calculated in Death'.  Wow that could mean anything and it does in this Eve Dallas thriller.  Our favorite author takes our favorite heroine and friends into the boring (to some) world of numbers.  We emerge on the other side, savvy and thoroughly entertained.It is such a pleasure to reconnect with familiar characters in the totally new world of finance.  Sure, Rourke owns 'the world' as Eve puts it, but this is about other people involved in lesser ways.Another 'can't put it down' book from J.D. Robb.
4	1365638400	Not sure I love these books set in the future, but there is little reference to that. Good suspense and not a bad story line.
5	1365638400	This is another winner by J. D. Robb.  All the central characters are smart, strong, funny, sharp, and engrossing.  I look forward to seeing and reading about them in each book.  But the best part of this series is the style and excellence of the police procedural.  Robb is a very gifted writer.  Her plots are strong and tightly woven.  It's very satisfying to read how the experts follow the clues and get the bad guys.  This book had witty banter that was appropriate for the story and the characters.  Nice to have those brief laugh out loud moments amongst the tense action.  And the action is very satisfying as well, as is the conclusion.  Can't wait for the next in the series!  I highly recommend this series to all my reading friends.  Though I would suggest reading from the beginning, since you learn more and more about the central characters in each book.  But if you can't start from the beginning, I still think you'd love these books!  Enjoy!
5	1365638400	I enjoyed the latest Eve Dallas series, and look forward to the next one. While I'm waiting, I have to continue re-reading the old ones. I never get tired of them. I particularly like how solid scientific policing goes along with guts to solve the mysteries.
5	1365638400	Have read all of the in death series. Watching as the characters grow.  The love that shows between all the main characters is warm and so natural. Calculated in death added more depth and exposed more of life in New York.  Problem is I can't put the book down so it is over too soon and have to wait for the next book. Looking forward to next installation.
4	1365552000	I haven't finished the book yet, but it's a good mystery.  A lot of intrigue!  Just have to find out &#34;who done it!&#34;
5	1365552000	I love this author  - great ways with words and emotions - draws the reader in- always a good way to end a story.
5	1365552000	I started reading the &#34;In Death&#34; series a year ago and just love it.  Couldn't wait for this to come out and was not disappointed.  It has been great reading the growth of Eve Dallas in all of her relationships.  Love all the characters, especially Peabody.
5	1365552000	This was as good as all the other in death books. Wholly satisfying and well worth reading. I can't wait for the next one!
5	1365552000	Great read I just love Lt  Eve Dallas and Roarke can't wait until the next one I just love how all the characters have grown.
5	1365465600	this is a fantastic book in the best series that i read, I literally count down the days to when a new one is coming out!
4	1365465600	The story and writing is as strong as ever.  Keeps you wanting and waiting for the next &#34;in death&#34;  book.
4	1365465600	I have followed all these books and enjoy them as they progress with the characters lives. It always has a good mystery. We know Eve will solve it but enjoy the ride. I'm looking forward to more in the future. have to have it right away.
5	1365465600	Each book in this series just keeps getting better and better. My only complaint is the wait for the next one to come out!
3	1365465600	I have read all of the death by books.  The last few the sex is not good the stories are ok.  It used to be you picked up the book and read all night. One crime after another and who she thought was wonderful.
3	1365465600	On Manhattan's Upper East Side a woman lies dead at the bottom of the stairs, stripped of all her valuables. Most cops might call it a mugging gone wrong, but Lieutenant Eve Dallas knows better.A well-off accountant and a beloved wife and mother, Marta Dickenson doesn't seem the type to be on anyone's hit list. But when Eve and her partner, Peabody, find blood inside the building, the lieutenant knows Marta's murder was the work of a killer who's trained, but not professional or smart enough to remove all the evidence.But when someone steals the files out of Marta's office, Eve must immerse herself in her billionaire husband Roarke's world of big business to figure out who's cruel and callous enough to hire a hit on an innocent woman. And as the killer's violent streak begins to escalate, Eve knows she has to draw him out, even if it means using herself as bait. . . .O.K. So First let me say I love this series & These Charcters.  This one has Robbs, normal finesse with a Homicide case, but other than that, I couldn't say that anything happened to move the Story of EVE & Roarke, or Peabody & McNabb, Ect.  I think you could skip this book and not skip a beat.  There was a few statements made during this book that lead me to believe she has something big planned for the next book (but that just speculation on my part).  At $12.99 for kindle version, i would wait for the paperback or go to your local library.
4	1365465600	Good suspense novel.  It might be a little bit to high tech in the vocabulary in the book.  I realize it is suppose to be set in the future, but it takes away from the book when you have to sidetrack yourself in figuring out what they are referring to.  Otherwise a good suspense novel.
5	1365465600	Always moving always well written a good easy read.  Good to know that when you want a consistent writer she is the one to go to.
5	1365465600	I love every book in this series and this one is no exception!  Another fast paced story line with the usual wonderful story of love between Dallas and Roarke woven in.
5	1365465600	The book is a great addition to the In Death series.  Always a good mystery with engaging characters. I really enjoy the continuity with the characters (and all their antics).
5	1365465600	loved it,love the recurring characters, a must read for all detective fan spass it onto your friends to read,really,truly, a page turner
3	1365465600	This was not up to the usual standard I expect from J.D.Robb. I know the title is CALCULATED in Death,but it got very boring in some spots.
5	1365465600	JD Robb cannot write her futuristic cop stories fast enough I have read them all!  I love the characters especially the side kick!
5	1365465600	All of the books in the Death series are very well written.  This is no exception.  I started this one day, and continued reading until it was completed.  Does not drag at all.I recommend this to anyone who is in thrall with Eve and Roark!  Good reading!
1	1365465600	How does she get away with this?  The Angie and Rourke characters lack charisma, interest and above all, believability.  The plot is thin, the requisite sex scenes...  - I can't spend anymore time on it.
3	1365379200	The new episode in the saga of Eve Dallas and Rourke is like an old pair of fuzzy socks. Comfortable and familiar, but not too exciting. I enjoyed it as a winter evening with "friends" but it is not up to Robb's usual level. If you are new to the series, start at the beginning and enjoy the progression and growth of the characters. If you read these books occasionally, missing this one will not hurt. If you're always waiting for the next installment, you may enjoy this one, but don't expect to be missing sleep to finish it.
5	1365379200	It looks like a botched mugging that left the victim, an accountant and mother, dead. But to Lieutenant Eve Dallas it quickly becomes obvious that it is no such thing. This was a calculated hit. But why? And who did it? Dallas and Detective Deliah Peabody are going to find out -- with the help of Eve's billionaire husband, the mysterious and multi-talented Roarke.
5	1365379200	Eve Dallas is a New York police Lieutenant of the future years 2059 etc. Her husband is Roarke -that's his whole name.  Eve often says he owns most of the planet's wealth and that of several other planets...in other words he is MAG-RICH, gorgeous to the eyes and brilliant in all other things.This story is a bit more convoluted than most. A lady is found dead in the lower level apartment that one of her clients is rehabbing to move his business .  To Eve that means she stands for the dead. Eve will go to the ends of the earth to solve a murder.  I've read all of the books prior to this and this one stands up to the prior ones very well.  I look forward to the next of her books almost as soon as I finish one.  Read and ENJOY!
5	1365379200	Great book, I love J. D. Robb, Easy to read, fast paced never boring. Can not wait for the next one, go Lt Dallas and Peabody
4	1365292800	Robb gives us another great chapter in Eve's life as cop and wife of Roarke.  It's nice to get a glimpse of vulnerability in her relationships with her female friends.  She seems a bit more open to them in this installment.  Nicer, but still necessarily tough.
5	1365292800	I like all of her books and look forward to the next one.  I like that her books stand alone, but also her chacathers but also come up in the next book with a continued story within a story.
3	1365292800	"Calculated" is (amazingly) the 36th entry in the JD Robb set featuring NYPD homicide cop Lt. Eve Dallas. For a series that only started in 1995, that's a pace of almost exactly two novels per year, every one of which we've read (not counting a growing list of novellas) - and we've marveled before at how consistently we find these stories to deliver highly entertaining and suspenseful police procedurals. A hefty cast of regulars who progress in their careers a little over time, as well as a futuristic setting (2058+) that features a few not far-fetched capabilities we might wish we already had, only add to the fun.So maybe it's somewhat inevitable that for the first time in over a dozen recent entries we found this one a little disappointing. We perceived the plot unfolding in two phases - after the killing of an ordinary female accountant, poorly disguised as a mugging, and then a few other murders, Eve and company worked awfully hard to identify the who, why, and how, consuming roughly two-thirds of the page count. While the clues seemed to appear at a decent pace, the machinations were frankly boring and unexciting; were we a page-skipper, we could see skimming much of this long dry setup. Ironically, the heat rises incredibly during the last third of the novel as Eve zeroes in on the mastermind, the actual murderer, and the various white-collar crooks that led to the long list of crimes uncovered during the investigation. A minor sub-plot about the crew getting ready for a movie premiere based on Eve's solving a famous crime added some welcome distraction.Thus the book seemed uncharacteristically uneven - in fact, some half dozen examples of Eve butchering everyday platitudes, like "fly in the lotion" instead of the "ointment", a trait we never noticed before, left us wondering if perhaps a "helper" was at work with the writing. While the snagging of the perpetrators finally provided some zest, to us this novel miss-calculated the story-telling attributes we've come to expect "in Death".
1	1365292800	This book is just another murder mystery, and not that well written either. I thought it was pretty boring overall.
4	1365292800	same ol gang running the mean streets of 2060 New York, usual rock 'em, sock ;em sleaze guy. Fun read
5	1365292800	I have not read one of her books that hasn't been wonderful. This one is just as great. I love Eve & Roark and Peabody and all of them.
5	1365292800	I haven't missed one of her books and if I go out of my way to ensure that doesn't happen (that's hard to do sometimes!). I don't know how she does it between writing as Nora Roberts and J. D. Robb but everything she writes is worth reading.
5	1365292800	all this baby talk leads me to hope that Eve will get pregnant soon, that would hilarious! keep them coming!
5	1365206400	Love all Eve Dallas books but this is far from the most interesting.  Robb needs to get back on top of her game and perhaps less time spent on Nora Roberts novels.
5	1365206400	Love all the In Death series books.  It seems a long time until the next one will be out.  Looking forward to it..
5	1365206400	Great as always. I have never read one I dud not enjoy.  You are the only author whose books I can always read again anfind something I missed the first time.
2	1365206400	Some people could probably get around the sophomoric language in this book - heck, I did for a few hundred pages - but it wears on you after a while. It's like a really talented high schooler wrote this. It's a decent story but WAY too long.
5	1365206400	The &#34;In Death&#34; series is the only book I will buy in hardback because I know I will want to keep it. Even though you might think this series is getting tired with 40+ entries, Robb (Nora Roberts) has only covered two years of Dallas and Roarke's lives. Enthralling and sexy, &#34;Calculated in Death&#34; will not be easy to put down until the last word has been read.
5	1365206400	Wow!  I read everything J.D.Robb puts into print.  I am completely obsessed with Eve Dallas and Roake.  This book is equally and independently superb.  Highly recommended reading.  I anxiously await the next book.
5	1365206400	Another wonderful book in a long list of great stories by an exceptional writer who's next book I will read. And every one after.
5	1365206400	I love this entire series!  This one was a really good read, can't wait to see what she comes out with next!
3	1365120000	The story follows a familiar path with all of the usual characters.  Getting somewhat repetitive. But, always a fun read.
5	1365120000	I read this book as soon as it became available. Then I clear my schedule as much as I can, park myself, and read. I love this series, and feel like the main characters are old friends. This series never disappoints me, always a top notch story. I can't wait for the next one.
5	1365120000	The author brings her unique perspective on future and &#34;Cop&#34; fiction to life once again, living up to her Reputation.
5	1365120000	Love J D Robb books.  Have all of the &#34;IN DEATH&#34; series.  She keeeps you guessing as to who did it.
5	1365120000	I have read every one of her books as soon as they are  published. My all-time favorite author. Believable characters and futuristic setting.
5	1365120000	I just love this series and cannot wait for each new book. This &#34;chapter&#34; was okay.  It was a quick read.
5	1365120000	Love all her In death books.  I have read and listened to everyone, more than once.  I am just starting to try some of her Nora Roberts books.
5	1365120000	I started at the beginning and took notes, so I know the references the writer inserts concerning previous cases.  Eve Dallas is a fun character.
3	1365120000	I have read all of J.D. Robb's in death books and the earlier ones were excellent. I could not put one down till i finished it, even if it meant staying up till 3 AM. This one however must be written by a ghost writer. The characters are not as in depth as earlier books and the story is slow to develop and the secondary characters were pretty confusing.  It took me three evenings to read this one, as it just did not hold my interest.  One of the reasons I have liked these books is not just the mystery aspect, I have gotten to know and like the characters, especially Detective Peabody. In this book it was like the writer was not sure who she was.I am not sure I will be buying the next one. I feel the same about the book before this one. Not up to her usual standards either of them.
5	1365120000	I always enjoy J.D. Robb's mysteries with Eve and Roake! I 'm completely absorbed and involved in her books! It is a fun exciting escape!
5	1365120000	I chose this rating because I love books by J.D. Robb in Death Series.I just like her books.I would recommend this book to everyone I know.
5	1365120000	I enjoy the Dallas and her attitude.  Have read them all and will read most anything she writes.  It is about time for her to start a family.
5	1365033600	I have read every In Death book.  This is one of my favorites.  I always like when the book is just straight good copwork by Eve and her wonderful team.
5	1365033600	I have been reading J.D. Robb's books for 8 years and love them all  I just have to remember which ones I have read.thanks to Kindle they let me know now.  Thank You, Amazon
5	1365033600	Yes,I know, killers and violence and a lot greed; however, this series just gets better with each addition. Eve continues to evolve and it's fun to watch as the other characters see it happening. There's no other series quite like this and each book is a definite ebook preorder. As for the author, I'm sorry but a simple "thank you" will have to do. Well, that and another preorder awaiting the next time travel into Eve and Roarke's lives.
5	1365033600	I have enjoyed the In Death series of books and this is another great one in the line up!  I like how the author makes one interested in the characters, what stage of their life they are in and what's happening next!  I am impressed with the futuristic spin that Nora Roberts puts on this series, totally believable!  I look forward to future installments!
5	1365033600	Just one more great book in a series of great books. I always have my next book in the series prepurchased so I get it as soon as it is available. It is fun to see how Eve and her group grow and evolve with each new episode.
5	1365033600	As always there is just enough of everything; action; love; laughter.  I do love Susan reading and inflections for each character
2	1365033600	Not a great book in the mystery-crime genre.  Set in 2060, the book still feels very "today".  Every now and then some futuristic tool is brought in, but the era is not fleshed out.  The main character, Eve Dallas, is a Lieutenant with the NYPD.  However, her ex-criminal-turned-good-guy, very successful businessman husband, is provided with evidence to help Dallas solve the crime, breaking every standard for police confidentiality and evidence protection.  This arrangement is known in the department and praised as a working option.  I won't even get into the jumpy plot moves that bring resolution within a page after chapters of chasing secondary leads.  Look elsewhere.
5	1365033600	I, like many of you, I'm sure, have read every Eve Dallas story.  I was hooked from the first novel, and, no matter what I'm reading, when the next Eve is ready, so am I.  Robb has an uncanny ability to write all these books and not repeat a plot story.  The characters she has created are &#34;real,&#34; even though the books are set in the mid-2000's.  My only fault with Calculated in Death is that so many of these wonderful characters like Mavis and Leonardo--and Belle--do not have a larger part to play.  No Charles and Louise--not even much Nadine!!  Not even much interaction with Summerset as usual.  However, since there is an abundance of characters in Eve's world, the reader always enjoys whichever ones Robb chooses for each book.  There are so many good things going on in a Robb book, you don't have much time to miss a particular character until the end when you realize that somebody made no appearance.  It is just hard to find a bad J.D. Robb book.
5	1365033600	Eve and Roarke at their steamy crime solving best! A fast paced read, and as always, I'm eagerly awaiting the next book.
4	1365033600	I always enjoy the character and plot development employed by J. j. Robb, but I was a bit disappointed with the abrupt ending.  Still, it has been wonderful following Eve Dallas from the beginning.  I look forward to the next installment.
4	1365033600	Loved this book! Eve is a constant work in progress, but she is evolving quite nicely. I don't know how this series will end, but I will keep reading.
5	1365033600	Always enjoy the detective mystery and this one was intriguing. All the typical twists and turns along with great characters. Loved it!
5	1365033600	Haven't found anything that I don't like about J.D. Robb or her writing!  I will continue to read her &#34;in Death&#34; novels until she stops writing them.  I will then reread all the books!
5	1365033600	I have been reading J.D. Robb  (Nora Roberts) for years.  I love the futuristic world of Dallas and Rourke.  To me these are quick reads and I'm always pleased with how Dallas and Peabody solve the crime.
4	1365033600	The story of Eve & Roarke continues with more bits & pieces of the people that matter and the evolving friendships mixed in a murder mystery.
4	1365033600	The plot growth was a bit slow. I did appreciate how it was not as gruesome as some of the other IN DEATH books have been.
5	1365033600	I love the characters.  I love the future time period.  How Dallas operates is always fun and interesting.  You  will enjoy!
5	1365033600	A true j.d. Robb book. Lots of suspense. I couldn't put it down. Hated that I finished so fast. Can't wait for the next book.
4	1365033600	As always, it was a good read.  Have read all the JD Robb books in order as they were issued.
5	1365033600	One of Robb's best.  I really enjoy the future location and all the characters she carries along in each book.
4	1365033600	I totally enjoyed this book.  JD Robb is an excellent writer, keeps the story moving, characters are consistent and vivid, usually doesn't get maudlin or &#34;soap operay&#34;, and has believeable  stories.  I buy all JD Robb &#34;in Death&#34; books, have everyone of them and this didn't disappoint.
5	1365033600	Love all of JD Robb's books and this wasn't anything different. Great read !!!!! Can't wait for the next book.
5	1365033600	I love all J.D.Robb, this was the best Eve Dallas yet.  You keep writing and I'll keep reading, just like till death do us part.
5	1365033600	I can hardly wait for the next J. D. Robb.  I have all of her books. and have re-read all of them at least once.  Keep them coming.
4	1364947200	Over the past several JD Robb books, Nora Roberts has spent less time on steamy scenes and more time developing secondary characters and using them to help create stronger mystery and police procedural story lines. Calculated in Death is definitely in line with the last few &#34;Dallas&#34; books as a solid detective story.
5	1364947200	loved the newest Eve Dallas adventure. i have read every in Death book and love them all. they just keep getting better. can't wait for the next
5	1364947200	As always this was a great book.  However I think for the price it should be longer.  Also, are Eve and Roarke ever going to have a baby?
5	1364947200	As always, I love the characters, the interaction between them, and most of all, the genuine affection that is shared by all of them, for each other.  Plots, to me, are secondary to the characters that people the books.  That is why, after the Kindle editions came out, I'm intending to collect ALL the &#34;In Death&#34; books and hope to read enjoy them time and time again!Renee Wadler
5	1364947200	As always J.D. Robb hits her mark. Love these books and have the whole collection. Always anticipate the next release.
4	1364947200	Robb writes wonderful mysteries that leave u always thinking of who did it or how Lt. Dallas will catch her man.
5	1364947200	I always like her books?  She keeps me involved in her plots, and it has been fun to watch &#34;Eve&#34; go through her growing process.
5	1364947200	I am an &#34;in Death&#34; megafan.  CALCULATED hit on all points.  Humor, pathos, plot, characters, dialog.J.D. Robb continues to score.RECOMMENDATION: AbsolutelyFFL
5	1364947200	Love, love her In Death books, have everyone of them.  Can't wait for the next one to come out. Have them on my Kindle and on CD.  Even have Hubby hooked on them by playing them on CD as we travel.
4	1364947200	It was great seeing everyone together solving a crime. I did not give it a five as it is starting to become obvious that there is a pattern to the books.
5	1364947200	I will keeep reading as long as she writes these Dallas books love it I have everyone in order .
4	1364947200	4.5/5You would think my now we'd be tired of this series but nope. This one is just as terrific as the rest or even more so. There are so many elements that keep this series interesting... to read my long review click here : liezel77.wordpress.com
4	1364947200	I am alway sad when I finish one of her books because it is over.  I love her characters and story lines.
4	1364947200	I would recommend to anyone who is familiar with this series.  It's good, but not as good as the alcove story, Celebrity was better.  There are 3 or 4, but I can't think of the titles right now.
5	1364947200	This one moves along at a much more consistent tempo. Enjoyable read without getting bogged down with endless, irrelevant details.
5	1364860800	Love the In Death series from Robb.  Have read all of them and hope she continues to write them.  This book has everything that you want to read in the story line.  Would recommend that a new reader start at the beginning of the series.  Would love to see them made into a television series.  I give this book 5 stars.
4	1364860800	This last, Calculated In Death, is not my favorite but I enjoyed it as usual. I find the books which encompass more interaction with theregular cast of characters more to my liking as I really like the way these characters have evolved and relationships have deepened.
5	1364860800	Wow loved it! I love the between Eve and Rorake is so refreshing and a joy to read. Then the murder mystery keeps us all on our toes. I look forward to  all her books.
5	1364860800	Eve and Roarke are to of my favorite characters to read about.  They are wonderful together and can solve any murder.
4	1364860800	This book wasn't as intense as some of her others and not quite as good.  But I still likes it.
5	1364860800	Love this series--I really liked the family involved in this one--the characters ere very rich! I will keep coming back for more and more and more!
4	1364860800	I was pleased with this JD Robb book.  This story line seemed to be slower moving and not quite as exciting as the previous stories.  Usually I find myself unable to put one of her books down, but this one isn't quite that riveting.  I will still buy any books in this series by JD Robb because it is a good story line and usually very interesting.  I would still recommend that others read this book because it is a continuation of the storyline after all.
5	1364860800	My favorite author and my favorite characters she writes!  This is a fun one with some great twists and turns.  I did get a bit confused because there are lots of suspects but is all came together just fine and I had a really good time reading the book.
5	1364860800	JD Robb can write anything and I will love to read it!  This book had the best ending yet!  Eve and Rourke rock.
5	1364860800	I really enjoyed this book.  Fast paced as always, just futuristic enough but not overboard.  Great series, makes you want the next book now.
3	1364860800	Exactly what you would expect from Dallas and Roarke. Right on target and quite enjoyable as I find all the J D Robbs.
4	1364860800	I never get tired of Eve and Roarke, Peabody and the rest of the crew.  Having read all the series I have seen the characters develop and grown.  Not great literature but very entertaining.
5	1364860800	Great read! The whole series is worth reading-have it all and can't wait for the next one! I have all my friends reading along with me. Thanks J. D. Robb!
5	1364774400	Loved it.  I wish I could have seen everyone on the red carpet!  I feel so cloxe to all the regular characters.
5	1364774400	I love this series and am quite pleased with the latest installment!  Nora Roberts is an excellent writer and this series proves it time and again!
4	1364774400	I confess I love the &#34;In Death&#34; series.  Robb always delivers multi-dimensional characters and fast-paced action.  This book was fairly typical for the series, with a difficult murder to solve.
1	1364774400	I love this series and have read the books numerous times. However I am finding this book very difficult to read. It is not in JD Robb style at all. It is slow and I have skim read most of it. I am disappointed I paid for it, and will preview the next one before I buy it.
5	1364774400	JD Robb writes an awesome tale every time. Suspenseful thrilling and entertaining every books of hers I have read. great readlng
5	1364774400	If you have not read this yet, what are you waiting for? Fast paced excitement with a little spice thrown in for fun. The &#34;in death&#34; series are worth reading and re-reading.
5	1364774400	Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb is just one of my favorite authors.  I love the Eve Dallas books -- can't get enough of them.  And getting it at such as good price from Amazon.com was icing on my cupcake!  Thanks!
5	1364774400	I love Nora Roberts (J. D. Robb). I have read all the J. D. Robb books in this series. I love the characters, and the story line. Each book keeps getting better.
4	1364774400	Calculated in Death is the 36th full length novel or the 45th story in the In Death series by J.D. Robb, depending on how you are counting them. Personally, for my records its number 45. Needless to say, that this far into a series, there is a LOT of back story that just can't be condensed for someone new picking up this book as a starting point. That said, most of the novels are self-contained stories and there are no major cliffhangers, so you could try this book and jump right into the action. J.D. Robb is a pseudonym for the internationally acclaimed Nora Roberts, but only for this particular series.The series chronicles the life and cases of NYPSD (New York Police and Security Department) Lieutenant Eve Dallas, Homicide Division in the not so distant future. A future where Urban Riots gripped and changed the world just some 20 years before, where automobiles can and do fly, guns are banned and stunners are the norm. But a future where people are still people, so hatred and greed are still very popular murder motives. We met Eve Dallas for the first time in book 1 just before she met her husband, Roarke in 2058. Roarke is a self made multi-billionaire who grew up dirt poor on the streets of Dublin and used his brains and a live of crime to get started. Eve was an orphan who found in an alley in Dallas, Texas and has made the NYPSD and New York her home. Basically, if you like a good solid mystery, wrapped in a little science fiction and topped with a little romantic bow, you would really enjoy this series. The characters are all very vivid and unique. With a long running series such as this, you can easily follow along with the lives of your favorite characters, and there are a lot of reoccurring characters.I will admit that I was a late comer to the In Death party. I knew that Nora Roberts had a long running series called In Death, but I just putting off reading it. Then finally one day, while looking for some new audiobooks to listen to on my work commute, I received the In Death series as a recommendation. I had been listening to Iris Johansen's Eve Duncan, Robert Ludlum's Bourne and Stuart Wood's Stone Barrington series. The In Death books were a natural progress. I got the first 2 books in the In Death series on Cassette Tape from Paperbackswap.com. Oh boy. Loved THEM! It wasn't long before I had to get the actual books to read and reread and read again.Today, I have all the books in print, e-print & audio versions, and am slowly working on replacing the paperbacks with actual hardbacks for the older books. I still go back and reread either sections or even whole books. All I can say is that you really should pick one up. Trust me on this, you won't be disappointed. This particular title got 4 stars on Goodreads. I am sure that I will reread it at minimum of twice before the next book comes out.
5	1364774400	I always look forward to a new book written by Jo Ann Flukes, or J.D. Robb, [Nora Roberts].They never disappoint.
5	1364688000	one of her more twisted plots, very nice read. Kept me going until the very end on this one. Fun
5	1364688000	Great book. Really enjoyed any DJ Robb in death series books. Highly recommend then to anyone read read read read read read read
4	1364688000	Good, though less engaging than most of the other "in death" series, and I've read all of them.  Always look forward to a J D Robb...& her Eve Dallas & Roarke adventures.
4	1364688000	At least this book kept moving unlike the two before it, especially "Celebrity in Death".  Almost didn't buy it because the storyline seems to be going no where.  All the accounting work that Roarke is just naturally great at was boring but that might be because I dropped out of accounting decades ago :)  I hope the one reviewer was correct in thinking this book is setting up a really great next book because if it's not I think it's time for the series to come to an end.  I can think of lots of great endings for it...
5	1364688000	she continues to engage you with her characters and twist of the pot.  Eve and Roake's relationship goes to a new level of trust and respect.
5	1364688000	Calculated in Death hooks you from the very beginning and carries through the story. It's a pager turner and hard to put down.
4	1364688000	Again, the author has hit another home run!  The story is well thought out and the characters are believable. She just keeps getting better!I don't know how she keeps getting better, but she does!
5	1364688000	If you have never read the In Death series, start now! you will not regret it. I promise. Mystery, sex, romance, humor, thriller...all rolled into one.
5	1364688000	This book was as good as all the rest of the Eve Dallas series. The murder case was interesting as always but I love the main characters and how they interact with each other. It is fun to watch them grow.Can't wait for the next book.
5	1364688000	Does not disappoint! Twists and turns! Very Enjoyable! Thank you so very much! Strong Female Lead! Great descriptions and evidence!
5	1364688000	If you've enjoyed prior works by Robb you'll love this one too.  It definitely keeps you turning the pages.  Suspenseful.
5	1364688000	she writes great stories and the characters are all enjoyable.  I buy all the books as they come out.  I enjoy all J.D.Robb books
5	1364601600	JD Robb writes fantastic books.  I love her writing.  I am always waiting for her new books to come out.  Which there were more that I have not read.
5	1364601600	As always, her books are interesting and fun.  Dallas and Roarke are great characters.  This is a good read.  I always look forward to her next book.
4	1364601600	What is happening to Dallas. She is getting more normal in her later years. Not as much blowing up at people, but I will continue to read this series
4	1364601600	Well done in all aspects as typicall Robb. I would have liked the names to be a bit more...different from one another. That part I felt like I needed to have some notes to keep them straight :)
5	1364601600	As always the character of Eve Dallas brings you in at the very start of the book and keeps your attention and entices you to solve the murder before she does.
5	1364601600	I enjoy all of her books.  I never expected to enjoy futuristic type books.  Her whole series is fun to reed.
4	1364601600	Read all of the books.  While this isn't up to the best of the best (hard to beat New York to Dallas), it is a worthwhile read and the wonderful brain candy it is meant to be.
5	1364601600	Eve has to be my favorite character to read about.  When a story makes me laugh out loud... that's entertainment.
4	1364601600	The story wasn't as in depth as some of the others.  I miss the more Human side of Dallas, when she is with her friends.
3	1364601600	I love the In Death series and grab them as soon as they come out.  This one is okay, not one of her best, but I would still buy it.To J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) ... keep them coming.  This is one of the best series on the market.
5	1364601600	I love the characters in J.D. Robb's books; the details of their lives are so vivid, the come alive in each book.Keep up the good work!!!
5	1364601600	I have never read a J.D.Robb  book I didn't like. Always keeps me reading and on the edge. Eve and Rourke  are a team like no others.
3	1364515200	The plot seemed to drag and was not as engrossing as some of her previous ones in this series.I prefer her novels to deal with more than one case/mysterY that complicate the plot.She still includes brief sex scenes which are always fun.M. K. M.
5	1364515200	This is another awesome book about Eve Dallas and her crew.  J. D. Robb is an awesome author and I love all of her books.
4	1364515200	I read the same authors like J.D. Robb because I know what I will get--well written plots that give you the whodunit before the ending so she can prove the perp did it and catch them in style.  The characters are vivid and familiar and you cannot help but like them like old friends.  I like that Dallas' past is less and less emphasized in these later novels.  That was getting old.  But the challenge is new plots that are not so pat and predictable.  This plot was pretty general with few twists and shockers.  But I enjoy the interplay of the characters in the novel and so forgive some repetition.
5	1364515200	Devine reading. I have all of the books in this series.They are  excellent because you see how Eve and Roark become different and better people because of the love that they share and explore.
5	1364515200	I have read all the series and I loved them all.  Always waiting on the next one! I usually read without stopping I become so involved.
5	1364515200	I have said it once,I will say it again,if you have the talent you can make a couple interesting AND stay together. all the usual suspects are back in this &#34;calculating&#34; story.Entitlement is a big red flag with me and to see the poster child for it get their comupence by Eve is the best revenge. I always love the diff intricacies of each dept.(e,me and the press)come together and the best? Rourke.
5	1364515200	Eve Dallas is one of the three favorite people in the books that I always buy over and over again!!!!!
4	1364515200	Usually the &#34;In Death&#34;  books are an automatic 5 stars. Not this one though, it is a slow going story. I am not excited to sit down and read it every second I get. The narrarator is either a computor or a zombie. Spoken in a dull monotone, where do they find some of these readers? Don't they listen to them?
4	1364515200	Good reading again,  although got the feeling it was rushed, seemed to finish quite quickly with the knowledge of who the guilty party was earlier than previous stories.
5	1364515200	I don't know how Ms. Robb, or Nora Roberts, does it, but her In Death books are consistently a great read with a great story.  I must admit that I like the books best when Eva has a fight with someone, but they all are great.  I love the way she lets Eva slowly solve the mystery and let us see her thought process as she does so.  And, I like how you can see how Eva has developed emotionally throughout the books.  And, I still buy these books in hardback because I love turning the pages and then going back to reread something over and over again.
5	1364515200	Another good read....Not as good as the first ones in series...Doesnt quite have the story lines as the first ones but it is still a good read!!
4	1364515200	As in all her books, this is a very good one.  It is always exciting to see how Eve, Roarke and Peabody solve the crime. I really enjoy these books by J. D. Robb.
5	1364515200	Awesome!Great read and riveting. I love JD Robb. And the characters are really really really really good. Good book
5	1364515200	Exactly what I was hoping to find in the next In Death book. Can't wait for the next one to be published!
5	1364515200	I always look forward to the next Eve and Roarke story. Enjoyed the crime solving but would have liked a little more character development of all the characters I know and love over all these books. Looking forward to the next.
5	1364515200	I have read every In Death book by J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) at least 3 times each.  They are fantastic reads.  Love the relationship between Eve and Rorke and Eve and her co-workers and friends.  I like how the author has progressed the damaged but strong Eve emotionally, i.e. letting people in to her life and secrets.  Eve may be &#34;kickass&#34; but she's learning to let down her guard with those she loves.  J.D. Robb is a &#34;kickass&#34; writer.
5	1364515200	Love the Dallas- Roake series and although I wish this one had gone on for at least a few more pages, it is excellent.
5	1364515200	I am a huge JD ROBB fan.  I have read all of the books and enjoyed every one.  This one did not let me down.  I love all the people in the series and seeing them grow in their relationships is fun. I am glad this one didn't dwell on Eve's past as much as some of the previous stories.
4	1364515200	Fun and fast &#34;summer&#34; reading. Perfect for a getaway from more serious reading. Can't wait for the next one to be published!
4	1364515200	I've been a fateful reader of the entire series.  While this may not have been my favorite, it ranks high.
5	1364515200	Even though I know everything is going to turn out alright, I enjoy the thought process to get to that conclusion.  I also love the continuing characters and their interactions.  Can't wait for the next book.
5	1364515200	The only problem is I'm greedy, I'd like 3 &#34;In Death&#34; books OR I'd even SETTLE for a half J D Robb + half Nora Roberts book like - Remember When
4	1364515200	The same characters are back, and basically it is the same story lines as past books.  The difference is in the readers imagination...working out the various plots.  It is the sub plots that keep you glued to the final outcome.
5	1364515200	Have read the whole series of these novels and once again thoroughly enjoyed this one. Recommended to anyone who enjoys futuristic fiction with sexy bits...very sexy bits!!
5	1364515200	I have followed Eve and Rourke from the beginning of the series Robb keeps the reader involved in the ongoing investigation. The Characters continue to develop with each book. I can't wait for the next book.
5	1364515200	J. D. Robb is my favorite author. I named one of my cats Dallas in hnor of this series. I have every In Death book on my Kindle. After reading each one I look up to heaven and say, "can't she write any faster." I can't wait until the next book. I highy, highly recommend this book.
5	1364515200	J. D. Robb cannot go wrong. Reading this book is a wonderful way to fall asleep - if you can put it down.
5	1364515200	Once again, a great read. Just wish the length of time between books wasn't so long! This series never gets boring.
5	1364428800	Great story & characters keep getting better. I always look forward to the  next Eve Dallas  and Rourke "In Death" new adventure. .
5	1364428800	I've read all of this series and each book gets better....just love all the characters.....especially Roarke and Eve...gets better and better...can't wait for the next one
5	1364428800	I love the story line and the way she brings all her characters to life.  Eve surprises me all the time.
5	1364428800	I am a big JD Robb fan.  I own every book in this series, and she always keeps me wanting more of the story.
5	1364428800	This if the first J.D. Robb book I have purchased in Kindle.  I have all of them, 1/3rd in paperback, the rest in hardcover.  Since I can't put one down once I get it, I was very happy to begin reading almost the minute it was released since I pre-ordered it.  Being able to read it on my cell in tiny snippets of time on my Kindle in the bedroom & on my iPad at the gym (where I have the font much larger) saves me hauling a hardcover copy around (except in my cell which I keep in a pocket in my slacks).  Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb always delivers a compelling story.  I want an Auto Chef NOW!
5	1364428800	J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) continues her captivating story of Eve Dallas and Roarke in the newest edition of the In Death series. If you are a fan of this series you won't be dissappointed.
4	1364428800	Love you jd keep writing.when are eve and roach going have kids..how about Peabody..How about adding more states into your stories
4	1364428800	This book was as good as the rest of JD Robb's, she always leaves us wanting more or her next book now!How she can come up so many different twist to the story are beyond me.
5	1364428800	I've read and own most everything Nora Roberts has written.  She's such an talented wordsmith, and I envy her gift!!
5	1364428800	I love the person of eve Dallas. How her childhood shaped her positively and negatively. Her cases are detailed and her relationship with roared. Is amazing
5	1364428800	Just another great JD Robb book.  Couldn't wait for it to become available.  A real page turner and would highly  recommend
5	1364428800	Fast paced and with just enough humor to make it hard to put down. Always like j.d.Robb stories with Eve DAllas.
4	1364428800	I love all JD Robb books.I have read all of them ! Eve and Roake are my favorite couple in the series and I adore Peabody and McNab  . Nora Roberts is awesome !!
2	1364428800	As always well written but I am getting a little tired of Eve and Roarke and this book is about a dead accountant, sorry but that's boring. Same stuff, she does not like fuss or make up, offers to put a boot where the sun doesn't shine, still old butler and fat cat. If you haven't read all the books then you will probably enjoy this one, if you have read all of them like me, then you might be a little over them. I probably will not buy the next one but that's just my view.
5	1364342400	Really enjoyed this one. Looking forward to the next book in the in death series. Hoping this series will be put on screen.
5	1364342400	I have always waited with baited breath for the next in the series of these books.  They are always a great read and the book is finished way to fast.
5	1364342400	J.d. Robb. (Nora Roberts) is always entertaining with her futuristic crime novels, I just like to escape with a no stress read!
5	1364342400	The last couple of J.D. Robb mysteries have really been good. Hope stories continues to write in this vein.If you haven't read any of his books in awhile, give these newer ones a try. Five stars for couldn't put it down.
5	1364256000	I love the in Death series, this one is no exception. Read it in a few hours was quiet happy with my purchase.
5	1364256000	From beginning to end story grabs you.  I love the relationship between Eve and Roadie and how they work closely to solve crimes, but especially Eve.  I hope J.D.Robb does not let the years fly by too fast.  This series could go on for many years more.
5	1364256000	It was a great read from start to finish, cant wait for the next book. The relationship between Dallas and Roarke is fantastic.
5	1364256000	I have read all of the In Death books and wish Robb would write them more often.  She has done herself proud with this one.
3	1364256000	After the excitement and intensity of her recent In Death books, this one seemed more of an oultine of what her books are. Missing were the quirks of each character, instead they were just... there. The little things that make us love her secondary characters,  Feeney with his wiry ginger hair and bag of nuts, Mavis trying to get her to hold a cooing Bella, Peabody disgusting her with sex talk, Mira's mothering. Instead all of the characters did their part, brought Eve to the climax of the book, with no real personality or interest. Personally I found I did not like or hate any of the suspects, none made me want it to be them. There were so many places for excitement or intensity with the crazy spoiled nutjob, the ruthless money men, the extended family, and the Las Vegas connection and yet I felt nothing for any of the characters. I have only seen this one other time, I believe it was Indulgence in Death, when JD Robb ignores the personal relationships and focuses solely on the crime. For some reason, I felt that book felt flat as well.
5	1364256000	Always enjoy the Death series.  J D Robb does not fail to keep you entertained in the Dallas books.  Great Read.
5	1364256000	Once again JD Robb presents a fast moving thriller with the usual humor and pathos of the series.  The intricacies of the world of accounting set a great backdrop for the tale of greed and selfishness.  As always the regular charcters are there backing up Eve and making for a great, easy read.
5	1364256000	Eve at its best.  Here she is investigating a crime on the eve of the movie premier of the Icove Murder books.  Did she make it to the premier, you have to read to find out?Enjoy.
5	1364256000	Another awesome Lt. Eve and Roark book. I wait impatiently for the new one as soon as the current one is finished. I just wish Nora (J.D. Robb) could write faster! Read them all you won't be sorry!
5	1364256000	I love this series and look forward to each new addition. I have &#34;cast&#34; all the main characters and picture them in my mind as I read. I laugh and get tears in my eyes and find myself racing through the pages to see what will happen next. I have loved every book Nora Roberts has written,read them all,and always preorder anything I see comming up.
4	1364256000	The continued journey w/ Dallas, Peabody, Rourk & the gang does not dissapoint. I couldnt stop turning the pages until the last sentenance. JD Robb's series Rocks and reading about the gang is like coming home for Thanksgiving.. You walk away full and satisfied but cant wait for more.
4	1364256000	Ok, I know that the In Death books are sort of procedural, but I really enjoy them and after the disappointment of Delusions In Death I'm very happy to report that I really enjoyed seeing Eve and Roarke again in a great story.So, if you enjoy the In Death series, you can breath easier, Calculated in Death will not disappoint.
5	1364256000	JD Robb/Nora Roberts always deliver a great story with the best dialogue.  Every time I read her books, I can't put them down.  She is a master story teller.
4	1364256000	Another winning book for the Eve Dallas series!!!!  Suspense, romance and humor all rolled into one great story. Highly recommend.
5	1364169600	This is another fantastic book in the In Death series. I have yet to read a bad book in this series. I can't wait for the next book!
4	1364169600	Great book.  I always read  Eve Dallas book when it first comes out and I wasn't disappointed..Great story....  Will read it again!
5	1364169600	I have every single one of Miss Robb's tales; together with the Psy Changeling and Guild Hunter stories, I could be a couch potato quite easily - no TV necessary!Hazel MacDonald
5	1364169600	As all her In Death books this one was great.  Can't wait till the next book comes out. thank you
5	1364169600	JD Robb never fails to tie us up in murder and mystery. She keeps Eve Dallas fresh and I look forward with anticipation to each new adventure. Toss in Rourke and what more can you ask for?
1	1364169600	Too many words to describe everything didn't need to be in the future was not happy with the writing or futuristic theme
2	1364169600	Had it not been for the author's attempt to bring in the futuristic lingo into the story, it wouldn't have been too bad of book. Detective Peabody is portrayed as an absolute idiot at times. I don't know if actually reading the book versus listening to it as an audio book would have made it more enjoyable. Listening to the previously mentioned lingo made it a struggle for me to get through this book. It was bad enough with the references to the electronics, but saying things like "Those boots are MAG" made it a difficult listen. Those types of phrases are used throughout the book and ruined the plot.
5	1364169600	Awesome book! As is to be expected from jD Robb! If you love the in death series this a must read
4	1364169600	The series has generated quite a number of books by now and, while the general outline is somewhat formulaic by now, the fun and energy lies within the details of the current investigation and, for me, the growth of Eve Dallas. Haunting the halls of Big Business, a host of suspects and strange methodology in the commission of crimes: these all propel Eve forward into her next investigation. I always await the next in line of the series; my Kindle's battery gets a workout when these arrive.
4	1364169600	For a series with something close to thirty-seven books you'd think that there could not possibly be anything left to add. You'd be wrong. Eve & Roarke still sizzle and the murders that Eve solves still have something new and interesting to offer. Somehow Ms. Robb manages to keep the series feeling fresh, even after all that has gone before. I know I'll be excited to see the next one when it hits the stores!
5	1364169600	It is hard to believe that this series is 20 years old.  It is as fresh today as it was then.
5	1364169600	This was another successful addition to the J.D. Robb "in death" series. I always look forward to what will be the next story line. I enjoy both of her styles of writing. It has been interesting to see Eve grow and change. In both her personal life and her working life. Please keep writing J. D. Robb. Ever thought about this as a television series?  I'd be your number one fan!
5	1364169600	Another hit from JD Robb. The main and sub story lines are great, and of course it was great to see all the old characters back
5	1364169600	Really enjoyed. The author used each of the main characters in such a unique way. They seemed so real to me. Once I began reading, I didn't want to put it down!
5	1364169600	All of the In Death Series are awesome reads, and Calculated in Death did not disappoint. If you have not read the entire series I recommend that you start now.
3	1364169600	I enjoyed following the latest book in the series, but it is lacking the personal stories of the characters.. It definitely details the crime, but the main characters have no real storyline anymore...
4	1364169600	Good, love the usual parties, keeping up with the day to day happenings of the crew -  friends and coworkers
4	1364169600	I Always look forward to new books in this series.  Love the plot lines.Her discriptive writing is always fun to read.
5	1364169600	I love the InDeath series and this ranked right up there with all the rest of them.  The only complaint is it didn't last long enough and now I have to wait for another new one.
4	1364169600	J.D. Robb never disappoints the reader.  Always a new twist and scenario in each book.  Eve Dallas rocks.  This would make a great television series.
5	1364169600	Yet another great read in the Eve Dallas Death Series by JD Robb.  Some new characters introduced along with the usual mottly crew.
5	1364169600	As always J.D. Robb didn't let me down. I have read every book in this series and each one is as good if not better than the last.
5	1364169600	Always enjoy this series.  The combination of romance and suspense is captivating.  Love the characters and the slightly futuristic setting.
4	1364169600	I enjoyed the book.  Robb kept the interaction going between her characters.  This is something she has gotten away from in some of her newer books which detracts from the enjoyment of the books.  Also, some of &#34;scenes&#34; are just rehashes from her other books in the series.
5	1364083200	I always love the J.D. Robb books and this one didn't disappoint with her usual mix of seriousness and humour. I found the deaths in this one especially the one that started the investigation more sad than anything especially compared to the gore of the last book.I found myself laughing several times through out so that was a big plus. The one minus was that it was blindingly obvious at least I thought so, who the 'bad guy' was as soon as we met him even though several were introduced, though it is explained that Eve looks at them all because they all have motive and certainly could have done it.All in all a good book that I enjoyed reading.
5	1364083200	i  really enjoyed this book as i always do with J D Robb keeps you entertained all the way throughthank you J D ROBB AKA NORA ROBERTS YOU ROCK
5	1364083200	once again, j.d. robb (nora roberts) has delivered a very satisfying update on the life and times of eve dallas and roarke.  the story lines continue to hold the reader's interest, and the characters continue to develope in their lives in a way that keeps the reader coming back for more.  no disappointment with this one!!
5	1364083200	These books are great! They keep you so involved that you hate to have to put them down. I'm always trying to guess who did it
4	1364083200	The story line in Calculated in Death was not as complex as Ms. Roberts usual story lines.  However, the writing was good and the ending somewhat surprising.  A good summer read.
3	1364083200	This book was so much like her others it felt like a formula. I saw no new character development and found it too predictable.
5	1364083200	I've loved the Dallas/Roarke team since its inception with &#34;Marked in Death&#34; and while this latest one doesn't have all the twists of some of the others do, it still entertains.
5	1364083200	J.D.Robb continues to bring the the personal character traits to her main characters to new levels so that they seem to actually have lived. I always look forward to her next book.
4	1364083200	I ave read every book in the In Death series and have enjoyed them all.  JD Robb brings Eve and Roarke to life and it makes you feel like they are a part of your life.  Keep writing JD Robb - can't wait for the next one in the series!
5	1364083200	I love the Death novels by J D Robb.  They go too fast and now I cannot wait until the next one.
3	1364083200	Reading this book didn't even feel like I was reading JD Robb/Nora Roberts.  There was a decent enough plot, but everything else seemed pale in comparison to earlier books in the series.  Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that there isn't much character development left to reveal for main cadre, or perhaps faithful readers have heard the descriptions so many times that they start to sound scripted, but for whatever reason, this book almost felt like it was ghost-written by some new kid on the block.  Looking forward to getting back to the old JD Robb.
3	1364083200	In death books can always keep me up late into the night to devour them but this particular one was not a smooth read. Something seems to be missing. Went back to read the previous books esp. Portrait in Death and that was much better! Hopefully the next installment will not disappoint.
5	1364083200	and I guess it takes all kinds. Got me thinking about the Seven Deadly Sins and I'm not even Catholic! But if you consider those and The Ten Commandments I guess you've got EVIl coming and going.....Is this my favorite book in the series? No, but I would be hard pressed to name only one. However, it was still a delicious read and brought in more details from Celebrity In Death. I still consider Greed as a major factor in most crimes, whether it be avarice in the extreme form such as our recent market meltdown due to investment bankers or in Bernie Madoff's case. We'll probably never see a single investment banker punished for what they did but but that will sort itself out at the Pearly Gates.........I managed to get it read in less then 24 hours. Was it as involved a plot as most of Eve's cases are? No, but she deserves an easy one once in a while.Once again Eve and Rourke put themselves on the front lines of "in harm's way" to protect the innocents from harm. Fortunately they've got some serious back-up.But once again Eve and the NYPSD get their men.
5	1364083200	Every Eve Dallas and Roarke Book is an impatiently anticipated Treasure, and the wait is always worth it!!!!!!  I really love the relationships in this series: between Eve and Roarke - tender, respectful, funny, sensual and HOT; between Eve and her collection of friends - a delightful guidebook to what friendship means, is and does.If you haven't read this series, I recommend that you start with &#34;Naked In Death&#34; and read them in order so you can watch Eve and Roarke and her collection of friends grow and mature and worm their way into your heart!!!  Hang on it's a great ride because this is the 36th book in the series!!!!!
5	1364083200	Eve has become a much more sure of herself character.Delia again is growing upLoved seeing how she continues to be afraid of getting her beauty regime completed
5	1364083200	I love absolutely all of JD Robb's books about Dallas...there is nothing like sitting down and a long day's work and solving crimes with Eve Dallas
5	1364083200	Excellent as always!  Don't know anyone her caliber!  Excellent pager turner!  A good read for sitting home and just reading!
5	1364083200	I can't wait for the next one in the Eve Dallas Series! I just hope I didn't skip any of them.
5	1364083200	I always look forward to a new &#34;Death&#34; book by J. D. Robb and this is another hit.  The storyline was captivating and it was very hard to put down to go to bed.  I simply devour all the J. D. Robb books (I have read all of them) and am so unhappy to get to the end as I want the story to go on and on. The love between Dallas and Roarke is beautiful. I look forward to the next one.  J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) write faster!
5	1364083200	I have read every book in the series, some better than others, I thought this was one of her best.
5	1364083200	I am a fan of Nora Roberts with the other thousand of fans- superb writer, have all of her &#34;in Death&#34;editions ---
5	1364083200	As always a very good read and enjoyable!  Will be anxious to see what is next!  Keep them coming, Nora!
5	1364083200	I love this series.  Eve and Roarke are great characters.  Despite future setting the mysteries are current.  Support characters are like old friends.
5	1364083200	I Loved this book. They get better & better. Can't wait for the next book to come out! Nora Roberts is awesome!
5	1364083200	J. D. Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) story lines keep getting better and better. I love the way the characters have evolved since the beginning.
5	1364083200	Another great read from the mistress of storytelling. Keep up the great work can not wait till the next one.
5	1364083200	I have all of the &#34;in death&#34; books and have enjoyed them all.  My only criticism is that the books do seem to be getting smaller, and the plot lines alittle less in depth.  I still enjoyed this book and wished it would have gone on for alot longer.
3	1364083200	I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH J.D. ROBB'S WRITING STYLE. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF HER ABBREVIATIONS LIKE VID FOR VIDEO.
2	1364083200	I wasnt as exciting as other jd robbs books, to predictable, could have done witha better ending. It just went puff.
5	1364083200	I love this series! I have read them all and this one didn't disappoint! Can't wait for the next one!
5	1364083200	I am a huge JD Robb (Nora Roberts) fan and the In Death series continues to hold me from the first page.  Highly recommend Calculated... and would encourage any reader to start at the beginning of the seriesp tks see how the whole world of Eve Dallas and Roarke evolves.
4	1364083200	Love eve Dallas books.  This one was not as good as previous books but still a good read.  Can not write fast enough to me.
5	1364083200	I thoroughly enjoyed every page. The author reintroduced most of our favorite characters and told a fascinating tale without the unnecessary gore and violence that she used in just a few of her previous books. I have read every book to date and eagerly await the next one.
5	1364083200	Always look forward to her books and try to figure out the villain aloing the way.  My only fault would be that the books come to  an end too quickly.  Love them!!
3	1364083200	I have read every one of the Robb books.  This one is not a re-read and I found it flat.  I was disappointed, as I usually can not wait for next books, and this one let me down.  It was not a bad book, but it was not a really good read that you expect out of this author.
5	1364083200	I was pulled in with the first murder and then felt the pressure to solve the crime before another died.  It was everything I was expecting it to be.
5	1364083200	This series with Dallas and Roarke continues to be gripping and interesting.  Their relationship is still evolving and always a gem.Great escape reading and always an interesting puzzle to solve.
5	1364083200	I like all of her books (Robb books)I thought this one was a little abbreviated but of course I am not the author only the readerAs such I could read on forever.I am missing some characters, not too much of Mavis & family this time around and have not heard of Charles and Louise for ahwile-(only little refereces nothing as to waht they were actually doign ) which would make the content a little longerKeep up this series, I absolutely love them------
5	1364083200	She never disappoints with every book. Excellent read, keep them coming J. D. Enjoyed the characters which keep getting better and better.
5	1364083200	One of those, can't put down books, I love Eve and her great stories.  I have read most of the In Death books.
3	1364083200	Dear Nora: I have been reading your books for over 20 years. When I found out about JD Robb I ordered all the ones I'd missed. I've enjoyed Eve, Roarke and the gang far more than any other literary characters. You have given so much to the world of readers and I personally thank you.That said, I'm finding it hard to justify what I pay for what you have been putting out there recently. It seems Robb gets more of your time with Roberts stealing what creativity there is.Please don't rest on your laurels yet. There just has to be more!
5	1364083200	as usual this story combined an excellent mystery with an amazing relationship among the returning characters-especially between eve and roarke. it left me wanting story AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
5	1364083200	As usual J D Robb does it again.  Can't wait for the nexdt one!  Keep up the great work and please writ faster lol
5	1364083200	Had me guessing all the way through....again love the characters.  A great story told, and was sorry when I finished it.
5	1364083200	As always full of action, wonderful characters, a wonderful book. I always enjoy her books and recommend them to anyone who likes mystery novels.
5	1363996800	Love all of the death books. Can't put them down once you start reading. Can't wait for the next one.
5	1363996800	I want to keep reading about these characters.  Wish the story would go a bit further at the end to include the socialization of the characters and not just the business of murder.  Love it anyway.
5	1363996800	I have read this entire series and love them all. Can't wait for the next one to come out. Have others reading them now also.
5	1363996800	I'm a JDRobb huge fan, and I loved this book. The characteres are more real, more emotional and more rich. Perfect as always!
4	1363996800	Lt. Eve Dallas is preparing for the 'vid' premier of the story surrounding her investigation into the Icove murders. As luck would have it, Eve is pulled into a complicated murder investigation of an accountant, and mother of two, who was found with her neck broken and the whole business made to look like a robbery gone bad. The only problem is Eve isn't buying it because things just aren't adding up.&#34;Calculated in Death&#34; gives us the opportunity to see Eve navigating Roarke's world, one of high finance and technology. As the body count rises, Eve matches wits with a cunning killer who has no fear because it's just a job.While this was not my favorite &#34;In Death&#34; story, it did give me an opportunity to visit New York circa 2060, and a cast of characters that I am familiar with and love. And I look forward to reading the next one.
5	1363996800	I have read all of the Death series books and loved them all.J. D. Robb is a wonderful writer.  You get to know all the characters as if in real life, and she adds a lot of humor to the story, also.
5	1363996800	I have read every one of her books under J.D.Robb and find them easy reading or listening, entertaining and light. Cannot wait until the next one comes out.
5	1363996800	I love the entire series!!!! Never been disappointed!!! I picked up survivor in death in a bin of books outside a bathroom in Mammoth while camping. I have read ever single one in the series.
5	1363996800	All of her books keep on the edge of your chair.  They always hold your attention and keep you coming back for more.
5	1363996800	JD Robb's books continue to thrill and satisfy...although this one was a little harder to read since the first victim was an accountant and so is my husband!
3	1363996800	Nothing new here for Robb fans. Uses the same formula as most of the other Death books, from the not-what-it-seems murder scene to the dreaded special event, the hated makeup session and the spill-his-guts conspirator. Only aspect in the least bit different was the lack of scene time for the bad guy behind it all. Dallas didn't even have her usual gloat scene at the end and the reader got no closure. In all, not a horrible read just horribly predictable.
5	1363996800	Great book.  I love all of her books but this was one of the best. I also liked that the author did not get so deep into Eve's past and psychological traumas. In the last few books there seemed to be more emphasis on that the on the current story. Great read!
5	1363996800	I have read every one of these and look forward to each new one.  I love thecharacters and the way they are written, suspense, humor and great characters.I usually read them so fast I wish I could slow down and really relish them!!
5	1363996800	Love the character Dallas. Tough, yet tender, along with a super rich, handsome, rugged husband, and a butler that does the household chores can't be beat. The book would stand on it's own, but reading the series from the beginning is a definite plus.
4	1363910400	J.D. Robb always delivers a good, interesting story in her &#34;In Death&#34; series.  Eve Dallas grabbed me from the first page of the first book.  No deep philosophical stuff, just good escapist reading --police procedural set in the future, with a romance angle.  I enjoyed this book as usual, but it didn't quite reach the standard of previous books in the series -- the plot and characters were not as engaging as usual.  However, an Eve Dallas book that doesn't reach the level of previous ones is still a lot better than many other series.  So, it's well worth the purchase.
3	1363910400	This was the first book in the series which stroke me as a purely filler episode. There was nothing new in the relationships of the longtime characters, no real insights into the perps' motivations or even interest in them. So, it felt like a book written by rote. Still, it is a professional story, otherwise well written and with that humor that usually entertains in between the crime and the love interest. Therefore three stars still seem appropriate. The next one this year promises to be much more interesting so I am thankfull for Ms. Roberts proliferate writing.
4	1363910400	This is a good addition to the series.  It isn't the best book of the series, but is well worth the price of the kindle edition.  I hope the series continues.
4	1363910400	Nothing explosive about the first deceased- just a happy working-family woman who was considered less than nothing by the killers. But this is still enough to have Eve and Co. ready to tackle on the killers and her fandom. Eve, Roarke, Peabody, etc all stayed true to who they were but the rest of the cast of characters seemed more like cardboard than anything else. This read was quicker than usual. Added a star simply because I like this story line.
5	1363910400	Amazing. They just keep getting better! J.D. Robb rocks! The story of Eve and Roarke is so easy to sink into. Sometimes I never want to leave.
5	1363910400	jJD ROBB OR NORA ROBERTS WRITES BOOKS THAT WILL MAKE YOU KEEP READING FROM BEGINNING  I HAVE READ THE WHOLE &#34;IN DEATH&#34; SERIES AND I LOVE IT.
5	1363910400	Everything she writes is 5 stars and in the J.D. Robb series all her readers want to be &#34;in the family&#34; of characters.
5	1363910400	As usual, J. D. Robb keeps the story moving quickly. Dallas and Roarke still sizzle white hot.  Peabody has moved past the sycophant underling and is now a genuine partner.
5	1363910400	I love all of the In Death books. I hate when I finish the last one because I have to wait for the next one. Keep them coming!!
5	1363910400	Well, JD Robb has done it again.  This book, like all of the others in the 'In Death' series was great.  A story well told is addictive and begs to be read again and again.  The steps taken to find the protaganist were well researched and the back story was well done and connected with the previous books in the series.  Once started, I couldn't put it down. Great Job !
4	1363910400	As always with this &#34;in death&#34; series the story continues with Eve Dallas. The characters are most believable & the plot intense.
5	1363910400	Love all E & R stories!. Just bought all the books for my Kindle, Lovely in the series of 5, and I'm going thru all in order. I do have most in paperback but since I bought a Kindle I don't have the newer ones in paperback. I've decided to buy only books I plan to keep on the e-reader since I can't give the ones I don't want any more away even though I own them, which is the biggest problem with e-readers
5	1363824000	This story was captivating. As always greed is a great motivator to commit crimes. I loved getting reacquainted with all of the characters. I could literally see them go about their routines. It was especially moving to see the tender way Roarke takes care of Eve and how they have become a unit. Can hardly wait till the next book!
5	1363824000	I have read every single book from the beginning and there was never a bad book among them, I look forward to her next one already!!!!!
5	1363824000	I love the &#34;In Death&#34; series.  Always some twists and turns not expected.  Love the characters, easy reading, especially since you already know and love the main characters.A little predictable in the end, but still a great read.&#9829;&#9829;&#9829;&#9829;
4	1363824000	This series has long been my guilty pleasure, and it continues with this book. It's a totally unrealistic universe, but it's warm and comfortable, with interesting crime plots, and a healthy dose of love and friendship.
5	1363824000	Absolutely wonderful!!!  Another Eve Dallas mystery that captures your attention with the first sentence.  The only problem I have is that 386 pages is not enough!
3	1363824000	I had a 'luke warm' like for Calculated in Death.  I love this series of books and have read each one multiple times. I got the strong impression someone other than JD Robb wrote it, which was disappointing.
5	1363824000	This is the latest in a great series.  It is by far my favorite series.  It was the only books I bought in hardcover, now I have bought the last three on my Kindle.I have read all the books in the series.  The main characters have been developed over time & seem like real people.  There is also a group of secondary characters that has grown to be a large part of the whole story.The series is set about 60 years in the future.  Some of the new inventions sound great, but people remain the same.
5	1363824000	The characters continue to grow and add to an exciting reading adventure. I've read every "In Death" book at least twice (excluding "Calculated") and love how the characters evolve.
4	1363824000	After all these years JD Robb still tells a great story. I was entertained and always want the next story when I'm done.
5	1363824000	As always, a wonderful mystery with twists and turns. I love all the people in this series and how their character continues to grow and expand. Can Eve deal with one more friend? I'm looking forward to the next book.
5	1363824000	I love the &#34;In Death&#34; series by J.D. Robb.  I could hardly wait until the latest book and I wasn't disappointed. I read the book in just a couple of days. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommend to other readers.
5	1363824000	This is another in a great series by JD Robb.  Can't wait for the next book to be available to read.
5	1363824000	J.D. Robb has done her usual great job of writing about the future.  Eve Dallas is a great heroine.  When I first started reading these books, 2059 and 2060 seemed far in the future.  The things Ms. Robb include in her stories don't seem that far fetched anymore.  Great stories!!
5	1363824000	as someone who had found a few of robbs recent death series books to be lacking in many ways i was pleasantly surprised to find this one up to the old standards.  i was beginning to think she had turned the series over to ghost writers (or new ones anyway) that were trying to make eve a bit too pleasant and yuppy like (roarke too..god forbid) but eve seems to have found herself again..maybe a bit more mellow and appreciative of others but not the yuppy joy/joy she was becoming.
5	1363824000	Terrific read.  I enjoy this JD Robb series.  Like it even better on my Kindle!!  Am working on reading the entire series..
5	1363824000	Loved it. I can't wait until the next one comes out. All books in this series have been wonderful. I love her writing.
5	1363824000	Awesome! I love when we get to see Dallas and the team in situations that don't revolve around crime. I also love when I don't have the whole story figured out before the story plays out.
5	1363824000	I don't know how J. D. Robb can write all these books and the others she writes as they are all so good and different. Where does she get all her ideas. I know she writes two a year as J. D. Robb and a lot of others as Nora Roberts. She is a great story teller.
5	1363824000	The stories involving Eve, Roarke and company just don't seem to get old!! Every book either evolves someone's character a little more--details that add to the back story --or bring in details from other stories so that you're always kept aware of what happened in the book before without being repetitive or boring.I  can't wait for the next &#34;in death&#34;
5	1363824000	I've read every In Death book so far.  I can wait for the next one.  I recommend it to all readers.
5	1363824000	This was a great story.  As usual J D Robb wrote a very interesting story.  I l enjoyed it very much.
5	1363824000	I just love this whole series! I really like the dyamics between Eve, Sommerset and all of her other friends. The love between Eve & Roarke is awesome!
5	1363824000	Calculated in Death is a great adition to the In Death series.  It has humor, suspense, romance.  I love the recurring characters.
5	1363824000	Robb never disapoints me,  Eve and Roarke are like my favorite people, they are real.  All their suport family are just as real. I have the whole family.  I realy like the future aspect of the Death series.  Thanks Robb for giving my husband and myself hours of escape into your creative mind.  Thank You
5	1363824000	Love the series. Consistently good stories.  One of my favorite series and authors.  One I can enjoy going back and rereading parts of books referred to in later books.
5	1363824000	I have read all of the J. D. Robb books and this one is definitely as great as the first!
5	1363824000	All of JD Robb's death series books are wonderful! Once started hard to put down. Love the small spots in each story that have me smiling, chuckling and laughing!
5	1363824000	have read all the J.D.Robb books and loved all of them ...... great story lines ....... the characters are all very interesting and entertaining.  Highly recommend this and all the other J.D.Robb books.  I would label these as adult reading.
5	1363824000	I love her books.  They keep your interest and are easy to read. Can't wait for her next one.  You do not need pictures.
5	1363824000	J.D. Robb is my favorite author.  I have read every one of the &#34;In Death&#34; series and this latest book follows in the tradition of great mysteries.
5	1363824000	JD Robb writes a wonderful woven story and I get excited when I see her latest book has been released as I can be assured that I am in for the armchair adventure of my life, she never disappoints and I can thoroughly recommend her books to all and in fact have done so. I eagerly await Eve and Rourke's next adventure.
5	1363824000	I like Eve Dallas and I have been pleasently surprised that JD Robb can keep turning them out without them becoming too repetative.  I think the key is that she links enough actions back to old books that things seem &#34;familiar&#34; rather than routine.  This one had several laughs, a few old friends pop up, and the usual death/mayhem/and murder.  If you are looking for something completely orginal and new, this isn't it, but if you want to come back in to the Eve Dallas world of murder, it's a nice return.
5	1363824000	I admit I am addicted to the In Death series and this one does not disappoint.  Good, storeylines and flashes of humor ensure an enjoyable read as usual, I have already pre ordered the next book.
5	1363824000	True to form with Eve Dallas and the entire J D Robb cast of characters. Never a dull moment here.
5	1363824000	Great read .JD Robb is a very good writer.In death series  are the best books to read .I have read every book published.
5	1363824000	The Eve Dallas and Roarke characters are my favorite of all time.  I read and reread them on my Ipad.  Looking forward to the next one!!!
5	1363824000	Loved it....JD Robb is the best caractor Nora Roberts writes about its always so interesting  Would read all her books and I have.
5	1363824000	Has always jd robb keeps you wanting to read more, could not put it down. I recommended this book to everyone.
4	1363824000	Love the characters, Eve, Peabody, Roarke.  Not my favorite, and some of the characters that I enjoy weren't used as much this time.  Not as much of the futuristic feel to it either.  I do enjoy Eve's coming to grips with her past more and more.
5	1363824000	I like everything that JD Robb has written which explains the five stars.  This is probably not the most compelling of all of these &#34;in Death&#34; books but there are some delightful elements of Dallas' homelife that I really enjoyed as well as a cracking mystery.
5	1363824000	A mystery that keeps you guessing and an ongoing steamy love story, what more could you ask for?? Another great book by J.D. Robb that has Eve and Peabody chasing bad guys and saving babies. A great read.
5	1363824000	Loved it.  I have read all of this series and I have enjoyed each and every book.  I even read parts to my husband.
5	1363824000	I wasn't disappointed in JD Robb's latest Eve Dallas adventure.  My only disappointment was when I finished the last word. I know have to wait for her next novel.
5	1363824000	I've been reading this series from the very beginning, before I knew that J.D. Robb was Nora Roberts, and I've been watching her writing mature and grow more incisive with every book.  The one before this was my favorite in the series thus far, and I worried that there would be a drop-off, as that was beyond intense.I was wrong.  My new mantra should be &#34;Just trust Nora.&#34;While this wasn't as intense - and the crimes this time were more ordinary, I suppose - the writing was at the same high level.It is always a pleasure to read the work of a mistress of her craft.  And it was wonderful to see Eve and Roarke and all our old friends (and some new ones) working and breathing and loving once more.
5	1363824000	I love JD Robb &#34;Nora Roberts&#34;  always a pleasure to spend time with Eve, Roake and the gang.  Read it in two days and I am sure I will read it again
5	1363824000	I have read every book in this series and have completely enjoyed every one of them.  Nora Roberts, aka J.D. Robb is such an interesting storyteller.
5	1363824000	Fans of the IN DEATH series will love this new book which is the perfect blend of mystery, fun, passion and character
5	1363824000	Just finished Calculated in Death and I loved it! Can't get enough Eve and Rourke! As always, the story pulls you in and keeps you there!
5	1363824000	Great book that keeps you guessing right up to the end. I loved it, cant wait for the next one
4	1363824000	I could not put this down, and can not wait to read the next one. Story line kept me on the edge. Fun, Fast and exciting book.
3	1363824000	I've read every J.D.Robb mystery and looked forward to this with eager anticipation, but it definitely let me down. Except for the usual tender and/or passionate love scenes between Roarke and Eve, the book struggled to be interesting until the last third. I think the problem is the subject matter! The writing is intricate and the mystery well developed, but I just couldn't get interested in the various aspects of bookkeeping. And some of the characters that usually spice up the stories (Mavis, Nadine, Summerset, Feeney) were either missing or put in just a token appearance. I'm a big fan, but this is not one of her best.
5	1363824000	As usual, another great read from JD Robb. Love all her characters and devious villains. I hope she keeps them coming. Would love to see Dallas and Roarke with a baby in a future book.
5	1363824000	Whether writing as JD Robb or Nora Roberts she NEVER disapoints. Her books are riveting and take me right into her stories
5	1363824000	I have yet to read an &#34;In Death&#34; that I did not like. My only regret is that it took me so long to make the leap from Nora Roberts to her alter-ego.
5	1363824000	I love the &#34;in death&#34; series.  I have read them all and cannot wait for each one to come out.  Although it is future fiction, it is fun to see what the possibilities of life could be like in 50 years.  The stories are well writen, with suspense, humor, action, love, and history.
5	1363824000	I really enjoy the Eve Dallas stories I have read them all I like the mystery, romance, humor and the futuristic settin
4	1363824000	I like the romance along with the mystery.  The plot is such that you don't know for sure until the very end.
5	1363824000	I am a tremendous fan of the JD Robb series and look forward to each new installment and the addition of new friends into their circle.
5	1363824000	J. D. Robb's series with Eve Dallas is my current favorite.  I hope there are many more forthcoming.  Great read
4	1363824000	Once again JD Robb has delivered a winner.  I would have liked to hear more from old &#34;friends&#34;, but hopefully we will get back to that in the next installment.  Good plot development and the expected plot twists help to create another winner in the Dallas series.  Can't wait to read the next one!
5	1363824000	One of her better books. I have read twice now. Can't wait until the next come out. Will tell friends
5	1363824000	Wonderful. Have all of her books! It was a little typical however what can we expect when trying to stay the same
5	1363737600	I bought this book because I enjoyed the other books by this author. It is worth the $ and is a fun read!!!
5	1363737600	Picking up an IN DEATH book guarantees a mystery, a thrill and a heart-pounding ride. But what sets these books apart is the growth of the characters and their relationships. They resound and they have heart.
5	1363737600	It reminded me of an episode of American greed. Loved the follow-up from previous books. Looking forward to her next work.
5	1363737600	The latest in the Death series is fast-paced and has a good story line.  There were plenty of suspects who had the motive and the means to pull off the murders (a financial audit can send some of the nicest people over the edge!)  It soon became apparent to Eve that it wasn't all about the money!
5	1363737600	Excellent book as usual - regular characters are my favorite part!  Love the human part along with the murder.Thanks!
4	1363651200	I was wishing so hard for this one to be up to par with most of the others.I have to admit the financials became boring.I love Eve and Roarke and don't always expect lots of blood and mayhem, but I do hate to be bored.The love story does continue, but the murder was slow and uninteresting.The edge just wasn't here.
5	1363651200	I have read all of the Eve Dallas books, and love them.  This book is no exception.  I love the characters and the relationships that have built over the series.  I only wish I didn't have to wait for the next book!
4	1363651200	CALCULATED IN DEATH, the 36th book in the In Death series, emphasized the police procedural. This story was very focused on Eve solving the case of the death of an accountant, mother of two and happily married. She also happened to be the sister-in-law of one of Eve's favorite judges.This mystery finds Eve deep in the world of big business. Luckily, she has an expert guide in her husband Roarke who is the biggest of big businessmen. Eve has to follow the trail and untangle the threads that bind a number of companies together uncovering fraud, money laundering, and other scams while she is digging. Along the way another accountant is killed and one of the partners in an investment business too. Eve is pretty sure which over-privileged but not over-bright executive is pulling the strings but she has to set herself up as a target before they can catch the underling who is actually doing the killing.This was a very enjoyable mystery and I loved the byplay between Eve and Roarke. This one showed how well they have come to know each other and how well they work in tandem. But I missed the contributions of the many characters we have seen in the series. The only other character who had a substantial role in this one was Peabody who was her charming self. We just had cameos by McNab and Feeney, Mira and Nadine Furst, and Mavis and Leonardo.I liked the recurring references to the upcoming movie premiere and the necessity for Eve's appearance on the Red Carpet. You could just tell that Eve would rather be anywhere else. At least, she wanted to be anywhere else until she arranged to trap the killer there. I also liked that Eve was more nervous about having Trina do her hair and make-up than she was at the possibility that the killer would succeed in his plan to eliminate Eve and Peabody.Fans of the series won't want to miss this one. I think it would also work for newcomers to the series as an entry point without having to read the previous 35 books.
4	1363564800	I kind of wish she'd skip the sex scenes, or maybe just label them like [sex scene 1 - angry sex] [sex scene 2 - tender sex] because these scenes don't change over the years.  However, as formulaic as the J.D. Robb books are I still enjoy them.  There's generally a fun new character.  Some jerks always get their comeuppance (how DO you spell that word?).  Dallas always has to punch some junkie or have some blood or bruise from a case that isn't hers.  It's in here.But I like these books.  I've read every one and will continue until she bores me.  FYI, I do not like her writing under Nora Roberts. I liked Roberts early stuff, but it has degenerated to a place that I can't go.  But these books continue to entertain and I'll keep paying the price for the moment.
5	1363564800	I've followed this series since the beginning and have enjoyed every book. I look forward to each one. I love the characters and interesting plots!
5	1363564800	This book was very good, I couldn't put it down, can't wait for the next book this series! Love that I can down load it and read right away! No waiting anymore for me!!
5	1363564800	J. D. Robb  never disappoints.  This is a great addition to the Death series.  Hard to put this one down.  Fast paced and intriguing.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Cannot wait for the next book in the series.  Don't miss this one.
5	1363564800	love all of j d robb books, have read them all! Can't wait until another one is written.  I always pre-order.
5	1363564800	As always JD continues to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Can't wait for her next one to come out.
5	1363564800	Another good case for Eve and partner. As usual keeps it real to the end. ALWAYS a good read from this author.
5	1363564800	Robb doesn't disappoint again. Always a sure bet of a great book.  I can't get enough of Eve and Roark.
5	1363564800	Best books.  Lots of entertainment.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.  Eve just keep getting better.
3	1363478400	With the JD Robb In Death series, Nora Roberts has found a (her) formula.  It's almost programmed/scripted.  Change character/victim/sex here, change villain here, change number of victims, change number of villains here, throw in a nightmare and/or a fight with hubby, a couple of gratuitous sex scenes and, at least, one attack on herself and/or Peabody and solve the case by use of verbal judo. Happy endings, happy endings, who doesn't love a story with a happy ending!The reality is Lieutenants don't investigate murders.  They oversee and direct the efforts of their investigators.  They also do not go back-to-back-to-back with sensationalized cases.  I am all for women's rights, don't get me wrong!  However, Eve Dallas has seen more cases of murder, mayhem and madness than is possible and we're lead to believe that she is the only person who can solve these crimes. It's almost as overblown as the Jodi Arias and Casey Anthony trials.
5	1363478400	As always she has twists and turns.  Loved this one, not my favorite, but it is up there.  Look forward to the next one
5	1363392000	Again Robb (Roberts) entertained me with a great read.  But a heads up to new readers, if you have not read any of the In Death series do not start with this one.  The first time I read  the series I read it out of order, reading which ever book I could find at the library.  It worked, the second time through I read them in order, loved the series even more.  With this book I just feel that you have  to know the characters to enjoy them.  A great read in the series, yes, a great stand alone, not so much.
4	1363392000	I have read the entire "In Death" series and didn't like this one as well as some of the others.  I found the subject of accounting, financial advisors and other business types to be boring and I needed a scorecard to keep track of the various characters and the firms that they worked for or belonged to.  That being said, I find these books enjoyable because of the characters and how they relate to one another.  All of the characters feel so real to me with Eve and Roarke's relationship growing deeper the longer they are together and Peabody and McNab, Mavis and Leonardo and even the baby Bella providing a rich background of secondary characters whose lives develop from one book to the next.  I wouldn't advise a new reader to start with this book as the backstory from prior books plays an important role in this one.  My advice is to begin with book one and read them in order.  I have read them all and look forward to the next in the series.
5	1363392000	I have every in death book there is and have enjoyed the character of Dallas and Roark- they are so life like that you find yourself laughing out loud and even a tear now and then.  I love the mystery and how she goes about finding the person she is after and she does find them.....make no mistake....interesting and a page turner...
5	1363392000	I was so excited.  Of all of the death series, the last book lost the humor I love so much with all. Characters.  It came back and was better than ever.
5	1363392000	I enjoy these "Death" books. They have love, suspense, action and romance. I find them to be a fairly quick read, but that's because once I start, I can't put them down. The star of these books are Eve Dallas, but the rest of the characters have become well-rounded. I feel like I've gotten to know them. And, I learn more in each book.  Fast paced and very enjoyable. Well written.
5	1363392000	Solving the crime, shutting down a criminal organization, saving lives and throughout showing her huge heart. Gotta love Lieutenant Eve Dallas!
2	1363305600	Wow there were hyphens everywhere. So many it became distracting.Who edited this his?I'm sorry but 7 hyphens on one page is a hot mess!
5	1363305600	If you're a JD Robb fan/fan of the series and of Dallas/Rourke/Peabody/etc, buy it. Read it. You won't be sorry! I wasn't (:
5	1363305600	As with the rest of the series, this one is great!  It's comforting to see Rourke and Eve as a happily married couple. The mystery is a good read, but I really like the interaction among all the characters. I've read every book in the &#34;In Death&#34; series, and I look forward to visiting with old friends.
5	1363305600	Eve Dallas in her element.  Peabody getting stronger.  Token appearance by Summerset and Mavis.  To top it off Trina gets her hands on Dallas again.
4	1363305600	For some reason this book didn't seem to be like all the previous books where although there was murder there was also more interaction and humor between all the main characters. While reading it I kept wondering if Nora's heart was in it or is she tired of writing the series as there is only so much you can write before repeating yourself.  Maybe its time to end the series with Eve and Rourke having a baby, God what a funny story that would make.  In saying this I am still a die hard fan and this was a good read but not what I am used to.
1	1363305600	This book was so &#34;blah&#34; that I couldn't even finish it. Not at all what I have come to expect from JD Robb. I'm beginning to wonder if its time to wrap up the Eve/ Roarke storyline.
4	1363305600	J.D. Robb continues to entertain me with her ongoing story of Lt Eve Dallas and Roarke and their whole crew.  I just wish one time Robb would actually let her characters participate in the festivities she talks about all through the book so we could see her enjoy a little bit of down time.
5	1363305600	Another fast paced story. We visit Detective Eve Dallas, her friends, husband and foe in another futuristic story that is hard to put down. At the end we hope that J.D. Robb, let's us spend some more time with these characters in another setting.
5	1363219200	Eve and Roarke continue their exciting life in this next installment in the In Death Series by Nora Roberts. 's Roberts continues to create new and exiting storylines with each book in her series and the love affair between the two main characters remains fresh  in this and all her books. A GOOD READ.
5	1363219200	This was a very good book.  I love all the J.D. Robb books and this one was no exception.  Eve and Peabody with the help of Roarke and McNabb get their killer with a lot of excitement going on throughout the investigation.
4	1363219200	J.D. Robb, in my opinion, can go no wrong with her Eve Dallas series. I found with some long running series that ever so often you can have an off book, or five, but you keep reading hoping for the magic to happen again. I can't recall if there ever was an Eve Dallas books I didn't love. I will typically re-read this series at least once a year. The newest in the series, Calculated in Death was just as good as previous stories. The one problem with reading the book instead of listening to the audio is that I always want to read the last chapter so I can see who the bad guy is. I contained myself this time and followed the mystery with Eve and Peabody as they worked their way through the world of high finance. And who knows that better than Roarke? With some great dialogue, a mystery to keep you guessing, and another wonderful story I just couldn't put this down. Ms. Robb is on my Must Buy list and will continue to be there because of such quality stories like this one.
3	1363219200	The plot is ok, as are the characters; however, Robb's vision of how things are in the future left me a little disappointed.
1	1363219200	I love JD Robb, i have read all her books and pre-ordered this one....however, i can't get through it.  Maybe after 30+ books, JD robb has lost its spark, but seriously, i am struggling to get through this.  I stopped ordering Nora books, because, like Danielle Steele, they are starting to be all the same.
5	1363219200	Great read. Loved the book. J.d.RObb never misses.  I can't wait for the next book  about EVe and company. Loved it.
5	1363219200	I have read all of her books, the story line was and is always different, but the lives of the characters is what makes up if the strory line drags a little.
5	1363219200	She keeps you interested with her writing style!  You never want to put one of her books down! Love her!
5	1363219200	Always wish there was more to read.  Robb writes so well it is hard to wait for the next book.
5	1363219200	Love all j.d. Robb books. Hope another one is already started. Think it's time for Dallas to have a child.
3	1363219200	Reading this book was jarring.  When did Eve become coarse and common?  She has always been described as hard-nosed and strong willed, but her language has changed.  It's thuggish. The expletives were so unlike her. She had strong language in the earlier books, but it evolved from her abusive background.  I could understand where she was coming from then.Why isn't Rourke having an influence on her?  She seems to be devolving. The emotional closeness between her and Rourke seemed to be missing, too.The further I got into this book, the more I wondered if Robb has become a Patterson and is farming out the writing of her novels to others.It had enough of the characters I like, such as Peabody, but they didn't ring true for me.  If it weren't for Peabody, I would have given it two stars only.
4	1363219200	J. D. Robb stories are a view into our possible future where people are still people, flawed, and always interesting. The author does a wonderful job of showing real to life relationships in difficult situations.
4	1363219200	I read this book over a weekend.  I have read every book in this series and can say that this book was a good read.  Ms. Roberts created another brilliant case that suited the characters. Although I must admit that after reading her previous novel in the series, "Delusion in Death," this was a bit of a let down.  Overall, I'd recommend it.
3	1363219200	I always love Nora Roberts and J.D Robb. They always keeps up the game. They must be good because I've just about read them all.
5	1363132800	In Eve and Roarke's story. I've enjoyed every SINGLE one! I can't wait for the next installment. I'm sure it'll seem like forever!
5	1363132800	As always these stories keep you rivitted to the pages. I am always sad when the story ends and can't wait for the next one!When will Eve and Rourke decide to have a baby?
3	1363132800	This book has all the characters of a J.D. Robb book, the cover even looks like an Eve Dallas book.  The only trouble is, the writing is not like the first ones of this series.  Eve, Peabody, Roarke,  everyone do not speak like they used to,  the word patterns and voice of the book are very different.Either Nora Roberts has hired ghost writers  (that's what I think)  or she has lost interest and just turned something out with not much effort.I had a real hard time finishing this one--  the cast of characters in it were pale imitations of the real ones.
4	1363132800	I really love this series and this book is no exception!  I cannot wait until Eve and Roarke decide to have a baby!
1	1363132800	i felt that this was written by someone much younger  i dont remember eve saying the f bomb soooo many times in one book
5	1363132800	Never disappointed in this series of books! Can't wait for the next .Romance and mystery is my cup of tea.
5	1363132800	Having dealt with a lot of soul searching and making progress in drawing slowly away from the parental shades which have darkened her life, Eve is back to Dallas.Once again we are repeated with an all-night, front to back, leaving us wanting more, and then some read.  The wit, repartee, and close, familial relationships hiding behind sarcasm and bitching returns one more, and we love and appreciate all of them.Rourke and LT have fun with one another and their love here is the free, exciting sexy and "best-buds" relationship which headlines and reappears throughout, and you just plain admire and take them in as your own again.Calculated moves quickly through the detect and surmise, plan and execute stages of jailing the prime criminal characters, flowing from start to finish.  It's as if the recent introspection of lives is given a delightful, light, happy interlude for the characters to enjoy their lives and, once more, return to the jobs they love so much.  Well, Rourke does if you concede his business empire can continue to grow without him for a few days and that his real job is the care and love of his wife while lending criminally acquired and honed e-skills to New York's Finest.And once again we ask,"when in the hell do we get to share these people once more!!"Calculate that...!
5	1363046400	I never tire of reading these novels. Futuristic does not normally interest me but I have read all of the in death novels and am always looking for the next. Enjoyed it but Roake could have been in it more
5	1363046400	Once again, JD Robb takes me into Eve's world and I only wish it didn't have to end. I love to see the character evolution through the series. I want more. Now, please.
4	1363046400	Not as exciting as some of the Eve Dallas books from before, but good. Would recommend to any who like this series.
5	1363046400	Always enjoy the stories of Lt. Eve Dallas and this one has more twist and turns then the last one.
5	1363046400	I have read every In Death Book and it is the same as the first one,you're there immediately.  Once you start you finish it.  I love these books.  Waiting for the next one.  Thank you Nora Roberts (J D Robb)
1	1363046400	Great book. Roark and Dallas very funny and exciting. I love the way Nora Roberts writes I give this book a five stars.
5	1363046400	I like JD Robb's writing, she make you want to read the next page until the last page and then you look forward to the next book
5	1363046400	Very good. The story line just keeps going with every book. She keeps the stories exciting n different. Love this series
5	1363046400	I love this author and I am looking forward to reading,  My order arrived a day early, which was awsome and everything is in perfect condition.  Thank you for the execellent service.
3	1362960000	This was a very slow read and that usually is not the case, but I had already figured this one out, and once again Eve gets her face messed up. The baby catch was good. I have all the Death Series and have found that this formula is beginning to get a little boring, but then again how Nora Roberts writes so many books, such a talent. I hope in the next book, there are a few changes. Possible promotion for Eve, about time for that. A baby on the way. How would the charaters handle that. Need a change mix it up a bit and stop getting hit in the face.
5	1362960000	As always, Nora Roberts doesn't disappoint! This is a good addition to the series. Love how you see their relationship progresses as the trust and love between them grows.
5	1362960000	The J.D. Robb series does it again. This is my absolute favorite series ever. The characters are so well done you feel like you know them. I'm always a little disappointed when I finish the book because then I have to wait for the next one. Eve Dallas is a butt-kicking hero with a soft side, even if she'd never admit it. Keep them coming!
5	1362960000	As always with this series once started I could not put down until the end. Writing either as J.D.  Robb or as Nora Roberts she continues to be my favorite author. I am amazed and impressed that one person can have so many stories to tell and tell them so well. I really enjoy the In Death series.
5	1362960000	As usual, I am on the edge of my seat!  I love her work and have read most of them.  She is on my &#34;favorite authors&#34; list.
4	1362960000	It's good. No big twists or turns. No wild sex or crazy people. Just a straight up crime to solve, which they do.
5	1362960000	Always a delight to reenter Eve and Roakes  story. They have such a great chemistry. The supporting players are like greeting old friends. Love this series.
5	1362960000	It is of course nice to revisit with the characters of Eve and Roarke's world....the main characters and the secondary characters. It's always nice to see Eve freak out whenever Trina shows up...lots of laughs and Galahad was hilariously funny
2	1362873600	I love, love, love this series. I've read them all and several more than once. But... this particular one is lacking.What's missing is the PUNCH. Sure Eve and Peabody do their investigation. Sure there is a killer. But there is no real nail biting suspense. None of the characters are in any real danger. Eve isn't in any lenghtly fist fights with bad guys. She's not throwing down. She's not fighting the system. She's not protecting Roarke. She's not saving Mira or Peabody.Roarke is smooth and loving but is missing his edge. Lacking his dangerous side. What happened to his enemy's like Ricker? What happened to his emotional turmoil? What happened to his desire to kill those who harm Eve. His bad side is just as important as his good loving side.There's little friction between the characters. It's as though they've all settled in. Are all happy with each other. Even Eve and Summerset are blah. Come On! Boring, boring, boring. Just like Ms. Robbs last novel I'm sad and sorry to say.I'm hoping for her next book to get back to those can't-put-em-down stories like Reunion In Death and New York to Dallas to name just a couple. There have been so many great ones. I NEED more.
4	1362873600	I enjoyed this book a lot. I love how from one book in this series to the next such different themes take place. In this instance Dallas and the team are solving a crime and also preparing for the premier of the movie. I particularly like the stories where the characters all come together in a big way. This is a brief review but I would definitely recommend this book if you love the series!
5	1362873600	I know it's a lot of the same, but I love them anyway. Reading one is like catching up with an old friend.  Try one you'll get hooked too. Lucine
4	1362873600	Enjoyed the book, but not as much as others in the 'In Death' series. It was too easy to put down for another day. The number of characters/suspects made it difficult to keep up with the Murder investigation, i.e., which firm do they work for?, how are they connected?, etc. Eve was typical Eve, Rourke was wonderful Rourke, and everyone else fell in place. Looking forward to the next book in this series. Can never satisfy my Rourke fix.
4	1362873600	Another consistent entry in Robb's in Death series. Not as violent as some of the others (thank goodness) but missing a little of the engaging back story and description of the world  and characters of the future.  It's a decent addition to the series but if you haven't read many of the other titles, you wind up wondering what the fuss is about.
5	1362873600	Only once in a blue moon is there an author that never fails to impress. This book picks right back up and throws you into the character's lives and loves. Definitely love to watch them grow and develop.
4	1362873600	I simply love all of J.D. Robb books. I have a vested interest in the characters and enjoy the relationships they call share. The whole &#34;Alexander&#34; thing got a bit confusing but I just kept reading and it worked itself out. Not her best but still worth a read.
2	1362873600	Sterile.  I don't really think Nora wrote this herself. Did you Nora? If so, it's the first time you have disappointed me to this extent. Wouldn't recommend this book.
5	1362873600	As always entertaining.  Still my favorite series and I read a lot of them. Can't wait for the next book.
5	1362873600	Never to miss an opportunity to be in the year 2060, I scooped this one up as soon as I knew it was available!  The story flows, the excitement doesn't end, and the imagery brings you right into the story!
3	1362873600	Don't quote me on the exact number, but I believe this book is the 33rd in J.D. Robb's &#34;In Death&#34; series - and I've certainly read my share of them. For those who might not know, J.D. Robb is the pseudonym of Nora Roberts, a No. 1 New York Times best-selling author of more than 200 novels. To say she's a prolific writer clearly doesn't do her justice.This series centers on the emotionally and physically scarred Lt. Eve Dallas and, in a lesser but no less intriguing role, her Irish rogue and billionaire businessman husband, Roarke. The plots are set in the relatively recent future - 2060 - just enough to add some interesting but believable elements like cars that drive themselves, programmable vending machines, healing &#34;wands&#34; that speed up the recovery process and (yuck!) Pepsi that comes in tubes.As Dallas, Roarke and the police department prepare for the premiere of a &#34;vid&#34; (movie) that's based on the successful conclusion of one of their major cases, a female accountant turns up dead outside a building that's under development. Mugging gone wrong? No, Dallas and her trusty partner Peabody soon determine. When they learn she'd been assigned to audit the books of a prominent company and her office files turn up missing, the plot begins to thicken.Tracking down her killer - and possibly the killer of a couple of others related to the accounting firm and audit - takes Dallas deep into the world of finance and illicit money-making schemes about which she knows far too little; of course, that means she turns to Roarke to ferret out what's really going on. When it becomes clear that she and her partner may be next on the killer's hit list, the whole thing becomes far more personal.If I'm honest, I must say two things here: The book was enjoyable and I finished it in very short order. Unfortunately, it just never reached the quality of writing (and suspense) of most of the author's previous books in the series - making it somewhat of a disappointment. Nowhere in the pages did my heart start to beat faster or my anticipation of what was coming next build, and at no time did I get the least bit upset when chores like fixing dinner or throwing the laundry into the machine meant I had to put it down for a while. In fact, compared to the previous efforts, this one was far more ho-hum than a happening thing.Oh well - maybe next time.
5	1362873600	After 35+ books, I've come to expect a great mystery and a lot of humor.  And Calculated in Death didn't fail me in that regard. The murder had some nice twists and diversions along the way, and I found myself laughing out loud more than once.  What I didn't expect, and was delighted to find, was subtle but important character development.  Eve and Roarke both have matured as individuals, and as a couple.Remember how Eve always fights taking any pain blockers, or how Roarke tries to dissuade her from dangerous missions where she's the bait? Yeah, that didn't happen here. I loved seeing them both become secure enough to admit when they need help; when they are worried; and to accept the other's feelings on any given issue.  The changes in the characters are subtle, but noticeable. In fact, her relationships with many characters have come to the next level.  Eve has always respected Peabody, but now Peabody is making some deductions before Eve and their interactions have become even more intimate - these are partners who trust each other with their lives.Overall, this was another great mystery that had a new dimension that brought it to the next level.  I cannot wait for more!
5	1362873600	When each new Eve and Roark book comes out what ever was planned fir that day is out the window. What is happening is I am speaking ding the day reading. I passed another pleasant Sunday happily entertained.
5	1362873600	I have read all of the IN DEATH books and have enjoyed them all  This latest one is very good. You could start with this one, but it would be difficult to work out all of the relationships. I recommend that you read them all in the order that they were written..
3	1362873600	I always wait anxiously for the new book, but this one seemed a little rushed. Very little mystery about who did it. I loved getting to see all the characters, but would have liked to have it end at the party, both before.
5	1362873600	Book 37 in the In Death series continues the JD Robb roll.  There has not been even one book in the series that hasn't been worth the read.  Looking forward to the next one.
5	1362873600	Another edge of the seat page-turner!  She never fails to make you laugh and think.  Definitely recommend this book.  Can't wait for the next.
4	1362873600	Story was well told and connected previous stories. Enjoy reading how Eve solved the crime with all the others.  fun to read on a snowy day.
5	1362787200	As always absolutely amazing, great read. Looking forward to getting the next book to read. One of my favorite authors.
5	1362787200	Every look into their lives is facinating -- a couple that is both tough and loving with friends that match them in every way.
2	1362787200	I have loved this series. Just couldn't love this book...Too many boring details page after page... Not enough of Eve being Eve with her staff, friends, hubby and suspects....had to force myself to finish it, expensive.
5	1362787200	J.D is a wonderful writer and has proven it over and over again with her 'death' books. 'Calculated' was a strong novel with lots of J.D.'s special way of story telling. She does a great job of researching and 'getting it right'.Thanks for the newest 'death' book. May there be many more.
4	1362787200	A solid installment without the tension or high speed a Eve Dallas have had up to and including New York to Dallas.Still a good read, just not one of those I'll read Again and Again.
3	1362787200	She spent too much time laying out the crime and linking it to the suspects not her best in the in death series.
5	1362787200	JD Robb is an exceptional storyteller. This book, like all of her books, provides the twists and turns that keep me up late at night reading.
2	1362787200	I did not like this book.  I finished it because I do like most of the books written by this author.I thought the book was boring and went on and on repeating thing over and over.  It definitely was way to long for me.
3	1362787200	I have the entire "In Death" series and have read many of the books more than once, but this book was a little too boring for me and I won't be reading it again.  I usually read her books in a day... but it's taken me a couple of days to get through this one.  Like other readers, I feel the plot wasn't interesting (and just a little confusing) and the "spark" between characters wasn't there (even Mavis and Trina were "blah").  I do hope her next book has some interesting character developments.  Will continue to buy this series... but hoping for more next time.
5	1362787200	I love J.D. Robb's in Death series. My wife and I are trying to get all 39 books in unabridged form on cd so we can listen to them while we are traveling. We are trying to get all of her books on our kindle also
5	1362787200	She gets you from the first sentence and all the way through. I love all of her characters. I liked one aspect that changed from the others in the series. It was less cryptic. We were able to keep up with the investigation right along with Eve and Roarke
5	1362787200	Another doesn't miss the mark Death book! Robb(erts) formula is an excellent read and I can't wait for her next book.
1	1362787200	It was just as good as I expected.  She always delivers wonderful entertai8nment in every book she writes whether it is . J.D. Robb or as Nora Roberts.  My hat is off to her.  I really don't know how she delivers at least 4 books a year.  I just know that my family eagerly awaits each new twist and turn.
4	1362787200	Book 36 already, and I am still not tired of this series. I love catching up with Eve and Roarke, Peabody and McNab, and all their friends. Still, this book did not captivate me as much as the last few books in the series, less intense somehow. Which does not mean it is not a good book, it certainly is.The murder investigation was exciting, and the murderer is truly bad and a creepy evolving psychopath. But his boss is even worse. There are so many bad and corrupt characters to choose from, all with a disdain for &#8220;normal&#8221; humans. I did not really have a target in my mind, but I did not expect this bad guy to be the one. Perhaps it all went a little bit too easy for Eve this time, with a judge in her corner from the start, although she certainly suffered her share of bruises and such again. She sure was lucky wearing the coat Roarke had made for her especially. Things might have gone very badly for her and Peabody.I enjoyed Roarke and Eve together, Eve is getting stronger in fighting her nightmares, and I admired that. After all those books, she is still growing. But even the threat of Trina was not as severe as usual, and Eve did have to look her very best for the premiere of the Icove movie. It is after all Nadine&#8217;s big night, and as all her suspects told her they would be there, it is a great opportunity to draw out the killer.And Truehart is going for his Detective shield! Yeah for Truehart, who is such a great secondary character in this series, and someone I would love to know in real life.8 stars. 2013 Reviews by Aurian &lt;/p>Full review on my blog, [...] .blogspot.com
5	1362787200	No one does it better.  I start reading and I can't put it down.  I am always impatiently waiting for the next IN DEATH book.
5	1362787200	Love the series. Read them all so far and have never been disappointed. Can't wait for the next book. Hop I don't have to wait too long.
3	1362700800	A little too chatty for me this time around.  Lots of deep intense conversations discussing the who, what, why, how of the case without very much actual action.  Still a good read, but it seemed based more on intellect than footwork.
5	1362700800	As usual, another Eve Dallas book I couldn't put down.  A bit confusing with trying to keep all the characters straight but excellent.
4	1362700800	I omly gave four stars because this book wasn't as nuanced as the others. Maybe it is because the relationships are maturing but it felt like it was written in a hurry. I love the characters in this series.
5	1362700800	I love JD Rob 's series of books on Eve and Roadie. I have them all. I'm always waiting for the next one in the series. They are good both in romance and mystery.
5	1362700800	I love this book! I could not put it down, had to finish it when I started! A friend gave the book to me, now I need to order more of her novels. J.D Robb tells a great story and never disappoints. Can't wait to read more of her books!
5	1362700800	Just  can't beat J.D. Robb for great reading. Looking forward to the next book, she is the best author in print.
5	1362700800	For those who follow Lt. Eve Dallas and her delicious husband, you will not be unhappy.  The whole crew is back along with some faces from the recent past.  I went away from the story wanting more.  I feel like these characters are family now.  Great story.
5	1362700800	Nora hits all the right keys in this novel. The by play between Eve and the other characters makes you smile, laugh, and gasp.
5	1362700800	Eve and Rourke never disappoint, the bad guys never win. I love the in Death series and anxiously await for the next to come out.
4	1362700800	After reading some of the reviews beforehand I was prepared to be a bit disappointed.  I was not.  It was still the J.D. Robb we know and love.  Yes there was some set up for new characters but over all the book moved quickly as always.  I think what I love most about this series is that conversations between the characters are always interlaced with side statements that do actually occur in real life. It was not my favorite In Death but a strong four star! I won't go into the story line because you know it............Catch a killer.
3	1362700800	I have never read any Nora Roberts books, but have read all her J D Robb books, but they are beginning to becookie cutter stories. I love Eve Dallas and her character. But it is time to expand on the characters or the stories.There are just so many times that you want the shower scenes, the embarrassment that she is married and thereare PDA's. Let them get they're collective asses kicked with no pay back. We know Roarke is jealous, we know sheis not into her looks. Peabody and McNab  need more story lines, more info on Somerset's past. They are and have been for awhile much to predictable. I have read all the books at least twice and enjoyed them. BUT(here is that ugly But raising it's head) I find I can put the book down now and no hurry to get back to it. Explore new avenues and venues for the whole cast of characters-----I am not advocating killing off any main characters, just get them something into which they can sink themselves into and hold our interest.
5	1362700800	Another excellent read by J.D. Robb!  Eve and Roarke at their best as a team and as a couple. Can't wait for the next one...
5	1362700800	The last few books in this series have been all right. I haven't hated them, but I wasn't excited about them either. I felt as if the Roarke and Eve we know and love are finally back in full force in this book. The plot is good and nicely paced, the characters are the familiar ones we love and new ones we want to get to know. Loved it, read it one day, even though it took me a week to read the last one. That must mean something, lol!
5	1362700800	I have enjoyed all of the &#34;In Death&#34; books written by J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts).  I am a Huge Fan and always order the books whether I have to wait or not. This one, I hope, will not disappoint either.  I know so.
5	1362614400	If you have never read JD Robb, you will enjoy this book.  I do enjoy the characters evolving through her books. You do not have to read them in order, but if you do you understand the nuances of the reoccurring characters  Eve Dallas is getting more in touch with who she is, and is burying the past abuse of her parents.This storyline has Lieutenant Dallas and Detective Peabody as targets of a hired hit. ONE of Roark`s prototypes saved their lives.Yes as always she outsmarted the murderer and all involved.
5	1362614400	Wow, what can be said about another great readIF Robb delivered again. Definitely worth the money.Couldn't figure out who the mastermind behind
5	1362614400	Another fantastic J.D.Robb, as the lives of Dallas and Roarke evolve, and another case is solved one realizes that there is never enough. Every aspect adds more color to the portrait, more depth to each character. The consistency and continuity is amazing, Nora Roberts is a truly gifted and talented artist. Thanks to her my life is a bit better for having  the opportunity to step into this amazingly real world and away from mine, if only for a brief moment at a time.
5	1362614400	Great story, Eve and Roark bring us romance,  hot sex, intriguing cops and fun loving nerds. Another great story from J.D.Robb.Ooooo
5	1362614400	Love ever word. Full of humor. Perfectly Eve Dallas. I really enjoy seeing Peabody grow into herself. Can't wait for the next book.
3	1362614400	I love this series, and the characters. I always wait for and buy the books .. and can't wait to read them. But I felt that this book was very .. "flat" .. in a way. I kept waiting for something that never occurred. I felt it was a very basic mystery novel. And not at all what I expect from the "in death"-series. I can only hope the next book will be much, much better. I would still buy this book, but it's not one of those books I will ever read again.
4	1362614400	This is the best book ever. I liked the energy of it and how her notoriety is becoming more pronounced.
3	1362614400	The last quarter of the book was intriguing like other "in death" books by JDRobb but the first half Dragged out too much with interviews weaving the web to be solved at the very end.
5	1362614400	Couldn't put it down. Love Dallas and Roarke and the rest of the team.  Want Dallas to make captain next book.
4	1362614400	Love, love, love the In Death series.  Eve Dallas is a smart, dedicated woman.  My only complaint is it was a little slow in the middle when they were going through the financials.But cannot wait for the next one.
4	1362614400	This is far from being one of the best books of this series & as buy each Robb/ Roberts title as it comes out I am finding that Nora does not seem to be doing her best for her many fans. Perhaps it would be better if she concentrated on putting a little more effort into less titles. I will continue to buy the books as they appear but must say at this stage they are a disapointment.
5	1362614400	I wasn't very happy about Robb's last book but I knew by the end of the first chapter of Calculated that this was good.  Eve and Roarke were "together" again.  Eve was herself again fussing about fancy dresses, shoes that hurt her feet and earrings she didn't even know she had....and where was she going to put all of her cop equipment?  Of course I was completely lost with all the money laundering, this account and that account and there were a lot of characters to keep straight....felt like I needed a "character board" in front of me.  But her interaction with Peabody was fun....happy that Peabody is getting a little sassy and I'm a happy Robb reader again!
5	1362614400	How can a book be anything but great when it's written by Nora Roberts!  I love the characters in this series and find it hard to put the book down!
5	1362614400	Wonderful book. Love Nora Roberts. Everyone should read this book. All her in death books are great. Please read them all.
5	1362614400	Once again, absolutely JD Robb at it's best! I can NEVER put these books down once I start, and this time was no different! Eve and Roarke are two fictional characters I could literally read about for a lifetime and I hope to be able to do so!
5	1362528000	Great read.  Eve & Roarke at their best.  They make a great team getting to the bottom of how and why.  Roarke with his knowledge of electronics and business, Eve Dallas with her street smarts make a great pair and get the job done.
5	1362528000	I can't wait for the next one!  I think these would make a great tv series. Who should play Eve?
5	1362528000	Every time I start a new In Death it literally feels like coming home. But this is definitely one of the better ones that have come out lately...
5	1362528000	How many ways can you say Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb is fantastic.  A futuristic murder thriller doesn't get any better.Eve and her trusty partner Peabody take on what looks like a mugging gone bad.  But after a short time Eve and Peabody determined that there is more to the death of accountant Marta Dickenson.  As the investigation continues, crimes of fraud, money laundering raise their head with the help of Eve's hunky, rich beyond belief, husband Roarke.  Two more deaths finally bring the culprits where they belonged, in Eve's interrogation room, under arrest and on their way to life in a cage.Great read as always.
3	1362528000	It lacks the spark of previous books in the serie. The plot is weak, and the interaction between Eve and Roarke us scarse.
5	1362528000	By accident I pulled an Eve Dallas in death book. I enjoyed them so much I went back to the beginning and have read them all. Robb (Norton) gets better with each murder mystery. I highly recommend this book and all the rest of in death books.
4	1362528000	Another well writen book.  I have all  the J D Robb  books and  have enjoyed each and everyone.Awaiting the next release, in sure it will also be as good.
5	1362528000	Robb outdid herself with this one!  She got the timing perfect with it being tax season.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5	1362528000	Love the book! J.  D.  Robb / Nora can write no wrong in my eyes. Love love all her work.
5	1362528000	Well another one of those books that once you open it you are hooked and don't want to eat or sleep until you get to the end.  Love all of Nora Roberts/JDRobb books. Best reads ever!!!!!  Thanks Ms
4	1362528000	Anytime I welcomed back into the world of Eve Dallas and Roarke, it is a joy for me. CiD was good--I like the storyline but something was missing. From New York to Dallas was excellent-intense and emotional--CiD was very streamlined and linear, if that makes any sense. It read as if it was a set-up for the next book--Eve dealt with politics and being Roarke's wife with a small amount of fussing.I can't wait for the next one.
3	1362528000	The subject matter did not interest me much and the story was too similar to others she has written. This one was a disappointment.
1	1362528000	It was unlike her other books in the &#34;Death&#34;series. This one went on very slow to the point of boring. Deaths of an accountant. So what???? I figured out the rest of the story! It was boring!!!!!! Even the end where the climax should be was not very exciting. It was a wasted $15!
5	1362441600	Nora Roberts always delivers.  Her books written under J D Robb have turned out to be my favorites.  There's just something about a tough, sexy, lady cop and her gorgeous hubby that keeps me coming back. The regular cat of characters are icing on the cake!  When's Peabody going to end up pregnant, Nora?  McNab would be a funny papa!
2	1362441600	I never write reviews on books but this one made me mad. This was a really slow read. Not her usual work,  really could have skip this book. I am really disappointed with this book. It gave no new insight, it lacked action, it lacked comedy and lack the usual excitement from Eve. Is this JD ROBB??? Where was the entertainment? I put this book down several times but had to complete it. Hope the next one is better.
3	1362441600	This is not the sort of thing I normally read/listen to- but I got sucked into the series some time ago, and it has been one of my guilty pleasures ever since. I love the characters and character development as the series has progressed, love the depiction of urban life in the not-so-distant future, and the plots usually have a good twist. I can count on several hours of blissfully mindless entertainment.That said, I am becoming a little disappointed at how things are progressing- or not progressing. It's like these characters got stuck in the aftermath of the Icove case, and never really went anywhere. At this point, these books are so predictable I think I could almost write one myself. And the characters have become almost caricatures. Which is sad to me, because I really like them, and want to see what happens in their lives. Ive started each of the last few books optimistically, only to end up thinking, well maybe next time something will happen.Despite all the complaining, I still somewhat enjoyed the audiobook and will probably get the next one... Although let me move on to complaining about the narrator. Good grief... She is just getting ridiculous. Almost ruined this book for me and was almost unlistenable at times. I'm fine with Dallas's voice... But poor Peabody- she sounds like a cross between Elmer Fudd and Eeyore...awful. And the way Dallas pronounced her name as &#34;Pee-Buddy&#34; about made me lose my mind. My other major gripe is Roarke- supposed to be this raw, dashing, brilliant Irish power broker- but whose voice sounds like Apu, the Indian convenience store clerk from the Simpsons...horrible. Sigh. Oh well, maybe the next one will be better.
5	1362441600	She did it again.  Great book.  Couldn't put it down.  She grabs you at the beginning and keeps you hooked until the end.  Can't wait for the next one!
4	1362441600	I love j.d.Robb aka Nora Robert's.I have read all the in death book's.they get better with each one .keep them coming.
2	1362441600	I hardly ever write reviews, unless a story really impressed or disappointed me.. and this one definately falls in the "disappointing"-category. I'm not saying the story line was awful - I'm just saying that this isn't what I've come to expect of Nora! (or in this case, JD Robb). If the firt quater of the book didn't refer to "Eve and Peabody" I would never have thought that I was reading an "In Death Novel". The characters and writing style are completely different than usual. I don't mean that I, as a reader, expect the same thing over and over again - it just felt as if the "essence" of Eve and sidekicks has disappeared. If this book was written by someone else - I think I would have given it 4 stars instead of 2... but this isn't some unkown writer who has just released his/her first novel for $0.99 ... this is Nora, and when I buy one of her books (and I've bought each and every one), I like to know that I'm getting what I paid for - a "NORA NOVEL".  Ghostwriter anyone??
5	1362441600	I  have read every one of J.D. Robb's books.  Can't get enough of them.  Especially enjoy the Roake and Dallas relationship.
3	1362441600	Let me say first, I am a huge Nora Roberts/J.D Robb fan. Love reading about Eve and Roarke, but her last few novels have just not challenged me.The characters are wonderful Eve and Roarke still have the marriage of a lifetime, Peabody and McNab are still together, Somerset is still a pain in the neck. Maybe that's what doesn't grab me. The books are so similar, only the crime changes. I think we need a shake up. Maybe have Eve get pregnant (horrors) !It also, in my opinion, seems she is getting very technical with her stories. This financial one had me very confused at a couple spots. Granted, I am NOT a numbers person.I will continue to read her &#34;in Death&#34; series, but now get them from the library.I have no such problem with her novels written as Nora Roberts. Those I devour in practically one sitting. I hope in her next Eve story there can be a little spark of something new.
3	1362441600	I have waited impatiently for every novel in this series. I have never been disappointed, until now. It felt more like an outline of, than a book about, these characters. Here's Eve, she's a kick ass policewoman, here's Peabody, her faithful sidekick. Here's Eve's husband Roarke, he's rich and hot. Here's Summerset, Eve insults him and he puts her car away. That is pretty much the extent of Summerset, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. I can get decent police procedurals any time, anywhere. It's the depth of these characters that has kept me coming back. I sincerely hope this was a blooper and not a preview of things to come.
3	1362355200	J.D. Robb's newest &#34;in Death&#34; book wasn't that bad.  It's not in the top ten, but I'd put in in the upper half.It's a sadder book then some of the others.  An innocent accountant is murdered by some reprehensible wealthy men.  The focus is on the lust for wealth and making hasty, irrevocable decisions on the spur of the moment.Loyal Peabody and McNabb are present, as are Dr. Mira, Baxter, Truehart, Mavis and Leonardo.  And Roarke, as always, has Eve's back, front, and everything in-between.Justice is served and the bad guys are caught in the end.A worthy way to spend a few hours.
5	1362355200	Great Book!!  Dallas solves again and again.  I enjoy this series so very much.  They are full of interesting characters well defined and interesting!
5	1362355200	Eve and Roarke are the hottest couple,with all of the characters in this series can't wait for the next in death
4	1362355200	This was better than some of her books but was missing some of Robb 's details that make this series so great.  Too much business and too many suspects and not enough by play between regular characters.  No really great moments, just pretty good moments.
4	1362355200	Maybe it's because Eve is such a moral barometer and Roarke a genius romantic that I'm unable to put down her books, but I'm disappointed that I couldn't savor it for more than two days. The plot may have been a bit thinner than her last few, but it had the same logical unfolding sprinkled with my favorite characters to keep me smiling.
3	1362355200	I have read all books in the In Death series and am a big fan. But over the last five books or so the momentum has stopped. The mysteries are all too predictable. Every book has the mandatory three murders before suddenly it all falls into place. As another reviewer mentioned, Roarke and Eve's relationship has stopped growing and evolving. Worse yet, why is she still a Liutenant? It's been four years since the start of the sees (2056  - 2060) and her career is still the same. There are no new interesting characters and the old ones are becoming dull. And in 2060 at least you would expect Eve to be able to have a great career and kids!! I think JD Robb needs to do the right thing by her readers and provide a satisfying conclusion to the series before falling numbers makes the publishers discontinue it.
5	1362355200	It is only fitting that while I write this review of CALCULATED IN DEATH, I am listening to a CD by a band called We Were Promised Jetpacks. I was raised in a time when it seemed all but certain that, as of this date, we'd all be zipping from Point A to Point B and beyond using individual jet propulsion units strapped to our backs. Speculating as to what the future will hold can be dicey, indeed. I think that is one reason why J.D. Robb's In Death series, though set in the future, keeps the guessing on the high-tech wizardry to a minimum.For Robb, 2060 is close enough to seem within grasp (for some readers, anyway), yet far enough away to seem exotic. Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas has a few tools at her disposal that the current-day NYPD doesn't have --- I would bet that Dallas's computers run a lot faster --- but for the most part she relies on good, solid investigation. You could draw a line from Sherlock Holmes through Steve Carella to Eve Dallas with nary a break; separated by centuries, they are united by tenaciousness and making the best possible use of the investigative tools at hand.CALCULATED IN DEATH is about money. Given that Dallas is married to the enigmatic Roarke, who is not only winning hands down the game of Monopoly that you happen to be playing but also the one going on next door, this is fitting. The opening gambit is the discovery of the body of Marta Dickenson, a well-liked accountant. Within a few pages, Robb manages to convince us that such a person might exist. At first blush, the woman's death appears to be the result of a mugging taken one step farther than it should have been. However, it quickly becomes evident to Dallas and Peabody, her partner in law enforcement, that the murder was staged to look that way by a killer who is very good at what he does yet is not necessarily the sharpest knife in the drawer.The building where Dickenson's body is discovered is owned by WIN, a financial consultant firm; as it happens and might be expected, some of their clients utilize the services of Dickenson's accounting firm. Dallas follows that rather tenuous lead and seems to be heading in the right direction, particularly after someone steals several files from Dickenson's office, adding a secondary mystery of the "locked room" variant to the puzzle. Roarke, of course, is along to devote his considerable resources and even greater intellect to the investigation as well. But the killer is still out there, and when he makes his presence known again, it becomes even more necessary that he be apprehended with all due and deliberate speed.As long-time and faithful readers of this venerable series know and expect, CALCULATED IN DEATH is not all violence and mystery. Roarke doesn't truly enter the book until almost a third of it has passed, but thrusts his way into the narrative in his own inimitable style and remains a presence both on the pages and hovering just off of them throughout the remainder of the narrative. Meanwhile, the premiere of the video based upon Dallas slowly but surely nears, an event that she approaches with reluctance while those around her view it with eager anticipation.Still, the focus of CALCULATED IN DEATH is the investigation into Dickenson's murder. While the plot is complex, it is not overly so, making it on balance one of Robb's best entries in the series to date.Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
5	1362355200	Classic Eve Dallas and her Roarke. Always a pleasure to join their lives for a new escapade. Definite must read.
4	1362355200	Enjoyed this In Death book.  Once again Peabody and McNab steal the show.  I miss the old love scenes between Roarke and Eve!  Have they become and old married couple????  Say it isn't so?
5	1362355200	Couldn't put it down,now I want the next one!!!!!!!The only problem I have with these books is they don't come fast enough.
5	1362355200	Nora Roberts writing as JD Robb has done it again! Another winner for the In Death series, if you have read them all or just pick it up for a good read you are in luck!
5	1362355200	I love  J.D. Robb  books It shows that  women can be just as smart and  capable as men. When does the next book come your?
5	1362355200	I gave it 5 stars. It was a well written suspenseful story as only J. D. Robb can do.If you are a Nora Roberts fan you will love this book.
5	1362355200	Another great "In Death" book! JD makes the characters come to life in a way that always leaves me anxiously awaiting the next book in the series!
5	1362355200	This Eve novel was a little more mystery and a little less police procedural, but it's mostly exactly what readers of the series expect -- and keep coming back to for more.Has anyone else noticed that Eve's New York City apparently has an amazing number of homicides?  In 2012, our NYC had 414 homicides.  In Eve's era, despite effective gun control and affordable/available mental health care, there appear to be many more than that.  Eve alone fields about 20-30 murders per year, her department appears to handle another 5 times that, and then there are all the other homicide departments in all the other precincts.
2	1362355200	These books were absolutely mag when they started, with interesting killers and victims and lots of plot twists. Lately though they read like not very good short stories that a ghost writer fluffed out into books. Formulaic, minimal to no character development, plot not very convoluted or even that interesting, gratuitous sex scenes sprinkled on like salt on the pretzel you because it smells good but then regret because its salty rubber.
4	1362355200	This book is a great continuation of the Eve Dallas Series, The characters really make the books great, you want to see what is going on in Eve's life as she solves homicide's with her husband and friends.  I really love how the people around Eve are growing, and how their growth effects Eve.  Trueheart is going for detective!!  Eve's life is continuing to expand, from just having Feeney, and Mavis.  Now she has Roark (awesome) her homicide division, Nadine, Rio, Webster, Harvo, Morris, Summerset (really like him), and on and on.  The growth of the series just makes you want to see the next book to see what else is going to happen in eve's life.In this book it is showing how an Female accounted is the beginning of a spree of killings, It is great trying to figure out who is the killer as eve connects the suspects to the evidence and motives.  The build up is always good, along with the other character interactions.  I  hope they bring Jaime back sometime soon.
5	1362355200	Dallas, Roarke, and Peabody to the rescue.  Solving crime in the 2060's.  New York City with flying cars, fancy computers and murder.  A police procedural at its heart, but with enough S/F for any reader of science fiction.
5	1362355200	J.D. Robb did it again!  Everyone of her books are mega awesome and flow, exciting to the max, I love how complex and detailed her stories always are.  You just can't miss reading this series!!
5	1362355200	I've read every book in this series and not one of them was predictable except that LT Eve Dallas and her NYPSD always get their man. There are always twists and turns that keep you guessing and make her books such that its very difficult to put them down. Calculated in Death is indeed another great read by J D Robb a.k.a. Nora Roberts. It always amazes me how different the two styles of writing are yet both styles are consistently great and are difficult to put down. This particular book keeps the reader as well as Eve Dallas guessing to unravel a very complicated plot. I can't wait to read another J D Robb &#34;Death&#34; series book! I'm sure you'll feel the same. If you haven't read the other books in this series you should go back and start with the first one and read them in order. A good number of the earlier books can be bought cheaper combined in sets. If you have trouble figuring out the order of the books go to your kindle and on it go to shop in the kindle store. Pull up one of the J D Robb books,then go to book extras and you'll see the books in this series listed in order up to whatever book you pulled up. The books actually need to read in order to understand some of the references made in each book as well as character development. This series and each individual book is a truly terrific read! Hope you enjoy them as much as I have!!!
5	1362355200	This is one of my favorite series, and this book does not disappoint. The characters stay true to who they are and I love them. A good mystery, well-written characters, some humor, everything we've come to expect from the In Death series.  Another winner.
5	1362268800	This book hit the mark as usual. Somehow I'm always left wanting more- Heaven help me when she stops writing this series. I have been hooked from the first book, and continue to remain hooked.
5	1362268800	Another great story in the series. It's fun watching Eve overcome her past and learn to live a normal life. Well as normal is it gets when you are married to a billionaire! Can't wait for the next installment.
4	1362268800	Imagine a week where you have a substantial -- but not extraordinary -- project at work and an interesting -- but not life-changing -- event coming up on the weekend.This is the week in the life of Eve Dallas that you'll see in this book.  There's a case, of course, and I found it interesting, but it's not a mass murder, it does not involve people from any main character's past, nobody is threatening to wipe out all of New York City, and there are no bizarre futuristic gimmicks. Moreover, none of the main characters or major supporting characters undergoes a major traumatic experience or life-changing event.So by J.D. Robb's standards, this is a relatively uneventful book -- except, of course, for a pretty good murder mystery that becomes more exciting in the second half of the book, the usual interplay between Eve and Roarke and Eve and Peabody, and some subtle development of the supporting characters.  Peabody is becoming so sophisticated as a detective that you have to wonder whether she should be reassigned as the senior member of a partnership. Trueheart gets some development in this one, too, and some characters from the book about the Icove case movie (no, I can't remember its name) return, and there's some closure about what's happening to them.It's not the most exciting book in the series, but for those of us who have gotten a bit impatient with the extreme angst of some of the books in the series, it's a nice change of pace.
2	1362268800	This is not Robbs best work. It took me 2 days to get through this book. This just isn't up to par with the other In Death books.
5	1362268800	I love every book J.D. Robb/ Nora Roberts has written . The chemistry between her characters is fantastic. I have read and reread every Eve Dallas book they make you laugh, cry and cheer. I can't wait for the next book.
4	1362268800	I enjoyed this book. I was worried when I read New York to Dallas but since then the series has picked back up. I like how the team seems to be expanding (with Trueheart beginning to study for his detective's exam) and I liked the pacing. Cannot wait for the next one!
4	1362268800	Futuristic New York City Police Department Lieutenant Eve Dallas tracks a culprit who murdered a seemingly innocent wife and mother. This killing is related to her work for an accounting firm who was doing some potentially sticky audits on high profile businesses and figures. The list of suspects starts out meaty, with money as the motive.  As the killer strikes again, Dallas gets closer to her prey with the help of her police team and her billionaire husband Roarke.  When the killer gets Eve in their sights, Eve has to make herself bait to save lives and put this brutal perpetrator away for good.Calculated in Death lives up to the charm of this long-running series. It stays true to its origin, procedural mystery with a strong romance.  Even after so many books, Eve and Roarke heat up the pages with their intense, loving bond.  Dallas is a sharp, driven, and thoroughly admirable protagonist, for all her gruff, to the point nature.  Robb shows a jaundiced but accurate portrayal of human nature, although she also features people whose love and regard for each other is evident.  Fans of the series should find plenty to enjoy in this installment.Affaire de Coeur
5	1362268800	I have to say that I've read every book this author has written and I do mean all of them. This book Is another wonderfully written story the characters are still engaging. You cheer for all the characters as you know them so well. they are like friends who you catch up with regularly and you are sorry when they have to leave.  ENJOY
5	1362268800	I love all of this series. I like that it starts off where it ended. Eve and Roarke are my favorite characters in a book. Please keep going.
5	1362268800	Wonderful.  Always enjoy JD Robb books.  Love to watch Dallas evolving as a woman and how it plays out in her life/work
5	1362268800	I can never seem to be enough of Nora Roberts.  She doesn't disappoint with her latest Dallas novel.  Once you start you won't want to put it down!
5	1362268800	Great read.  Love all the J.D. Robb series with  Lieutenant Dallas.  Can't wait for the next edition.  Just finished reading Calculated In Death.
5	1362268800	This is an excellent book.I very much enjoyed reading it. Eve and Roark always give the most excitment for your money and enjoyment.  I look forward to reading more stories about EVE and ROARK.
5	1362268800	I love Dallas and Roarke and J. D. Robb always tells a good story. Can't wait for the next one!
2	1362268800	I've read the whole series and so have read some that i thought were very good, some merely good, and others okay. This one is in the last category. It's by Nora Roberts, so it's not going to be bad really, but with this contribution the In Death series is getting ever more formulaic and standardized. That could be inevitable considering how many there are of them, but I can't help but think there's need for either a big shakeup or a fairwell.
5	1362268800	First, I love Eve and Roarke, and I love that she is getting stronger in her relationships and friendships.  I love that she and Roarke are evolving, their marriage...it isn't all lovey doves all the time, and that they are friends as well as lovers.  They truly have that trust for each other.This book was all that and more. The story was as heartfelt as all of JD Robb's books...with hilarity mixed with tears, suspense and cunning.  Written well as always.I don't wish to go over the plot as then it is wrong, but the plot was well written.  This book didn't contain all the nerves and suspense of some of the more dangerous episodes, but was done exceedingly well, as always.  I am a huge fan, so it was a pleasure to read the latest.
5	1362268800	I've enjoyed all the JD Robb books and I think this is the best yet. I actually laughed out loud on several occasions. Eve's sarcasm gets me every time. All of the characters have evolved so that you feel like you know them. I enjoy reading as their lives progress. Several of the earlier murders were mentioned throughout the book and I had to scramble to remember what each was about due to the length of time in between books. I hope this series continues for a good long time. Thoroughly enjoyable. Hated for it to end.
3	1362268800	This was probably the first book in the series I didn't enjoy. Not because it is a bad book. Because its the wrong book. It takes place in the same place, the characters have the same names and... well, that is it. The whole thing feels completely wrong, like a painting the hangs just a few degrees off center and you can't really fix it. If you don't notice it it doesn't really bother you, but once you see it you can't stop seeing it. The dialog between the characters feels wrong (the banter between Eve and Peabody is especially noticeable), the investigating methods used are different (when was the last time the Dallas went looking for fingerprints to solve the case? or when was the last time Roarke had to do actual financial analysis rather than coming up with the magical answer 5 minutes after being asked the question?), the characterization is way off (like someone had a list of typical things this or that character does but no real insight into why. Simple example - Dallas eats more soup in this book than in all previous books combined. Yeah, the writer mentions how much she loves pizza (ticking it off the list) but the rest of the time she is slurping soup and can't stop singing its praises. And the support cast, that all important set of characters that makes these books interesting - where was it? Compare the time given to Whitney, Mira, Nadine, Morris, Feeney, McNab etc. here and in previous books. Bet you in previous books each of those got more &#34;screen time&#34; on their own than all of them had here combined). Hell, even the crime is wrong. In the previous versions we had terrorists blowing up NYC, cloning humans, inventing drugs... here the big evil is...GASP.... real estate fraud. Shocking how that doesn't really make you shiver in anticipation to read all about it. Is it more realistic? Yeah, sure. Are we reading these books for the realism? Not really.Roberts is one of those truly amazing writers who can churn out books by the truckload and somehow that doesn't come at the expense of quality or consistency. Whether its pure talent and professionalism or the ability to delegate to the right people, you really couldn't argue with the results. Nearly 40 books in the Eve Dallas series and they have all been consistent in style, themes, characterization, world-building... and it has been my guilty pleasure to read, reread and always enjoy almost all of them.That is because the plot of these books becomes obsolete at some point. You don't read them because you particularly need or want to know who the killer is, but because you DO know who the investigator is. Dallas, Roarke, Peabody and the whole crew of support characters are the driving force behind such long series and the readers' familiarity and affection for them is what sells the books and draws the glowing reviews.The whole thing feels like the author, intentionally or not, went into a completely different direction than before. There is very little consistency in the writing and none in the feeling the book has. And I don't think it was intentional. They had their check list and included it all (Dallas loves pizza - mentioned on page 123, move on. Dallas fears Trina - mentioned on page 234, move on. Dallas sets herself up as bait - page 345, move on. Its all there, but it feels like patches sewn over something completely different).This is not a bad book by any means, but it IS an annoyingly different book. Some people wouldn't even notice that and many of those who do notice wouldn't really mind. But I personally found it annoying as it stopped me from immersing in the book and enjoying it. Bugged me enough to actually sit down and write about it even though its going on 2 am here (apologies btw for typos and general grammatical inadequacy :) )The ghosts of past ghostwriters (or Roberts herself) haunt this book and whoever wrote it. I hope the next one goes back to the good old for the sake of giving the fans what we want - more of the same, mostly.
5	1362268800	I loved the fact that we got more insight into Rourke's side of things. What goes on when it comes to his business.Then there's the way Eve is dealing with what happened between her and Stella. Where she is dealing with it and not letting herself get bogged down. Instead doing the typical Eve way of handling things: beat into submission, ignore, deny, or beat into submission. When it comes to emotions.Great mystery and definitely on my to reread list!!!
5	1362268800	It's the middle of winter and you are tired of looking at brown grass, your boots are getting far to scuffed and you are just tired of opening the coat closet doors. "What I need", you say to yourself," is a day at the beach". A tropical getaway and a good stiff drink.Calculated in Death has none of that. But as far as the read, it's all that. Oh how I missed you guys! I gave Calculated in Death 5 stars. Yes 5 stars just because it was a breath of fresh air. Stay with me here folks. Cause ya might think me crazy.The relationship with Eve and Peabody is pure gold in this installment. Long gone is the mentor/student relationship. True friendship has evolved. The banter between these two is simply hilarious.Eve and Roarke = perfection. The yummy conversation over the current case is lovable and smart. They have never been better. With Eve's past becoming just that, A thing of the past, they are really bonding and hitting a rhythm.The gang's all here. We visit the entire cast of characters in this one and get a glimpse of what is going on with each one. I like it when authors do that. It keeps me invested with my peeps. Summerset and Galahad are my favs.It really was a day at the beach read. A warm fuzzy on a cold day. Time spent with people you love. The action wasn't as prominent as it usually is. There was no emotional turmoil and anger issue Eve is famous for. Even the droids seemed to be on their best behavior.I was expecting a thrilling ride and instead and left with a warm breeze wrapped around me. I can almost smell suntan lotion and coconuts. Thanks J.D. for the mini vaca.T~
5	1362268800	I love to watch how Eve &Roarke; evolve, good to see what all the characters have been up to.Enjoyed another in the In Death serious - a Must read...
4	1362268800	I thought 'Calculated in Death' was great. It was an interesting case, and still showed a lot of personality from the characters. Eve still has Trina fear, hates Sunmerset, adores Dennis Mira, and is a total badass. Peabody's smart mouth but reliable ways shines through, Mavis is a ball of energy, and so on. And of course, plenty of Roarke and his love for Eve. It does sort of drag, but for me, all of the books in this series makes up for it in the end.
5	1362268800	As always, enjoyed the story. I've come to love these characters and look forward to their new adventures in the future.
5	1362268800	Kept me intrigued throughout. After I had it figured out I wanted to know how Eve we would handle it.
4	1362182400	Love these characters and have read each one. Always a great story and just enough of everything I like to read in an afternoon.
3	1362182400	Move along, everyone.  There's nothing to see here.  Dallas catches a murder, rounds up all the usual suspects, has her business-savvy hubby crunch the numbers and run &#34;deep data&#34; checks, then she and the murderer find each other for the end-of-the-book shoot out.  Did I leave anything out?Between the lines:  Robb is moving the series closer to a satisfying culmination. She-body is easing into Eve's skills and leadership role, and other players are falling into place in the new hierarchy.  With her beloved police station covered, Eve can move into something new as it continues to dawn on her that what she and Roarke have isn't worth losing to an errant bullet.
5	1362182400	Great, nice and fast paced. J D Robb aka Nora Roberts keeps you glued to the pages. Excellent story line.
4	1362182400	Robb, aka Roberts, has done it again. The story was great, although a little slow starting. As I have read everything she has written, I couldn't put it down until it was done. I enjoy the connections from the previous cases/books. I look forward to the next!
5	1362182400	I have been reading the In Death series since book 1 came out 18 years ago. Best books ever written by Nora Roberts. Really some smart person would turn them into a movie/tv series.
5	1362182400	Eve has been assigned to an apparent mugging gone bad, but after reviewing the crime scene she realizes that its a definite murder. Pulling her usual crew together, she starts pulling clues together to solve the crime. I love the way this works, you know there is a murder board, that the little details are what provide the clues and the characters are varied and crazy.  I always love the storyline but I really enjoy the love story between Eve and Roarke!Reading an &#34;In Death&#34; novel is like visiting your favorite friends! Peabody, Mavis, McNab, Dr. Mira, Feeney and the rest of her friends and family, even Summerset and Trina! Just finding out what's happening with all of them is the best part of the book, I can't wait until Peabody and McNab finally settle down and marry, that should be a really great event! I know it will definitely be special. I expect Trueheart will have a major role in one of the next books, he has to take his detective exam and from her conversation with Officer Turney, at the crime scene, maybe there will be a new member of her team.I can't wait for the next installment! I'm lovin it!
5	1362182400	Always love Eve and Roarke...can't wait for the next one!  Make a movie with these two!  Need to decide who would play them.
5	1362182400	Nice to see Eve putting her demons away and her and Rourke working totally together. Looking forward to the next one.
5	1362182400	Keeps you wanting more.  Ended too soon. IF Robb it did herself. Eve Dallas wow, I can't get enough one tough cop.
4	1362182400	When a series has gone over 30 books, it's not surprising when it becomes formulaic. This is not necessarily the same thing as boring, because in this case, at least, it's a pretty good formula. Still, a few more like this one, and it will get boring. Eve is still smart and snarky. Rourke is still brilliant and gorgeous. Peabody, McNabb and Feeney are all their old selves. I don't necessarily agree with the reviewers who say there is not enough development and change because, after all, the entire series comprises less than two years in the characters' lives. For two years, there has been a lot of change.In this book, Marta Dickensen, an accountant, is found murdered. The villains, fairly obviously, were trying to cover up a whole series of frauds. The main bad guy is only in one real scene and the actual paid assassin is close to being a moron. Almost a paint by numbers affair for our heroes, who deserve better competition. I skipped the sex scenes. They are boring, and I'm tired of Eve setting herself up as the target but in the end, this was another enjoyable and fairly entertaining romp in a solid and entertaining series.
5	1362182400	Have read all the books in this series and enjoyed every one.  Some are better than others, this is one of the good ones.  Good story with strong characters and the right amount of action.
5	1362182400	Great read!You have gotta read this in Death book it does not disappoint. JD Robb has still got it!
5	1362182400	I love Eve and Roark.  I always hate to reach the end of a &#34;...in Death&#34; book.All my favorite characters were in this one but Dr. Louise and her husband.
5	1362182400	Love this book,another great story.Great to see the characters evolving, but hope the next book has a little more Sommerset, missed him in this one, even though he wouldn't have fitted the storyline
4	1362182400	As always a good read. Just not up to par. Not much suspense. Miss the play by with all the others in her world.
5	1362182400	Everything about this series is golden. Yet again this was a great book with fantastic characters. Looking forward to the next one!
5	1362182400	Nora Roberts strikes again! I had this book delivered to my kindle on it's release date and could barely put it down. Here it is 2:30 in the morning and I'm finished. I want to cry, write faster Nora.
2	1362182400	The &#34;Born in Death&#34; had the two dead accountants and find the money scenario. This is not up to Ms. Robb's standards. There are many instances in prior books where Eve/Roarke have to pursue the money angle but this was so easy to follow and figure out, it was not fun at all. I am a real fan of Eve & Roarke and all the other characters but nobody went beyond or grew beyond their usual selves. A very big disappointment. We deserve better from the talented Ms. Robb.
5	1362182400	Another most excellent installment of my favorite series! Lots of interesting plot/case twists and turns and a really bad 'bad guy'...blah, blah, blah...lol...I know, what about Eve and Roarke, right?!!? Eve and Roarke are awesome!(; Ahhh, no spoilers, though. So many parts to love...just a few...Roarke makes a unbelievably sexy nurse, the work out scene, the whole freaking incredible ending, Roarke's boy-o comment about the knife...I could go on and on! Oh, and Eve's character is really growing and developing...not so much because she's beating the nightmares, but because she didn't beat the crap out of the guy who called her Roarke's get-out-of-jail-free card. Classic!
5	1362182400	Another great story with exceptional characters.  You feel like you know them, they`'re friends.  Love the continuation throughout the series.
1	1362182400	again too much mind numbing info of eve thinking etc--the authors strong point has always been the continuing development of her recurring characters which is totally lacking in this book-the prep for the action scenes and the scenes themselves are very familiar from past books but not nearly as entertaining--wish the author would go back to what works or dont write this series anymore
3	1362096000	I had been waiting and waiting for this book.  I love the JD Robb collection and I was really disappointed.  I kept waiting for something more to happen.  There was alot of "blah blah" filters but not much in the way of "Eve and Roark".  To someone that had not followed the in death series I guess it would have been a good book.  But for me it lacked the personal things.  The book is ok but I had been waiting for over 6 months for the MORE and it just didn't come.  I guess now I wait another 6 months and hopefully the next will get back on the track that I thought it should be on.
3	1362096000	I love this book series, but especially with the last few I'm feeling a bit cheated on some level.  I really wish there could be more meat with the personal day to day stuff.  More fun, more personal, and more character development.  I'm not asking for more sex, I pretty much ignore those passages, skim right over them, but there lately hasn't been enough life in the lives of the characters.  I sure hope that  Miss Robb gives us more for our money than she has been, because I can't justify paying premium prices for this series any longer otherwise.
5	1362096000	Thanks J.D Robb for another awesome book! Great story, easy to follow and a few Eve and Roarke sweet special moments for the people who have read the books from the start.
4	1362096000	I'm a total JD Robb fan ~ I can't wait for the new stories to come out each time.  But I have to say I was initially dissapointed in Calculated ~ for the first few chapters, I was like, OH NOES.  How can this beBORING?  But it was.  Thankfully it totally picked up ~ this was far from my favorite In Death, but I love to visit w/ Eve, Roarke, Peabody & the gang, so it's never a waste of my time, and I'd never miss one.  But let me assure you you'll be glad you hang in there for Calculated!!  LOVED the 'baby catch', and it still cracks me up how Eve is embarassed by attention ~ even though she's always the center of it.
4	1362096000	It is like catching up with friends with a little murder thrown in.  I always look forward to the latest i stallment and catching up with Eve and Roarke.
2	1362096000	I have read all of the In Death books including the anthologies up to this point. Needless to say, I was VERY disappointed. I felt Eve was getting too many compliments and that there was not enough of her snarly side.. Also, the relationship between Eve and Roarke as well as Eve and the other characters didn't feel "there" if you know what I mean (those of you who have read the series). I missed the jabs between Eve and Summerset. I don't know if this was being a setup for the next book or not, but this book lacked the punch of the other books. I got the feeling that JD Robb did a rush job on this particular book to meet a deadline.
4	1362096000	Good read! Not as fast paced as some of her previous books in this series, but still good. I can't wait for the next installment of Dallas and Roarke. I love these characters!
5	1362096000	Great read always enjoy the adventures of Eve Dallas. It would make a great movie or tv series. Enjoy it
5	1362096000	I've read every In Death book thus far. And this one was wonderful, too. It was so good to catch up with my &#34;friends&#34; Eve, Roarke and crew and all that is going down in their world.I just so do not get tired of these tales!
4	1362096000	If you like the In Death series, you will like this one. It follows the same formula as all the others and Eve and Roarke are as wonderful as ever. I just wish that after all this time there was a little more. I don't know what I want precisely but I finished the book and thought to myself &#34;Good but nothing new&#34;
5	1362096000	LOVED this book as I do all the "In Death" books!  Wish there were a new one every month! I have read every one and it always leaves me wanting more!
5	1362096000	I read my first JD Robb 10 years ago, and wasn't a fan, but about 5 years ago she grabbed my attention, and hasn't let go since. I love the evolution of Eve and Roarke's relationship, and even Eve and Summerset's. This book didn't disappoint either. I just love getting to lose myself in the stories, the world, that JD Robb has created. That's the best review I can give. Her books, and this heroine in particular, let me put myself in another world. I can honestly say that I've never finished one of these books and felt like I've wasted my time or my money, and every In Death book will be pre-order for a  long as they are written.
4	1362096000	I always enjoy  Nora RobertsBooks but this one wasn't quite as good as usual. Too many suspects, not enough of the regular characters for my personal taste. I just didn't feel so connected like I usually do to these characters, however the worst Nora Roberts book is still a great read!
4	1362096000	Ready for the next one!  I do think Roarke and Dallas should give Peabody a magic coat for Christmas.  Counting the days until the next one.
5	1362096000	The standout thing about all of the past Eve Dallas books is that the characters continue to grow as individuals as well as couples. Happily, that theme carries on in Calculated. So many series become carbon copies, book after book after book. I certainly could rave on about Rourke's sexiness, but we all know that. ;) Bottom line:  great continuation of the overarching plot with the deft weaving of a new criminal consortium along side.
3	1362096000	Someone is getting too laid-back in writing, and I'm not sure it's J.D. Robb. This book, like several recent entries in the series, seems to be either on autopilot or ghost-written. If Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb turns out one romantic suspense, two In Death futuristic mysteries, and a short story each year all by herself, that doesn't allow much time for rewrites and editing, so maybe the problem is a natural result of churning out pages. Roberts/Robb is a major player in publishing, and I automatically buy each new release. But this one falls a bit flat. The good news is, the Mad Scientist/Psychopathic Serial Killer is missing, replaced by an ordinary mastermind and murderer. The bad news is, the characters are falling back rather than moving forward. Peabody is speaking too much like Eve, Eve is speaking too coarsely, the futuristic touches (part of the charm of the series) are disappearing, and current fads are out of place in the year 2060 (someone wearing an "I Heart NY" shirt 50 years from now? Roarke working on a tablet?). Nice to meet new characters (Turney) and see progress with old ones (Trueheart), but Eve and Roarke's relationship seems to have reached a plateau, so the fireworks are missing. For several books, there have been many references to the Icove case and I suspect that the whole Icove mess will reappear in an upcoming volume. That's fine, but bringing it up over and over in several books is rather annoying. Enough show...time for the tell. I will continue to buy the In Death books, in hardcover, but I sometimes think the series should be wound down to a reasonable end. "Calculated in Death" is one reason why.
3	1362009600	I have loved Ms. Robb's books forever but this latest was not up to her usual standards. I normally can't put her books down until I finish them but with this book, I set it aside a number of times.  I found the killer rather one dimensional and the plot dull. It didn't have the usual humor, suspense and thrills I expect from an Eve Dallas book. I am disappointed because I always look forward to her latest novel with a lot of anticipation and this was lacking.
3	1362009600	I liked this book. I didn't love it like the others in the In Death series.  This book seemed slow at times and too fast at others. Hopefully, the next installment will be better.
5	1362009600	Aced it again! Can't get enough and cannot wait for the next one. Don't know how she keeps it so fresh.
5	1362009600	I've been a fan of this series by J.D. Robb from the very beginning. The storyline flowed easily and Rob 's prose were spot on. I love how the reader can follow Eve 's logic as she works the case. I would have loved to hear more about the movie or "vid" premier and have read how the other killer handled his interview with Dallas. All in all I highly recommend this book and can't wait for the next one...I'll be pre-ordering that one too!!
2	1362009600	It wasn't as good as any of the other ones. I waited so long for a new one to come out. I love Eve and Roarke but this one just didn't do it for me. However, it won't stop me from buying the next one. I'm a fan for life
4	1362009600	J.D. Robb always entertains, and Calculated in Death is no exception, but the plot was a little reminiscent of an earlier book, the characters were less developed than in previous books, and it just lacked the depth of earlier books in the series. We also see less of some of our favorite minor characters. With that being said, some of the scenes had me laughing so hard my family was concerned. The scene where she catches the toddler is awesome, and I don't think anyone would deny the humor in the "take a nap or go to jail" scene. What is no longer funny is Eve's misuse of cliches. A couple of misused cliches is funny, but it actually became a bit annoying after a while.
5	1362009600	I've read a lot of books by Nora Roberts, the in death series is the best. Read everyone of them. Makes you wonder how she comes up with the characters and story. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5	1362009600	After 43 stories and books I still eagerly await the next Eve Dallas book. The stories still reel me in even now. This was nice to see Eve work her way through Roarke's world. To the critics who say Eve is not evolving I wonder if they are reading the same book I am. The story always mentions the timeframe from the last book and it is usually weeks,  how much evolving do you do in 2weeks? This series is one of my favorites to reread occasionally. I think it 's great to have stories and characters that kept you interested as these do for me!
5	1362009600	Nora Roberts does it again in the exciting world of Dallas and Roarke.  With lots of money, greed, murder and action you will have a great time reading .  You won't want to put it down.
4	1362009600	Nothing outstandingly new or different here, but I love the in death series enough that I'm ok with that :)I've recently reread the entire series, so it makes the similarities to some prior stories stand out, but still a fun read.
5	1362009600	Didn't disappoint. Fast paced action, steamy romance. Eve and Roarke save the day. As always can't wait for the next In Death book to come out.
4	1362009600	I read the book as soon as I got it in the mail, and I enjoyed it a lot, but it wasn't as good as the usual ones because I find business boring.  I can't believe that no one mentioned the name of one of the firms--Alexander and Pope!  Did no one else study British literature?  "To err is human, to forgive divine," among other famous lines from this great author.  I shouldn't be too surprised, though, because I don't think anyone else realized in an earlier book that Robb was almost giving the killer away by naming him Moriarty!  I liked the introduction of Officer Turney, who I hope will follow in the footsteps of Peabody and Trueheart and become the next newbie who will eventually develop into a detective.  I liked former free-ager Peabody picking out the murder weapon at the hardware store and making her own thigh holster to wear under her gown to the premiere!  Eve may be the heroine, but for me Peabody rocks!  One of the final scenes in which Eve interviewed the killer made me think of A Fish Called Wanda and Kevin Kline's character, who went ballistic when he thought someone was calling him stupid!  Anyway, this book had its plusses, and they outnumbered its minuses.
5	1362009600	Bought it and I love it of course. This is a series that can go on forever. She has an amazing knack for writing and thinking like a normal person. Her train of thought runs parallel with mine. The stories are always entertaining and I love the humor in her work.I expect anyday for her to kill off Peabody or Morse ...or some wild twist. I think Trueheart will be featured more in the future. Anyway, she is a great writer and I really liked the book. I wish that Roake could be in them more but I know this is 'all about Eve'!
5	1362009600	JD ROBB did a great job with this, I couldn't stop reading until I finished.  Always a terrific read and enjoyable.
5	1362009600	Thanks Nora! I wait impatiently for every book in the series to be released and like the rest Calculated In Death was worth the wait. Dallas, Roarke, Peabody and the rest of the gang feel like family (the much loved family that you are actually excited to have visit a couple of times per year and miss when they are gone). Very few series have kept my attention enough to buy EVERY book, but I have all of the In Death series. I love Eve and the way her character has developed from a self proclaimed loner to grudgingly accepting love, friendship, laughter and family Roarke and the others have brought into her life.  Please keep them coming! Can't wait for the next!
5	1362009600	There are some writers that you just order when the book is abvailable and do not even bother to  read the excerpts this is JD Robb. I wait inpatiently every year for her books and devour them as soon as I get it. I love that there was more interaction with Roarke and Eve and still all the regulars were there also. I really enjoy that the fearless Eve is afraid of Trina, so funny. I wonder who JD Robb will pair Reno, Louise and Baxter and Trueheart with. There should be love interests coming up in that relm. There was murder and mayhem and Eve on top of it all as usual, great book and great story. Another big question; when are Peabody and McNab getting married?
5	1362009600	Wow. I feel as if J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) read my complaints about her last novel, Delusion in Death and fixed them finally in this novel. My two main complaints have always been that every case somehow involves Roarke and Roarke takes days off to follow Eve around while she investigates.In "Calculation in Death" we have Eve and the dependable Peabody investigating the apparent mugging of an accountant, Marta Dickenson. It becomes clear pretty early on that this is not a mugging, but a deliberate murder. With Eve and Peabody figuring out the who and the why we have them becoming embroiled in the world of finance.The writing is once again superb, the dialogue fast and funny at times, and we get to catch up with all of our beloved favorite characters, Mavis, Leonardo, Nadine, and others. Probably one of the best scenes in my opinion is Eve trying to win back Galahad's favor. When you read about what occurs you will not be able to stop laughing.What I liked is that this novel for once had Eve investigating with all of her officers and very minimal Roarke at her side. One thing that always irked me is that Roarke is a billionaire who is constantly wheeling and dealing and he was never at work. Instead, he was off always helping Eve investigate. I liked the shift in this novel that we get to see how busy Roarke truly is, and though he doesn't like Eve being in danger he trusts her to take care of herself.Also I liked that you couldn't guess who the villain was right away and that there were many layers to the murder of Marta Dickenson.Only one teeny quibble I had is that once again the killer decides to go after Eve. I wish that for once we just have murders that Eve is investigating that does not result in the killer deciding to go after Eve.I definitely recommend this novel to fans of the "In Death" series, you will not be disappointed!
5	1362009600	I've read them all..and it just keeps getting better..Thank you for the fun and laughter.  Looking forward to the next adventure..
5	1361923200	Wow, she's done it again.  I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline.  I do have to say I did get a bit dazed with the number of players in this book, but once I straightened it out, I even enjoyed it more.  It ticked all the boxes.  I will be reading it again, as I do think on a first read through you miss nuances etc.  I cannot wait for the next one.  The "In Death" series is my favourite of all her various trilogies/quartets and stand alone books.  Its like re-visiting an old friend every book.
5	1361923200	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Good pacing, as always, and the story was interesting. I would recommend this author to all my friends
5	1361923200	Couldn't put the book down.  As always J. D. Robb created a story that grabs and pulls you in so fast that you don't realize that time has flown by while you're reading.  Can't wait for next book.
3	1361923200	If you've read all her other Lt. Dallas books then this is a bit of a been there done that.  What is really missing in this book are all the other characters that keeps her books interesting and fun to read.  Also something that struck me with this book is that I'm beginning to not care for Lt. Dallas so much.  I started this series really enjoying a strong independent woman and now I'm beginning to find her lack of social skills and rough edges annoying.  I mean how many years can Roake handle carrying her off to bed to get some sleep since she doesn't have enough sense to do it herself....and I admit the need for people to force her to take a painkiller, pick out her clothes, etc is getting to be too much.  I thought she was growing and changing into a somewhat normal human but after all these books she's still so rough around the edges that its rubbing me the wrong way.  Just my thoughts.  I'm sure ill be thre for her next book but the excitement and enjoyment of this series is definitely not what it use to be.
5	1361923200	Lt. Eve Dallas and Detective Peabody,ably assisted by Roarke and McNab are out to catch a killer. Not a professional killer, but one that is rapidly evolving to a serial killer as he finds out how much he likes to kill with each victim. Three are dead, will Dallas and Peabody be able to stop him from killing moreI can truly say she never disappoints. The characters are real people to me and their interaction with one another is like the interaction you have within your own family. There is more than one story going on here; besides trying to locate the killer, Eve is finding the WHY of the deaths, all while planning to attend the premier of a vid (movie) based on one of her previous cases. The action is ever suspenseful and never expected.This is the 45th book by JD Robb that I have read and I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery, suspense and romance.
5	1361923200	An avid J.D. Robb fan and will always look forward to the next Eve/Roarke adventure! I hope they never stop.
5	1361923200	As Roberts always delivers, she has put forth another great story. However I am a bit unhappy about the errors I've found: Detective Santiago should be Sanchez (as he is referred to in all releases after Treachery in Death) and Lieutenant Oberman from that same novel is called &#34;Oberon&#34; in this book. Perhaps an editor error? Either way the plot is twisty and the anecdotal interactions between Dallas and the people closest to her leaves you wanting more.I can't wait for the next.
2	1361923200	I'm sure at some point, many years ago, the In Death series started as a glimmer in Nora Roberts brain. It was just a thought, maybe about how intriguing a series about a female cop set in the future would be. That idea took root and other characters started to come to life; Nora started writing and history was made...the first In Death book was published to rave reviews. More books followed, the series garnered even more fans and it made a lot of money...Nora must have been happy with her creation because the plotlines remained innovative and the characters kept developing making it obvious that Nora remained invested in the series.Sadly, that investment seems to be over. The last book I am sure was written by Roberts is "From New York to Dallas" which was superb. The most recent books, including "Calculated In Death" are poor imitations of Roberts at her best and I don't believe they were written by her. This new ghostwriter is not invested in the supporting characters nor does he/she understand Eve and Roarke very well because their mannerisms and dialogue are just...off. Also, these books have no edge...they aren't compelling and this series was always compelling and filled with suspense. This book is better than the last two but again, I don't believe for one moment it was written by Roberts and that is why I am confused and saddened. I don't understand how or why an author can put so much into creating a wonderful cast of characters and then building a world for them to live in and then just turn it over to someone else knowing it won't be as good. This is very disrespectful to the fans and the series.I'd rather see one good book per year instead of two subpar books. If Nora is done with Eve and Roarke then she should take a break or end the series. The fans deserve better and so do the characters.If you still want to buy this book don't expect to see much of the supporting characters and don't expect to be riveted by the mystery because it isn't developed enough to pull you in. This book is like overcooked oatmeal...bland, sort of mushy and hard to swallow.
1	1361923200	This is the first JD Robb book I've read where I had to force myself to finish it.  It was boring and plodding.  It is as this ghostwriter (and it has to be ghostwritten) was writing a CSI episode without any of the interesting bits.  I could skip over pages and not really miss anything.There was nothing special about anybody here.  The characters are caricatures of themselves where their names are used but none of the personality that infused them and made them interesting are there.  The dialogue is like reading a bad TV script.The things that made Eve Dallas special are all gone.  Eve is "off" with none of her usual brilliance or humanity.  She's coarse.  Lots of unnecessary profanity that I had not witnessed before.  She's plodding.  She has no humanity . . . No caring or emotion . . . she even catches a baby thrown in the air and doesn't even care!  It makes no true impression on her at all!She exercises no real brilliance.  Roark and others seem to have done the work for her.  And, in the prior books where she "stands for for the victim"?  That's missing.  There really is not emotional link between Eve and the victim, especially the first victim.Sadly, there is also no Eve evolution.  Roark is still forcing her to do basic functions for herself, e.g., eat and take pain medication.  Others are forcing her, STILL, to dress up.  I mean this books acts as if she is mentally incapable of caring for herself.  In prior books, that type of atypical behavior is balanced by her amazing brilliance as a cop.  Not here.  Here, she seems like a fool, a person not worth anyone caring about.All the interesting characters in the prior books are shadows of themselves.  Nothing interesting.  Stale dialogue.  Stale case.  I could guess the culprit as soon as he was introduced.Disappointing.  I'm seriously disappointed.  This may be the end of the In Death series for me.  I don't see wasting any more time or time on this type of book.  I kept reading because I hoped it would get better.  It never did.  It plodded right along to the last page.  I hated this book.  I hate what was done to the characters.  ~sigh~
4	1361923200	I read everything from Nora Roberts, so this one was on the list.  Good read, even after all of the In Death reads, she adds enough new to keep them interesting and fresh. I like how all the characters have evolved and continue to grow with every book.  I will regiment this to friends.
5	1361923200	I enjoy the characters and they are always evolving. It's like watching your children grow up. It doesn't get any better.
5	1361923200	Yet again another enjoyable book by J. D. Robb.  I enjoy this series and this book did not disappoint.  I find that the books just seem to get better and better.  Would recommend to any one who likes a good book.  If you have been a reader of this series you will find this enjoyable!
3	1361923200	Formulaic. Pedestrian. Read them all in the series and this one is definitely second if not third tier. Taking a break from Eve and Roarke.
5	1361923200	I love all of these books and this one was no different. I loved the whole book and was disappointed when it was over. Great ending and of course as always a cool plot. Eve as always kicks major butt. Just loved it
5	1361923200	I just love this series and have a hard time waiting patiently for the next book to come out. The gang is all here and Galahad is more human than cat.
3	1361923200	While I have enjoyed ALL of the "In Death" series including this one, I find that the price is too rich for my blood.  The paperback only costs $1.00 more and at least you can lend the book to friends.  BRING DOWN THE PRICE!!!
5	1361923200	J.D. ROBB. Best read ever. Read my words very carefully. No need to ever say anything more than best read ever.
5	1361923200	I love all the characters they come alive. You feel like your there and part of the story. I love this series. When's the next one?
4	1361923200	This was a good read.  A little slow at first, but the pace picked up towards the end.  I really liked the interaction between Eve & Roarke.  The part with Galahad the cat was hilarious!
4	1361923200	I've read every &#34;in death&#34; book.  I really appreciate the depth of the characters.  This book was a quick read, left me wanting more.  Unlike some of the others there was no real death threat to the main characters.I enjoy the way the author puts a story together.I can't wait for the next one.
4	1361923200	If you are a fan, this doesn't disappoint!  If you aren't a fan, well, whatcha wait in' for?  Full cast- Eve, Roarke, Mavis, Peabody, McNab, Leonardo, Mira, plus some old favs... great action and still enough unsaid to make you think without making you tired!
5	1361923200	A read worth waiting for. I'm invested in Nora's characters and enjoy the update with each book. What a storyteller!
5	1361836800	JD Robb has done it again, fast-paced totally enthral lying novel. Yet it is character driven.  I found this lighter while murder investigation is at the core for those of you who love the secondary characters they are all there.  I won't give plot details but it was a wonderful romp and visit with old and new friends.  I love the continuity from one book to another, letting the reader see what has occurred in the lives of previous characters and from previous books.  Could continue and hope to contine for many years
4	1361836800	By all outward appearances, the death of Marta Dickenson seems to be the result of a mugging gone wrong.  But to NYPSD Lieutenant Eve Dallas, things just don't add up.  The evidence Eve and her partner find lead them to believe that the accountant was murdered.  After someone steals files from Marta's office, it becomes clear that Eve will have to dig into the world of big business in order to find the killer.  With the help of her husband, Roarke, Eve will delve into the world of finance to find someone calculating enough to order the death of an innocent woman.  And Eve better hurry, because Marta's death will only be the first of many, if the killer has his way.I can always count on J.D. Robb to deliver an enjoyable story, and that's just what she does in CALCULATED IN DEATH.  The thirty-sixth novel in the IN DEATH series is a slow burn read; it takes a while for momentum to build, but once it does, you'll be unable to put the book down.CALCULATED IN DEATH is primarily a case-centric book, and it's a delight to see Eve slightly out of her element as she navigates the world of corporate finance.  It doesn't hurt that she has the biggest name in business sitting across from her at the breakfast table every morning.  As always, the way Eve and Roarke play off each other while she's working a case provides entertainment and gives insight into how each of their minds work.  Indeed, it's the small moments rather than the case itself that give CALCULATED IN DEATH its spark.  The byplay between Eve and her partner, Peabody, the glimpses into the dynamic of Eve and Roarke's relationship, the way an element of the case can help Eve come to terms with an aspect of her past... All of these things come together to make CALCULATED IN DEATH a pleasure for a fan of the IN DEATH series to read.Ms. Robb has a way of engaging the reader all throughout the book with the twists and turns that Eve's cases take.  This holds true for CALCULATED IN DEATH -- even the twists you can predict are written in such a way that you're not going to want to stop turning those pages by the time you reach the story's climax.  While not as emotionally-charged as some of the other IN DEATH books, CALCULATED IN DEATH is still an excellent story and I cannot wait for Ms. Robb's next foray into Eve and Roarke's world.LilyReview courtesy of Romance Junkies
5	1361836800	Love the In death series the characters are well written and you always feel like cheering on Eve, Roake and the rest of the repeat characters in the series can't wait for the next book
3	1361836800	I did read this book cover to cover without pauses, but I kept waiting for that moment in an Eve & Roarke book that I just did not get.  This book is a basic murder plot, with lots of subtext (I hope) for the next book.  I am going to try not to give spoilers, I might allude to something but will not give details.  If you are new to series, start at the beginning, for diehards you will want to read this, but there is nothing other than your own impatience that makes it MUST read today :).Eve and Roarke are my fav's as some of you know.  I read them the second they come out and I almost always 4 or 5 stars.  This book feel like the set up for the next one.  You know how a lot of the books recently have referenced that Eve would have had a promotion already but some people think she is a glory hound and others think she is too brash blah blah?  This feels like it is setting her up for major career advancement.They start by talking about how good she is @ spotting talent and brining that in, you know how she brought up Peabody and Truehart and then she kind of mellows, the things that would drive her insane, she still gets snarky over, but she she lets things go and delegates some of it.  They also have  a part that will make her a hero in the eyes of all New Yorkers, and lots of positive media bits with out looking like she is seeking it out.  We are no longer getting the accusations that she puts her life before her career, in fact the judges sister in law that gets murdered wants Eve on the case.  So instead of roadblocks this book has things streamlined.I see big things happening in the future, and it did need to be laid out, it just was not this book.  The character interaction was so so, nothing I found to be great.  Very mellow book.  It will not be one I re read, I enjoyed it and it was worth reading, maybe not @ 14.99.  This seems more like a wait for paperback version.  I rarely if ever say that about the J.D. Robb books.  I personally could not wait because I think the next book will knock my socks off. Not disappointed I spent the money for the book, because I could not wait even if I read this review, I need to know NOW.  If you are like that, settle in for a well written police book. Like I said this feels more like character development, I can totally see Baxter making LT if Eve gets a promotion.
5	1361836800	Once again Nora Roberts has transported her readers to Eve Dallas' and Roarke's world. The storyline is fast paced and their relationship continues to grow. Eve's rough edges and emotional limitations continue to ease. The dialogue is witty, sarcastic and perfectly in character. All in all it's like visiting old friends. Welcome and heartwarming.
5	1361836800	I love a great mystery. The first to New book in the series is great read. A fives stars . I highly recommended series for adults who like iris Johansen.
4	1361836800	On a freezing night in 2060, W.I.N. Group financial consultant Bradley Whiteson shows his girlfriend Alva Moonie the renovation of his Manhattan East Side apartment.  However, as they enter the temporarily vacated building, they find the body of a woman without a coat.  NYPD beat cop Turney contains the crime scene until Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her partner Delia Peabody arrive to lead the investigation into a Jane Doe dressed for business but without a bag or briefcase.  Though it appears to be a mugging gone badly, anomalies make it seem more likely a professional hit by someone with limited cleaning experience.  The victim is accountant Marta Dickenson, a mother of two married to the brother of a Judge.The grief stricken spouse explains to Dallas and Peabody that he knew something bad happened to his beloved wife when after working late on an audit she failed to arrive home in a reasonable amount of time and failed to call him about any delay; he called her but Marta did not pick up.  The two cops learn that the victim's accounting files are missing and probably the motive for Marta's murder.  With Eve's husband Roarke providing his unique expertise, the cops focus on the accounting-finance world rather than the victim's family.The latest In Death futuristic police procedural (see Delusion in Death) is a gripping murder mystery in which readers feel they are five decades into the future mostly due to ingenious gizmos used by the police.  Though the culprit's increasingly out of control violent murders come across as over kill, readers will relish this fast-paced and action-packed homicide investigation as Eve risks her life to catch a deadly predator.Harriet Klausner
4	1361836800	Really good story.  Love J.D. Robb. Clever plot, a little humor, a dash or two of sex and romance, snappy dialogue = success.
4	1361836800	This is #36 in the In Death series & it can stand alone. Always enjoy trying to solve each murder puzzle. The main & side characters become like family. So it's fun to first meet them Here or to catch up with them.  In this book, LT Eve Dallas, NYPSD, spends lots of time in the beginning interviewing all the people in many corporations who are connected to an accounting firm. A young accountant, wife/mother, Marta, was found dead on the upper E side without coat or purse, etc, made to look like a mugging. Police procedural to figure out who & why Marta was killed. Plus other bodies surface as well. Sometimes it felt confusing trying to keep who worked at what company straight. But still all enjoyable reading. Action picks up in second part of book. There's plenty of twists & turns.Eve has many conversations with her sexy billionaire husband Roarke. Some of their usual romance & sex, not enough for me tho, more in other books. But still there's discussions that inform of their marriage relationship & some about Eves past. Roarke also helps once again as he delves into the finances (& lives) of the varied companies using his computer & business skills. Something interesting to look forward to is the upcoming video premiere of the Icove clone case, solved in the Orgin in Death book. All the characters & cops will attend walking the red carpet. & awaiting the killer who Eve tries to bait knowing he's now after her & her partner, Peabody.Not as much interaction between characters as in other books. But this book is enough to get to know Eve, Roarke, Feeny, Mavis, Peabody, Mcnab, Mira, Nadine, & other cops & the many others. Read all this series books  & see how they grow/change. New to the series start with at least the first four.  In this book theres humor, interesting dialogue, sex, romance & enough mystery to make a facinating read on its own. It's far too easy to get lost in Eve & Roarkes world. So much so I often reread all the series books. Nora Roberts as J D Robb certainly knows how to tell grand stories that keep you guessing want more. Its addicting fun.
