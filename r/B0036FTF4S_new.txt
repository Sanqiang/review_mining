5	1405382400	good read
4	1405296000	This book surprised me and was overall a very entertaining book
5	1405209600	The author has good writing skills, making the book easy to read.  I also appreciated the character development.  I enjoyed it very much.
4	1405123200	Entertaining read, I plan to buy the other books in the series.
5	1405036800	Lallo
4	1405036800	Enjoyable storyline.  Looking forward to reading the next installment.
5	1404950400	This book is one of the best books I have ever read! Some books leave me with an unsatisfied feeling, this leaves me wanting more. It has a great mix of elements that every story needs and the best part was that it was able to make me laugh and cry at the appropriate moments. In short... IT WAS THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN A LONG TIME!!!!!!!! =D
3	1404950400	.... /meh
1	1404864000	The fantasy in this book has no basis.  The magic education is covered only in general, nor is there any other support for the immediate appearance of some, oftentimes ridiculous, magic.  This type of story telling is too similar to the Potter series, where the ability for magic magically appears just in time to resolve the current dilemma.  At least with that series, some thinking was involved while the story played out.  With this story, we are expected to blindly follow along from one frail scene to the next.
5	1404777600	I absolutely loved this book. And, of course, I read through it way too fast,as even though it was a hefty size, I just couldn't stop. Well, it's not the first time the birds were singing as I went to bed. Now I'm headed to buy the next one. Very good characters. dialogue, and action. Focused and well laid out- I found a new treasure! Definitely a keeper.
5	1404777600	This is the best adventure book I have read. It is a mixture of adventure, action and mystery. You really get into touch with the characters and it is hard to put the book down after you start. I recommend this book for everyone who likes adventure and fantasy.
4	1404777600	I read a lot of Fantasy/Science Fiction, write, and have family and friends in the publishing world. What comes out of the larger publishers neatly fits a template of marketability, which is to say the storylines/characters are a bit predictable. E-pub provides access to the "slush pile", which can often be interesting.I give this 4 stars as the I had no idea how the story was going to progress, and really enjoy being surprised at the unfolding. Decent dialogue & interesting characters. The author sets a nice pace of events - I often read farther than I had time for as I wanted to see where this was going.But, many of the other comments are correct - the help of a professional editor would have helped. While I enjoyed the story arc, it was unbalanced to the overall universe of the book. Character positioning towards each other missed the mark at places.Regardless of reviews, I will be picking up the next book in the series soon, as I like the main characters, and I want the author to continue his work. Joseph, keep at it!  Make a budget for an real editor and give it a try, you are building in the right direction.
3	1404604800	A few months later, the characters here are still fairly fresh, which indicates to me that the book was pretty well written.I liked many aspects of this novel, but I felt there were some somewhat ambiguous modern political points that the author was attempting to make.  That's pretty tough for fantasy, as readers who don't agree with those points will feel alienated, like I did.I liked the fox-man character and the secret city design etc.  The main character was a bit disagreeable, but the ancillary characters were creatively constructed.  I liked the book, but I'm waffling on whether to plop down $$ for the next in the series.
5	1404604800	Good read and free!
4	1404518400	It took me quite awhile to get into this book, but once I did I SO enjoyed it. The characters are refreshingly believable and the storytelling is quite good. The many errors were a little distracting (spelling, mixing up characters' names, etc.) but I still immediately purchased the second book in the series and am now reading the third. If you enjoy fantasy, give it a read!
5	1404345600	Loved it. Adventure, magic, dragons and other creatures, call me old-fashioned but i'd say fairy tales is my thing. And i wouldnt say it's a children's book. Just bought the second of the series :)
4	1404086400	Character development is great, mystery is on going look forward too the rest of the books. She has a lot ahead of her much to do to end the war.
5	1403740800	This is a well written book with unique settings and style, any fantasy reader will enjoy this book. I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1403654400	This has to be one of the best books I've read in a long time. I would even say better than Game Of Thrones. It has an excellent pace and the rewards come easily as you see Myranda grow. I don't want to give away too much because I loved the little surprises that appeared as I read. Not only was the story great, but the voice of the author and flow of the narrative was a great pleasure. I found myself re-reading descriptions of places and people, which is something I haven't done since I was a teenager in the 90s reading Angus Wells. Well done! I can't wait to read the others in the trilogy!
5	1403654400	The book had an interesting start, but captures the reader with a lot of action and character growth. Very fun read!  I bought the last two in the series, but I haven't gotten to them yet.
5	1403654400	This fantasy world will snatch you up and hold you, enthrall you and thoroughly keep you reading. It won't let you put it down.I loved the story, the adventure and the characters.Recommended for LOTR fans and those who love adventure tales.
4	1403568000	Although the heroine is slow to catch on to anything but magic, it's still a fast paced entertaining read.  I will look for 2 and 3 to come.
4	1403568000	I've just reread the book of Deacon before starting the 2nd book and thoroughly enjoyed it ... Again. A few of the characters are a too charicaturish for me but generally people and others are well drawn and have sufficient complex well-thought out moral ambiguities. All mixed with magic and intelligent dragons. Yeah.
5	1403481600	this is a very good book.exciting and great story line.if u like fantasy stories you will enjoy this one. I can't wait for the next book
3	1403308800	The book was written fairly well (nothing too special but it was by no means painful to read) and it kept me interested, but something bothered me about it and so I'm not going to buy the second book.I couldn't put my finger on any one big problem, so I'll just list the little problems I noticed.1.  The dragon was obnoxious.  Everything from the fact that she acted like a dog to Myranda's ineffective parenting, I just would have rather it wasn't in the book.2.  Nearly all of Myranda's problems could have been solved by shutting her mouth every once in a while.  In the beginning, she gets an entire town to hate her for saying something completely unnecessary.  Sure, she has good reason to FEEL that the lady's relative died for no reason, that doesn't mean she had to say it to her face.  She could have said &#34;I'm sorry for your loss&#34; or something tactful like that and she would have been fine.  She didn't have to complain every time she felt someone was treating her unfairly, either.  sometimes, you just have to grin and bear through obnoxious people.3.  nobody had respect for anything or anyone.  ok, that's an exaggeration, but consider this.  At one point in the story, she starts training under a crotchety old wizard.  He's one of those cantankerous geezers who seem terrible in the beginning, but surprise you with their wisdom, skill, etc.  At one point (spoiler warning), they get into a dangerous situation and Myranda volunteers to act as a decoy.  As a final gesture of good will (and thanks), the old man gives her a locket and one of his best wizarding crystals.  It's kind of a sweet moment, actually.  however, just a few chapters later, she ends up under knew teachers who unceremoniously throw both the stone and locket to the ground and laugh at them as trash, AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING!!!  Come on!  At least respect the locket.and finally 4.  everyone praises the main character for her amazing mediocrity.  sure, she's a good wizard (they go on and on about that), but that's not what I'm talking about.  Every reaction she has and every choice she makes is incredibly average and yet people praise her for it.  There's one part where a hooded stranger, at great cost to himself, pays for her food and lodging in a time of need.  She meets with the stranger and finds out that he is a member of a race that is traditionally hated by humans and cast as villains in childhood stories.  After reacting in disgust, she gives him the benefit of the doubt and over comes her racism, which is a completely normal series of reactions given the circumstances.  However, said helpful character praises her for her &#34;purity&#34; as if she had done something exemplary rather than just decent.  Even the part that I mentioned in which she offers to be a decoy.  It was either, die there with everyone or try to run and maybe die or escape.  It wasn't advantageous at all for her to stay so that was also a pretty average choice.  This is fine, but it just bothered me that people praised her so much for these kinds of things
5	1403308800	I was looking for a fantasy novel to pass the time and came upon this title, a little slow starting off but overall definitely worth reading.
5	1403222400	I read the whole series a long time ago but know I loved them or wouldn't have purchased, read & gave them this rating on my kindle!
5	1403222400	would suggest any fantasy addict read this first installment, well crafted vivid descriptions. Did not want to put it down till I reached the last word.  Look forward to the next installment
5	1403222400	I am in my 60's  and my grand daughter is 10 and we both loved the book. It is a good down to earth fantasy book that is easy to read and enjoy.
5	1403049600	The first few chapters were tough but it picked up fast! I enjoyed this book and would suggest it to anyone. It was a good break while I wait for the next book of my favorite author, Trevor Cooley. Thanks Joseph lallo, you are now one of my favorites!
5	1403049600	This was a great read. I was able to enjoy the characters and their exploits. In fact unlike most of these series, I am looking forward to reading number two. Thanks to the author for getting me involved.
5	1402876800	I really enjoyed this book. The writing seemed a bit immature at first but depth was developed as the story continued. The character development was excellent. I love a story where I care about the characters. I downloaded this book for free from Amazon and will now be purchasing the rest.
5	1402790400	i can not wait to read the other books to follow.  i hoping to read the rest of the books very soon.
3	1402704000	I downloaded this book 2years or so ago, and until now sat in the cloud it keep coming up in my suggested books so I gave in. I was not disappointed but also not quite sure if it is really 4.5-5 star quality.I am not saying I didn't enjoy but it seemed not what I expected.I do recommend to others as it is a good story but not sure it is the grand book as others have stated
4	1402704000	I enjoyed the book and really had a problem putting it down.  The character development was great; you felt attached to the characters that are clearly NOT one dimensional.I got the second book in the series right after finishing this one.The only downside was the book left you 'unfinished'.  This is often the case with multi-book series but this one left you less finished than usual.
5	1402617600	Loved this book, the writing was a tad bit aimed towards juveniles (or so I would believe), but I thought it built the characters very nicely and I enjoyed it very much. Quick, easy, fun read.
4	1402617600	Joseph Lallo has managed to create an exciting and spellbinding fantasy tale that will likely leave you wanting more.~Potential spoilers~I quite enjoyed this book from the moment I picked it out of my kindle list - the beautiful artwork on the cover being what first caught my eye, the first few pages caught my mind. The story pulls you along in easy-to-digest scenes within each chapter and the use of language is simple enough not to make reading a chore (as can sometimes be the case with fantasy novels). The perspective the reader is first immersed in is that of the lead protagonist, Myranda. With a few short exceptions the story revolves almost solely around her exploits as she wanders a war-torn land, unwittingly the pawn in a great game of fate. She is a relatable heroine with a unique voice and identity, and the reader quickly finds themselves sucked into her narrative.Around page 70 I found my attention to the story beginning to waiver however. The flow that the first quarter of the book had enjoyed started to give way, and I became aware of the authors desire to force the plot along. From there multiple arcs began to form, and I started to feel that the author was taking advantage of one-too-many common tropes - or at least, taking advantage of them far too suddenly. Myranda's character evolved at a pace that didn't seem to match our initial introduction to her personality. Within the space of a very short time she acquires a dragon for a pet, learns the basics of wizardry, and is inducted into a super-secret resistance group - and there was no build to any of this, it merely happened to her in one fell swoop.Issues of that sort remained somewhat constant throughout the rest of the work, leaving me with an unpolished feeling from the pages I was reading. It felt like some more thought and attention to detail over the course of an additional rewrite would solve many of the problems at hand. Having the book be introduced more clearly as being an account of events passed (written by Deacon's hand), would have been better than leaving that until the very end. A wider sense of time for realism perhaps - extending the length of Myranda's journey and training into many months or years (or validating much earlier that she has a propensity for magic). I struggled to push through the story in some places because of these issues, and what would have been a two-day read stretched into a long week as I found I could only dive in a few pages at a time before I lost focus.All criticism aside for a moment however, I did end up finishing the work, and I enjoyed it enough to perhaps pick up the next couple and finish up the trilogy. Lallo has a playful tone of writing that is hard to resist, and he obviously has a powerful love of the genre within which he's working. I recommend keeping my criticisms in-mind if you find yourself wavering while you read, because even though this book did have some issues, I found it enjoyable enough to want to continue to the end - and I'm pretty certain that if you give it a chance you'll find the same.
5	1402617600	Loved it!  Flows easily and well, fascinating characters with unexpected twists, enough mystery and action to keep me interested, but peaceful enough to be a good, relaxing read.
1	1402617600	I read the first few chapters and I really couldn't go any further. I've read amateur works that far outshine this.
3	1402531200	It's ok to pass the time.  The characters are good, just a little repetitive on some things.  The main character seems to be rather vague, not really explained or thought out, I'm almost finished with the book, and still could not tell you what color hair she has, or her age, or anything else about her really.  So, that's the tree star.  The concept is good, just getting from point a to b is kinda weird. I won't remember it for very long. It's not one that sticks with you. Wish it had been a more detailed book, that would have changed everything.  The idea was great, if it had been more intricate with characters, etc. I would have found it much more readable.  Glad it was free!
5	1402531200	I had ten minutes to kill waiting on the bus so I went to the kindle store and this book came up. I figured I had nothing to lose and started reading. Well...after being sucked into the world Lallo created...I missed the bus. I couldn't put it down! I was reading while brushing my teeth, waiting on stuff at work, walking the hallways, cooking dinner, any free minute had me exploring the adventures of Myranda. This is one of the most engaging books I've read in ages and highly recommend it to any fans of the fantasy genre!
3	1402358400	This book with the amount of plot movement could have been condensed to 20 pages. Its one of those books that the author gives for free with enough cliff hangers to force you to buy the sequel that has the actual plot.
4	1402272000	This book, as with its precursor, held my interest throughout.  Character development  made the interactions between the characters believable and made one want to keep reading. Too many missed bedtimes! Thank you.
5	1402272000	I must admit, the title threw me off at first.  But, Deacon is the story teller.  This book is packed with constant action.  It kept me entrigued and the heroine was just a plain Jane.  I can't wait to read the sequel.
5	1402185600	A very well mounting to a even greater story that is to unfold in the books ahead. I am still very impressed with the amount of information the author could provide in a first book while still bringing the ever present emotion to need to learn more about the storyline. Truly amazing.
5	1402099200	this book is well written and performed, reading the second book now and it is just as riveting as the first
5	1402012800	Well written, immersive and often funny. A great read for anyone who enjoys a good sword and sorcery type fantasy.
5	1401753600	I loved it! I couldn't put it down. The author pulls you in and keeps you there. I will definitely read on.
4	1401753600	I did not like the beginning so much, but once the characters became known and the story unfolded I became hooked!  The ending clarifies the beginning, and it made more sense after reading the last chapter.  I enjoyed the book tremendously - read it in a 36 hour time period......so you know it grabbed my attention.  Will be downloading the 2nd book as I can't wait to continue the story.  Thank you for the good read..., it has entertained me as I recoup from surgery.
2	1401753600	while reading was entertaining I didn&#34;t  like that ending would be coming sometime in future readings.  I will take care in the future to check the last few pages and not waste my time reading without and ending
5	1401667200	Very rarely a book will keep me reading right through the night. This series should be made into a movie. I love the characters and the story will draw you in and keep your attention from the very 1st page to the last. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.
4	1401667200	I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little slow to develop but once it did, it turned into a very good read and would recommend it to others.
5	1401667200	It's a little disjointed with how it starts out and then how it ends up but a good read none-the-less.
5	1401408000	This was a great tale of war,magic and hope.This tale was well written with superb character development.I actually felt that I was in the story.Excited to read the next book.
2	1401062400	This book was not my cup of tea.  I guess it depends on your taste, but this book did not keep my interest.
5	1400716800	This was an unexpected delight, the characters are well developed and the pace is quick. I look forward to reading the rest of the books. It has been a while since I have seen characters that I now like yet suspect I may be surprised by in the future.
3	1400371200	This book kept my interest. I did find it a little tedious because she excelled at everything. The only complaint with the book is that it did not end. I enjoy a good series but I prefer each book to have an ending then another story in the next book. I usually feel cheated if the book doesn't end. I feel the entire series is only ONE book. I did enjoy the story line and the characters.
5	1400284800	This book is a very good book. On the first page it draws you in and doesn't stop. The excitement never ends, it's like 1 adventure to the next. READ IT NOW! You will not regret it!
3	1400112000	The writing is good here. And the characters are complex. The magic system is richly developed--something I love. But I gave it 3 stars for two big reasons:First, the book is SLOW to get going. It's literally 33% into the book before the heroine begins to grow, learn, or do more than literally react to a string of troubles thrust on her. The real plot takes many pages to start.Second, worse than that--worth a loss of a star all by itself--is that the protagonist has no driving goal or ambition until the final page of the book. She has marvelous things happen to her. And she reacts to them in a way that makes me like her. But she is simply trying to keep up with the demands others make of her--including her extensive training.I did love the training/schooling aspect of the book. It pretty much is what this book is about. I love that setting so much that I almost gave this book 4 stars. But I held back because I realized unless you love that type of story--being taught a magic system and passing tests--you won't especially love this story.I am going to read the second book, maybe with a goal to pursue the story will move along and develop better.
5	1400112000	I was skeptical when I started reading this series, but it is so good. It's one that I have reread several times.
5	1400112000	Wonderful character development. We are eased into the storyline with clarity of purpose and understanding of individual personalities explaining the &#34;why&#34;, without our wondering about it.  Intrigue guides us along and envelopes us in every battle tocheer, jeer, or cringe as if we were right there.  Seamless melding of storyline from one book to the next.  I dislike trilogies.I find them disjointed or completely overlapping the previous effort, making them uninteresting, boring, and quite frankly awaste of time and money.  Not so the Book of Deacon. Originally purchased on my Kindle, I promptly bought the trilogy inpaperback for my Library.  I am only sorry they weren't offered in hardback.The absolute BEST aspect of the books - not one single swear word!  I should be so disciplined!
4	1400112000	Griping. A very nice read. This book hooks you from the very first page and does not let go. A must read for fantasy lover's.
1	1400025600	Horribly written. I couldn't even finish reading the book. The author had a good idea but it just wasn't executed well.
4	1399939200	Enjoyed it enough to purchase the rest of the series that is out so far. Plan on keeping this on the re-read list!
3	1399680000	I was not enticed to continue with this series after finishing The Book of Deacon.  The characters were not developed well enough for me to care what happened to them.  It was not a poor work, just undistinguished by plot or character or overall vivid writing.
5	1399680000	All the characters in this book keep you interested. Their journey through the &#34;beast&#34; was one of the best cave journeys I've read. Would recommend for anyone looking for good easy reading.
5	1399507200	I have been looking for a really good book lately, and the book of deacon is by far in my top 10 of favorite books!
1	1399420800	I could not get into this story.  Usually if a book does not capture my attention in the first few chapters I give up.  This was one of those books.
4	1399248000	The story started slowly and I thought it was kind uninteresting.  But once she made the discovery my curiosity was peaked and I was hooked until the end.  I had to really pay attention to the characters because the names were not very distinguishing.  This is a long book which seemed to me, to develop very slowly.  You have to like to read to really enjoy this book.  I will be interested in reading the next two books.  I may come back and change this if I don't like the ending.
2	1399075200	Very easy read. It was very predictable and corny.  Many things weren't explained thoroughly.  I read it but wouldn't recommend it to other fantasy readers. Not enough gore/realism for me.
5	1399075200	Just when I thought I knew where the story was going the author surprised me. . . in a good way. It kept me turning pages long after I should have been asleep.
4	1398902400	A grand epic, lots of magic and mayhem, mystery and action. Sometimes it rather rambled though, repeating things that were already made obvious so sometimes I found Myranda to be a bit of a twit, instead of a person of common sense. Finding herself alone and in a dangerous world, she still believes there is good to be found. Her big heart was so sweet and lets face it, I think anyone who reads fantasy wants their own baby dragon! Enjoyed this enough that I'll be looking into the rest of the series, need to find out what happens when all the Chosen get together.
5	1398902400	I received this book for free and I enjoyed it so much that I bought the next 2 books in the series.This trilogy should be made into a movie...it's that good.
4	1398902400	Easy read nice story with no foul language or questionable behavior. Hope the series stays true to that. Too many out there that are despicable filth
5	1398816000	I found the story line intriguing, it kept me thinking, I can't wait to start the next book to see what myranda comes across next.
5	1398816000	Spell binding would be a good choice of the books power looking forward to all the books Mr Gallo has written
3	1398816000	Hadn't read this author before, it's a nice young adult story but I'm not impressed.  It's a good read for when I'm sitting in the Dr. Office.
4	1398556800	Excellent characters in a believable, high fantasy world.  Once you get into this book you won't want to stop reading.
4	1398470400	Well developed characters, that are believable. The plot manages to not be predictable. Of course there are sorcerers, dragons, assassins, oh my!
3	1398384000	Entertaining, but the &#34;heroine&#34; got to &#34;god like&#34; in her mystic powers, to be believable ( within the story line), for my taste.
5	1398384000	Really good plot line. Few grammatical errors here and there. Slow to start. Definitely worth it. Love the different teachers.
5	1398297600	I loved this book and can not wait to get the ones that to with it. I recommend this book to other people
5	1398211200	I enjoyed this book so much I have bought all the others in the series! The story reads easily with not too many crazy names and without introducing too much too soon, but draws you in from the first chapter. Its a great read and I looked forward to my reading time everyday to see what would happen next. I am now busy with The Rise of the Red Shadow which I felt I should have read first. it is no less gripping than The Book of Deacon and can't wait to see what happens further in.I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read fantasy books. The prices of the books in this series are unbelievable! Get it now!
4	1398211200	I found it very easy to get lost in the world of this book. I didn't realize it was a series until I was almost at the end and I have already purchased the next book. The story is staying in trend with setting the story during medieval times, but adds characters/breeds not typical to this era. Overall very enjoyable read!
4	1398038400	The Book of Deacon is mistitled but I will not say more about that.It is a good Fantasy, a little confusing at first as the author develops their world. I would recommend this as an easy read and have bought the other books of the Trilogy.
4	1398038400	While i do not always enjoy fantasy writing, I reallly did enjoy this book, which has led me to purchasing the next two books in the trilogy to continue the story.
5	1397865600	This book was perfect from the first sentence all the way to the lastI loved the story and how it all worked out
5	1397606400	OMG I just can't explain in full detail how this book makes you think. It starts slowly but builds with time and destroys any genre of fantasy you have read. A must read will buy the next to finish the journey!!!!!
2	1397520000	Meh sums it up. Tired plot lines with nothing new and interesting, only one sort of enigmatic and mildly interesting character, and pedestrian writing make this a very run-of-the mill young adult fantasy book.
5	1397520000	Young heroine, shady friends, mystic blades, magic users and a baby Dragon assembled by fate.  I purchased book 2 and unless the story and quality of writing take a tragic turn to the worse I'm sure to be purchasing the rest of the trilogy.
4	1397433600	This story drew me in almost from the first sentence.  The story has a purpose and so many of the fantasy stories lack a good purpose.  I will enjoy reading the next book and recomend this to all lovers of fantasy.
5	1397433600	Could not put it down, every chance I got I would knock out pages can't wIt for the rest of the books to be at my disposal
5	1397347200	The story is exceptional! This is the best book I've read since having my kindle and I only hope the rest of the trilogy is just as incredible. I fully intend to purchase the other books in this trilogy.  :)
5	1397174400	This was a remarkable narrative of a war-torn country. Though the writing style left much to be desired, the story was flawless.
5	1397174400	crazy or must not be open minded. Not that I think you need an open mind, per se, more that you need to open your mind and let the story take you. I have read the trilogy (several times actually as it is a story so long and in depth you miss little things) and the extras, Jade and Rise of Red Shadow, and loved them completely. I just felt it was so different, but.... I, frustratingly, can't explain it well enough. I would recommend and wish I could actually talk to the author because I often find my mind going back to the story and have a question or two that could clear something up for me. I loved all the characters and their faults and strengths and how well they play off each other. I honestly wish there was a continuance just so I knew how their lives were after the BOV and multiple times wished it was picked up for a movie or series.
5	1397088000	Kind of a Middle Earth feel . The descriptive quality of Lallo's prose is wonderful. I feel cold, hungry, anxious right along with his characters. The pages keep turning!!
5	1396915200	I love the characters and the setting. There is plenty of action. I'm starting book two. Can't wait to see what happens next! I totally recommend the series.
4	1396828800	Easy going relaxed pace,combined with an involving and interesting plot make this very enjoyable. The story itself is mostly point of view, putting you right in the characters shoes. This can bother some people as it is somewhat slow in places. However the detail creates a sense of realism that pulls you right next to the characters for an very invovled experience.
5	1396828800	Great books, highly recommend.  I have enjoyed the series immensely! Thank you Mr Lallo! I look forward to each page
5	1396828800	I really liked the book. It left me with suspense to read the next book but I dont have money to get the series though. :(
5	1396656000	I STARTING WITH THIS BOOK  AND I NEED TO READ ALL OF THEM IT WAS FACINATING, I RECOMENDED THIS LECTURE FOR YOUGHT PEOPLE
5	1396656000	Amazing well written that's for sure keeps you on your toes and then some it just attracts it attention in so many ways
2	1396656000	Unrealistic pacing, uninteresting dialog. The story itself could have been interesting, but it felt as if it was being spoonfed to the reader, without any real depth to character to development. I couldn't even bring myself to pick up the next in the series when it abruptly ended.
5	1396656000	This was an awesome book. It kept me enthralled so much that I stayed up all night reading it to the finish I am looking forward to getting the next one!!
4	1396396800	Mystery and fantasy set in the Olden Days.  A fast 'lite' reading book; worth the reading.  Shall purchase the sequels. Fantasy Fan
4	1396310400	good book, amazing read.I enjoyed it to the max and recommend it to readers who like a good adventure tale.
4	1396224000	Having not read a story in this agenda genre in quite awhile, I may not be a well informed critic but I know the author created characters I cared enough about that I did not want to lay the kindle down. Characters are diverse in temperament and well and thoroughly conceived.
4	1396224000	This is a good fantasy read with a little Shangrila thrown in. Loved the characters and their interactions; there was some really good dialog. I felt the characters related well and the story was strong. I grew to like the characters and I cared about them. However, I do not like a cliff-hanger book in a series. I feel that a good fantasy writer can write a book that makes you want more but the book is kind of &#34;complete&#34; standing alone. Also, break this into chapters - why are you shunning that?
4	1396137600	Awesome book by Joseph Lallo, I couldn't put the book down. I had to go buy the other two right away to finish the series!
5	1396137600	this is one of the most satisfying books I have ever read. magic could not even tell how truly great this book really is.
5	1396137600	Very good story line, well developed characters.  Unique in development of the story.  Sorry to get to the end but looking for the chapter.
5	1396051200	This book was one of the greatest books I have ever read! Not the best but definitely worth a close read! The characters are well developed and they make you feel like you are starting to get to know them personally. You also pull out your hair when they do something stupid or when the plot twists is just too much for you. I definitely would and have read this book over and over again.
5	1395705600	This book along with the rest of the Book of Deacon Trilogy are amazing. Also there is the book The Rise of the Red Shadow, which covers the life of the malthrope before encountering Myranda.
5	1395619200	I read a lot!  I often purchase kindle book deals searching for authors that I will enjoy.  I am so glad I purchased this book, it did not disappoint at all!  The author did a great job of creating a mythical world without going too far.  I loved how he spent time on each character and made you feel the emotions of all of them.  The suspense was great, the relationships between the characters was interesting.  I did think  the battle scenes initially were a bit long, but the more I read, the more I understood that the author was weaving an intricate tale that captivated me from the beginning of the first book to the end of the third.  I couldn't put this book down and bought the rest of the series before I even completed this book.  I am now a fan of Joseph Lallo and can't wait to read everything he has written!
4	1395619200	This book offers a world much unlike our own other than it riddled in war. Twists, turns, surprises and a never ending line of characters that truly are amazing fill this book in its entirety.if you want a book that is intriguing, suspenseful and full of fantasy...read this one
5	1395619200	Love the book. Great read. I would recommend this book to everyone. Very enjoyable. Very pleased with the story line.
5	1395619200	This is a wonderful story of magic and emotions and endurance. I had a very hard time putting it down to get sleep or do anything. Very immersive and the characters are wonderful with a wide range of emotions, beliefs and wanting to right wrongs that are centuries in the making.
5	1395532800	I really hate to write reviews.  especially when they force you to a word count.  I think if you want my honest opinion, I should be able to use as few words or as many word as I please.  as you c a n tell from my comments. I am a non-conformist.  with that said, I enjoyed reading your book.  so much so, th a t I have read it TWICE.  so there.  and you have a nice day.

5	1395360000	One the  best fantasies I've read this year, finished all three books in a week, it's well written and the characters jump to life in your mind, ranks up there with Game of Thrones.
4	1395360000	I read this book because I'm a big fan of his Bypass Gemini books.  I read the two of them and at the end of both he mentions his real passion is his Book of Deacon novels.  I've seen this a lot with writers.  The books they write on the side are better or do better than the books they are most passionate about.  For instance, Steven King's &#34;The Stand&#34; series was obviously his passion and it didn't do nearly as well as it deserved.This book is good though.  I enjoyed the plot and the magic system.  The second book was even better and we got to see some real plot development.  I'm currently on the third book of this series now and having a little bit of trouble getting into it.  That said, it seems this series is worth the investment considering the price.
5	1395273600	My sister loaned this to me...was a lot better than expected...unfortunately I allowed the &#34;cover&#34; to influence me...I found it to be highly entertaining
5	1395273600	would recommend reading, clear reading, plot that was great to follow, I will try to follow the series to find out how it all ties into a future event pending,
4	1395187200	A very interesting introduction to the storyline and the unfolding of the saga is riveting.  A great read.  Recommended reading.
3	1395187200	After all the hype I expected a far better book. The story was good and the characters well=balanced and interesting. What grated for me was the excess of both grammatical and spelling errors. Also the language was stilted.and the plot is filled with too many incredible coincidences.
5	1395187200	As the first in the trilogy, this book gives an amazing start to the series. Builds characters without becoming boring. Along with progressing the story to keep your interest. All in all great book.
5	1395187200	This book is a amazing fantasy adventure unlike any other I have read before. Since the book is free I would really recommend this to anyone
5	1394841600	A slow story line, the characters are outstanding and intriguing the story for more information about the book. If the author will provide a little more action and romance to the series. I recommend  The next book before I recommend this book.
5	1394841600	Great book while keeping it clean... get really tired of reading smut just to read a good fantasy novel.. love a good book, but if I want porn I will get porn.. this kept it clean with a good story line...
5	1394668800	I absolutely loved this book. If I could give it 10 stars I would! One of the things I really enjoyed was the fact that this is a long book. I can read a 200 page book in a couple of hours, so this one kept me occupied for a week. Joseph Lallo had characters so well developed I felt  like  I was with them. He introduces new characters effortlessly. Everyone has a role in this story. There is not a lot of &#34;fluff&#34;--some authors fill their books with tedious descriptions just to make the book meet the word requirement, not Joseph Lallo. When I finished the book I felt almost bereft because I didn't want to leave Myranda and Leo.Myranda does get slightly frustrating in her thoughts of Leo, I wanted to smack her a couple of times and say &#34;wake up, girl! He has done what he had to in order to survive.&#34; It seemed she tried to put him on a pedestal that he didn't want. Myn was an interesting character, I didn't think she would be such an integral part of the story.The world that Joseph Lallo introduced me to will remain in my thoughts for a long time.
2	1394582400	This book started off grabbing my attention. Unfortunately it didn't hold my attention until the end was near.  I will read the 2nd book because I believe this author has potential along with the characters.
5	1394582400	The Book of Deacon is a fantasy story set in a world where two armies have been fighting as long as there is memory. The story tackles moral issues regarding war and looks at the idea of war for war's sake. Beyond that, it is a beautifully written adventure novel with several breakneck twists and turns that will leave almost any reader gasping for air. In the best way possible.Being that it was a free e-book I was hesitant to download it given my experiences with free books in the past. However, I was so impressed by the cover art that I was willing to give it a go. What the heck, it's free, right? Within the first chapter I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike so many self-published authors, Lallo has polished his book to a mirror shine before publishing it. From what I know his sales are good, and I can absolutely see why. The writing is smooth, lush, and professional (which are the highest compliments I can pay). His descriptions are tight and well written, his plot is strong, his characters are diverse and vivid... I can't say enough good things about it.(Read more at [...])
5	1394496000	Wonderful storyline. Believable characters.Magical! Looking forward to the next book to find out what happens to the main character - will she succeed?
1	1394409600	This book should not even come close to the rating that it is listed on Amazon. What amazes me more is that it is listed as #1. Yeah the book is free, but I found it very difficult to read through. The amount of errors are incredible throughout the book. The main character goes from a nobody to a prodigy that just excels at everything. Not to mention gets into these predictable yet troublesome situations yet just manages to survive each time. The last 3rd of the book or so is completely obvious where the story is leading not to mention completely dull and boring. This book in all honesty was torture. To the next person that thinks about this book save yourself the hassle and walk away from this piece of garbage. Please read the reviews with 1 or 2 stars they are more accurate. If you something better to read I recommend The Wardstone Trilogy or the Vanx Malic series. Again please do not let the other reviews fool you don't waste your time like I did.
4	1394409600	The book of deacon is a good read, not an amazing read, but definitely worth the time.I found it to be an enjoyable tromp through an interesting world, the characters are mostly believable and genuinely interesting, the character interactions are frequently funny, a decent start to a good series.Spoiler warningMost of the problems i had with this book involve the speed of training for the main character, and the fact that despite the grand mage she is supposed to be, she never really uses it again. The inconsistencies annoyed me.
4	1394323200	I obtained this book free and at the beginning had no great expectations. As I read on and the characters became more vivid in my mind I became increasingly more engrossed. The story held my curiosity until the very end and I have just purchased book two in the trilogy.
4	1394236800	I enjoyed the diverse group of characters. This book has magic, war, and amazing lands. A wonderful read for anyone who enjoys mythical stories.
5	1394236800	I just finished reading the third and final book in this series and thought I would come back to the first book to write my review so that someone who might be interested in reading this series would know my thoughts. This is a really good read and I enjoyed it from the very beginning. The plot, the characters and the pace of the story will keep glued to the pages. Each character has their own history and intricate role and it is an epic story of good vs. evil and individual struggle to make their professes come true. I think you will enjoy this series, I know I really did!
3	1394150400	Fun book to read with a lot of action and fantasy. Not the most sophisticated writing style but sometimes I like to just get away and enjoy a story without to much thought. This book does that for me.
4	1393977600	Strong, interesting characters with a good storyline on fantasy. Reads fast & am looking forward to next two books in the trilogy.
3	1393977600	The story was good, and I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series but the main character is so absolutest as to be unreal.  Couple that with somewhat stilted dialogue and juvenile thinking, and this would be better offered as a young adult novel.  However, the story kept me reading and overall I enjoyed it.  With some refinement this could be a great series to rival others of its type.
4	1393891200	At first, it seemed that the only plot was the absence of a plot; It appeared to be about the experiences of someone on the road. Once I stopped looking for a plot line I was able to immerse myself into the book and I was pleasantly surprised. I found that the way the main character was written annoyed me somewhat, but the secondary characters were well written.
4	1393804800	While the trilogy gets a little long winded, I enjoyed the read.I would recommend it to any science fiction/fantasy readers.
5	1393804800	I really enjoyed this book and I think you will to. I hope the next book in the series  will be.  As good.
5	1393804800	5stars. I got so caught up I had to finish. I have to read the next one. I highly recommend this to any scify reader.
4	1393804800	If I don't recommend this trilogy, why am I giving this book four stars?  Because this book deserves four stars.  Unfortunately, the next book is not quite as good, and the final book is just a mess.If you don't mind it when authors jump from one person's point of view to another person's within a paragraph, then by all means read these books.  Personally I find that very annoying, and if I had know the author was going to adopt that practice starting in the second half of the second book, I would not have allowed myself to get hooked on the story.The story itself is engaging.  The writing though...
5	1393804800	I love this book! It has everything I would want in a book. At first I thought I would not like it but I ended up loving it. I love the plot and there are just enough details to give me a picture of the setting but not to much to give a headache. I am a really picky reader because I get headaches from some books and even if I do like the book or not. I'm just glad that I got to read this book. By the way I love the title I didn't know what it meant til the end good job. There is a twist and turn on every page! I had to beg my mom so I could get the next one! Keep making books just like this one!
5	1393718400	Very well thought out and fast paced. Loved it. I was so impressed by the different mastery subjects and levels
5	1393718400	I enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to reading the next one in this series.  I am sure it will be great.
5	1393718400	A v very good read. I look forward to the rest of tree he trilogy. I feel like there is a mystery here that needs to be solved. Fantasy, mystery and a very interesting world. I am wonder ok by about Miranda past.
4	1393718400	This was the perfect length I'm so tired of all the free books being short the characters were lovely the dragon is awesome the main character finally can stop being a victim of circumstance and take charge of her life loved it
4	1393632000	I did enjoy this book. It held my attention. I did not want to put it down. I read the book within 2 days and have gotten the next in this series.
4	1393632000	It kept me reading and I need to finish the trilogy now! This is my first fantasy in a very long time. I really enjoyed the variety of magic and it has an intriguing storyline.
5	1393459200	I absolutely loved this book! It's so suspenseful and full of riddling thoughts. I'll be looking for these books in book stores! I hope that the book I'm writing will turn out just as good as this.
4	1393372800	A wonderful book! Despite the few miss-spellings.  I absolutely loved it! It kept me on the edge and wanting to read more!
5	1393372800	Fun book but I knew what was coming. Great description of the world, it's history, and culture. Nice conversations, and nice flowing plot. I recommend this.
5	1393286400	I really like this book. It was free, and I bought the other two and am reading them now. It's not contrived or totally predictable. Some reviewers mention grammar/editing errors, but I think Lallo has re-edited this trilogy and I didn't think any errors really stood out or interupted my reading. The story is enjoyable!
2	1392940800	While I realize it is hard to be original with some story lines I kept getting thisfeeling that I had read all of this before.  It just kept going on and on so muchso that when I would look to see how far I had gotten along in the book couldnot believe not even half!  I really did try:I liked the little dragon, the wizzard was a royal pain who would go off ontothese incredibly lenghty dissertations, Leo was interesting but way to sketchy incharacter development and the book was just long and drawn out.  I did somethingI hate to do - I did not finish it.
3	1392940800	wel this book felt like it was written for the older child or teen. i am only about half way through the book. i want to finish this book and if it gets better for me then i will go back and add to my review. that is about all i can say for now.
4	1392940800	I have to say I have enjoyed reading this book. The characters are quite fun and imaginative and the twists are great, however they are a little predictable. All in all, a good book and I look forward to reading the next one.
5	1392940800	Got this one for free read it...Loved it...bought the rest of the trilogy. and bought his short story. Thank you for being a talented author.
5	1392854400	What a great imaginative book, full of some suspense, characters that are wonderful, background scenes to die for in one place, and did I mention the dragons! Other great friends that round out a story worth reading. If only...
5	1392854400	I hadn't finished this yet and it's amazing.  I didn't know anything about it when I started reading it and it has become one of my favorite books!
5	1392854400	Great story that moves right along. What I like is that there are only a handful of characters. The heroine is a young lady that can take care of herself without a home, food or shelter, surviving very cold winter weather. Her story really begins when she stumbles upon a dead, frozen knight and finds his sword.
5	1392768000	The story made since and was tied together well. It gave you a since of adventure without having to remember to many plot lines. I really enjoyed it.
5	1392768000	I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in this genre . I'm moving directly on to book 2 in the trilogy.
3	1392768000	I got this book because it was free, and unlike most free kindle books it had really good reviews. I don't think it is deserving of them, but it is still a fun read anyways.This book has about every fantasy stereotype you can think of, Myranda's character is very irritating at the beginning and unrealistically perfect at the end, the &#34;world&#34; of the story is a bit flat, and the dialogue is roughly formal in some places. Oh and don't get me started on how many chapters end with Myranda being knocked unconscious.Although it seems more like a good draft than a good finished project, the story is interesting for all its flaws, and I liked many of the characters. If you like fantasy, I'd say read it (I mean, it's free), and then decide (as I currently am) whether you want to buy the other two books in the series.
4	1392768000	I got this because BookBub recommended it to me, and got it for free. I can only assume Lallo wanted to promote his book series -- and promote he did. Can't wait to read book #2!The story was engaging and compelling throughout. The characters were well-thought out and there was plenty of development and plot twists. I'm also pleased with the latter end of the book, no matter how anti-climactic it was. The first half of the book was really stressing me out with how much the main character was going through, then eased up toward the end. It had an odd pacing but I didn't find it unpleasant.I wish Lallo would have given more descriptions of the characters' emotions. There were times when the main characters were angry and I could only tell because I had to read into the dialogue. Some sort of imagery to convey their emotions would have been helpful. I was also kind of turned off by the cliched [ elf/dwarf/fairy/etc. ] set of races, and fire/water/earth/air -manipulation.Despite its flaws, it was an amazing read. A definitely must-read for fans of fantasy/sci-fi!
5	1392681600	I love these kind of stories. Kept me guessing as to what was going to happen. Have started on the 2nd book.
4	1392681600	Well when I see a free book and decide to buy it :) , I actually was expecting the old adage (you get what you pay for). To my surprise and delight, I found that this book was a page turner and a fun read. So now I gotta buy the next one and help support my fee read. Great hook with the free book. Yahoo got me.
1	1392681600	I thought the book took way too long to get I to the meat of the story. Sorry to hear there at least two more books because  I won't be reading them.
5	1392681600	I liked this story line very much.  I have often thought about how things would be on earth if we had a massive war and who or hat might want to control the earth.  This book allows for some imaginative thoughts along those lines
2	1392595200	So I was reading this book, finding it to be a pleasant if not captivating tale about a stoic young woman eking out a hand to mouth existence, and I reached a point where within a few paragraphs the author totally destroyed my desire to read any more. The following explains the scene:&#60;SPOILERS&#62;So the main character finds herself rescued by some resistance group, right after having been abducted by wraiths (?) intent on taking her to an elf general (??). She is told that, in having found a sword which she no longer even possesses, she can serve as a great inspiration for the cause. She is definitely a VIP. Well, a couple of days earlier she had wounded her shoulder, and as the resistance leader inspects it, she tells the main character that the arm is definitely not salvageable. A healer should look at it quickly. No problem, says main character, just point me in the right direction and I'll ride to medical attention in the morning.Resistance leader rolls eyes and says look, you may be a VIP, but that doesn't mean we're gonna give you a horse. You can hoof it on your own. After all, it is only a *five* day journey by foot.&#60;/SPOILERS&#62;I'm sorry, but this just didn't make any kind of sense to me, and seemed a shoddy way for the author to treat a character whom he had already handled poorly up to that point. I realized that there were no characters that I had any connection to, the plot seemed to be chugging along on an autopilot of misery, and I didn't really have a sense for things ever going anywhere. I cut my losses and picked up one of the dozens of other books in my queue.
5	1392595200	Engaging read! I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to continue reading with the next  book. Definitely not what I was expecting.
5	1392595200	this series kept my interest i loved the way the characters interacted and the differences. i recommended the books to my grandchildren.
5	1392508800	Great read,leaving you wanting more. So much was unanswered, you can image many endings yet I would be surprised if Joseph did not have one more trick up his sleeve to turn the tables on what you have surmised as the ending!
5	1392508800	I really liked it .I read it in 2 days and didnt even want to quit.Now i have to get the next one in series.Plesantly surprised.
4	1392422400	I like fantasy and enjoyed this book. However, I didn't like that it ended on a cliff hanger and the preview I read of the next book didn't seem to pick up in the same place but in the life of another character and from his perspective, not the original perspective.
4	1392422400	A little slow starting but a good story line.  I almost stopped reading but kept going and glad I did
3	1392422400	The story catches your interest.  I felt it was a fast easy read. I liked the idea of a consicous objector as the protagonist and all that brings to the storyline.  Have to admit that I will read the rest of the trilogy but felt that the writing could be better.
5	1392422400	Kept me interested. Could hardly put it down. When I finished the book just had to get rest of trilogy.
4	1392422400	Any book that keeps me wandering....and this one does!Good descriptive writing,  I can fully picture it all. Very imaginative!
5	1392422400	I mainly go for romance books, but this one was free and had an interesting brief! I'm on book two and since I've had to pay for book two I can say book one was interesting and well written! Otherwise I'm a cheapskate and I wouldn't have purchased book two if book one was crap!
4	1392422400	Great adventurous read.  Love the characters and every detail.  Don't wait read this book, just wait throughout the beginning until they reach the &#34;beast.&#34;
4	1392422400	A well balanced blend of narration delicately interposed with illuminating details regarding social structures, as well as a unique and imaginative mystic forces.  Overall conflict seems rushed, as well as political underdevelopment. This being said, an excellent job creating a cathartic character, and allusion towards a mysterious anti-hero.
4	1392336000	Got this book just to pass time and actually enjoyed it. Good storyline. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good book.
4	1392336000	The Book of Deacon was a good read, however when it ended it left me wanting for more.  Its quite wordy but worth it.
4	1392336000	I read on and on, plodding along with Myranda and just as clueless. I found her adventures interesting and mysterious and wanted to know more. But even though she went places and did stuff and overcame hardships, I never did really find anything out except who Deacon was. I guess it's in the next book!
5	1392336000	Nice fantasy storyline and grabs you from page 1.  The ending leaves you with anticipation of the next chapter and where the story might go.
5	1392336000	It was fun and it kept me into it until I finished. I liked it. It was a long book
2	1392249600	first off and most importantly: this is not a complete story. there is NO resolution! I don't even know if there is resolution in the second book. I kept reading this book waiting for the various story lines to make sense and they never did! so frustrating.I don't mind books in series, but they need to have some resolution on each book. this book does NOT have that. cannot recommend this book at all. it's only half a book.
5	1392076800	Just perfect. If you love fantasy books with magic. This is the perfect book I recommend. Buy it and have a great time.
5	1391990400	I plodded through the beginning of this book, bored to tears at times, fighting the urge to compulsively pound the NEXT button on my Kindle, only to end up spellbound once the story took off. There's magic! And dragons! And fairies! And mermaids! And some weird fox man, whose name MAY or MAY NOT be Lain, or it could be something else, and REALLY WHAT IS HIS DEAL?  You will need to read. This is the first of the series and the series ends up being great. The first few pages a boring as they set the story, then it is off and running great book well worth your time and money.
4	1391990400	I liked this book a lot. It suffers from the usual eBook editing issues but the story is interesting and there are many complex characters. I can only hope the development follows this same path.
5	1391990400	Sometimes an author can craft a tale that beckons the reader into a world of possibilities...and such an author is Lallo. As this tale unfolded I found myself identifying with a few of the characters. Over all this novel had a wonderful tempo and I felt I could imagine the crafted reality...since book 1of this trilogy is an embracing indication I don't hesitate to recommend the remaining two
5	1391817600	I was hesitant about finishing this book until the author assured me that my favorite character does come back. And I'm glad I finished it (and the series) I hope another ones written and I just have to say, these would make amazing movies. To Mr.Lallo- if you decide too I'd love to be in them! Haha
4	1391817600	I'm a long time fantasy reader and this is a good story, with decent characterization and is good intro for the trilogy.As soon as I finished this first free selection, I parted with my money for the rest of the trilogy and the side story &#34;Rise of the Red Shadow&#34;.
5	1391731200	The first one was a freebie.  I was skeptical but I kept reading - wanted to find out what happened.  Now I'm invested in the characters; might have to buy the other books now.
5	1391731200	Great book. It is a short introduction into the world, but I am excited for more. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series
5	1391644800	I really enjoyed this book and will be getting the rest of the series as soon as possible. Great reading.
5	1391558400	It was hard to put down this book.  I look forward to reading the rest of the booksIn the set.F
3	1391558400	Well written in a style that's easy to follow. Good character development and story line that doesn't take forever to get to a point like some authors. I'm in to the second book now. Very enjoyable.
5	1391558400	This was a great read from start to finish. The characters were developed well and the story seemed to be building up the whole time. I most certainly will be buying the remaining books in the trilogy. I found myself in the story more than once and that, to me, is a measure of a good book.
5	1391472000	This book captured me from the moment I started to read it.  I could not put it down. I will recommend this book to all my friends and can't wait to start the next book.
5	1391385600	I loved this book! I was really surprised to find such a gem for a free version. I am new to reading kindle style, so this just happened to be the perfect teacher. I can't wait until I get the others!
4	1391385600	I have really enjoyed this tale of Myranda and her adventures. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
5	1391299200	Well written. Fantasy but I found myself completely immersed in the story and immediately searching for the sequel. Kudos to Lallo!
5	1391299200	A free download and described as the first in a series, the book's conclusion was very frustrating because--though it appears the main character development and premise of the series is established within this novel's tale, the reader will not want to put down the story to have to seek out the next installment.  The book lets the reader's imagination soar with wizards, dragons, magic, knights in armor, malanthropes, magic swords, beings that aren't really there, a perpetual war, damsels in distress, priests who favor war, and peacemongers being considered traitors.  With the conclusion, the single story is told, but there is so much more to know about who the Chosen might be, how they are found, how they all come together to create a world where war is not fought just because that is the way it has been for so many years--or, perhaps, that is the way the world will continue?  Will white, black or gray magic be important in the future, and will the generals turn against their superiors?  Will all the people imprisoned die there?  What happens to the undermine;  will they cause an uprising in captivity?  There are some issues with grammar, but nothing that would distract the reader from wanting to continue to read the story and the series.
5	1391212800	all I can say is it is refreshing to find a strong female lead character I really enjoyed the pace and the writing the author does a real good job of building his characters and keeping the story interesting I even enjoyed the slower parts when the action was not as intense if you are looking for a book filled with action fantasy magic and mystery then i highly recommend this book
5	1391212800	Great book. Excellently written. Awesome storyline. Can't wait to start on the next one.When I like a book it's got to be god.
5	1391212800	I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fansty and adventure books. This was great and I can't wait to read the other books
5	1391212800	when I began reading I didn't think this would be a book I enjoyed, but I soon got caught up in the story and had to finish. I have to continue.  Great read.
5	1391212800	This book started slowly, for me, but picked up quickly.  The story is very well written and keeps your interest easily.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
4	1391126400	I was bored and decided to look for free books on amazon one night. Came across this and enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend to younger readers who enjoy fantasy book.
4	1391126400	Really unique story, really cool and dramatic, full of magic and war. The main character is Miranda, she is awesome but a little full of justice...  This series is a must read for the interested. It only gets better and better as they go along.
4	1391040000	This book was a little slower paced than what I'm used to. The beginning dragged on for a bit, but I enjoyed the characters so much that I had to keep reading. The book eventually picks up the pace and the plot begins to develop further. Some fantasies can be quite confusing and tedious, but this is wonderfully written. I will definitely be reading the rest of the series.
5	1391040000	I choose 5 stars because it's just that good. It's a rarity for me. The Book of Deacon is well written. The story flows smoothly and it kept my interest. I'm going to be buying book 2 very soon to see what happens next. I would recommend this book to all who loves well written stories with a cast of interesting characters.
5	1391040000	I haven't enjoyed a book like this since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The characters have full personalities, the detail in the story gives depth and writing is wonderful and comfortable.  I will heartily recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre and will personally seek out the next book.  Thank you for a great tale.  Chrissy
5	1390953600	I loved this book. After years of "urban fantasy" it has been such a blessing to finally find a fantasy book worthy of the old masters! The story is complex, the scenes diverse and detailed. It moves at a wonderful pace yet it was long enough I didn't feel cheated. The characters are vivid. I love this author's voice. I am now in search of book two of this series! I haven't been this enthusiastic since Marion Zimmer Bradley died and effectively ended my beloved Darkover series.
4	1390953600	I thoroughly enjoy multi book series and the character development. it's a great book with a unique assortment of relationships and creatures that I've not seen before
5	1390867200	Loved every page. From the first to the last this grips you and makes you beg for more. Alas, you have to read the rest of the trilogy. What agony &#128512;
5	1390867200	I started reading the book and left it when I'd read about 20/100 of it. A couple of months after, I came upon the reviews and saw that the amount of good reviews had slowly trickled up, caught by curiosity I decided to give it a second chance... I've enjoyed it immensely and am looking forward for the next book.
5	1390867200	Loved the story...one of the best stories that I have read in a long time....please keep it up....couldn't lay my reader down....
4	1390867200	I don't like fantasy but the writing is excellent and he tells a good story. I went in search of more of his books and found some science fiction books (2) and read the first book and have started the second. I hope more science fiction is in on the way.
3	1390608000	This was a pretty good book.  The characters seemed a bit naive and some of the book was redundant. It seemed like the author included things like elves just to keep up with science fiction and not because they fit in with the story line. It's a unique storyline though and I will probably continue reading the series.
5	1390521600	Yes, there were a lot of errors in this book, which normally bring me to a complete stop, but the story was interesting enough that I was able to skip over a lot of the mistakes ( which usually doesn't happen at all).  I was pulled through the story, only to find that it was the first of three. I liked it well enough to buy the other books in the series,and can't wait to see where the story leads.
5	1390521600	Even with the few grammar and spelling errors, this story was well developed and the characters were believable. I highly recommend this book!
5	1390521600	It brings you right in to their world. I found myself not wanting to put it down. I really enjoyed the characters throughout the book.
5	1390435200	The change from normal to supernatural in this story was very exciting. A hint of magic at the beginning when the sword left it's Mark keeps the reader interested in seeking the purpose. Descriptions were well to the point and not over exaggerated which can cause boredom. The story flowed smoothly with an abrupt change to a world of supernatural but continues to flow smoothly. It will be in the rankings of Terry Brooks, Margaret Weiss and Jim Butcher in my quest for excellent reading material
5	1390435200	I got this free on my Kindle and loved it. It gets a little slow at some points, but I bought the next two books in the trilogy right after finishing this because the story is great. Definitely worth the read.
5	1390348800	The book was easy to follow and it was well written without a lot of contradictions. I am looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.
4	1390348800	If you're a fan of RA Salvatore like me then I'd recommend this book to you! Joseph Lallo  really is a fantastic writer and I can't wait for more of his books to come out!
5	1390176000	fascinating book to start out with when you get to page 26 the summary title will make all the sense in the world. great authors are far and few between this one is one of the elite signed GDF
5	1390089600	Truly inspiring and amazing. This book is one of my favorites throughout the plentiful amount I've read. A book of mystery and fantasy that would make a person read even more and more.
5	1390003200	The author needs a good editor to fix multiple grammatical errors and such, but he does spin a good tale. I enjoyed the whole series and am hoping he writes more soon.
4	1389830400	I really enjoyed this story More than that I found myself becoming involved in the story, looking forward to what was next. I'm looking forward to reading the rest on the trilogy as soon as time will permit
5	1389830400	very interesting and enjoyable. Will definitely read the trilogy now.. the story has a good flow and good characters that offset each other well.
3	1389744000	The author had great ideas. But it was more than obvious to me that it was a writer at the beginning if his career. 70 percent of the time I was shaking my head, while 30 percent of the time I was thoroughly enjoying it. While I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the books in the series, I don't think I would finish book two unless there are noticeable improvements in the writing.
1	1389657600	I am not sure why people rate this so highly. Its not especially well written and the main character seems to be way to perfect except for her level of maturity. Her naivete grows as the novel goes on. There multiple times where I was ready to just put the book down, and the only reason I finished was because I can't stand to leave a book unfinished. That being said I will definitely not be buying the remainder of this series.
5	1389657600	This book had me hooked from the moment I started reading it. I had no idea how awesome and on edge it would keep me. Love the characters and their personalities! Can't wait to start reading the next one.
5	1389398400	I downloaded this freebie after the creator of the  Children of Man series made a business move to get a publisher and, in the process, delayed the release of the third books by YEARS. Not willing to wait that long, I started to search for similar books to fill the time, I gave a few a try, but about gave up until I found this one. I was never a huge fan of fantasy novels, but for some reason always enjoyed games like World of Warcraft and the Fable games. About halfway through this book, I decided that this was definitely I felt the series to replace that which I was unwilling to wait for. This book tells the complex tale of a girl named Myranda, who in the start of the book is nothing more than migrant girl, until a fateful meeting with a special sword and a fallen solider in a field. The whole series focuses around the centuries old war raving her world and the secrets she learns along the way to unlock magic she never knew she could master. A great read if you liked the Children of Man series or anything to do with medieval fantasy.
5	1389139200	If you liked Red Shadow you should love this. Great storyline with so many characters!  Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
4	1389139200	Well written with a compelling story line.  Looking forward to the next volume.Great for teenagers and adults alike.One of the better fantasy fiction series that I have read.
5	1389139200	It is remarkably refreshing read. While at first glance the world seems relatively generic dungeons&dragons; style setting small twists and unique touches render it sufficient character to stand out from the mass of fantasy &#34;soap operas&#34;. The characters are well detailed, properly motivated and sufficiently strong through the books with their individual vulnerabilities. The story-line is well paced and occasional twists keep it going through all three volumes. Most of the story-line twists are pleasantly unexpected and do not feel artificial for just dragging the story onward but  instead are reasonably plausible allowing one to follow the heroes of the story in well immersed manner.I very much liked the trilogy. Pleasant surprise was that all three volumes are equally entertaining as often after the strong first volume the following ones tend to be left weaker, but on in this case.
4	1389139200	I liked itwrite more quickly so I can read until my eyes but n and my hands o numb from holding it
5	1389052800	What an amazing story!  Love the characters and their interaction with one another.  Can't wait to read the rest of the books.
5	1389052800	$0!!This might be a free book, but this offers a very rich story.Definitely worth a read and worth your time.
5	1389052800	This was an amazing book.  Joseph Lallo did an exceptional job of story telling here.  Myranda was brought to life in the details of every word in this book.  If you are considering reading this book, do.  You will most assuredly be drawn into it as I was.  By the way, Deacon is a breath of fresh air.
5	1388966400	A very interesting read.  I loved the characters and totally taken in by the storyline.  I read all three books now and not disappointed with any of them.
5	1388793600	It has twists and turns and mystery and dragons. I am going to recommended this to all my friends. Awesome!!!!!
5	1388620800	The book was written beautifully and artfully. I truly enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the next two books.
5	1388620800	I so thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I've just finished reading it for the second time and am ready to start the next book.
5	1388361600	i even endded up buying the other ones. so that should speak volumes about the quailty. and heres four more words
5	1388361600	I choose this rating because this book is everything a child like me would like to read it is well detailed and it is interesting so you can never be bored.
4	1388102400	A fun story. Maybe slightly childish for an adult to read. Sadly this book becomes a little repetitive over time.
3	1388102400	I picked this up on a free weekend and enjoyed most of the story, although I felt that the author could have made the story line much tighter.  While we experience the majority of the book from the main character's (Myranda) point of view, it is the Malthrope and the elven General Trigorah who seem to have the more interesting backstories as well as the greater conflicts.  In a way, the book feels like a Disney fairy tale: 'poor girl is starving, poor girl discovers something magical that changes her life and along the way she is helped by other magical creatures to find a new life. She even has a pet dragon for a sidekick! The middle  part of the book that dealt with her magical training by the 4 whimsical masters was a bit long and repetitive.  There was no doubt (which Deacon says on several occasions!) that Myranda will pass each test with flying colors. I never feel nervous or concerned about the outcome, or feel that Myranda will not manage to get out of whatever situation she finds herself trapped in.I also had some issues with the bitter cold of the region she lives in. She manages to survive in little more than a tattered cloak without ever suffering frostbite, and there does not appear to be a food shortage despite the lack of viable farmland or the lack of healthy people to farm it due to an endless war. I also felt that if Myranda was as gravely injured as the author says after her rescue by the resistance fighters, she would never have made the 5 day trek to the healer or worked for a week before he ever helped her with her wound. I did read the book from cover to cover, but the telling thing to me was that, when I finished book 1, I didn't feel I would go crazy if I didn't download the 2nd book in the series on the same day.
5	1388016000	I actually came into this series after reading his Bypass Gemini books first. I enjoyed those so much I was excited about trying his fantasy series since he claims he is more comfortable with fantasy.I wasn't disappointed. Lallo can craft a great story but even better than that are his characters. The way he writes some of his side characters is what makes his books so good. I look forward to getting into the next one.
5	1388016000	It's free. There is nothing to lose You won't be disappointed.  I have to buy the second book now!  Hope it is as good as this one.
4	1388016000	This book was free, so I cannot give it less than 3 stars, and I really enjoyed half of it, so I've given it 4 stars.  1st half had lots of action.I got hooked on the story and the characters Myranda and Leo quickly.  I had trouble putting this book down for the first half of it.But once Myranda goes through the waterfall ... It gets soooo boring.  The same stuff over and over... I wanted to stop reading a few times, but was curious to see how it ended - which wasn't anything special.Hoping the 2nd book would pick up on the action again I went to purchase it, but decided first to read the reviews.  Many of the reviews said the 1st book was the best one.  Therefore... I decided to not follow Myranda and Leo any longer......but I do wish them all the best.
4	1387929600	I would not describe myself as a true fan of the Fantasy/Adventure genre; however, I did read quite a few in my youth.  Wanting a return to the imaginative stories of my childhood, I gave Mr. Lallo a try.  He did not disappoint.  I give the effort 4 stars.  The character's he has created are all very well crafted, while the world they inhabit is equally beautiful and dangerous.  As the first book in the series, it has certainly done its job in making me want more.  There are some things keeping it from a 5 star read but, the potential is there.  The decision making of the heroine in the opening chapters seems a bit suspect and the training sessions toward the last quarter are a little too repetitive......work, sleep.....work, sleep.....work, sleep.  Other than that, I would recommend it and am looking forward to the next one.  On a side note, the book did have several spelling mistakes and other errors which were a slight distraction.
2	1387756800	This book started out promising, but I didn't like where it headed.  More than half the book was spent on repetitive tests for the main character that did nothing to further the plot.
5	1387411200	This book kept my attention from beginning to end. I will find the next in the series and begin it right now!
5	1387411200	Considering how cheap this book was ($2.99), I wasn't expecting much. What an amazing surprise to find that I actually really enjoyed it. Got to go as I've got the second installment waiting.
4	1387411200	I'm enjoying this book.  It's an easy read but well written.  The story line is light so far so it's good for reading at the end of a day.
5	1387238400	This book had me glued to my seat. A great original fantasy idea. The characters where wonderfully developed and I couldn't wait to read the next book.The story got progressively better and I found myself lost in this epic world of frozen fantasy.I got through this series in probably a week and when I found Red Shadow had come out jumped at the chance to purchase it. Joseph quickly has jumped to one of my favorite authors.
4	1387152000	While the book had a bit of a rambling start, once it got rolling it was a whirlwind of a tale that introduced all of a rather large cast and set the tone for the rest of his particular part of the saga.While there is a central arc to this book, it feels less compelling than the overall arc of the series, which is one failin it has. It feels almost as if it had started off as a larger work that was cut into multiple pieces, which it may well have been. It would have gotten a full five stars if it had a concise plot beyond stage setting and a mild revelatory scene near the end.Myranda is a wonderful character, who is at once stubbornly determined and completely nave, taking so much at face value but never collapsing into recriminations when her misconceptions are exposed. She has that moment of awe or shame, but shoulders on.I Wil admit I thought deacon to be older than her was. He seemed just a bit young to me to hold the position he does.I'll be getting the first set in hard copy, just for the pleasant experience of reading the complete saga.
4	1387152000	Very good, entertaining read !I was never bored. Nor did I find myself scanning useless filler to get to the meat !Keeps a very good pace and always left me wanting to get back for more.Now for #2 !!Well done, Joseph Lallo !
5	1386720000	I have never read a book like this one. It is very interesting. I didn't want to put the book down. I was captured by how good the book was. I would have never expected Leo/Lain to be the Red Shadow. He seemed so nice when he was first introduced. I couldn't picture him as a killer.
3	1386547200	Fantasy is one of the few categories that require a background to understand. For someone like me, it makes no sense and is usually impossible to follow. In this case, the characters were built from the ground up. I could understand this fantasy world, the motives, and most importantly the characters. Normally, I'd drop a book talking about pet dragons and elves but not this time because they made sense. Little slow on action, but that's either why I could follow it or I'm just shallow.
4	1386547200	This is a great read.I highly recommend this book. I can't wait to read the next one.Like I said awesome.
4	1386288000	I really enjoyed this book. I purchased the other books in this series and am waiting for the next one to come out
4	1386115200	Overall an excellent read that is fast paced and can easily be done in one sitting.The book does suffer a few continuity errors, but they are not overly distracting and are easily brushed off. Where and how the book begins and the author uses the characters to describe the world, vastly changes in the end. How it happens is written in the book, but it does leave the reader wondering and questioning congruency.Despite the complaints above, I really enjoyed this book. Mostly because the author refuses the book to be locked into any one drone, which keeps the book from getting boring. I found it easy to connect with the main characters, although they may not be as deep as the author could have taken them.I found no major editing errors in the book and would highly recommend this read to any fan of fantasy and magic. The lack of a slobbering love affair between two coming of age youths bridges this light read from teen novel to anyone who simply enjoys an escape to a fantasy world.My only reservation comes in the fact I believe this book was originally written to be a trilogy and the second book has mixed reviews.
5	1385942400	Joseph Lallo has written an excellent story that makes you want more. I'm looking forward to reading the next book and seeing how the story develops. The characters are developing well and I can't wait to see what happens to Merynda and Myn as they search for Lain. I recommend this book to fantasy lovers of all ages and I intend to read all the books that Joseph Lallo has written as I like his style of writing.
5	1385942400	It's sort of a computer game for me, watching how she passes each level, one after one... For people with imagination, who love fantasy... great  book!
4	1385942400	Nice short story read. Enjoyed it.Wish the book was a bit longer.Having it on my kindle is wonderful.
5	1385856000	Of late, I have been disappointed in the e-books I've read.  Short, seemingly endless series with characters never fully developed and very little plot to them. WOW, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!I downloaded this book quite a long time ago and never read it for one reason or another.  Wish I had.  What a great book this turned out to be. The characters are wonderful, the story engaging and descriptions that make you feel as if you are right in the pages.  Finally, a REAL NOVEL!  BRAVO!  I recommend this to all fantasy readers.  I plan on reading the next book immediately!
5	1385769600	I enjoyed this book. It was one I had problems putting down. I truly hate endings without closure, but I still rather enjoyed the ending to this book. It was a rather slow read for a while, but picked up about half way through. There wasn't any marked chapters which was a bit taxing, and a few details left out I thought could have aided. The purpose of the title was never really fully revealed either. Overall an excellent book. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
4	1385683200	It started off a bit slow..but I'm glad I continued on, I really enjoyed it, and have become very attached to the characters. Can't wait to see what the next book has in store!
2	1385424000	He's got a long way to go but has potential.  The characters feel bland and they really don't interact with each other very well.  I feel like there's about 30% missing for a great read.  I am sick of all the additional descriptors and adjectives that he uses.  Sheesh, its like he's writing with a thesaurus!
2	1385337600	Kind of like a movie that's a little painful to sit through but you figure what the hell, I've already paid for it and I've got nothing else to do.  Characters were a little annoying and hard to attach to.  Everything was predictable with very little creativity or world building.  Typos were an issue for me.
4	1385337600	In my mind, the ability to create a plausible world in which the characters interact is essential to a good story. This is a good example. Also, I love magic....
5	1384992000	She has left Deacon behind without a good reason. Strange as it seems our heroin seems never to learn so long.
4	1384646400	it is a good story that will keep you wanting to read more. i stayed reading until after 2 am.
4	1384560000	I downloaded this book because the cover reminded me of Garth Nix's Abhorsen books. This book was nothing like that, but in a good way. The depth of Myranda's character made me feel almost like I was being carried around in her head. The conflict and turmoil she experiences with finding the swordsman, meeting the resistance, her 'adopting' of the baby dragon, traveling to The Belly of The Beast, her magical training - all masterfully written. I especially liked her testing with the Elder, it reminded me of some twisted Alice in Wonderland.... The ending was a bit abrupt, but not Soprano-ish... Great Read!!
4	1384560000	At first the reading was slow.  Meaning, it took a while to get to the meat of the story. Once it got interesting I was hooked.  I couldn't  put  it down . I look forward to reading book 2.
4	1384473600	I chose this book simply because it was free. I enjoyed it so much that I will be reading the rest of the tale.I would recommend The Book of Deacon to all who enjoy sy-fi fantasy.
4	1384214400	This book was able to keep me interested in the story and wonder what was going to happen next during the times I was unable to read. I am very interested in reading more of the series. The unlikely heroine and her mix of companions make for an interesting story line. As for the action, while some twists were as expected, others were a mystery.
4	1384128000	I. would recommend this book to anyone who likes magic and fantasy. it was very exciting and l hated to see it end. I look forward to the next one.
4	1383782400	Excellent book I like hoe the author develops the charaters, the only thing is that in spots the story is predictable and that is why I gave it a four instead of a five.  At first I was skeptical about the story line, but after the first chapter it the author had me hook, line and sinker.  It boils down to the fact that I just enjoy the way the author delvelops the story, and lets me forget about my world for a short time.Thank you Joseph!
4	1383350400	I wasn't sure what I thought of this book when I first started but by the time I was at the 5th page, I was interested. It was a little slow in some parts but overall I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the second one :).
5	1383177600	This was a free book that was recommended by a book club I follow on FaceBook. Im not sure it is free anymore.
4	1383004800	This story has all the familiar elements; interesting characters the arts of war and magic, dark purpose and lighted hope, and like the frosting on the cake, a narrative voice that bears you through the story with intensity purpose and skill.  Like many tales it ends just when you wish most it would not and yet another follows.
5	1382918400	This book grips the reader and holds her in thrall to the end. There were little grammar and punctuation errors that should be fixed but nothing too terribly distracting. I can't wait to finish reading the trilogy.
4	1382918400	I very much enjoyed the plot of the story and the characters.  Im anxious to read the next two books!  Thank you.
5	1382832000	This book is by far an amazing book. After reading this one I immediately went and bought all 5 books in the series. Love them!!! 5*'s from me!!!
5	1382486400	I very much enjoyed this book. It reminds me of the 'Naming' a book I love and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
4	1382400000	I quite enjoyed this story. The characters were well developed without being stereotypical fantasy novel characters. There are a few grammatical errors, but not enough to be distracting, or even notice if you aren't looking for them. Great for older children and adults alike. You can almost see the people and the action of the story. Well done.
4	1382400000	This was a story brillently told with emotion, imagnation and mystery. I crave those kinds of stories. The only reason I gave it a four star is because of kids ten and under. The story is dark and bloody sometimes in parts. It is not for people craving a prodictable or even happy ending. But for people who love mystery and magic behind every paragraph this is deffenitly for you.
4	1382313600	Pick it up and it is hard to put down, you will want the next one, go ahead and get it now. :)
4	1382140800	I really enjoyed reading this book. The only issues I had with it were the grammatical errors that many others have pointed out and some awkward dialog that seemed forced. The story of this book is great and it's easy to fall for the characters. It is definitely worth the read!
5	1382140800	This book is a fantasy lovers delight, it has everything we love elves, fairies, good vs evil and even dragons.  Seriously it is a well written book with an entirely different twist and realm to explore.
3	1382054400	Besides the slow start and finding it hard to get into the story.  I finally did and enjoyed the constant changes to Myrandas life.  Loved her interactions with Myn.
4	1382054400	I look forward to following these richly developed characters. Can't  wait  to read the next installment in their journey. Will they?
4	1381881600	Characters well developed, exciting, sexy compelling, engaging I recommend anyone who wants a female hero to give it a try
4	1381536000	I read a lot of fantasy, and was very entertained by this novel. It has some of the classic elements of war, swordplay, and magic, as well as the popular theme of a talented young Mage learning the ways of magic, but Lallo creates interesting and memorable characters and a world with depth and complexity. I enjoyed the twists on the inner workings of magic, and the legend of the Chosen. I look forward to reading more from this author.
5	1381536000	Excellent story with lively characters and great description. Lots o keep one waiting for the next part in the series.
1	1381449600	Every book with a cliffhanger ending should come with a warning emblazoned on the cover. Nothing infuriates me more than spending hours of my precious time reading through a book, only to find I've been cheated of a satisfying conclusion to the story. Especially when I have not enjoyed the journey, but only read on because I'd already invested so much time that I wanted to know how it turned out.The book is so rife with horrid grammar that I was totally distracted all through the first chapters. Because tense changes occur inexplicably, I could hardly surmise whether an event was happening in present, had happened in the past, or would happen some time in the future. Strangely, the grammar improved as the story moved on.The story starts on an exciting note and carries on for a while, but then comes a long, flat section that I could hardly drag myself through.  The main character is just too, too perfect for my taste, and she seemed to regress in maturity as time went on.  First I pegged the novel as Young Adult, then Middle Grade.I really wanted to like this book.  I think the author could have woven a wonderful tale from the interesting elements he put forth. Unfortunately, it seems that he just didn't take the time to clean it up. The Book of Deacon reads like a first draft. . . and then you come to a non-end.
5	1381363200	The entire time I read this book, I felt as though I had left this world and entered another one! Enjoyed the fantasy while it lasted and can't wait to return . Thanks Joseph Lallo for allowing me to be apart of your world for awhile, and for my new addiction. (Lol)
5	1381276800	I loved it, I was almost done when I remembered reading the first few pages. I can not wait to read the next one.
5	1381190400	I really loved this book I'm in the second one now and it's just beautiful! &#60;3 I love fantasy and this was just wonderful. Typically I'm into more romance than what this one has, but considering that it didn't have very much of it in there it's still delightful. It was hard for me to put down my kindle reading this book lol a good page turner. :)
5	1381104000	I generally do not like trilogies or any other book that leaves you with questions, but no answers at the end.  This book left a number of questions.......but  (darn it!) I am really hooked and need to know what happens next.  The author kept the book moving and interesting, even when there was little or no &#34;action&#34;.  I have already ordered the next two in the series and look forward to reading more.
4	1380844800	The characters make you want to learn more about all the people & secret village where such wealth of magical knowledge exist.  The only negative with the whole book is that it was slow at the beginning & a little hard to get into. I was told of the excellence & thank heavens I continued on! The excitement just kept growing through to the very end. I can't wait to read The Battle of Verril & The Rise of the Red Shadow! I can't get them fast enough!
5	1380672000	This was the best book ever can't wait to read the next one I hop Deacon is in the next one .
4	1380672000	Pretty Good book :) hits the fantasy theme well and keeps the action flowing! Really enjoyed reading it and am on to the third.
5	1380326400	The characters are become more complete as the story continues. I became a watcher rather than a reader and couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  As for next, I'm off to book two to see what happens next.
5	1379980800	This book was free in the bookstore and I downloaded it on a whim of needing something to read and have been astounded by the authors ability to hold my attention so well
4	1379980800	This book is engaging and entertaining.  It was a unique blend of several aspects of the fantasy genre and, although it started out slow, it had my attention before long.  The book only managed 4 stars for two reasons.  The first is that it is loaded with typos and grammatical errors.  I know a good book should be based on story, not appearance, but I expect a knowledge of the craft from those doing the crafting.  That alone would not have cost it a star, but there was also the unnecessary descriptive detail.  Unnecessary content was added in the story in the form of excessive description of items, environments, etc. that held no importance to the story at all.  Still, it wasn't enough to lose a star.  The final blow that shook the 5th star from this rating was the ending.  I refuse to spoil the ending for anyone, and I remind that it is the first book in a trilogy, but I will say that it came at the worst possible time for an ending.  It could have happened a chapter earlier or even later and I feel it would have given enough closure to feel contented with the book as a single story, not just a third of one.  I recommend this book for age 12+ fans of any aspect of the fantasy genre.
4	1379808000	While I felt the story started out a bit slowly it built up nicely to a very tense ending. The story and characters are well developed with a feeling of being quite real. The story revolves around a young woman and an unusual partner. What happens to the characters feels very real and worth reading. A very nice start of a complex series!
5	1379548800	A fun read and has some interesting twists. Will definitely read the next one. Enjoyed the pace and suspense, a quick read.
5	1379462400	This book i a must have. Wonderful charactors. Amazing story line.  Great for adults or coming of age. You'll love it.
5	1379462400	I thought the first book was great. I certainly plan to continue the series. I must know what happens. I have even recommended the trilogy to a friend. Great book.
3	1379203200	I tend to have high standards when it comes to quality of writing. This book had interesting ideas, but the writing was often stilted and the characters didn't grab me. However, for the amount I paid for it, it was worth it.that's the great thing about these indie authors - they get published and get to share a decent story for a price that makes it a good value. And this was a fun read but it's not a book I would ever re-read and if I'd had to pay $8 for it I would have been irritated.
5	1379116800	1 star for originality1 star for enthralling story/plot1 star for frustratingly lovable characters1 star for addictive quality1 star for convincing me to buy the second bookI'm very impressed. Only down side about book; the last hundred pages or so there are quite a few typos. Can't knock the author though, he did an amazing job.
2	1379116800	I just could not get into the story enough to finish reading the book. Just not my kind of book I guess.
5	1379116800	Fast paced and very interesting. The Book of Deacon takes you on a ride well worth taking. Surprising twists and just enough action to keep you going.  Can't wait for the next installment.
5	1379116800	I found this book full of detail and excitement.  I had a hard time picking between sleep or reading.  Just get the book you will not regret it.
5	1379030400	I loved the story line and the characters and it kept my interest enough to actually get me to buy the rest of the series.Once again however I think I think the fox hybrid  outcast would have been better if just written as a human outcast/hero instead of part animal.
4	1379030400	Honestly, the story was slow starting, but picked steam nicely.  I am fairly certain that this was a free book, but it prompted enough interest for me to purchase the second.
5	1378944000	The concept and character development is a breath of fresh air compared for what I normally read. I look forward to reading what happens next as well as whatever other stories has up his sleeve.
5	1378771200	Really enjoyed this readGood character developmentClever storylineUnique plotCan't wait to read book 2 and book 3
2	1378512000	I've read several books, didnt finish some because i simply didnt like the story or the story telling (from known and respected authors) but this one is the first book i didnt finnish because i didnt like the writting.So about the writting:Reading a book is supposed to be a pleasant experience but reading this was not one, it was dull.The prose is plain and seems flat and hurried.The passage from one scene to the next is not smooth but sudden and made me wonder if there was a paragraph missing in between (it wasn't). It was like seeing a movie and pressing the fast forward button, frequently, for a short time.I didnt like the way the author tells the small parts of his story.-----SPOILER-----------For example a girl in the middle of nowhere just before the sunset, freezing and starving, saw a reflection somewhere far away. As she approached, in the night, she saw a pile of stones, and several other things (in a sequential kind of way, the one after the other). She managed to start a fire and cook some meal, then slept in a tent and when she woke up in the morning she realized that the pile of rocks is a dead dragon. I never lived in a fantasy world but i suppose a dragon just a few feets away from someone would have been the very first thing to attract the attention.-----END OF SPOILER----I also didn't like the dialogue and the monologues of the main character, it felt fake or fixed in a hurry.I give 2.5 stars because i didnt like the writting at all but i can not tell about the story because i didnt finnish it.
5	1378252800	This book was full of excitement and adventure. The main character is interesting and strong in a human way. You want her to succeed. I can't wait to read the next book.
5	1378080000	This is a very creative and imaginative story. I really enjoyed the characters and enjoyed getting to know them. This is as good a fantasy story as I've read.
4	1377820800	I enjoyed this read. Characters were really nicely developed. Lots of shades of gray waiting to be explained. Classic chase/quest adventure with enough twists to keep you wanting to discover what happens next. And who can't love a book with an anti-hero badass??? Definitely recommend.
4	1377820800	This is number two of a triology, very entertaining and draws you in. I can hardly wait for the next book.
4	1377648000	A little slow getting into it but definitely will draw you if you stay with it,.I look forward to reading the next in the series.
4	1377561600	What an enchanting story! I am now most definitely interested in the whole trilogy including the side stories. Can't wait to get to reading more:)
5	1377561600	I have been looking for a new fantasy series since I found Garth Nix's abhorsen trilogy. This magic is so far beyond that which is presented in Nix's trilogy! A bit slow to start, but this book is absolutely worth sticking it out for. I simple couldn't put it down! I've now purchased the next in this trilogy, and I hope it's every bit as fantastic as this one was. Age is of no concern in this book, essentially the main character &#34;could&#34; be any age from 13-30, so anyone could relate to her. None of the sexualities so many fantasy books incorporate, without seeming too young for me as an adult. All fantasy lovers should read this book! Just get past the few spelling errors!
4	1377475200	I got the kindle version free and enjoyed it so much that I bought the other two books in the series. Very well-written and enjoyable book!
5	1377475200	I couldn't put it down. It remained me of other stories I have come to love,and followed along the same well know rules of magic . However, the chosen protagonist, a strong, independent woman was easy to identify with.
4	1377216000	Over all a good book. The beginning was interesting. Toward the middle and end though, I got a little bored. Really neededMORE EMOTION and connection to the main characters. Still, worth reading.
5	1377216000	love this book, i have now read everything in this series Lallo kept me guessing ... am going to read everything this guy writes ...
5	1377129600	Joseph Lallo is a talented writer and his work deserves your attention. This first book is wonderfully quirky and surprising. The main character, a young woman named Miranda has a truly delightful journey. Worth every penny and every second reading it.
5	1377129600	To go through life alone and seek something you are not sure of finding, makes you want to read more. Enjoy this first  book of three. See you for next  one .
5	1377043200	This is trilogy is an amazing tale. Great Author! I will be reading more of his writing because if if this a sample then there is no doubt he should be listed among the great fantasy writers.
5	1376956800	I really enjoyed this book and am onto the second.  I do find the main character to be a little tiresome at times, maybe a bit too gullible and/or optimistic.  However, I did still really enjoy the book and plan on reading the series.  Worth a read!
5	1376956800	I downloaded &#34;The Book of Deacon&#34; to my android via kindle app because it was free. I liked the book so much I ended up buying the whole series. I could not put them down until I finished!
5	1376870400	I got this book for free.now I'm hooked!!!Downloading the next two books now. My teen loves the book too
5	1376784000	What a great read. I couldn't put it down towards the end. Eager I am to procure the next installment.
5	1376784000	I found this looking through the kindle store for something to read while I waited for the latest installment from my favorite authors. I didn't really expect much from a freebie to be honest. I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised! I was so wrapped up in this book that I couldn't put it down. The characters are well-developed and it was refreshing to have heroes who were not perfect. I would definately recommend this book to any lover of the fantasy genre! I have already read the next one and I am writing this review as I download the third.
1	1376524800	The author still has some way to go. Style, plot and characterization are not quite up to standard. Try again.
5	1376438400	Once I started I did not want to put it down!  No plot holes. I would recommend it to anyone.
4	1376265600	The first few chapters of this book and I still wasn't sure if I wanted to buy book two of this series or not, but I did anyway, and now I'm glad that I did. It may take awhile to catch your interest,but buy the your finished you'll be glad you bought it.
5	1376179200	Anther top notch book with a good plot and story that grabs hold of you and is hard to put down. If yo like SciFi and Fantasy books then you will love this one.
4	1376092800	The book is a bewitching tale of heros and magic. It is a unique look upon a well worn story plot as a common girl comes into mystical powers and joins a ragtag team of heros to end a one hundred and fifty year war. It is a great and addicting adventure.
5	1375574400	I couldn't put the book down. It has a wonderful and imaginative story, though the writing is a bit rough at times. I, however, loved it nonetheless.
5	1375315200	this book was awesome! it was about a person having an adventure with an assasin while enduring tests of magic from 4 differant teachers with differant personallitys. just wished the next book was free
5	1375228800	Im very picky with my selections of series to start. This is definetly worth starting. first book is free and the others are worth paying for.
5	1375142400	This is an exceptionally well written novel. It is quite long but an easy read as the writer has a way of being descriptive enough to have you visualizing all the details without going overboard into drawn out unnecessary details. Keep in mind, this is a trilogy and does not have an ending. I will definitely be getting the other two which are a bargain price for the length of this story.
5	1375142400	Excellent! I was so wrapped up in the story that I read it cover to cover in a mere 16 hours.
1	1375142400	I hate grammar Nazis, so I'm reluctant to leave this review but this book was just too difficult to read for me. It desperately needs an editor. I feel like it could have been interesting if the excessive redundant language and overwhelming passive voice was corrected. The author constantly plunges the reader inside the very apparent and unnecessary thoughts of the heroine like it's been written for a young child. Not to mention the contradictions. if you've just spent a paragraph telling us about how valuable the sword is and how she knows it will bring her a fortune in the future don't start the next paragraph with a contradiction telling us about how she wasn't thinking about the value of the sword.I feel for the author because I'm a writer as well, but this book should have been run by the editor at least one more time before it was published. I'm sure there is an interesting story in this book, unless the 300+ 5 star reviews are bunk, but until the book goes to a readable second edition I'll never know what it is. Sorry, I tried.
5	1375056000	I downloaded this book yesterday and spent the entire night reading. Wow, the pictures are still in my head! Now for the next in this wonderful trilogy. Fantasy without a book full of places and names which are hard to pronounce and even harder to remember. Thanks for the great read Mr. Lallo.
4	1374969600	Thrilling look forward to reading the next book. Hope the second book can be as extraordinary as the first book .
1	1374969600	I do not recommend this book.This was a book that I could not finish. It has quite a good rating on Goodreads and it seemed right up my alley. I found this book frustrating to read, to be honest. The overall story felt stale, like I'd read it a thousand times; normally this wouldn't bother me in fantasy because there are other things to make up for it, like good characters. I found the main character to be quite dull and really couldn't feel myself caring much what happened to her. Find a mysterious sword of power, yay I guess. One of the more interesting characters leaves quite soon after you meet him and that is kind of when my desire to keep reading dropped to zero. I know that the character will reappear eventually, I just didn't care. I think one thing that really stood out to me about this book was the dialogue, it is so very poorly written. Everyone sounds like they have the same voice and they all sound very stiff and wooden. It is almost like watching a play of bad actors where they all have stage fright and can only deadpan their lines. It just felt wrong. I really wanted to like this book and am sorry that I didn't. Keep in mind my opinion is mine and other people's opinions rate this quite high, so it might be a book you'd be interested but this was just my experience with it.
2	1374796800	I have been reading fantasy themed books, for children, young adults and adults for years. I adore fantasy books, but I was disappointed with this book for a couple of reasons.1. The cliched plot. It's all been written and seen before in Sci-Fi/Fantasy, in some form or another - starting with Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea and even in the 2009 Star Trek reboot. A person of humble origins and uncanny talent, overcomes the odds to defeat evil. Honestly, I feel like there are so many books on the market like this, I think the author sells himself short by following this plot.2. The characterisation. Myranda seemed far too naive to have survived living as a vagabond. I mean, she didn't even have her own knife at the beginning of the book - how was she meant to hunt? Protect herself? Towns that have been pulled apart by war are not soft and fuzzy around the edges. Even though previously she is close to starving, she does not wake the innkeepers' son for food so she can eat on the road before she leaves the inn. Near starvation is not something you just brush off. Myranda also invites a strange man, whose face she hasn't even seen, into her room (!). I understand that this book was written for teens, but it just rings so false that Myranda is an innocent as a newborn lamb.3. The writing could seriously use an editor. Some of the sentences could be made cleaner and easier to understand.I couldn't finish this book. I was really hoping the story would turn around. Right around the time Myranda got kidnapped I decided to call it quits because I wasn't enjoying it.
5	1374796800	Possibly one of the best books I have ever read and certainly going to be anxious to read the rest of the series
3	1374796800	This book is great if you need a quick distraction. It deals with issues almost anyone could identify with just in a magical setting. While at time the writing is a little thin - to plain, more essay than novel - the author more than makes up for it in other places. I enjoyed getting to know the young protagonist and look forward to reading the next book.
5	1374624000	I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre, but I could not stop reading this book. The storyline was so engaging, and the characters so personable, that like a child, I was disappointed when the last chapter came to an end. I can hardly wait to read the next books in the trilogy.
4	1374537600	I really liked the story line and its something close to what I have been searching for after reading The Naming by Alison Croggon ( part of the  Books of Pellinor). The one thing that distracted me a whole lot was the multitude of grammatical errors (present at least in the free Kindle version). It was enough to make me waste  some time trying to figure out who/what was being referred to. Other than that, it is perfect and I am looking forward to classifying this series with my favorites in the category (this includes the Naming- of course :) - the Poison Study, the Black Magician (by Trudi Caravan) ... and I can't remember the others off the top of my head but any suggestions to further this list would be greatly appreciated :)
5	1374537600	very good book. I wished for more of them. Book of Deacon was one of my first fantasy book, and it helped me fall in love with the genreI am writing the review because I want to give it five stars.
4	1374537600	Overall I enjoyed this book, but I felt the story was vague sometimes and long getting into the situation. I feel I need to read the next book to make my decision to read further.I give the book four stars.
5	1374451200	I enjoyed the story,but found reading the book difficult because of all the (he said, she said) in so many sentences one after another.
5	1374364800	If you are a kindle/fantasy trilogy fan you must read this. It is consistently good and will not disappoint. The characters are original and interesting, and you care about them. Good Job!
4	1374278400	I really did.  I liked Myranda in the first book and just kept reading.  This is simply one that appeals to me, and I read a lot of fantasy.  I recommend it to my friends that share my enthusiasm for fantasy.
5	1373932800	I am now searching for book two of the series. The story came alive in mind's eye.  Time to start book two!
2	1373846400	I read this as one of the top 50 Fantasy trilogies of all time. Really? Not even in the top 1000. The leading character is not believable. Most plot twists are silly at best and at some point I wanted to beat her pet dragon. Elves, dragons, demons and magic that was made to fit any circumstance. Don't bother.
4	1373846400	it started off a little slow at first. but towards the middle i really started to like the book. great story line. loved the characters and their different personalities
4	1373760000	I read the first volume of the trilogy because it was free; then I bought the second two.  I've read them again and the concept and character development are, simply, first class.  However, and I don't know whether this reflects the failure to teach grammar, Lalloregularly makes the same mistakes as new Amazon writers of significantly smaller talent.  That is, he uses the nominative case when the objective is required.  She  told "he and I" - for example - instead of "him and me."  This error is easy to avoid if one limits the sentence to a single pronoun. "He told I" is self-evidently wrong.  Also, may is often improperly substituted for might - may is present tense; might subjunctive - and when one is explaining that it would or might be a good idea to do something, a subjunctive is called for.Why am I making a fuss about what many might consider small matters.  Well, the great writers, of every genre, aren't sloppy.  Lallo can join that group, but not if he disregards rules of diction that actually make sense.  See, for example, Wyndham, Mieville, LeGuin, George RR Martin, Dick and Disch. Lallo has the potential to join the band of masters.
4	1373673600	Book was very entertaining. Good light reading for adults, but could be appropriate for young teens also. Characters are sweet and charming.
4	1373587200	This is not a complete book.  It is just a sequential collection of adventures with no apparent objective.  It is said to be the start of a trilogy, but a trilogy is supposed to be three complete adventures that are similar and on a common theme.  This is not a complete adventure.  It just starts, continues through numerous incidents, and ends.  The author's comment at the end is that it continues to the next book, but since I had read this entire "book" and didn't know where the theme was going, I decided not to continue with the adventure.With that opening criticism you probably wonder why I gave this a four star rating instead of a lower one.  I rated it high because it is well written, interesting, and held my attention.  I was just disappointed that it wasn't tied up into a neat package with an opening, objective, narrative, and ending.  The narrative, the telling of the tale, is interesting, and I enjoyed it.  But I kept asking "where is this going?"  I'm still asking, but I don't care enough to follow it further.  What is there is good, but it'll leave you hanging.Other reviewers have described the plot, so I won't go there.  It's fantasy, good fantasy.  They have also criticized the book because the heroine survived too many highly hazardous situations.  There was also criticism that some of the incidents were too unlikely or unbelievable.  I found the book OK here, because, after all, it is fantasy and you have to suspend our world's reality and defer to the reality in the world of the book.In summary, it's a good read, but just a chunk out of the middle of a story.
5	1373414400	It's rare for a free book to pull me in as much as this one has done. Off to buy the next...
5	1373241600	I gave this book 5 stars because I couldn't put it down. It held my attention and when I reached the end, I was determined to continue with the next book
5	1373155200	Ok....this was amazing. I had to give this 5 stars based on the MY constant comparisons of books from Brent Weeks, R.A. Salvatore, and Terry Goodkind. Add in the fact of being free, I wish I could rate it higher. While starting out slow, it became an all out sprint about halfway. I am purchasing the rest as soon as I am finished with this review. If you enjoyed the Lightbringer books from Brent Weeks and Sword of Truth series from Terry Goodkind, this is a MUST read. There are not any risks and a plethora of bonuses of giving it a try. I hope and pray the other books can live up to where this one took my expectations.
4	1373155200	Time is short and attention is such a dear thing to hold. Were I the editor of this tome, I would have instructed the author to start not at the beginning but rather the middle. Having the main character recollect the events told for the first 50 or so pages as they are rather stark and bare. They are not without purpose but must truly bear your patience. The beginning bears all the devastation that the war has spread to every corner of this imagined world. They serve as counterpoint for the later world revealed. For within another roughly 100 pages after, the book begins to hold a pace which makes the reader forget the passage of time. A rich fantasy does indeed unfold. A world filled with characters of might and magic. Some posses natural gifts which assist them while they train and work to reach the heights others are ordained and chosen to reach. The main conflict in centered on the hope that our main character has to see an end to the war. That struggle is continued from the first to the last page.  This book is quite satisfying and well worth the endeavor. I look forward to a further foray into the world the author has created. Go ahead and download it it, for it is entirely worth your time. As long as it is free that is all it asks of you. You are repaid handsomely with a rich fantasy work, well developed characters, a timeline that doesn't cheat or really resort to cheap tricks or emotional blackmail. Most characters we meet are well developed. Most are easy to care for as complex interesting and fully fleshed out characters. Others hold the promise of more to be revealed in the next installments. Near the end the main character seems to be leaving the full and lively training center of the book. The initial bare world was completely overcome by the time she enters the training ground. Here the book comes to life as does the pacing of the author. In midst of training, the author begins a consistent revelation of rich details. These details bring each character's development through enrichment of skill and purpose. Hopefully, the trend will continue, despite the desertion of the central training ground. If the pace and material quality that is developed there can be maintained it would make the next installment worth investing both time and money in.Start diatribe: The rest of the critique is my own personal issues with the one aspect of main character development the author made. It is a personal bias and has no real bearing on your enjoyment of the novel. The main character is orphaned by war. As an actual real life orphan, I find this to be a tired and ridiculously over-used trope. It is used to draw easy quick sympathy from the reader for the protagonist. Time would be better invested developing a character's character. Additionally, it would be a better use and evidence of a writers skill. Yet, it is so often used. It almost seems a forgone conclusion in all works of fiction. Having never met another orphan in my entire time on this planet with the exception of those whom I lived with in the actual orphanage I find their ubiquitous presence rather unbelievable. Honestly, if you have never noticed it before... pay attention. Almost every hero story contains an orphan. Most of them are drug addicts and losers in all actuality. They are not out conquering the world. Even Dickens and Disney resort to this tired and most lazy theme. I suppose one cannot be faulted despite my utter distaste for this type of emotional blackmail. I suppose I have to forgive this rather lazy author as well. If the best do it why not the rest? I just wish it were not so ever present. Makes me fell lazy. Like I am not living up to my potential as a poor orphan child. Who knew so much was to be expected of us? Apparently only every single fiction and fantasy writer that ever lived. End of diatribe.
3	1373155200	Without a doubt, this has been one of the most interesting fantasy books I've read in a while. I found both the characters and plot interesting. However, my one issue with this book is the formatting, or lack thereof. It would have been nice to have it divided into chapters. Instead, at times I felt like I was reading one really long manuscript. Other than that, I've no real complaints about this book, especially since it was free. I will definitely be buying the other books to see how the story continues. I just hope by the next book, the author will have discovered the usefulness of splitting sections of the book into chapters.
4	1373155200	This is a well written book, I didn't have to stumble through any grammatical or spelling errors (which really put me off a story quick) and it had an interesting plot as well. I do think it takes some abrupt turns and doesn't do as detailed an explanation of certain things as I'd like, but overall it was really good. I'm planning on continuing the series
5	1373068800	This a great book for those out there who love to read about how the hero became the hero. It starts out with a normal person who then goes on to become great as well as a master at sorcery. It is a great piece of fiction.
5	1372896000	The unity of mind, spirit, and nature  is the nexus of all magic. This story will cause you to gain an understanding of this innate ability we all share, the power to direct magic.
4	1372896000	i have learned not to expect much from free kindle boks, but this is a welcome exception.  please don't judge me regarding my poor grammar in this post - i am quite humiliated enough as i have a doctorate in dramaturgical literature, but cannot communicate on a kindle, apparently - and i'm 28!
5	1372809600	This was a very good mysterious book. It keeps you wanting more. The other books I can only hope are is great as this one.
5	1372723200	I think the thing that I liked the most was the magic. It isn't used for evil, and it has a great description on how to use each element. But please, no more kidnapping. I hate that kind of stuff in a book. And I also hope that there are more DRAGONS:)I really recommend this book to anyone who enjoys magic.
5	1372636800	No gratuitous sex or violence and the story came across unscathed! Imagine ...someone with enough literary skill to write a book without swearing, sex, overt violence...why, it's a miracle of intelligent use of words!Yes, I am sick of authors who have no more skill than to drag in the carnal, the sensual, the gore in order to keep the attention of their poor ignorant readers! Most...MOST of the time these pages do little or nothing to drive the story!Congratulations Mr. Lallo...my next purchase will be after finishing here. As a note, though...if your other books don't live up to this report...I will drop them like hot rocks.
4	1372636800	I enjoyed this book and found the characters and story line to be somwhat different and interesting which was good.  There is plenty of action and magic and sets things up nicely for the next book.
5	1372550400	I am excited to read the next book. Characters are multi-layered and writing is smooth. A few typos are distracting.
3	1372550400	The first book was interesting and entertaining. The second and third books were long and tedious accounts of war in a fantasy land. I recommend the first, but stop there.
4	1372464000	Very slow beginning, but it's to update you on the basics. I love fairy tale books that have a desire for peace, amongst a war.
5	1372377600	All three of these books were a really great surprise! I thought The Book of Deacon was going to be a quick read in between some of the other series I am reading, and BOOM I am reading the second and third books in row! The characters are really intriguing and I love the mystical creatures. Very well put together. This author has a great imagination and was definitely mind candy all the way through. I would recommend these books to any friend who enjoys fantasy as much as I do.
4	1371945600	Interesting book. It was graphic and very detailed regarding the difficulties she faced along the way of her life. Interesting.
5	1371859200	This book had a good story line and has kept me wanting to read more. The suspense at the end of the story makes me wanting to read the next one.
5	1371600000	This book of fantasy is sufficiently complex while the characters retain enough realism to be relatable to the casual reader.
5	1371340800	LIked the mixture of action with magic and the diffrent types of magic introduced.  I bought the next two books to finished the story.
5	1371254400	This book is a wonderful read. I cannot wait to read book 2. All of the characters are so fully developed and intriguing. Terrific plot, wonderful details and descriptions. Keep up the great work!!
5	1370995200	I loved this book. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. It is definitely a book for fantasy lovers.
4	1370736000	I love the story and the characters. Can't wait to start reading the next books in this great series. Bravo!
4	1370736000	I thought I had already written a review on this one.  I felt is was good enough for put the next book on my wish list.  It had destroyed kingdoms, a girl struggling to survive, magic and mystics and worth reading once and then if you want more go for it.KJK
5	1370736000	I found myself really getting into this book. I'm excited to read the remaining books in the trilogy. The ending was definitely a cliff hanger...I would be doing myself an injustice by not continuing!
4	1370736000	I enjoyed the main characters, their points of view and the authors description of the world. I got me hooked and made for a good read.
5	1370736000	A great book with an amazing tale to tell leaves you hanging wanting more can't wait for the next book
5	1370649600	Good story and plot twists and fast paced and can't wait to read second book of the series would recommend
5	1370476800	I thought this book had just the right amount of motion and rest to keep my interest throughout. In fact, I am going to buy the 2nd book as soon as I click submit on this review!
5	1370390400	Little did I know when I downloaded this eBook that I am going to be hooked on Joseph Lallo's style of writing. They say that there isn't a story out there which hasn't been told a thousand times before. And that may be true - but Joseph Lallo has a unique talent of stringing words together that makes his story sound more interesting. It may seem like an easy-read but that is where his unique talent lies. He doesn't go around beating the bush dead, instead, he eases along in a comfortable phase and yet the reader finds himself/herself getting more excited as the plot thickens. A real page turner and never a dull moment in it.
3	1370304000	This story demonstrated an imagination that was refreshing and enjoyable.  Frequently fantasy is just recycled ideas & story lines. U
4	1370304000	I liked the female protagonists very much, as well as her dog-like dragon. I also liked that the conflict was man-made and not the result of some evil wizard or dark lord. Though the basic plot was fairly common, there were enough surprises and unique elements to allow it to stand on its own.there certainly could have been a bit more visual description, but I can visualize with a minimum of detail, so it did not affect my enjoyment of the book.I appreciated the opportunity to get the first part of this trilogy for free so I could try a new author. I in tend to purchase the remaining books in the series.
5	1370217600	This is the sort of book that, at least for me, captured my mind and opened up my imagination. Pure magic. I highly recommended it to any and all fantasy lovers and without a doubt, I shall be reading the rest of the series.
5	1369958400	I was very surprised at how well I enjoyed this book.  I was hooked right off the bat.  In fact I purchased the next two in this trilogy before I finished this story.  I am eager to continue reading, to see how this tale ends.  Joseph Lallo, keep up the great work, I look forward to reading more of your stories.
3	1369872000	I thought this was a very good book. I love the characters and the story line was fantastic. I look forward to reading the rest of the .
4	1369872000	Well written and suspenseful. I will buy the series, just because I want to know how it turns out. It has some twists and turns to keep it going.
1	1369785600	It runs on and on before something leads up to even a small event. Had to quit reading. Gave it a chance, but a no go.
5	1369612800	Great book am heading to get the next in the series!  It is not what I first expected to find !!!
3	1369526400	I enjoyed the heroine and the magic. The opening could have been smoother. I enjoyed the story more with each chapter. Myn was delightful. I would like to read more books with strong female characters.
5	1369526400	This is the first of a trilogy and the best book of the three.  I really enjoyed the story and almost felt that it could stand alone without the other two.  Having said that the other two books are worth a read.
5	1369526400	A  wonderful book, that leads to an amazing adventure. The character development is absolute beautiful. Twist and turn on every coner,
5	1369440000	This author is really quite good.  I enjoy the storyline and the characters.  I bought the other books in the series to see how it ends.
4	1369267200	Seems like a good starting book for a very good series. Pulls you along, doesn't drag on and on over superficial details, yet doesn't leave you grasping for explanations.
4	1369094400	I wasn't expecting much from a free kindle book, so many are full of grammatical and spelling errors, not to mention poor writing overall that I didn't expect to find this gem. I love Myn, and Deacon is so like every nerd that ever wanted to talk to a pretty girl. Characters that are flawed make for good reading and this author knows just the right flaws for was each character. I can't wait to end this review so I can read book 2!
5	1369094400	I could not put this captivating book down. Heroes and villains abound - and even the villains keep the reader spell bound.  I can't wait to read more of Joseph Lallo' s suspense filled novels.
4	1368921600	I really enjoyed Book 1 so bought the others. I wasn't disappointed. The characters are well developed although some of the generals are difficult to differentiate. Deacon becomes more influentiial in Book 3 and adds another dimension to the plot.
5	1368921600	Great characters , great story line and what an imagination. This book was good from the get go. Hard to put down and well worth the time. I can not wait to start on the next book in the trilogy!
5	1368921600	ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. I COULD NEVER PICTURE HOW SHE LOOKED AND THAT BOTHERED ME BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER REAL TO ME.
5	1368835200	I don't text reviews much. But the ones I have are more than worthy of them. Could not put my kindle down or my phone that has the app.
5	1368662400	I downloaded this purely because the cover looked interesting, and I am so glad I did! I highly recommend this book to any fantasy lover.
5	1368576000	I was actually surprised that I liked this book. Most of the free fantasy books just don't grab my attention. Really want to finish the series. If the other books are as good then maybe I'll find other books by the author.
5	1368576000	Absolutely enjoyed this book.  The young dragon's personality adds so much to the visualization and interplay of the various characters.
3	1368576000	I tried reading this book several times over a two week time span and made a little progress. I just couldn't get into the story. It may be for some people, but it just seemed to drag out and lead nowhere. Sorry. Just not for me
4	1368489600	This is the first book in a trilogy that takes you on an epic journey to places you never expected with characters who are more than meets the eye.
5	1368489600	An absolutely wonderful series. Once I picked up The Book of Deacon I couldn't put it down and flew through it as well as the other two books in the series. An easy fast paced read in which the author takes the reader on an exciting journey.
4	1368489600	I enjoyed reading this book. The plot, place, characters and flow were all very nice! My only problem is that there wasn't really anywhere to stop and think. The ending was a cliff-hanger; afterwards I immediately started reading the next. This is my third read of this book.
5	1368403200	This is one of the most entertaining fantasies l have read in a long, long time.  I am looking forward to reading the next book on the trilogy.
3	1368230400	Seemed well written and all... just couldn't stick with it.  I can't point to anything I didn't like so I'll probably will pick it back up later.
3	1368144000	Got this book since it was free and had pretty good reviews so I had some fairly high expectations. Was disappointed in the writing style...the author kept saying things like &#34;the resourceful young lady&#34; in reference to the main character which was strange to me. Plot was sort of aimless for the first 1/3 of the book. Considered putting it down since it seemed like there was no point to the story, it seemed like it wasn't going anywhere. After things started picking up the plot was pretty interesting and well paced. I found it extremely repetitive towards the end especially when heroine is going through her magic lessons and finds out she's actually an amazing magic prodigy and is basically the best of the best at everything. I found myself skipping pages at a time during that part. All in all, the overall plot was interesting but the writing style and character development could use some work.
5	1367884800	This book, from page one to the very end was a very gripping tale. Every page was well written, every page made me want to read another. Looking forward to reading another. Pure fiction, but so well written, you can see what is happening through the entire book.
3	1367798400	A lot of typos the further you get in to the book, and it did take me a while to get into it, but for a free book, it did keep me entertained, and was sweet. Easy read.
4	1367798400	This book was a very good read. It had a good pace throughout, and kept you guessing from beginning to end. I truly enjoyed this book, and expect to do the same with the next one.
5	1367798400	When I bought this book I wasn't sure what to expect. I bought it around 12 in the afternoon and finished it a couple hours later. The book of deacon is a great fantasy book that keeps you wanting more. After I finished this book I bought the other 2 in the series and was very happy with those as well. If you like fantasy books this series is perfect. I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1367798400	i was a bit wary at the start, but this is a great book! the plot develops solidly, the language is mature and flowing and, most importantly, now i want to read the other books in the series.
5	1367625600	I couldn't put this book down, not willingly. When I did, I was already planning the next time I would be able to give my hunger enough substance to be satisfied for a time.  I recommend this novel to anyone who has a desire to discover an amazing mythical world that keeps you for hungering for more.
5	1367539200	When you are so involved with a story you start to become angry with a character, you know it is well written . And this one certainly is.Unfortunately, they ask for the review when all you want to do is start on the next book. So all I want to say is read it. You will get much more than you bargained for.
4	1367452800	The beginning was a little slow for me but as  the  story started to unfold l did not want to put the book down. Over all very good.
5	1367366400	Approaching the third age, I still love Science-Fiction, Fantasy and Adventure genres for light reading. But during the past 10 years I have been worried about the excessive violent, sexually explicit or just too dark and crude literature, especially regarding what it's made available to our kids and teens. So if like myself you are a parent (or grandparent) looking for a good read for your kids and teens, this series (the three of them) is excellent. Easy and site renting reading with drama, humor and romance suitable for all.
4	1367193600	Stil about 38% finished. but i like it so far. i usually don't like female protaganists, but this one is well written and i care about her character. we shall see.
4	1367193600	I like this so far.  Not as indepth as say Tolkien or Jordan but good so far.  Will definitely read the whole series.
5	1367107200	Very good book. I liked this book. It was well written. It has a detailed plot and good action. Well worth reading.
4	1367020800	It went too fast but it was fun.  I like big books but the whole series constitutes 1 decent sized book.
3	1366934400	At times in the book,  to many words were used and reading became tedious.  Overall this was a good book with a good storyline.  I do plan on reading the next book in this trilogy
4	1366848000	This book cleaned out the taste of my last one, which was horrible. It as free with my prime account. Now I simply can't wait to read the rest. This story has some great character development, wonder characters. I've also enjoyed the uniqueness of the tale. I believe the rest of the series will be even better.
4	1366848000	This is great for young readers. From elves to mermaids and dragons every mystical being arrives in this wholesome tale(apart from unicorn). I wish there was more romance,well any romance really. The heroin is special and interesting. The story is pretty good, lots of characters to keep up with but not confusing to do so. The lines dont deepen on sideline characters so that makes it easy to keep up. Not a trance inducing read but worth it!
5	1366848000	This was an experience to relish. Being sucked into a story is very important and Joseph went far and beyond. It wasn't just a story. I was drug into an entire world of his making. Thank you for the ride. I'll be continuing the journey if you don't mind.
4	1366848000	These books are really good. I think that they are more suited for a younger group of readers, but I liked the story line.
5	1366761600	I love this book. Just wish I could get the others that go with it but boy they are very expensive..
5	1366761600	I love this series, i cant seem to put it down. I got the free first one, and put off reading it awhile. After a week I started reading this and it was a bit slow at first, but took off fast and is getting better as they go. I am on book 2 and cant seem to put it down.
5	1366675200	Very fun book, really descriptive! One of the best fantasy books I've read in a while, if you like adventure, magic and drama then ou'll really enjoy this book. Has all the epic struggles of Lotd of the Rings but with a strong magic twist.
4	1366588800	This was a good story but it did go on and on with great detail. I would like to have given it a four and a half if possible. I will look for the new book by this author.
4	1366588800	This is a great fantasy adventure with a female as the main character. It is a well written story and kept me anticipating what would happen next. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
5	1366502400	I said that this book was really complex because if you were to start in the middle of it, you would make no sense of it. It is a book that I really loved because I'm kind of like Myranda towards the end of the book. How the author made the characters' complexities change made the story a great read. I would recommend this to anyone 12+  ;)
4	1366502400	The story was definitely interesting and I plan on reading the rest of the trilogy. The writing was a little dry sometimes and lacking in details, but overall the story was great and I enjoyed all of the characters.
5	1366243200	Solid read flew through it.  Might have given the protagonist a few too many powers in such a short period.  Good world building and magic system.
4	1365984000	Very good read. Book is very well wrote an easy to read. The ending comes quick. The writer is very gifted.
5	1365984000	Am looking forward to the next two!  I have spent every extra minute possible reading this and have not been disappointed.  Very interesting premise and characters.
5	1365897600	I have read all of the books in this series. The author has created such an amazing world and adventure. The character development throughout the series was really good. I found myself crying, getting upset, laughing, and smiling brightly as the story unfolds. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels!
5	1365811200	I have trouble putting this book down when I have to work on something else.  I cannot wait to get to the next book.
5	1365811200	Quick arrival.  Sweet decal for any super hero fan.  I have gotten tons of remarks on my decal and my son loves it.
4	1365724800	The story is an imaginative one filled with magic and imagined creatures, so it's a nice exploration in your mind. The writing isn't awesome, but it's good. I enjoyed it.
5	1365638400	the characters and story were very well developed and creative, as were locations and driving dramatic forces. I will be buying the sequels, i must find out how the story ends!
5	1365638400	The first book of the trilogy was spellbinding, to say the least.  Lallo created characters that are interesting and imaginative.  The foundation was laid well for the following book without giving anything away of the story still to come.  Really excellent.
5	1365638400	I wasn't expecting to even make it through the first chapter, but I was drawn in. The characters are well developed. Definitely a page turner.
5	1365552000	This book was a good book. I did enjoy it. It was not my typical read that is filled with romance...but considering the lack of romance and my level of enjoyment means it was a great book.
5	1365465600	At first i was not sure what to expect from the synopsis, but i decided to give it a try. The author has picked a classic setting in a war torn fantasy kingdom, with probably the most unassuming of heroines. What i loved about the story is that it continues to develop as you read and you are never quite sure where the story will go. Leaves you longing for more.I am in three quarters of the way through the third book and have enjoyed every minute.
5	1365379200	This will not at all be what you expect. It's an edge of the seat book all the way through. Please if you are reading this download the book and at least ready until chapter 8. You will not want to stop.
3	1365379200	I could not put this book down. I fell in love with the character Deacon, and wished more was written from his perspective. I would recommend this book to a someone searching for a read with a lot of fantasy
5	1365379200	The adventure that the characters go through is so intriging. The accidental happenings are so unexpected yet you see them coming....
5	1365292800	This was a wonderful book about a completely new and wonderful people and places. In a world of war  and crimes. VERY GOOD.
3	1365206400	The main characters were vivid and captivating as was the landscape. I found myself at times wanting a little bit more from the other side characters but knowing they are going to be handled more deeply in the second book. I think I am just greedy. I really give this 3 and a half stars. I can't wait to see where this story takes me. :?)
3	1365206400	I enjoyed the story, but the narrative is stilted at times and there were many typos in the ebook. I may or may not bother with the sequels.
3	1365206400	I can appreciate the work the author invested into writing this book but I must say that I never felt like I couldn't put it down. It was a fascinating enough book that I wanted to read it to  the end and I will breadth  other 2 books to see how the trilogy ends. I would recommend this book as an excellent high school assignment read.
5	1365206400	Very very good read. Great characters and awesome creatures.  Love Leo and the wizard. Cannot wait to read the next book.
4	1365206400	the story line was much as if one was playing a game for a personal computer but none-the-less was exciting and interesting with some neat characters. good read
5	1365120000	This book starts off the series for the book of deacon. It starts by showing how a girl learns the arts of magic and finds that she has a real talent for learning the arts. The books that come after this series are no stop action. So, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a good fantasy novel but doesn't want a heavy read.
4	1365033600	I'm an avid fantasy reader and escapism is a daily event. The Book of Deacon is good. I had some trouble getting through the first 90 or so pages- a lot right? Not because of poor grammer or world developement. Just not enough energy and plot to really stir up the interest. The main character is a bit wineful. I held out. Glad I did. Once he gets going, the world presented here is wonderful. I got this as a free ebook. So keep that in mind. I also purchased the second ebook in the series. That is worth knowing as well. :}
4	1364947200	I found this book to be extremely interesting and was quickly sucked into Myranda' s adventures.  Hopefully the rest of the books will equally captivate me.
5	1364774400	I cannot comment on one book specifically as the three books are one complete story. But on the story, I say excellent. It was difficult to put the books down to take care of much needed tasks and sleep. There was always something going on. And it kept you wanting to read more. The only thing I'd want to see more of is myranda and deacon returning to deacon's home. Perhaps a separate story. Also, kudos to you about not having this be a love story. Yes, love found away into some of the characters, but it remained about the purpose.
3	1364688000	I found the book to be adequate, mainly because of the rich character portrayals. As I read, I came to have a feeling of knowing them, and liking them, which is important to a reader. However, some areas were a bit lackluster in the way of the storyline being predictable. But overall, it wasn't a waste of time reading, as
2	1364601600	I really wanted to like this book.  Dragons, magic and war I thought this might be a great read.  The first quarter was a long and painfully slow intro to the main character with only a few pages of real action.  I downloaded it for free on the Kindle so I guess lesson learned: you get what you pay for.
5	1364515200	I loved this book. It was very exciting and interesting. I had hoped for a bit of romance, but the author assures me that may develop later in the series ;)
3	1364428800	I liked the first book in the series, I just didn't appreciate the simplicity of the main female lead. She is overly judgmental at times, and a bit hypocritical as well.Certain parts were overwhelmingly predictable, and I am hoping that the author did this on purpose as opposed to a general lack of imagination.I did not like the cliff-hanger nature of the ending, and I feel like I would only purchase the second because I feel this overwhelming need to know if they (SPOILER ALERT) make it through the stupid magical cave.Over all, I do not regret reading the first book in the series, and I am glad I was able to do so for free.
5	1364428800	I wanted to read a book of fantasy.  Not knowing this author I decided to try his book.  Good for me.  It is one of the better books. At times the descriptive writing bored me. But,that is true of most books for me.  I enjoyed the action and mystery. Look forward to the next in line trilogy.
5	1364342400	I read the book in 3 days, and enjoyed it very much, I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. Wonderfully enticing story. I highly recommend it.
5	1364342400	I did enjoy this book. It held my interest and kept me up well past my bedtime.Job well done
5	1364256000	I totally enjoyed this book!! It was well written, and the take on magic was quite refreshing.  Can't wait to read the next one!
5	1364256000	I loved it. I couldn't stop reading. Great characters,easily known. Lots of action. I can hardly wait to read the rest of the trilogy.  Thanks Joseph Lallo.
5	1364256000	Thank you, Mr. Lallo for these great books and the response to my email. I read a LOT of free books on my kindle app, but i only buy 2-4 books per year.. I HAD TO HAVE THE TRILOGY!  And I emailed him saying thanks, because I was so hooked on the characters and would love to see more books about the chosen ones and the future of their post war lives... I think this is only the second time I've ever emailed an author after buying 2 books and reading all three!  OUTSTANDING!
4	1364256000	This was an awesome book one of the best adventure books I've read in a long time I love the detail the story
5	1364169600	This book is much different from others in that the character is a girl who develops into a woman without sex as the primary angle.
1	1364169600	This is my first book review and all the misleading 5 star reviews promted me to do so. I was originally not going to finish the book it was so bad but forced myself to do so in order to write an accurate review.The good is this had a possibility to be a good plot but all the negatives blow that.What kills this novel is many things and the first is believing in the story because of the number of contradicts and discontinuities throughout the book. It is almost like the author forgets many times what he wrote before in the story and this start in the first chapter of the book. He wants us to believe a young woman has been wondering around a land that is like Alaska in the winter for years, but then has the character act like the never have been off a farm before. I could write a chapter about all the times things like this happen in the book and why I stopped reading after about a quarter of the way through.The grammar and vocabulary seemed to be geared to a sixth grade audience and maybe I missed this is suppose to be a young children's book.
5	1364083200	A very captivating story.  One of the few books Ive read in quite some time that I couldnt put down.
5	1364083200	couldnt put it down...finished in 2 days....didnt want it to end...cant wait for the others to be on the free list
3	1364083200	Well written story but lacked intensity. It was a refreshing change of plot compared to other fantasy books which are usually all the same. I hope the second book is more intense.
4	1364083200	it was an apt ending to an interesting trilogy it was well written with great imagination worth reading the whole trilogy
2	1363996800	I initially was interested in this book but the further I read my interest faded.  The author gets bogged down and leaves me wondering if there is a plot.  While I believe he has a series planned this book doesn't leave me wanting to read the next book.
5	1363910400	This was an awesome free book. Definitely consider buying the 2nd & 3rd books. Minor editing errors, but overall good product. The character development is only lacking in a few areas, but I expect it to improve over the series.
4	1363737600	I enjoyed this book and decided to purchase the rest of the trilogy.  Will probably read others by this author.
4	1363737600	The beginning was the usual but keep me intrigued and WOW ,the read had me going, could not keep the Kindle down ,can't wait to read rest of the trilogy!!!!
5	1363737600	To say this is a great book is but words until you read it for yourself.  So fellow people who love books such as this I have but one phrase to say. "Tap that button and get to reading."
5	1363737600	I chose this rating because this book kept my attention. I only wish I didn't have to stop reading and get the next book. I wish it was all one book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes stories of supernatural beings.
4	1363737600	As the title says, this book was pretty good. I enjoyed it and followed it a lot. It just seemed to be lacking a bit compared to his sci-fi series. It seems this series is definitely older, and it shows. Lallo really came into his writing with Bypass Gemini and having read those first the book of deacon series feels like a slight step back.The story though is pretty interesting if not terribly original. I am usually not a fan of catch-all magic systems that let people do just about anything but this is done fairly well. My main issue with it isn't really realized until later books, so I will refrain from that in this review.Myranda as a character is decent. She has a fair amount of innocence and compassion, yet is still labeled the rebel and disliked by characters for what is generally something you like someone for. This was fairly interesting to me.Overall, the story was able to keep me interested and I enjoyed it, but having read his newer work it left a strange feeling.
5	1363564800	This book was really hard to put down. You did a great job. I would recommend this book. Can't wait to start the second book
4	1363564800	This books is different but a definite good read.  I love the main character I can't wait for the next book
5	1363564800	Love it.  The story was great and the next installment in the series is on my must have list. Can't wait to know more.
5	1363478400	Great read. Plenty of twists and turns that kept me interested the entire time. One of the best fantasy novels I've read in awhile! Thanks Joseph Lallo.
3	1363478400	The concept of the story is very good. It does take a while to get going's but is intriguing enough to keep reading. I would recommend this book to those who like fantasy stories.
5	1363305600	Thought it would be ok as it was free, but this author spins a tale that takes you away and keeps you thoroughly entertained as the characters come to life with in these pages. read this one and you will simply have to have the other two...
5	1363219200	Awesome story line I love love love love love love love love love love love love love love this book
5	1363219200	I can honestly say this is now my FAVORITE book of all time. The book of deacon keeps you on your toes at all times. In this story my favorite character if mya:) the Dragon.
5	1363219200	An awesome trilogy at a great price for those looking for great bargain books. I gave it a perfect rating.
3	1363219200	I really liked parts of "The Book of Deacon" and the concept. What I did not care for was the heroine, so I'm one and done with the series.
4	1363219200	At least I think it's a debut novel. It has the standard chosen one story but with enough engaging secondary characters that it stands above many otherself published e books out there. That is so important in story telling. And Your main character is only as strong as the support ing cast. Oh And it's free! Buying books 2 and 3 for sure.
3	1363046400	Its not the book that I thought it was. I guess the old saying &#34;Don't judge a book by its cover&#34; applies the Title as well.
4	1363046400	This enjoyable, well written story keeps the reader connected to the characters.  The author does a fine job of balancing the details with the pace of the book.
4	1362960000	I would recomend this book.  The reading had a nice flow to it and kept me interrested though out the book.  Just start book 2 and it has the same flow going with it.
4	1362873600	Very good book, my emotions went up and down like a rollercoaster. The books make you want to continue the series
5	1362873600	I had long ago given up on the fiction fantasy genre. This book has made me reconsider. Thank you!  I look forward to the next and the next.
3	1362787200	Reviewing this book is a challenge.The good part is that the book is fun to read. I do not know that I'll read the sequels but overall I can say that I did enjoy the book. The overall line of the plot is promising and intriguing and the conceived fantasy world has its potential.The bad part is in the details. The pieces don't fit into place well. The "rules" of the world the author created are constantly changing, seemingly on the whim of the author. Suddenly this thing is not possible, or cannot be done but the some other thing is simple and easily achieved. The plot shifts and turns but in but these shifts feel random and not "quite right". The characters, though growing with the story, are not reliable and their actions seem arbitrary. In fact, there are many arbitrary and inconsistent things going on that it is hard to sympathize with the characters or to become part of the fantasy world that the author created.The bottom line is that the book is ... not bad but not good either. If you have some recommended book under your hand - proceed with the other book. If you are looking for something to pass your time this book is probably better than others. In my humble opinion, if the author was a bit more careful it could've been a great book.
4	1362787200	I've read some reviews through this medium and I will warn you ahead of time that I am no great literary critic. I read a book and I either like it or not---I don't know about character or plot development or maintaining the appropriate level is suspense. But I do know the kind of books I like and I definitely like The Book of Deacon. I like the characters, the story line and the pace. The only negative--Mr. Lallo deserves  a MUCH better editor!  There are way too many grammatical errors and too many typos. At times it can be very distracting. So Mr. Lallo, if you are letting your little sister, girlfriend or mom edit your stories, QUIT!! They deserved not to be criticized for something they want to do to share in something extraordinary. Let them done easy and find a more experienced and talented editor.
5	1362787200	Was hooked from the start. Fell in love with the characters and could not put down. Purchased next two books right after finishing this amazing book!
4	1362787200	I was pretty amazed at how i enjoyed this book.With a somewhat basic vocabulary, the author managed to still colourfully describe his world and immerse me in it.The plot is somewhat predictable but that wasn't much of a issue for me.Pros: A good world, fun characters.Short falls: Small vocabulary used. I got annoyed at the constant use of a certain adjective (which will go unnamed because i don't want you looking for it). I may have only noticed this as i read the book over two days.A good read in all.If you want to read to improve vocabulary then this is probably not the book for you - try Stephen Donaldson - but, if you just want to enjoy a typical fantasy read, i wouldn't go past The Book of Deacon.
4	1362614400	Reading it now Love it. Can hardly wait to open it up again and see what is going to happen next.
5	1362614400	I got the book on a whim and couldn't stop reading it. After finishing the book I quickly bought the other two. My only complaint is that I wish Myranda and Deacon' s relationship was expanded on.
4	1362528000	IT keeps you wanting to know what is next. And just when you think you got it it changes. Looking forward to the next book.
4	1362528000	Great energy that keeps one turning the pages. Can not wait to read what the next book brings. Getting it now.
5	1362528000	The first of Joseph Lallo's Deacon Trilogy of a young girl seeking herself through a frozen, war torn land of wizards and shape changers.  The most memorable line to me is almost just a throw away phrase:  &#34;Don't weep for me.  Where I am going ailment cannot follow.&#34;
5	1362528000	This book was well written- I couldn't put it down and finished it in a day.  I immediately purchased the second book to see what happens next to the characters.  It is a nice mix in fairy tales, magic, and epic scope.
5	1362528000	This is an engaging, creative story about a great adventure.  The character development is excellent and the lessons of life and war come through with Myranda's firm belief that the long-running war must end.  I cannot wait to read the second book!
4	1362528000	This story was surprising. What at first seemed like a story about a girl who found a magic sword in the midst of a perpetual war (which I thought was going to maker her some sort of super warrior as in many other tales that begin this way) turned out to be anything but. There are multiple story lines unfolding at the same time, though the majority of time is spent with Myranda, and this gives the tale a place in the larger part of the world. The writing is fairly fluid and I only noticed a few formatting errors in the kindle version, nothing that pulled me from the story. The beginning is rather slow, but that could be a result of the main character's primarily solitary life. Once she starts meeting more people the story's pace quickens. There are some interesting plays on magic, though it is fairly typical (based on the four elements) and I find myself wanting to know what happens next. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy as an entertaining read.
5	1362355200	I really loved this book! I think it was a great set up to a great series. It set up a pretty cool world, and throws a young girl into a big adventure simply by stumbling upon a sword. I think the author does a great job in this book developing very interesting characters that have distinct personalities and values that they stay true to throughout the series. I really loved this book and would certainly recommend it.
5	1362355200	Meaty and fulfilling, this book is one of those rare 5 star freebies you hope to find, yet never do.  I plan on immediately buying #2 and digging in.Mr. Lallo, well done. You have earned a new fan.
4	1362355200	A fantasy world filled with strife, magic, dragons, and likable characters. What more do you want?  Enjoyed it very much
5	1362355200	This book was well written & unique. I was totally drawn into it. You'll want to read all of the books. Lallo is one of my favorite authors now.
5	1362268800	To have found a fantasy story with creativity and imagination without being cheapened by sex or gore is such a joy! I was surprised that a book this long and still captivating was available for free on kindle. I'm grateful to be invited into this struggle for hope in a land of war. The beauty of a land of peace that teaches freely draws you into wanting to read more. The characters become friends that you want to journey with in their self discovery and fate. Thank you!
5	1362268800	Lallo keeps your mind wandering. Never thought I would be so anxious to read the next two books. Thank you for the adventure.
5	1362268800	Wow. Its starting to be rare to find a completely original book, but this one is. Joseph, keep writing! The quality of you writing is inspiring. And the fact that this book took me a week to read is a testament to how good this book was.I normally finish a book this long in hours. Keep on writing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4	1362268800	The hero in this story is not to be discovered until the end. Meranda the new healer is on a mission to make our hero believe in the humanity of mankind. I really enjoyed this book, I just would have like to seen it better proof read.
5	1362182400	This series would make a great movie. Especially if Peter Jackson held the reigns. First book I've read by this author and I am an instant fan.
5	1362182400	Really enjoyed this book, kept my interest through to the end. Looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.
4	1362182400	What a great read.  I got this book free from Amazon and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was a quick, but enjoyable read.  It was so good that I immediately purchased the second book.  It had war, magic, dragons, wizards, simply everything.  I can't wait to get started on the second book in the trilogy in just a few minutes.  Hope it is just as good.  This is my first book by this author and I can definitely way it won't be my last!
4	1362182400	This book is easy to follow, flows easily, and is a great read. Fantasy buffs will love it. There are quite a few typos, which is why it got 4 instead of 5 stars. They don't, however, detract too much from the story. This is a trilogy, so be prepared to buy the others. He doesn't end this book where you can be content without reading the next.
4	1362009600	Well written a few misspellings but a great story. It was very hard to put it down. Can not wait to read the rest of the story
5	1361923200	This is an awesome book! I downloaded it by chance and was swept off of my feet by the smooth writing. I often will skim a book because of redundant descriptions. The author gives just enough,then draws you forward into the story. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
5	1361836800	I love this book. I really cant wait to read the next two books i bet they are gonna be just as good as the first
5	1361836800	I downloaded this as a free book and was not expecting much. However once I got into it I could not put it down and had to continue with the story!
4	1361836800	These sheets are very soft and comfortable to sleep in. I washed and dried them and have no problems with seems popping or anything. My only complaint (and it might just be the other blanket on my bed) is that they are either starting to 'pill' or they are attracting lint. Overall though great product for the price.
5	1361836800	This book was free so I decided to give it a chance. I started the book and without realizing it, two hours had passed. I was enthralled. As soon as I was able to I bought the rest of the series. I can not wait to get to book two. If you like strong female leads and magic, give it a try. Now off to the next book!
4	1361836800	The author blended fables with fantasies with myths with fairy tales with aliens, etc. but I enjoyed the trilogy and visiting his world.  Although the storyline was confusing at times and the journeys long, it's still well worth the read.
3	1361750400	A very captivating story and well written . The Book of Deacon was not what I thought it would be. I picked it up and couldn't put it down .finished it in one day
5	1361664000	Leaves eager for the next change of action.  There is a total sense of continuous immersion. Do not start without leaving everything else.
5	1361664000	It was an enjoyable book to spend the day with.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
4	1361577600	A fantastic beginning. Can`t wait for the next book. I did believe it was a bit slow to start, but picked up speed quickly.
5	1361577600	I am surprised that I enjoyed this book. Almost gave up a few pages in. Good story with characters that were interesting and unique. Bottom line is I am a fan and will buy the nextbook. Thanks for the free read.
5	1361491200	This story is exciting, gripping, adventurous and very well written. I can't wait to read the 2nd book of the series.
5	1361491200	The storyline was easy to follow, and was captivating.  The love story part of the plot line left a lot to be desired as far as chemistry went, but since it wasn't really the focus of the book, it was easy enough to overlook.It's an excellent read that I have already recommended to others and will continue to do so.
5	1361404800	This was one of those books that was sooo! captivating that you couldn't wait to see what was around the corner.I just didn't want to put it down.  I'm glad Lallo left the door open for a continuation.
3	1361404800	Not bad. Not great. It reads well and I may get the other parts but I'm also reading other books at the same time.ok
3	1361404800	Another self-published book in need of an editor. It may possibly be a very good story, but the flaws in the first few chapters tried my patience. The main character lacked conviction - she seemed to have to be led around, accepting advice from untrustworthy sources. Also, the coincidence factor is a bit high - things conveniently happen or appear, just in the nick of time.If you like fairy tales and can suspend your belief, you may like this book.
5	1361318400	This was one of the first kindle books I ever downloaded that wasn't a reference book.  Once I started reading it I had to wonder where it had been my whole life.  This book after reading about its creation, was well worth the time that the author Joseph Lallo put into it.  The love for the story and characters comes through and made me read on and on. To note I am reading these on my android smart phone and even with the smaller screen I would make the font smaller as to get as much on the screen at one time as possible.  When I was 75% thru I just went and bought the other two books in the series to have at the ready.Get this book and get ready to get wound up in a wonderful take on an authors journey through the wilds of his imagaination.  One where he is quite comfortable and you are made to feel the same way while you visit.As a last note here, I can only hope that Joseph is planning on giving us more of this wonderful world he has put before us, hint hint.
5	1361318400	I really liked this book. It had a good story and interesting characters. I will be reading the next two.
5	1361318400	The story was fun to read and I ate up every word.  I love sci-fi stuff, the thought of another kind of life draws me in. I hope ya'll like it. Also the book is appropriet enough for my kids to listen to it as a bedtime story. Which is good because than the book gets read more than once.
5	1361318400	I immediately bought the sequels.  It's classic fiction in a unique setting with intriguing bad guys.  This is highly recommended.
5	1361232000	All of the characters in the book showed promise.  I could not put the book down.  Keep making the series even after Jade.
5	1361232000	I was with held at first about this book and what it might contain, but do NOT let the first pages fool you!!! It had to be read to lead you to where the story was going! Believe me you will NOT regret this read! The only thing I regretted about this book was that I had to wait to get the second book! lol I would highly recommend it!
5	1361232000	I downloaded the free version; although it was a little difficult to get into the writers style of writing at the beginning, I liked this work so much, I bought the other two books in the series.
5	1361145600	This was my first kindle book, I read it about a year ago and ran across it again. I should have reviewed it sooner but l will make up for it by buying the second book. a good read that I still think about the story once in a while.
3	1361145600	This book started as many tales do, with the main character living a life she has grown accustomed to. While on the whole this book was a wonderful read, one thing keeps me from accepting this book as excellent. Toward the end, a cuss word is used. I'm not sure what page it's on, but it's there.Other than that, the book is fine and I enjoyed it thoroughly. One of my favorite characters is Myn. She is so adorably overprotective!
4	1361145600	I'm going to keep it simple and allow this review to stand for the trilogy rather than this first book in the series.Like other reviewers, I downloaded this because it was free.  What a surprise to find it not only well written, but highly entertaining!  Sure, there are a few editorial issues throughout these books but really they are very minor and few in quantity.The characters were well developed, and the detail given to the settings and actions were very well done.I am not certain what age group is the target for this series; most of the time it seems perfectly appropriate for young readers.  The battle scenes could be a bit off-putting for younger folks, and some of the language and themes might be a bit older - but in general, I wouldn't hesitate to allow my 10 year old (who is in love with the Rick Riordan books)to read this series.Immediately after reading the first book, I bought the next two.  While it's true that it follows a general "recipe" commonly found in fantasy novels, there were still some surprises in store and it was not always predictable.  Though one may wonder at the title of the first book in the trilogy, it becomes more apparent as the reader moves on through the next two books.In summary, I would recommend this series for anyone that is a fan of the fantasy genre.
5	1360972800	This book held my interest so much that I had to read till it was completed. I liked it so much that I've already bought the next in the series.I believe this to have been one of the best reads since I first found Sci-fi.
5	1360972800	An intriguing story, well written, very hard to put down.  Loved the characters and the story progressed at a great pace, neither too quick nor dragged out.  Thoroughly enjoyed.
3	1360886400	Decent read with some interesting characters and situations but some of the character's reactions are a bit overdone. I guess there are people who do act that way but it made the character's a little less really me. Good enough I would read the rest in the series.
5	1360886400	This yarn completely pulled me in. After reading the first book (Book of Deacon), I bought the other two of the trilogy. I look forward to future books from the author. Keep them coming!
5	1360800000	This book was great! It was offered free for Kindle and I went ahead and took a chance. I liked it so much I have recomended it to several friends who read the same genre. It was so good that I bought the next two books and was finished with them in a week.
5	1360800000	An awesome tale. I absolutely can't wait to read more. I had this book in my kindle for awhile before reading, but when I started I couldn't stop. This book does not disappoint.
5	1360800000	Slow start but the twists and turns make u read more. The ending was great because you never seen it ending right there.
4	1360627200	Nice book. I would recommend especially for younger readers of fantasy. It was free but interesting enough to buy the next book in the series.
5	1360627200	I was barely able to put this book down. Payday can't come soon enough so I can buy the rest!
5	1360627200	I love this book can't seem to put it down. I read it in three days would have token two but I have kids lol. Great for free and the . Other two books so far just as great
4	1360627200	I found the story telling good enough to continue on with the reading. Miranda needs to mature a bit more.
4	1360540800	I am not a huge fantasy genre reader.  I have just finished the inheritance series of Dragon.  This book seems to be a shadow boxer for that series.  However so far this book has been entertaining.  Had I read these books 1st I may have preferred them.  The Dragon series was at times drawn out and slow.  This book is a more enjoyable read so for.  We shall see how the others pan out
4	1360540800	I was surprised to find that this book kept me into it until the last page and left me wanting to know more.
5	1360454400	I was so involved I couldn't put it down.  Great for everyone to read.  Would be good for a family to read together.  Lots of magic.
5	1360281600	I stumbled across this was pleasantly surprised at the gem I found. A very enjoyable read. I look forward to finishing the series.
5	1360281600	I found this book hard to read at first but as the mystic part of the world started to open up I couldn't help but continue to read and read until I finished. I cannot wait to read the rest and hope they are as good as this one.
4	1360281600	The main character is engaging and interesting while supportive characters were adequately developed. A few grammar errors lead to some confusion, but nothing that can't be figured out. The story line is interesting and well developed. Some of the transitions between plots and subplots are ragged, which leaves the reader a little disoriented. A good proof reader and rewrite could make this into an excellent book.
2	1360195200	I thought it was creative how the author threw together a variety of different characters and environments (i.e., half-human/half animal main character, Entwell - a form of Utopia, ordinary female heroine, etc.) in this story.  The plot for the whole series has promise but I am not eagerly looking forward to read the next books in the series.I was disappointed with the numerous typos throughout the book, the very slow start, the awkward wording, and when some details were overlooked.  The typos and the overlooked details were a distraction.  The awkward wording also disrupted the flow.  I found the slow start very irritating because I kept waiting to see what the author had in mind for the characters.  I didn't find myself getting into the book until at least 50% of the way through it.  At that point, I didn't think the excessive back-story was necessary at all.
5	1360195200	I simply couldn't put this book down.  I had a couple of nights where I fell asleep hours past my bed time reading.Simply birlliant.  I can't wait to read the next 2 books.Very captivating story and the pace is well set and easy to follow.
5	1360108800	Gripping right from the start,an eye opener through out the tale being told,magic is always a hope to harbor in this day and age
5	1360108800	This book was really an Amazing book. I can not get enough of it at all.When I bought this book it was because it was free, and I curled up in my room in my little reading space curled up in blankets and supported by pillows in a dark room. I was grasped by the book and it held me there till the very end. I couldn't stop reading even when I got to school the next day. I was Rage reading till I had finished it. It was the most amazing addicting book to me. I didn't have the money to buy the next two so I had to agonizingly wait till I got money to buy them. I got both of the next two books in a heart beat and I'm working on the second book right now. I will have to say the Writer did amazing at this series. :P
3	1360022400	No positive theme, the author simply rambles through a series of implausable incidents that meanders towards a trilogy hoping he can take some of his readers with him.
5	1360022400	Could not put it down.  It is a great story, has a little bit of everything, humor suspense, mystery.  It is nice to get lost in a good book, if you like fiction/fantasy.
5	1360022400	If you are looking for a good fantasy read, this series was excellent and nicely priced. I recommended it to others.
4	1360022400	Great story look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy you made the characters come alive no easy feat
5	1359936000	I enjoyed this book so much that I'm now on the third in the trilogy! Great story and great characters. Just needs more spell check.
4	1359849600	A bit of a slow start but eventually draws you in and makes you want to continue the series. Be aware that while the first book in the series may be free, the rest of the series are not!
5	1359676800	Hooks the reader.  Well done.  Being able to see a bit of oneself in the protagonist pulls you forward to look for more.
5	1359676800	I never under stood why it wasn't named something about the chosen, but a great start to a great series!
4	1359676800	This book is written in two halves both very different one is earthly and the second other wordly.  It will appeal mostly to those who love magic and myth and the old good winning over evil.The only down side was the slightly overdone sad beginning, I nearly stopped reading a
5	1359676800	I really enjoyed this book. Good story and good use of imagination. There were a couple minor issues with grammar and the short time frame it took the main character to learn all the forms of magic seemed a little unbelievable, but she was a prodigy, so what do I know. I am really looking forward to the next two books in the series.JeffIndieproofreader@gmail.com
5	1359676800	The book got better and better! It is a must read, and it keeps you wanting more! A book for both adults and teens, not the usual, sappy teen fantasy book either. Which, is a refreshing change!
5	1359504000	This was by far one of the better free books I have read. I use to read these type of books all the time when I was a kid and this one was great.
5	1359504000	This was my first online book and I must say it was really great.  I enjoyed the book and it kept me interested throughout the entire story....now I just have to get to the second book as I must find out what happens next.
4	1359417600	This is the first time I have read any fantasy books. I found the story very enjoyable and look forward to reading the next book.
5	1359331200	So enjoyed on to the next , but not the cold weather. The ending cliff was to be expected. Yeah.
5	1359244800	Like many others I grabbed this book for free a few months ago. After finally getting around to reading it I quickly finished and immediately bought the next book! The characters are wonderful and their interactions are nuanced.The book contains numerous minor typos but nothing that makes reading difficult.
5	1359244800	I was absolutely captivated by this book! Trust me you will not want to put it down! The story is riveting, the plot well thought out and the characters, man you gotta love em especially Myn! I read this in one sitting I couldnt stop and then when i was finished i purchased the remaining two books and did not regret it!!!
3	1359244800	It's a great book.  It kept me hooked from the start.  Suspenseful and entertaining all the way through.  The book is a great read
5	1359244800	There are a lot of books available for free on Amazon and most of them are terrible. This is one I have enjoyed thoroughly and had a hard time putting down.  Found myself reading around 3AM because I couldn't find a good stopping point!
4	1359158400	Intricate and detailed, this is a work of near artistry in the storytellers craft.Miranda holds true to a belief that is shunned by all she meets, so much so that she is forced to live on the run and alone. Through wearisome trials and near captures, she arrives at a time and place where she learns more about herself and her abilities - becoming a master wizard in the process.  Miranda must choose: hunted or haven, warrior in name or in truth.There are some bothersome typos and 'spell check' wordings that require an extra moment or six to figure out actual meaning, but they are minor distractions in a Great story... I will be looking for book 2 immediately!
3	1359158400	Lallo weaves a compelling tale of well-developed character characters, set in a believably wondrous world that offers perhaps some allegorical connections to the war-drugged land Americans inhabit. I especially enjoyed Myranda's tutelage in magick. It's worthy read, and I'm intrigued enough to consider the sequels...but... Okay, everyone needs an editor, and I'm neither an author nor a grammarian, but wow, the sentences ending with "of," and the trite idioms, and (fault of publisher) the missing/wrong words...these manuscript flaws really tried my patience. I savored the flavor even as I found the chewing a chore.
5	1359072000	I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of this trilogy. I can't wait to read the next one! I hope I won't have to wait long.
3	1358985600	I liked the book. It was interesting to see how Lain had always been around and how strong he was. Hopefully he will do the right thing.
5	1358899200	What a great read. Action packed with twists and turns. I didn't want to put it down! Can"t wait to read the next one.
4	1358812800	I loved all that this book offered! It was a refreshing and engaging adventure that I did not want to put down. I will buy the other books that go along with this one once I find them! Thank you for your writings.
4	1358726400	A great combination of magic, war, and struggle. Great characters, action packed and full of emotion. Loved it ! Awesome!
5	1358726400	Truly an amazing treat. I downloaded this book because it was a free kindle book and was completely absorbed into it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. There were twists and turns that are not seen anymore. Going to buy the next book now.
5	1358640000	This tale was fantastic in every sense of the word. The plot was engaging, the writing clear, the characters unique and entertaining. I totally fell in love with myn, myranda, lain, and deacon. I cant wait to get my hands on the next book of the series. If you bypass this book i promise you will regret it.
5	1358640000	I had bought this book long ago and never bothered to pick it up, and when i did i couldn't put it down!Its written very well, its perfectly paced and it has all in it that i need. Dragons, half-humans, fake humans, ghost like creatures many types of magic and more. I guarantee this as a great read. . .
3	1358553600	It's a good story, but it moves a little slowly, has a character that is more pitiable than admirable (stuff always seems to happen to her, she acts as if she's swept along with it and powerless - hard to really like her), and there's so much that happens that it feels like the story hasn't begun when the book ends.
5	1358553600	I have read many, many books.  It is hard to find one I don't want to put down.  This was one of them.  The character's are fascinating, the story-line is great.  I actually look forward to the second part of the series.  A truly unusual, entertaining book.
5	1358467200	I'd never heard of Mr. Lallo until I read this book. I knew before I'd finished it that I was going to get the next two books in the series. Great read!
5	1358467200	This gran tale of  a girl struggling  to save the fate of her kingdom and rid the land of war is a charming and warm tale full of mystery and adventure.
4	1358467200	A VIVID AND WELL DEVELOPED FANTASY Interesting characters  I am eagerly looking forward to being emerged into the next two books
5	1358380800	One of the absolute BEST trilogies I've read in a very long time. That statement coming from an avid bibliophile. I will definitely recommend these books to all my fellow book reading friends. I am also going to look for this series on paperback, as I would like to have them physically to add to my collection. All I can say is, if you haven't read these book yet, it would be in your best interest to do so. Excellent plot, I was highly attached to all the characters, and there was even a bit of romance, though it didn't go overboard like so many other books. AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. I will be reading these over and over for years to come.
5	1358380800	I enjoy fantasy books with strong female characters.  Miranda is strong, smart, scalable realistic.  She has faults and hasn't been given an easy life.
5	1358294400	I just love this book. I wish I could find the other series to the book. I can remember the events and there is a little bit of romance which makes everything better. I really liked it and would recommend the book.
5	1358294400	This is a very well written book. The creativity of the author is astounding and the imagery is particularly good. He is able to blend the various chapters of the book together well always keeping the plot focused on a logical progression of the story.While some authors switch character perspectives at the beginning of a new chapter and proceed to lose direction, this author expertly guides the books focus to  the main characters and their plight.
5	1358294400	This is the first not Romance book I read, and now I'm hooked. Thank you Joseph Lallo for opening a whole new world and kind of books to me.
3	1358208000	This book is fairly good. It starts off fairly slow. I was constantly left with the question of what the end objective of the story was. There is no quest at hand or anything, you are just left following a girl around. The objective of the over all story doesn't come out untill the  end of the book. That is why it's important you finish the whole book to enjoy it to its fullest.The world this author creates Is not as fantastic as the universe of LOTR or the covenant series.However he does a good job at creating a some what unique world. He also describes the way magic works in the world which I found very enjoyable. Especially since most authors just call magic magic and leave it at that.Overall this book is a good read, and gets very addicting halfway in.
5	1358121600	Great book.can not wait to read the next adventure.One of the best books I have read this year so far.
5	1358121600	This book keep me reading until I finish it has everything a reader likes to keep him stuck to the book with a nice glass of wine!!!
5	1358121600	I rarely leave a review but this book was awesome. I didn't know what to expect from a free book but I was really impressed and more than happy to buy the next books in the series to find out what happens. Awesome!
5	1358035200	I am usually hard to please, but my my my! I was hooked from the begining! Thank you Mr. Lallo for writing such an amazing story!
5	1358035200	Books I have read in quite a while.  I cannot recommend it enough.  If you loved Moon's Paks I believe you will love this book.  I bought the rest of the series before I finished the first book.  I hope the other two books live up to the first in this trilogy.  There were a few errors but just small editing things that I noticed, nothing truly jarring however I am no expert lol.  By the way this author's world building is so good I just realized that fact as I was writing this review.  I read this straight through in like six hours.  Fixing to start the second in the series goodbye sleep.  Happy reading and this book is truly worth the time spent reading something I cannot always say.
5	1358035200	Fast paced and kept me very intrigued. I would recommend this to anyone interested in fantasy novels. I will be buying the rest of the series
5	1357776000	I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! I just ordered part 2 and am very excited to read more. It is just so well written and so much fun to read. I highly recommend this story.
5	1357689600	I absolutely loved it. It was well written and had a very good flow. My only hope is that I can find out if Deacon and Myranda fall in love and that Lain (Leo) helps to stop the war.
5	1357689600	fantastic book i really enjoyed the dynamics of the magic system and how the story progressed. it was a delight.
5	1357689600	The story kept me turning the pages until I had finished the whole book without stopping. Looking forward to the second book in the series.
3	1357689600	This book was pretty good, but not great. There were quite a few typos which I noticed was a complaint a lot of other reviews mentioned. It was a little bit distracting, but I was able to move past it.  Some of the chapters in the middle of the book were a little boring for me. There are quite a few chapters that go into detail about the different magic used in the story...they just didn't hold my attention. I'm still planning on reading the next book in the series & hope it gets better.
5	1357603200	Awesome book, easy to read and good story. I can recommend this book to all who enjoy a good fantacy!!!!
5	1357603200	I cant get enough of these, the stories are compelling, they suck you right in to a fascinating world.  Truly excellent books!
4	1357603200	This was a free download I happened upon and was pleased to discover that it wasn't a blurb to entice me to buy the rest of the book. It's also a fairly long story at 8000 plus on the Kindle.
5	1357516800	This is a very entertaining, and a real work of imagination.  It is quite interesting the way the author has entwined the various creatures of fantasy into a human world of fiction. I would recommend this book for young readers as it is quite different from other books that are being published now.  There is quite a bit of bad language being published by other publishers as being the normal usage of the American language.
1	1357516800	Not the type of books I choose to read. it was a free title on kindle and so i read it and tried to stayed focused.
4	1357516800	I really enjoyed this book. I loved all the action and trials Myeranda had to overcome. I can't wait to read the next one.
5	1357430400	I bought this book because it picqued my interest. Needless to say, I bought the remainder of the series. It's well written and you genuinely connect with the characters. Give it a shot
4	1357430400	I am quite curious as to the next phase of the journey. Not all of the characters have a clear definition of their role, but seem to play a major part. So many fates left to the unknown does leave quite the cliffhanger and I hope all will start to become clear in the future books.
4	1357430400	enjoying it thus far,due to work & school I don't get to read it as much as I'd like, but everyone I get to it, it manages to captivate me
5	1357430400	This was one of my favorite books to read. I must start the second book immediately! I like the use of a female lead. Very well written.
5	1357430400	Good start of a series. It left a lot of room for the author to expandDefinitely looking  forward to the next book
5	1357430400	My only regret is not owning the other two books in the trilogy... yet.  The story was well written and compelling.
5	1357344000	I read all three books. This is a great story with loveable and hateable charecters. As a female reader I sometimes tired with the length of the battles but the story is solid.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the trilogy.And when your done, read Jade... Delightful story of the Chosens decendents.
5	1357257600	This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for.
4	1357171200	I got my Kindle for Christmas and this was the first book I downloaded, I just to see how a book looked on here. I certainly loved this book and how it was written from the very beginning. I love reading 'series' books, mostly because I like reading stories that don't end quickly. I will be getting the other books as soon as I am able. And as I said above, SERIOUSLY AWESOMEPANTSNESS!!
5	1357171200	This is one of the best books I've read since vampirates and it is absolutely amazing I would recommend it to everyome
5	1357171200	I came upon this book as many of other's have  -because its free-. It far exceeded my expectations. The main plot has been used in several series (the no-one main character who becomes very important after a process of discovering himself), but its very well developed in this book and has twists and unexpected events that keep you motivated to read more and more.I will definitely add this book to my read-many-times list. I will write more about it in the future.-So I have now read the book for the second time, and it doesn't let me down in the slightest. It is very well written, pleasant to read, and leaves you wanting for more. I followed Myranda's adventures with a mix of feelings, as I didn't want the book to be over but I wanted to keep going.Definitely worth it. Look forward to the rest.
5	1357171200	The book starts out a little slow but when it gets started it is a very good story. I really enjoyed reading this book as well as the rest of the trilogy.
1	1357084800	SORRY I CANNOT PROPERLY RATE THIS BOOK BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET PAST THE FIRST CHAPTER. IT JUST DIDN'T HOLD MY INTEREST.
3	1356998400	This series was okay.  I have read better.  The character development was not so great and the characters themselves were somewhat odd.  I finished the series only because I am OCD and like to complete stuff.
5	1356912000	I got this book as a free download. It surpassed my expectations by a lot! I am now a HUGE fan and have read the other 2 books in the series. If you like this type of story (wizards, dragons etc) then you will really enjoy these books. I just hope that the author brings the characters back for a few more stories! I've already read the series twice. I can tell it's going to take up permanent residence on my Kindle.
4	1356825600	At first I was confused about the direction the book was taking but then as soon as the action started I just had to know what happened next! I recommend this read.
5	1356739200	This was a great book and now I am reading the next in the series. This is an easy read.
4	1356739200	This was the first I'd heard of, or read anything written by Joseph Lallo, and I wasn't disappointed at all.  I don't like adding spoilers to reviews so I'm not going to here.The main character was very well written with depth and some very real traits, that allowed the reader to empathize with them in certain circumstances.  That doesn't mean there are not those times when you just want to shake them silly, because there are, and to me that added to the book.  The main characters concerns about what is taking place in her world, are very real concerns that could be placed into todays world in which we live.Will I read the follow on novels from this? Absolutely,  I would also highly recommend it to anyone that likes this genre.
5	1356652800	I loved this series and highly recommend it to others! Great plot and overall just wonderful! I hope to see more books from this author!
4	1356652800	The book kept my interest the whole time.  Now I just need to purchase the next one.  A good freebie on my android kindle to get me hooked!
5	1356652800	Excellent story line, very imaginative fast-paced fantasy.  Lallo's colorfully depicted surroundings make you feel as if you are there.  The characters are fully developed and worthy of attention.
4	1356566400	Price was right:) free, the next 3 in the series are minimally priced. Storyline is a bit silly, could have been more original
3	1356393600	Well written, however nothing great . Just an OK read. I would read another book by the same author. 3 star
5	1356307200	I could not put this book down!  It was a terrific read that had me from the beginning.  I am definitely going to continue with this series.  It had great fantasy themes that worked quite well in this story.  I am excited to see where it goes from here!
5	1356307200	This is book is amazing, the descriptive words and &#34;epic&#34; story! I can't stop reading. It reminds me; more or less of the Hunger Games. It's plot and setting really place you in  this &#34;fictional-masterpiece&#34;! And since it's on an electronic, I tend to read it more.
4	1356220800	The Book of Deacon is a good read, that I found myself looking forward to each evening. There are some twist, but mostly this trilogy is good classic fantasy. I would recommend this series.
4	1356220800	The thing about most new epic fantasy stories (multi-book stories) is that you really want to have some idea rather quickly about where the story is taking you, because you're facing the uphill side of three books.  I usually push through a slow book hoping for better things to come, but every once in a while I'll give up before I've invested too much time in a book and move on to the next book on my reading list.  This book was starting to look like one I was going to have to give up on because it just didn't seem to be going anywhere.  I'll avoid spoilers so to keep the review vague enough to relate what I'm talking about you'll just have to trust me on this.  There is a point in the 1st book (this one) that you finally get the feeling that you know where the story line is heading... let me just say... at Entwell.  From that point on the story starts to move.  I like the characters but although each one has their own personality and development arc, I think they make some pretty unrealistic transitions as they &#34;develop.&#34;  Despite the criticisms, I really did enjoy the book.  I am one who goes to a movie and so that I can enjoy it I just accept some parts that are pretty far-fetched rather than let it ruin the whole story for me.  This book is like that in some ways.  As long as you can put up with a slow start and some pretty unrealistic scenarios, the good parts make it a fun read.
1	1356134400	The writing is juvenile, the characters unrefined, and the dialog unnatural. I gave the book several chances, trying to read it on my subway ride, at night before bed, and after work; yet, always had to stop reading from utter frustration at the lack of skill and execution shown in this poorly crafted affront to fantasy.You can do better. Don't waste your time.
5	1356048000	I am usually not a wizard book reader but this one was very good,had a good plot and believable characters
5	1356048000	Was a page turner. I loved the fact that there was a litlle of everything there. Can't wait to read the next one.
4	1355961600	In this first book of Deacon, the text could stand some polishing, but all in all I found it an entertaining and captivating story.
4	1355875200	I read this book, and was hooked.  Good story line.  Easy to follow all the different plots.  My only gripe was how it ended.  But I went and got the second book.
5	1355875200	This series is gripping! I'll admit, it starts a little slow, but once it starts, you're hooked! Dragons, girls with magic, malthropes, oh my! Give this a shot and you'll have dreams about magic cloaks and malthropes for days!
5	1355788800	Very well written story by an author I was unfamiliar with.  I got the first book free on my Kindle but you can bet your sweet bippy I bought the other two when I finished.  If you're interested in exploring an unbeaten path, the Book of Deacon is for you.  Be prepared to let your imagination run wild.  You won't be disappointed.
5	1355443200	While at first I was thinking that this series was shallow and predictable I soon learned that I was wrong. It is different and moves quickly but I found that entertaining and refreshing. I would recommend to fantasy readers for a good read.
4	1355270400	I purchased this as a free e-book and was very pleased with it.  Overall was a great read.  Storyline is well written and the characters were enjoyable.  I liked the magical twist that was included and the want to stop a war that has went on for way too long.
3	1355184000	Maybe 10 or more years ago likely I would have rated this higher. It's fairly compelling. I remember how all these stories are so unbelievable. But, maybe the genre has just lost its appeal to me. Will I spend money to read the sequel? Not sure. I am also dismayed by all the errors in these free ebooks. Okay to fill some 'free' time, but would think twice or more before spending money on it.
4	1355097600	I chose this rating because I enjoyed this Book.I liked the story couldn't put it down looking forward to next book.Will refer.
5	1355097600	This is the greatest story I have read by far. Not only are the characters described well, and the author makes you feel like you&#8217;re there, but the author also didn't rush anything. The books long, and there's two more just as long before you reach the end, but you won't notice. The Book of Deacon, and the rest of the trilogy will captivate you, and make you hate the fact that you're turning the last page when you get to that point, and trust me you (along with me) will be waiting for Lallo to continue the story after The Book of Deacon. If you do like this book there is a story written after it called Jade. You may like it. I found it as more of a bridge to what I hope will be his new epic trilogy or longer. No matter what happens though, No other author is ever going to even come close to this series.
3	1355011200	The beginning is great, however as the story progresses the author begins to step away from creativity and go with familiarity, the story the became predictable.
5	1354838400	At first I was apprehensive to read the book because the description was a little vague. However, it was free and the cover photo told a story of its own and I wanted to uncover it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and began to read it. At first I was a little bored by the prologue but immediately emerged into the story. I read the book within a day and bought the other two afterwards.I loved Myranda as the main character. She was a well rounded character capable of angering, annoying, and winning over the reader. She is intelligent and compassionate. I loved the other characters as well. There is a special place in my heart for Lain. He is definitely more than meets the eye and I loved how the author demonstrated that there is good within everyone. Myn is by far my most beloved character. The little dragon always managed to put a smile on my face. Lastly, Deacon is a sweetheart but at times a tad annoying. I think that the following books captured that very well.
4	1354838400	I had read reviews calling the plot over used and the editing poor however I found this book such a delightful escape from reality that i didn't have time to notice any of the like.  There were a few "oh brother" eye rolling moments but they didn't hinder my enjoyment. Even though it is 1 am and I should be sleeping I am very tempted to start reading book two! The reason for the four stars is simply that I consider classics five star works.
4	1354752000	The beginning of the book didn't pull me into the story incredibly fast, but as it progressed, I really enjoyed it. Sometimes I even wish for a bit less of intrigues because it's almost as if you are losing hope for things to be solved together with the main character. At one point, story began to slow down again and at the end I felt really disappointed for how little we know at the end of the book. But I still intend to read through all of them. My curiosity was awaken.
3	1354752000	When I say worth the price, I should mention that this was a free download. I'm undecided on whether or not it was worth the time I spent reading it on the airplane. It seems like there is a lot of potential here. The problem is that the writing is terrible and events/interactions that would make the book enjoyable are glossed over or are not well explained.This is worth downloading (for free) and keeping on hand in case you ever get caught on an airplane with nothing else to do or read.
5	1354665600	In searching for books to read I came across this first in a trilogy. I so enjoyed it that I ordered the next two.  The characters are richly developed and I found myself just eager to folow their development.  The sidebook Jade drew me to this series.  I will read this author again!
5	1354579200	I mainly read Sci Fi and history but do enjoy a well written fantasy story from time to time and the Book of Deacon is certainly one.  The characters are well developed and their motivations varied.  The pace of the story continues to pick up as you get deeper into the tale.  The story captures your interest early on and maintains it throughout.  Given that the book is free your cost is the time invested in reading it which you will find well spent.  I've just finished the story and purchased book 2 and can't wait to start on it.  If you like fantasy at all you will enjoy this story.
2	1354492800	Please read all the other 1 and 2 star reviews.In general concept, this series held some promise, and at $6 for 3 books, it's not too bad of a money suck.  However, I get the sense that this trilogy was written from a bullet-point outline that was then filled in as the author had time, often with no regard for continuity. Characters, who seem to be a collection of method actors (all motivation and minimal development), are filled with determination and passion in one sentence, and then exhausted to the point of collapse in the next. The main character successfully learns some skills and is tested in a bitter graduation event, only to become completely clueless about her skills a few pages later. New ideas seemed to be added as they occurred to the author and welded in wherever they could be made to fit in. The story, as told, has a very choppy flow and an irritating overuse of very simplistic and repetitive sentence structures, almost as if the author wasn't sure of whom he was writing for, adults or YA?And, as other reviewers have noted, the willing suspension of disbelief takes a serious beating, especially early on in the first book. It was very clear that I was reading a book, rather than pulled into a world. It gave me something to do on a very long train ride, but I will look a little more carefully at any other products from this author.
4	1354492800	I have recently been branching out from fantasy books because they tend to be the same story over and over. This book, however, was enough of a change to keep me interested. There are still some fairly predictable parts, but I found them pleasantly so rather than boring. I bought the second book so obviously I'm still invested in the story and want to know what happens next.
5	1354320000	This is my first book I got on my kindle and a first I was a bit skeptical since it was a self published book. After reading a few chapters I was hooked! Yes, there a few missing commas and a bit wordy here and there but overall, I think that its a very good book.
4	1354233600	I thought this was a good book.  The story was interesting and not so elemental that it didn't lead any where.  Now I have to get the other books.
4	1353974400	it was slow to start, but the continued build-up was there, culminating with a suspended end to Book 1, urging you to continue with Book 2 & 3.
4	1353888000	I enjoyed this book. I especially loved Myranda and Myn's relationship. Leo/Lain keeps me guessing and like Myranda he frustrates me to no end. I still can't help liking him though. This is a gray set up novel for the series.
5	1353888000	I really enjoyed this book.  It kept me turning pages.  Everytime you think you have learned it all hang on.  Must buy the sequels.
4	1353801600	This was a good read! It had good characters and an exciting story. I'm looking forward to the next book (Convergence)
5	1353628800	I enjoyed this book greatly. That I got to read it for free on my kindle is just gravy. Keep up the good work Mr. Lallo
5	1353628800	It was fantastic! Kept me reading through the night! I cannot wait to read the next one. Give it a read, you won't be sorry.
5	1353542400	Ate through these books like the worm I am for a good magical story. Progress was slow, but most definitely steady.
4	1353456000	Other than a slow spot in the middle this is as good a majical fantasy tale as I've read.  I'll. Almost certainly read the sequel.
5	1353456000	The book read very well, I did not find any of the other negative comments to be appilicable.  Had a hard time putting it down. You will become involved in each of the characters and how the adventures proceed.  I am currently reading the second in the series and expect to progress to the third as well.
4	1353283200	Excellent story but had a lot  of action coming from all directions.  Found it hard to keep the action parts in order
4	1353283200	Enjoyed reading this as was sad when it ended therefore will purchase the rest of the trilogy, which I normally wouldn't do for a free book.For me, I would need to know how the trilogy ends to decide whether it deserves a 5!
5	1353196800	I have read these books no less then five times and plan to do so several more times.  There is so much detail and depth to the characters.  I would love a book on Entwell.  And a prequel to the Myranda story.
5	1353196800	The story has lot of plots and leaving you wanting to pick up the next book. I really enjoyed all the twist with the main characters.
5	1353196800	I love Robert Jordon's books, The Wheel of Time series. This is the closest I have found to his writings that I like. I cannot wait to get the other two books- I wish the series was longer!! (longer as in more than a trilogy) :-) Thank you for a most excellent read!
4	1353110400	I wanted to love this book, but something was missing and that something was a driving force to move the plot forward to keep me reading all night. I often found myself wondering where this story was going. I love a lengthy exposition and I rather enjoyed that the direction of the story wasn't made abundantly clear on the second page. I didn't mind that Myranda was verbally anti-war and caused herself to be tossed out of any number of towns just in time for a life-threatening blizzard. In fact, I thought her awareness of her chattiness and inability to control it made her a more believable young adult character. The story picks up when Myranda gets into trouble and is on the run while being chased by the enemy, but as soon as the chase ends, so does the plot and I'm back to wondering where the story is going. I don't need to know exactly where the author is headed; I just needed a hint of something on the distant horizon. To be fair, there are some interesting charcter conflicts and developments that occur later in the book; I just think that they were lost in the absence of a clear direction for the rest of the story and a constant focus on Myranda. That being said, the last few page concluded in dramatic and exciting fashion and even though I was a bit disappointed by the first book, I intend to read the second.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
5	1353024000	This book will be enjoyable to all ages, refreshing to read and difficult to put down. I would recommend this to everyone.
5	1352851200	Terrific allegory.  You need to read this book.  It is not just a kids book.  I work at a library and have been recommending the book to everyone.
4	1352764800	The author is a delightful storyteller. The whole ignorant,bungling and naive woman who becomes an accomplished magician is common, but the path is always interesting.I liked the random plot changes. Also, the part in entwell is a nice time of character development.Its interesting to read his theories on magic and its origin. The exams, especially the final one was filled with imagination and suspense.The title of the book lends no reference to the story, unless the story is about the path that leads her to claim the book in the last sentence of this book ;-).Once ive finished with the other books on my kindle ill read what happens to myranda and leo/lain.
4	1352764800	I enjoyed this light read. It has interesting twists and turns. It takes a new perspective on wizardry training. the high magic a bit fanciful, but interesting.
5	1352678400	Excellent story line.... i couldn't put the book down - read it in 2 days... Mages, wizards, dragons Oh My!!!
4	1352678400	The book of Deacon is as rife with wonderful originality as it is packed with cliches and over used plot devices...but it works and it works very well. The mix is just right, the pace is such that you often can't put the damn book down.Can not wait to get reading the rest of the trilogy.
3	1352592000	It did drag.A preface which info-dumps the history.Then the heroine wanders around in a frozen landscape for an unconscionably long time, not doing very much.Perhaps I'm getting jaded but there wasn't the feel of anything new here.
5	1352505600	I'm a very specific reader that has very high standards when it comes to enjoying epic fantasy novels. I like lots of magic, believable characters, little political intrigue, and little major battles. What interest me is character development that is believable and interesting. I also look for the main character to get into such a major, world altering, problem that you can't see any way they will "rid the world of an epic evil force."I'm SO impressed with the author because he has full filled almost all of my requirements in this first book. The character are very well though out and incredibly believable. The plot is NOT ladened with immense political intrigue and large complex battle scenes. There is a political plot and battle skirmishes and it's likely to be on a more epic scale in the second book I'd guess. However, these two areas don't dominate the book thankfully.The author has some similarities to my most favorite authors:Terry Brooks, David farland, James Clemens, Eldon Thompson.I simply Can't believe he's giving away his first novel! I've was so impressed that I've now written my first ever book review!
4	1352419200	The description of this book intrigued me, and I was not disappointed. It was so enthralling, I finished it in just a couple sittings. I would have given a full five stars for the content, but there were a few grammatical errors. I definitely would recommend this book. Now I am off to buy the next one in the series.
4	1352332800	Heading to buy the second and third in the Trilogy as I enjoyed the first. A welcome  change from vampire theme series and fifty shades.
5	1352332800	When are we going to see more?  Kind of left me hanging at the end....will there be more written about these characters?  I hope so!
5	1352246400	I loved this book sooooo much, it was well written a d clearly understandable as well as interesting g,demanding and fun to read, I would recommend this book to anyone that likes adventures and bibliographies. I will read the whole trilogy a 100%
5	1352160000	Excellent trilogy! I am an avid reader and it takes a lot for a book to really take hold of me and draw me in like this entire series did. I enjoyed it tremendously. I very rarely write reviews or take the time to rate something, because I'm too busy reading my next book. Honestly, this is one of the best reads I have had in years. The characters grab a hold of you and don't let go until the last page. I first chose this book because it was a good price, but after the 1st book I would have paid much more just to see where the story was going to take me. Buy this book, you will not regret it, I promise.
5	1352160000	If you like reading fantasy adventure novels I recommend this book and the two that follow it. Worth the 6$ for two well written books, and this one is FREE! If you do start this one I warn you, you will have to buy the next two weather you like it or not. You could find yourself like I have, trying to get your paws on EVERY J.Lallo book. Great writer, friendly guy, buy his books.
4	1351641600	Ordinarily, I am not a fan of fantasy novels, but I took a chance on this title.  I was into the characters pretty quickly and was able to imagine the world that that the author painted.  It's a good read and I'll probably go further with this author.
4	1351555200	I enjoyed this story very much. The characters were interesting and well-developed. The plot was unique and I enjoyed the details about the works of magic in Lallo's world. I loved the way he wove different races (elves, mermaids, malthrope, dragons, dwarves, etc...)into the story. My only criticism is that it could have been edited better, however I don't find that a drawback if the story is well written (as this one is).Paragon: The Propagation
4	1351468800	Good characters. Interesting story and sub text. Thoroughly enjoyed the setting and the way magic permeates the world. Well written. Great read.
3	1351468800	I picked this up for free on my Kindle and I thought I would like it, I just don't.  I hate being negative about books but Kindle says I'm 12% through, which should be around 30 pages and I just can't read anymore. The story seems like it could be interesting and it is written well except for some of the dialogue and internal thoughts that come off too propaganda-ish.2 Star reduction because it's just not holding my attention enough to warrant finishing. So my advice is this; if you can read through the sample, then you'll probably like the book.
1	1351382400	I absolutely love to read and am especially into "Twilight", "Hunger Games" and the like fiction reads. Thus the reason why I thought I would love The Book of Deacon. Duhhhh, was I ever wrong. I lost track after the scene changed the 100th time in about 20 pages...not to mention that the characters seemed so very fake, so I put my kindle down swearing to never pick it back up and finish "Deacon". (I have this thing about not finishing books so I picked it back up a few days later and tried again hoping my brain had rested enough for me to find something, anything that would encourage me to finish the book) After another few hours of reading, I gave it up "gladly" and deleted it from my kindle. After reading these reviews, I must be a real ignoramous because I so completely disagree... I would have rated this book a 0 if I had been able.
5	1351209600	All three books are impossible to put down! The end of each one leaves you thirsting for more. After reading these, I can't wait to read the rest of Lallo's work. Amazing read!
2	1351209600	I read a lot of fantasy genre. I also have an aversion to writing a review that is highly critical of someone's effort to create a good read ( it takes some effort to even try it ). Sometimes you get what you pay for - in this case zero. To the author, take the constructive criticism and try again ( where was your editor when you needed one? ) As regards the meanspirited criticism - be independent minded. For the rest of us - there are a lot of much better reads available.
5	1351123200	I loved this book. It was a cross between Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Great imagination and left me wanting to read the next book.On a critical note more care could have been taken on editing.Perhaps more returns to what is going on with the army chasing Myranda and Lain so the reader doesn't lose track.Overall a great read where descriptions of characters easily visualized and I felt like I was there.
4	1351123200	Enjoyed the story, but the typos wrecked my head. In fairness, I got it on a day it was offered free so my expectations were quite low but the enjoyment of a good story was spoiled somewhat by the need for a good proof-reader. Would it put me off reading the next installments? Absolutely not! I've already added them to my wishlist but I hope that they've been put through a proper spelling/syntax check process if I'm paying hard-earned cash.
5	1350950400	Enjoyed the take on mixed races and the character build=up... Not too much fluff filling the pages. I could see the forest, villages and people interacting with the main character. Nice twists to the plot that kept me interested.
4	1350864000	At times the "bad luck" of main character gets a little too unrealistic and bogs down the story but for the most part the book moves along fairly well.  This first book of the trilogy ends at a most inconvenient moment.  I understand there is more to the story but Book I ends in the middle of a scene that seems like the middle of a scene rather than a breaking point.  Clearly done for marketing Book II of the series.  If the story is good I will read Book II without the cliffhanger drawing me in.  I don't like being so blatantly baited but I will probably finish the series.  There's enough mystery to hold my interest and overcome my dislike of the marketing tactics.
5	1350864000	I absolutely loved this fast paced book.  From the beginning I was drawn into the story.  The characters both "good" and "bad" are not perfect, they each have their own flaws.  The twists of the book are constant, yet Mr. Lallo is able to put them in without losing the storyline.  I first got this book because it was a free download on Amazon.com so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I am very glad that I took the chance and will be purchasing the second and third book in the series.  I can't wait to continue the adventure.
5	1350864000	I picked up this book because it was free and I like fantasy.  What a wonderful discovery this was.  I could not put it down.  I was only sorry to finish it.  But I quickly purchased the second volume immediately after finishing the first.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction.
5	1350604800	The Book Deacon was offered free and loving sci/fi and fantasy "bought" it and subsequently bought the two remaining books in the trilogy for $2.99 each.  They're a bargain.  The book starts slowly, for me, as it introduces the characters and sets the background and storyline for all of the following action.  OK, I really bought into and liked the characters so that I had to find out what happens to them.  I don't want to spoil what happens, but a creative blend of magic and action entails as the adventures unfold.  The bad guys are bad and appear to  be unbeatable.  I really cared about the characters.  Recommend strongly buying.
5	1350604800	Okay.  This is my first review ever, but I feel so strongly about the series that I feel an overwhelming need to share my thoughts.  I consider myself "one of the lucky ones"  because I began the journey with "The Book of Deacon" very early on.  There were very few reviews on it at the time, but I had my brand new Kindle in my hot little hands and it was a free fantasy book just begging me to read it from cover to cover.  When I finished I couldn't believe that I had been so lucky to read such a great story for free! Imagine my utter disbelief when I immediately went to purchase the second book and it too was free! And at the time, so was the final installment!  To be honestly truthful, I felt a little bit like a thief because I had gotten soooo much entertainment and joy out of these books that Mr. Lallo had so creatively written and given him nothing in return.  I still think that the price of the following installments is too low for what this great epic is worth!So Mr. Lallo, I humbly give you in return, my very first review.  I know, I know, it pales in comparison to the hours of fantastic reading that you gave to me, but I can honestly tell you that you have a fan for life.  I will pay, GLADLY, for future books that I hope you write....very quickly pleaseeeee!......because you are definitely an author to watch!For those of you wondering whether you should read "The Book of Deacon".....what are you waiting for?  Get it while it is free because believe me, it shouldn't be free!  It is a great epic fantasy that will appeal to a wide variety of readers and leaves you frantically searching Amazon to buy the next book in the series!  Thank you Mr. Lallo!  Keep writing!P.S.  To all of the negative people out there who think all five star reviews (especially if it is the only review a person has written) have to come from the author's family and friends, believe me when I say I am neither.  I am just a lucky reader, from a small town in Alabama, who stumbled onto this book by chance.  Happy reading!
5	1350172800	For a reading class, we were challenged to find a free book that fit our interests. It could be in any form so I set of to find something on my kindle fire. This caught my eye, but I did not expect much. This book has easily cracked my top five, and I read a lot of books. Miranda is such a strong female leader that you cant help but fall in love with her. The book is writen so descriptively that the words were like liquid along the pages. The ending basically forced me to buy the next book! It is not to heavy on the magic, so no real Harry Potter feel makes you dislike it.You will NOTbe disapointed.
4	1350086400	I can appreciate the war theme.  I found this book inventive, exciting and a fun book to read.  I will keep my eye out for the next book in this series.
5	1349654400	The book was interesting to me.  I love the main character and how other characters are brought into the story and take shape.  I have just finished the 2nd in the series and will start on the 3rd tonight.  It is rare that I read a complete series back to back and even rarer that I read fantasy.  This author keeps me coming back for more.
5	1349654400	I decided to read this book because of the reviews & I can see why it got such great reviews.  I love this book.  When I read, I do so for entertainment & don't want to have to decipher the book while I read.  This book is a great combination of fantasy & adventure.  I bought the 2nd & 3rd books before I finished the 1st because I liked it that much.
5	1349481600	What a great read. My imagination being what it is made this book spectacular, but to those of you whose imagination is sub par, you will have no problem enjoying this book. Mr Lallo left nothing out. You can smell, taste, feel, see, and hear this book as you read. If you're into fantasy this is a must read. I've read the whole trilogy and am very pleased. The same dedication went into ever book. Can't wait to read more of Mr. Lallo's work.
2	1349481600	After reading the reviews, I had expected this to be fast paced, exciting, and just all around better than it was.  While I finished it, there were stretches when I contemplated just deleting it from my kindle.  I will not be seeking out any other books in this series.  I think that the premise and story were good, and it was free.
5	1349481600	This is an excellent example of myth and magic story telling.  Ordinarily I steer clear of this genre, however the book description and the price (free) piqued my interest and so I gave it a chance.  I was very much surprised to find myself quickly immersed in Myranda's adventure in a land filled with all types of magic and strange creatures.  I was especially captivated and charmed by Myranda's constant companion and protector, the little dragon Myn.  If you are like me this description probably has you rolling your eyes, but if, like me you enjoy a good story and are willing to suspend your skepticism for a brief moment and give this book a chance, I think you will be rewarded.  I plan on purchasing the rest of the trilogy to see how the tale concludes.
5	1349395200	These books were short but there is not much filler. The story is easy to get into and there are some really awesome twists.
4	1349308800	I selected up this book on impulse when looking for a new book to read.  After I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  And when I finished it, I immediately downloaded books 2 and 3 in the series, and read them as well.  I wish the author had included a map so I could have followed Myranda's journeys in these books, but the story itself is engaging and full of memorable characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story from start to finish.
1	1349222400	I downloaded this anxious to try it after seeing that it had an average rating of 4.5 stars. I always try not to look at reviews before I read a book. I just want an assurance that other people did enjoy it. But about half way through this book I gave up. I can't believe all the gushing reviews for this book! The plot was a meandering collection of events that had no apparent meaning. The heroine is chased endlessly for a reason that is never revealed. The reader is forced into endless exposition of magic and wizardry at the half way point slowing everything down and inducing sleep. I really had no idea what it was all about and I quit caring. The somewhat interesting beginning was just wasted by a lack of coherent development of the story.
3	1348963200	The author seems to be another of those who attended the "how to be an indie author" seminar which recommends a free first volume that is little more than an extended advertisement for the paid series. OK, like I've said before, that seems like a very expensive form of advertising but to each their own.I liked the story and semi-constructed world that is put together. Like others, I found Myranda (any correlation to Feist's Miranda perchance?) to be less than a believable character, or incredibly stupid for all that she is a magical prodigy. Lain is in the same mold, as his character morphs from interesting-witty into a sullen-brooding one without credible reasons. When a reader can't understand why characters are behaving in such a stupid fashion, in effect begging for the consequences of the next scene, they tend to disengage from the story. Compare that to a good writer, who has competent characters making mistakes for good reasons, or as part of a development cycle. They don't make the same mistakes over and over, but are overtaken by events.There were still a number of editing errors, more of the "sparring vs. sparing" type than misspellings. The text has been spell-checked, but the author and editors are still skipping a word-by-word review. It wasn't as bad as some I've seen, but the story deserves better. I'd read the follow-ons, but they aren't highly placed within my "to-buy" list.
5	1348531200	I LOVED the book. I just started the 2nd book, & will order the 3rd as soon as I can. I hope Mr Lallo writes quickly, so I can enjoy all of his future books. I will also look for other books that he has written. Thanx, for some wonderful reading.
2	1348444800	This book had a great start. I really enjoyed Entwell and learning about Lain and Myranda, but I lost interest as soon as the chosen thing was introduced. At the time of this review, I have read the complete trilogy...find something else to read.
4	1348444800	First thing is the price (free)and for a free ebook, it is more than worth your time in reading it.It is a simple but captivating tale that relies upon the tried and true fantasy formula used by many fantasy authors.Though frustrating at times as the heroine learns to control her powers, this becomes simplistic and repetitive.Otherwise a relaxing Saturday afternoon read.
3	1348358400	The book started great. But ended with to much about how great Myranda is, how fast Myranda learns, how strongs she is, how fast she is. on and on and on.
4	1348185600	This is a good start to a series, and though the story line feels a bit awkward at points it's not distracting enough to make it bad.  I enjoyed the characters in the book, and they stayed true to themselves for most of the story.  Definitely a lot more positives than negatives, a good read.
4	1348185600	I like most witch stories.Not love stories.It is worth your money.I have yet found a author that after reading there book would buy another. But like I said I read it,and finished it.!!!!!!!!!
4	1348099200	I happened upon this book while browsing for a fantasy title and came across this book.  It has good reviews, has a good length and is free.  "Well, how can I lose?" I thought to myself.The book of Deacon is the story of a girl struggling against the brutal results of a war that has gone on for so long that the general population has even forgotten why it even started in the first place.  It starts an almost bitter tale of her struggle for simple survival when she accidentally becomes a part of something much larger than herself.  I must say I enjoyed the novel, and am glad I downloaded it.It starts as a low fantasy world, but the level of fantasy elements slowly builds through the novels, the cast of the book is largely interesting and it had me reading for longer periods than I intended, keeping me up far too late some nights.If this book has a major flaw it is the need of a good editor.  Sometimes things can get a bit muddled and the pacing of the chapters could use some work.  That said, I did enjoy this book enough to buy the second and third novels in the trilogy, so take a chance get the Book of Deacon and enjoy.
3	1348012800	The books have great potential. The world and the magic system was interesting.My biggest concern was with the detail and development.  For example, the relationships of the characters seemed to jump from friends to supposedly madly in love when there we're no signs nor were they reinforced later in the storyline. Partly because of this, it is hard to relate to the characters.  When they get hurt, the reader doesnt feel it.  When characters die, i dont feel the loss either.  Sometimes there would also be too much detail on insignificant things like the different horrific creatures the bad guys create.  I would suggest adding more progressing hints on each character's motivations, emotions, and relationships.  For example, maybe more background on ether watching lain suffer through the world that hates him and her furious and indignant at the humans' Treatment of him instead of improving herself before she is summoned.  Or with myranda and deacon, myranda admires how deacon looks, some unintentional physical touching and blushing and being grateful for each other's presence and how both would have the other foremost in their minds.  I really thought myranda and lain would fall in love from how they interacted, got mad at each other, considered each other, and how much time, in tentional and unintentional, they spent with each other.  Speaking of lain, his personality changes were pretty confusing. One second he has one, the next, a different one, and ends with none.I agree with another reader that a good editor would definitely improve the books.
4	1347926400	I will willingly admit I downloaded this book for free. This is the type of tight, well-written fiction I love for my students to read. I especially like that the lead character is a strong woman who does not make excuses or expect a man to rescue her.I often read books for review and put them down after one or two chapters, or read the minimum of four required for the review. I read this book to the very end. I highly urge all ages to read The Book of Deacon.I had one complaint, Deacon did not enter the book until half way through the book.
5	1347667200	Having picked up this book as a freebie off of Amazon I wasn't sure what to expect. The reviews seemed quite mixed about it, though I admit I rarely look at or read reviews before plunging into a book as I was my opinion of it to remain unbiased.The book follows Myranda, a young woman who struggles to survive in the frozen North in a country that has been stuck in a decades long war. As a sympathizer she is shunned from most villages she comes across and leads a mostly nomadic life, moving from one town to the next stopping long enough to rest and regain supplies before continuing her constant walking. I liked that fact that she often talked to herself while traveling to help distract from the biting cold, hunger and great distances that she need to reach the next village. The history of the world she lives in is well described and makes you wonder at times how she has survived all this time.The introduction of new characters flowed well for the most part. When she meets Leo, a Malthrope which is a half man half beast (in this case a fox), the initial exchange between the two of them is interesting. Sharing a bottle of wine they both explain how they got to where they are now, taking turns asking questions then waiting for the other to answer then ask their own question.Myranda's reaction to his species is exactly what I would expect, there was shock but not enough for her to change her mind about him keeping her company. Their quick friendship had me wondering just what the future had in store for them, especially when they went their separate ways shortly after leaving the village.As she moves on through the world, carrying a sword that would change her life forever, a number of other characters are introduced and thrust Myranda into many new situations. The appearance of dragons was honestly something I hadn't expected to see in this book and at first I was worried that it might ruin everything that had been laid out so far. However as the story progressed I saw the importance of the dragon as it affected not only Myranda's life but Leo's and several others around her.There seemed to be a few characters that were thrust into the story with little reason at first. Eventually they were revealed as important to the story line and some were directly linked to Myranda's life and past. What they added to the story will hopefully be of greater significance in the two other books in the series. One character I did highly enjoy was Deacon. His enthusiasm over the small secluded world that he lives and trains in was a great addition to the book. Though I saw early on that there would be some sort of relationship between Deacon and Myranda forming I was glad to see that was not rushed into, in fact it was left up in the air at the end of the book as Myranda left the secluded life to find Leo once more.When she starts to undergo training of the various elements of magic everything suddenly feels rushed. After completing training with the four element masters she must then be given a final test. I enjoyed this part of the book not because of the use of her newly found powers but in the way she was able to outwit Azriel, the woman conducting the final test, at her own game. The end result of the test surprised me.One small problem I did have with the book was the lack of chapter breaks. I am not sure if it was strictly because of the Kindle edition but it was a bit odd to have no chapters within it. Usually I use chapters as a stopping place while reading. While I rarely wanted to put the book down I found it hard to pick a spot to take my reading break from.While there were slow parts popping up here and there the overall flow of the book was good in the first half. However I found near the end that things seemed a bit rushed, especially when she was undergoing her training with the masters. Not only did the flow seem to speed up too much I also had a problem with Myranda being so good at each aspect of magic which she was trained in. No one should be that good that quickly in so many different aspects. Then all that training seems to go to waste as she leaves the hidden away village to chase after Leo. Hopefully the next two books will explain not only why she seems to be such an expect with magic but also give her reason to having this power as well. The rushed end aside I am looking forward to seeing where this story leads in the next two books.
2	1347580800	I love fantasy dont get me wrong but this book bores me so much. I cant pronouce any name. Story confuses the heck out of me and its just boring.
5	1347148800	downloaded over 400 free books to find a few authors like Lallo.  this rates in the top 5 %.  really liked this one for its character and setting development.  a new basis for magical action is excellent but a little uneven. recommend highly
5	1346976000	I read my first Joseph Lallo book through the StoryBundle website and can't get enough of his books.  Bypass Gemini and Unstable Prototypes are must reads for science fiction fans.  The depth of his character development is impressive.  The Book of Deacon go out and buy the other two books in the series.  I hope he finds time to keep writing!
5	1346889600	I started to read The Book of Deacon because it was a free book for my Kindle. I was hooked after the first few pages; if you are a fantasy fan who loves magic, this is the book for you. If you are a person who loves to be hooked by mystery, this is the book for you. With in the first few pages you have more questions than answers and you have to continue to find out the answers....I hope this helped you decide to read the book, I know it will be worth your time.
4	1346889600	This is quite a good book, but I don't like the existence of animal-human-halfbreeds in stories (there is a half-fox-half-human character). Really not. Despite of this fact, I finished the book and rate it well - because it is.
5	1346544000	I have never been much of a fan of Fantasy, but after reading just a few pages in this book I could not put it down.  This is a great story written by a very talented author.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy as well as other books by this author.
2	1345766400	This book sounded like a great read according to the reviews, but they were quickly proven wrong.  The book started like the writer didn't even know where the book was heading.  It is just one odd happening at a time, that never seems to get anywhere until half way through.  Then the author makes this intelligent strong woman a complete idiot that can't do anything on her own.  Suddenly this woman seems to not ask herself questions that are so obvious it makes you nearly give up at the sad attempt of the author to draw out a book already drawn out to the point of ridiculous. All in all, character development is bad, story line is not existent.  The book is just wandering around blindly with no direction.  The author seems to assume that all readers of the book are ignorant and mindless.  The only reason I give the book 2 stars is that the writer is truly talented at writing.  Please look at other books, I would recommend something in the Trudi Canavan trilogies if you want something similar only good.
5	1345420800	definitely a good read. I find it extremely difficult to put the book down. I will definitely be buying the next 2, and checking out any more books this author writes.
5	1345420800	This story kept me enthralled right up until the end...then I immediately purchased book two.  I often wondered where the story was headed and was always pleasantly surprised.  I would definitely suggest this book--I hope book two reads as well.  We will see.
4	1345334400	The main character, Myranda, begins the story as an orphan in a war-torn land, leading a miserable life, literally on her way to starving and freezing to death.  Stumbling across a dead body who she ransacks for food, a tent, and a magical jeweled sword, she believes she can sell the sword and change her whole life for the better.  She gets her change,  but what a surprise for her!  Things only get worse.  On her way, she picks up a traveling companion who is not what he seems.  This is a good read, full of magic and mystery.  Myranda's passions for justice and her desire to end the war don't seem to affect everyone the way they do her.  I enjoyed reading this.
1	1345161600	I tried to like this book. I got about 6% into it before putting it down in favor of something else. I came back to it and made it to about 30% before quitting again. It's just a boring book. The main character is generic and uninteresting. I can't comment on the plot because I'm fairly certain there isn't one and the pacing of the book makes me wonder if I'll ever find one. I didn't expect much from a free book but I was still somehow completely underwhelmed.
4	1344816000	It would be a much better book if there was some proofreading going on. This book otherwise was great! Pretty typical but a good read. Good enough that in spite of the reviews I will give at least the first of the sequels a chance.
4	1344816000	I read the trilogy, and I thought they were good books. If you are looking for an easy read with an engaging plot, then I would recommend these books. However, I never would have started reading the books if the first one wasn't free.
5	1344297600	I really, really, really love this book. I got it on my Kindle, but my kindle was stolen and i never got to finish it. Now i have a Pandigital Supernova and Barnes and Nobel had it digital for free like Amazon. So of course, i got it. After i lost my kindle my friend convinced me into joining the World of Warcraft world. I did, and i'm now a level 49 blood elf. Just yesterday i got my Pandigital and downloaded The book of Deacon. It was really hard to read without thinking.."omg, Alliance? That reminds me so much of WoW..." I literally kept thinking.."Lol, that's so much like WoW..." I still loved it tho. Can't wait to get into the next one. So yeah, it's a good read, but you'll always wonder if the author played a lot of WoW...xD
5	1344211200	I originally downloaded this book because it was free and sounded interesting. I was skeptical about it at first because sometimes things are free for a reason. (Because they aren't good.) But the first few pages really got my attention. It was super long but really good. Detailed and many twists. Once I got to the end I immediately looked up the next two books and am very excited to begin reading them. I would recommend this book to a friend that loves adventure, magic, and a little mystery. So buy it and enjoy.
3	1344211200	So first off don't let the title of this book scare you away. It's a fantasy novel with no religious underpinnings.So the plot and storytelling style were pretty good in this one. It isn't Dragonlance by any means but it's decent. The story is interesting enough as are the rules of magic, but it's missing something; and that's other real characters.In this book there were probably only 3 characters who had any meaning...this seems like too little for a fantasy novel. On top of that the main character is a very annoying "goody goody" treehugger type of person. Myself as a reader cannot empathize with such a character. Sure, maybe she will mature a bit more as the story goes on, but for now she is a turd of a person who just so happens to have an uncanny magical talent.For a free book this was definitely worth the read, but I don't know if I'll be compelled enough to purchase the other 2 books in the series. You have to have a much stronger main character who makes better life choices.
4	1344211200	We bought this for our 2006 Honda civic coupe. We bought it from Costco.com just in case we needed to return it because of fit. I decided on this one because someone else mentioned in a review that it fit for their civic coupe rear facing. I didn't want to get my hopes up but it actually fits better than our infant carrier. Installing it with latch was also super easy and the shoulder straps also adjust so easily.One big problem folks might have is if you want to put three car seats together in the back, this will definitely not fit in a compact car because of the width but the height is definitely good.Some things for clarification that I had to find after a lot of digging: the headrest is easily adjustable but you can only use it for rearfacing on the two lowest settings and your child's head has to be at least 1 inch from the top. If you are worried about your child growing out of it too soon, to to the store and have your baby try it out.The back middle seat is the safest place to install car seats BUT in order to use latch there, it must have dedicated latch or it must actually say in the owner's manual that you can "borrow" the latch from the other seats. Unfortunately, apparently most cars will make you use the seat belt installation and it seems that not a lot of people know this. Civics do not have latch in the middle AND they do NOT allow borrowing.I am so happy this actually fit and it is so easy to install.
5	1343692800	*NO SPOILERS in this short review.While looking for a new fantasy story, I read the summary for this one. It sounded pretty epic....  war, wizardry, magic.  And I loved that the main character was a young female. So I gave it a shot and was not disappointed. The characters were diverse and fun, the world they live in is complex and believable, there were some unexpected plot twists... and I was especially surprised (and fell in love with) Min. She's a treat I was not expecting.I do recall some editing/grammar errors but it wasn't enough to detract from the story really. However, they were noticeable and for some people that can be a big pet peeve.All that being said, I'm looking forward to the next book in the series and learning what adventure awaits  Myranda.
5	1343520000	I am a big fan of fantasy novels and I enjoyed reading 'The Book of Deacon' so much that I immediately  down loaded the second book in the series.
4	1343260800	While the book is a bit wordy, and takes a bit of time to get to the point, when it does, you can't put it down.  In fact, I was so enamored with it that after I read it, I bought the other two as well.  I read those quickly, and couldn't put them down, either. I think the author really needs to give us some more adventures with these characters.  With all that magic going on, who knows what could happen?
5	1343174400	I have not enjoyed a great book in such a long time and I enjoyed reading this book. I had to force myself to put it down so that I can eat and sleep as the character Deacon having issues sleeping and eating trying to read or write.  The liked the way that Joseph Lallo's detailed descriptions of story and the characters giving the reader the full imagination as if you were right there with the characters in the book.  It kept me intrigued as I just finished the 2nd book The Great Convergence, and can't wait to read the 3rd book The Battle of Verril.
5	1343088000	I love to read and was surprised and wonderfully intranced in the story. It was the first book that made the me want to tell author what a great job he did. Amazing story line. Don't worried I've already bought be next two and can't wait to start.
5	1343088000	this is a great book that is full of twists and turns. I got a clear picture of the world and the characters as seen through Myranda's eyes. I was up 6 hours past my bed time reading this book! Consider your self warned.
3	1342569600	For the most part, it was a good book. But at the end thay had the stupid feamail going after the jurd instead of the man that would treat her well.
5	1342051200	I really enjoyed the whole series. Although my sleep.housework and laundry suffered horribly. You wont regret getting this book. Just take a nap first!
3	1341964800	The story was drawn out and at times boring.  The story line was confusing, to where I needed to go back to make sure I understood the plot.  Big let down at the end.  I do not want to read the other books of this series.  It was free so it really doesn't matter....
5	1341792000	This book keeps your interest as you want to know the ending. I am ready to read book 2. I have enjoyed the main character and her development. Her interaction with other characters is very well done.
4	1341705600	I think I had some trouble getting though the first 50 pages or so of this BUT it immediately picked up after and ended up being quite a good read. I recommend this to anyone who just wants a good story to read. The characters are great and very fun. The beginning is a bit slow but it turns out better than I thought it would have.
4	1341360000	Myranda's story is interesting, intelligent, and has characters to care about. There are some twists you won't expect, and the world-building is fairly complex and comprehensive. I didn't give four stars because the author has a bit of a tendency to tell you something rather than showing you, and it's always hard for me when a character is as perfect as Myranda. She's kind, generous, thoughtful, and can do everything better than anyone else. Fortunately there's a reason why she does everything better, but...while I don't like reading about characters who are jerks, leaving someone room to grow is good. Still, this is a fun read, more complex than you expect, and definitely worth picking up!
5	1341100800	I was tempted by the brief description of the book (and the price of $0.00 certainly made it worthwhile to download the book and see if it lived up to its teaser).  By the time I was 2% into the book, I was hooked.  I really can't say that for most books.  Great fantasy.  I really enjoyed the the heroine and the character who I assume will turn out to be the reluctant hero in the 2nd book of the trilogy.  I feel the author did a good job of inventing interesting characters and developing plot twists.  I have already bought the next 2 books and can't wait to start on book 2 -- in the morning.My only complaint is related to proofreading and editing.  What has happened to typo-free books?  E-books just don't seem to have the same quality of proofreading that paper books do.  It's as if the only editing being done is spell check by computer since all the misused words are spelled correctly even if used improperly.
5	1340236800	I am not going into all of the details the other book reviews have on this.  I just want to say, that this was a fantastic read, and immediately after I read the first book (which was available to be downloaded for free through Amazon) I purchased the next two books in the series.  Very entertaining and every time I took a break away from reading, I wanted to pick the book back up right away to read more.
5	1340064000	I loved reading these books, especially since I haven't read in a while.  I am glad that I chose to start here.  I couldn't put these books down when I started reading them.  I appreciated how the writer described magic and the struggles our heroes had to face.  Reading these books started off my Imagination again and now I have over a hundred books on my iPad.  Great job!
4	1339632000	After a long bout of really bad self-published (and professionally published!) fantasy novels, I was skeptic of this one to start. Not so by twenty pages in. This novel has lots of great elements, well-developed and engaging characters, and several very good sub-plots and a great foundational storyline. It does have its severe drawbacks, but if you're willing to overlook those (even the big ones) in hopes that all will be revealed in final two books, this is an engaging and compelling tale that will keep you interested from cover to cover.First, the good stuff (and there's a lot of it that I'm paring down for space and brevity):- Love the plot! It's a great mix of war, wizardry, sympathetic situations, protagonistic, and hateful characters, mystery, and nuance that work very well together. Lots of twists and turns that you don't see coming, which SUCH a nice change from the usual fantasy novel formulas.- The characters, especially Myranda and Lain, are very well written. They are believable and very easy with which to identify and sympathize. The progress of their individual characters' growth and maturation is great. Myn is hysterical and adds much-needed levity to Myranda's occasionally too-dour moods.- Myranda's character in particular is extremely well-developed. Her intentions are very clear, and only rarely does she behave in ways that are uncharacteristic without having some kind of major change or motivation to provoke the unusual behavior. The author does a great job of expressing her varying emotional states without too much repetition, nor does he spend much time dwelling solely on her inner monologues without pairing them with some kind of action or scenic element with which she can interact calmly.- There are many "action sequences" - fights, chases, etc. All are great. The pace is quick and descriptive. You really get the sense of the fury and fear and adrenaline. Good descriptors without being repetitive.- The various scenes are wonderfully descriptive without being Charles-Dickens-overly-descriptive, and very much come alive with small little injections from the author as each scene unfolds.- The treatment of magic and magical elements is great. It does get a little technical, but the author makes sure to always have those "re-phrasing" dialogues where the technical stuff is broken down and clarified without the reader having to go back and re-read passages multiple times to figure out what is meant. Love the different attitudes and personalities the author has created for each character regarding their magic and aptitude.**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**The not-so-good:- At no point are we ever told WHY Myranda is singled out by the Alliance Army because of the sword. That's the crux of the entire plot and we're never once told WHY the sword left a mark on her, nor why the Alliance is so desperate to get their hands on her. The reason for everything that comes after those first pages when she finds the sword relies on understanding WHY the sword is important, what it's magic is, and why the Alliance wants it. We're never told that. I kept reading hoping it would be explained in one of the Alliance General's conversations, but it never was. Nor are we told HOW they (and the rest of the world) suddenly just seem to know that she's touched the sword and is a wanted criminal. This is a HUGE FAILING on the author's part to make sure the plot is consistent. It really unravels 90% of the great work done developing the rest of the storyline.- Myranda's virulent anti-violence attitude is understandable given the history of the war on her family, but it makes no sense that she won't even carry a knife or a bow or any kind of hunting or basic defense weapon. In a country where lawlessness can instantly come in the form a sympathizer-lynching mob or cloak-wearing ghostly death-bringing soldiers, it's a major character flaw, and downright stupid for an intelligent character, to not carry some kind of defense weapon. She doesn't have to like using it, but it's too far of a stretch for us to believe she's survived that many years as a nomad without having to resort to violent self-defense once in a while. Additionally, anyone wandering and begging for food would want some kind of knife or at least a sling for a rock to use as a hunting tool when food may be available for the kill. Anti-violence does not mean anti-food, and we're never told that Myranda avoids meat for any particular reason other than it's hard to come by as a beggar.-Many times there are set-ups where it seems obvious that Myranda has the perfect chance to ask questions that will yield clarifying answers for the reader and help develop the plot. But she never takes these chances. After twelve, I stopped counting how many opportunities she had to ask "what's the deal with the weird sword?" and "why did it leave a mark on my hand?" and "what did Lain do with the sword?" and "why does the Alliance want to capture me?" She never asks. It's maddening to the point of almost making me want to quit the book. Either the author forgot to answer those questions, or he thinks it's ok to string along his readers into the next installation of the trilogy. It's not ok. Some basic questions MUST be answered in a timely manner or the reader will get frustrated as the plot disintegrates for want of solid explanations. As it goes with playwrighting, if you have a gun on stage in Act I, it had better be fired by Intermission. The same goes with novels - if you have a catalyst, it had better be explained before the end of the book.- The anti-war screed in the first few pages is way too preachy. It really turned me off and I almost stopped reading. We get that she's not in favor of the war dragging on. That's well established and her reasons are well-explained. So move on. The almost three pages plus random half-pages and constant "I hate war! Violence is bad!" inserts devoted to her anti-war, anti-violence tirades and whiny laments are too much and take away from both the story and the character.- Lack of chapter breaks. It felt like this novel went on forever at times because there was no room to take a breath and re-group after a long stretch. Chapters would go a long way to help with pacing and define timeframes and shifting viewpoints. That was the most disorienting and irritating thing about the whole novel.- General Tisgorah. Is she an iron-hearted devoted general to the Alliance, or is she a little bit of a softie who really just wants the war to end? She starts out as the iron-fisted military element who will crush all rebellion and always gets what she wants, no matter the cost of lives, property, or anything else. Then suddenly she develops this little beating soft heart that makes her weary of her job and desirous of peace. In between there's no catalyst for the change. It's sort of indicated that she's suspicious of her superiors' motives and reasons for their orders, but that it never explained to satisfaction. Does she question the war itself? Does she question her superior's reasons for prolonging the war? Does she suspect the war itself is a cover-up for some other heinous business being done? It's barely hinted at, but never enough to make it a sub-plot worth grabbing the reader's attention.-Lain. As with General Tisgorah, there's no catalyst for his change from nice-guy outcast-friend of Myranda's to the hard-hearted swordplay master he becomes. They enter Entwell and suddenly he's completely different. Myranda is rightly confused, and that's a great plot element to drive the storyline and bring in more elements for the future, but the REASON for his change is never explained. Does being back in Entwell have something to do with it? And if he's such a great, and heartless, assassin, why did he let Myranda go when he had the change to kill her? He knows there's a bounty on her head and yet he rescues her time and again. He outright states that he makes his living selling secrets and killing for money, so why does he save her? He has no reason to; it would benefit him to have given her over to the Alliance at any point. This is another HUGE failing that really undoes a lot of the other motivations of his character and leaves the reader feeling a bit lost.
5	1339459200	I downloaded this book because it was one of the free ones and was pleasantly surprised. Ireally enjoyed the authors style and ability to keep the story moving while providing depth to the characters. I like it so much that I ended up buying the two books that follow this one and am almost done with the third. So happy I found an new author to add to my collection.
3	1338681600	While reading book one I was impressed. It was written in the style of Terry Brooks (one of my favorite authors). However books two and three really let me down.  The small band of Choosen seemed to go from one battle to another without adding to the plot or their characters. Another case of how to make a two book plot into a trilogy,fill it with meaningless fluff and battles.
5	1338508800	I have read many fantasy books but this was completely different. I could not stop reading once I started reading. If you like Brent Weeks or other epic fantasy authors then you'll love this book. Joseph Dallo is an amazing writer and will show you a whole new fantasy world never before seen.
4	1338422400	I would classify this as a fantasy book (not urban fantasy or paranormal romance).  It takes place on a different world where the north and south areas are at war -- and have been at war since before our heroine, Myranda, was born. Myranda doesn't support the war which makes her an outcast.  At the start of the book, she had to flee the last town she was in as she didn't display unwavering support for the war effort.  She is almost dying trying to get to the next town through the snow and cold when she stumbles upon a dead body.  The body has supplies that she can use to survive.  When she makes her way into the next town, she gets into trouble. She is eventually pursued by various factions (rebels, the army, magic people, etc).  The book concerns her escape from the people pursuing her and her learning about her destiny.I enjoyed the book a lot.  There are minor editing issues. But I enjoyed learning more about Myranda and many of the people (and animals) she gathers around her. I don't recall any sex in the books -- but there is quite a bit of violence. Thus, I don't know think the book would be appropriate for a younger audience. The only drawback to the book is that this is simply the first book in the trilogy and there are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of this book. I did enjoy this book but need to decide if I want to invest the amount of time needed to read all of the books (be aware that this book is 8,362 locations on the kindle -- the info page says that the book is 323 pages but it seems longer than that.)
5	1338422400	Everyone had a time in their life where it seems that nothing seems to go right. For Miranda it seems to happen all the time, I found The Book of Deacon wonderful read. Before I knew it I was at the end of the first book and quickly trying to find the second book in the series to quench my thirst for more.
5	1338163200	I've read a lot of free books, thanks to the Amazon Kindle store. And of all of those I've read, I've only liked a total of two. The Book of Deacon is one such book. I had not expected much (as many of the free books just haven't done it for me), but not only was it a surprisingly good read, it was a surprisingly great read.I could not put this one down. The story follows a girl, Myranda, who is wandering a world that's only known war. Myranda's wanderings lead her to a mysterious sword which permanently marks her as someone important, if prophecy can be believed. We follow Myranda's adventures through her world and into magic, which she eventually learns. Along the way, she picks up a friend who is part fox and part human, along with a baby dragon and a Master Wizard.Part one of a three-part trilogy (yes, I've already started the second book), The Book of Deacon is a edge of your seat adventure where you simply must quickly turn the page to find out what happens next. I zoomed through this story almost as quickly as I devoured the entire A Song of Ice and Fire series last summer and am looking forward to completing the entire trilogy.This book also serves as proof that there are good authors out there who are self-publishing. Sure, there's not a slick book cover and there are some minor editing problems, but none of that detracts from what's important - the story.
5	1337990400	I picked up the Book of Deacon as a freebie on Kindle and before I finished it had bought the others.  Very good work and I enjoyed getting to know and love the characters!  Can't wait to see Joseph's next work!
5	1337558400	You can't beat free, but this title is worth paying for. The mystical characters are well rounded and interesting. I'll be looking for more from this author.
3	1337212800	I liked the book. It is an easy read, and the author did a good job creating the environment and the characters.I didn't love it though. There are some situations not very well resolved, and many others are too predictable.I also didn't like that the book doesn't really finish. This is a genre problem, probably based on Lord of the rings - it had to be cut in three due to size issues. I still don't like it. A trilogy should be three books different and self contained, with elements in common. Not one book cut in three.
4	1337040000	This is a book that captivates your interest.  There is no way I won't complete this trilogy.  A fantastic fantasy/fiction story line.
5	1336953600	I couldn't put this book down. Very well written. I stayed up all night reading and into the next day.
5	1336867200	I love the old "just a nothing" to "Hero" stories.  This book doesn't disapoint in that aspect.  You will need to read the next books to get any kind of idea of what is going on though!  If you are looking for an epic read this is where you start.
5	1336608000	This book is a wonderful start to the best triology I've read in a long time.  I am a very picky reader, and the Book of Deacon had me enraptured from the very beginning.  It is so well written and brilliant.
5	1336348800	This tent held up well for 5 days of camping with my boyfriend. It rained and we stayed dry, the cool night breeze even with the rainfly on was awesome. We were both unexperienced campers so this uncomplicated tent did the job just fine. I couldn't imagine camping in anything smaller, or adding a third or fourth person to this tent. I was able to keep all the clothing, most supplies and munchies inside and have plenty of room to sleep.
5	1336262400	To say that this book was not what I expected from the reviews is an understatemant.  Like most epic fantasy, this is a coming of age tale - but that's where it's turned on it's head.  Myranda, our heroine is a pacifist who just wants the war to end.  She feels the unfortunate loss of humanity on both sides of the war, and if she could figure out any way to speed both sides to peace negotiations, she would do it.  But, she is only a girl and an outcast for not fighting on the side of the Northern Alliance.  She moves from town to town hiding her true feelings which would brand her a traitor.  After slipping up in a village she is given bad directions.  These directions don't lead her the nearest town, but into a frozen wasteland.  She has to find wood for a fire or she'll surely freeze to death, when she spies a flash of light through the blizzard in the distance.  Having no other options, she heads for that light, and what she finds there determines her fate for the rest of the book and beyond.At this point in the story we realy start rolling.  Myranda experiences adventures that mystify her and that she is ill prepared for.  She gains help from some unlikely places, a half man/half fox, the Undermine, a group fighting against the war, a white wizard who teaches her healing, a baby dragon who latches onto her and becomes her protector, a grey wizard, an Earth wizard, a water wizard, an air wizard, and fire wizard who happens to be another dragon.Because of what happened in that frozen wasteland, the Elite of the Northern Alliance has orders to capture her alive.  They have already captured everybody that came in contact with her after she left the wasteland.  So, what is so bloody important about what she found that the the North Alliance that they would go to so much trouble over one little girl and the half man/half fox (malthrope) that helped her?  The plot twists and turns like a hedge maze as we follow our heroine in her journeys through the North trying to evade capture.  And one other thing, some of the people in the Northern Alliance don't seem to be quite human.  If they're not human, what are they?  What do they have to do with a human war?  And what is their interest in Myranda?  Are they evil?All these and more will be answered in the final two books of the series - The Battle of Verrill and The Great Convergence.  While many questions weren't answered in the first book, the ending was still masterfully done.  The characterizations in this book are impressive, going out of their way to present shades of grey to each character, more like real life than most others - making them leap off the page unlike most authors.  Constantly questioning herself about the right thing to do, Myranda grows throughout the book, the more she finds out about what has happened in the world, as well as being the Mother to a Dragon.  By the end of the book she has a purpose that she would give her life for.  The other characters such as Deacon and Lain change too through their interactions with Myranda.  It is quite a big cast and some are from different races: elves, dwarves, mermaids, malthropes and dragons and yet each has a distinct personality that leaps off the page fully formed.The pacing in the book is swift - grabbing you from the very beginning and not letting go until the final words.  The transitions in the book from the characters POV to another are silky smooth, there is no jarring, no stopping, no confusion.  The ending in the book is neither too slow, nor too rushed.  It answers the earliest questions, but leaves others quite open for book 2, which is already out. (So is book 3).I would whole heartledly  recommend this book to people who like epic fantasty.  I would also recommend it to those who like books on magic - because Lallo's take on magic is a combination of historical accuracy and imagination.  I would also recommend this book to people who like to read historical war fantasy.  While there are not a lot of battles in the first book, more are coming in the Battle of Verrill.  I realy think you'll like this.  And last but not least, I recommend this book to students of human nature.  When you fight a war for decades there will always be dissenting opinions,  disillusioned soldiers, burned out high command.  At this point, you're just fighting to fight, not getting the best possible outcome for the people.  This book is a thumping good read by any definition.  Don't let the whinging from other reviews put you off.  (PICKY! PICKY! PICKY!) You can't beat the price and I promise your time won't be wasted.  Just download it and give it a chance - it's free!  I'm on to book two. I can't wait.
5	1336176000	I downloaded all 3 of these books and I thought they were wonderful! The story really got to me and I can't say it was much like anything I read. A good plot and a good set of characters that where all very different. The only only negative I could say was that sometimes the feelings of the main character seemed a little misrepresented but nothing you couldn't overlook. All in all I'm very happy I got this first book for free, it gave me the opportunity to really see a story that I haven't yet and I really enjoyed it.
4	1336003200	This Book was great.Especially if you consider the price!I can't wait to read the next one.I have never read this author but I am now a fan!
5	1335830400	Excelent writing and excelent adventure. I have enjoyed immensely this well written and really entertaining tale. A friend recommended this book to me and I must say that it surpassed my expectations. I found myself not being able to to put it down. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
5	1335657600	This book was one of my first downloads on my kindle. I chose it because it was free. This was the best freebie ever. I found the story very interesting.  Its full of all the stuff I love about si-fi.....wizards, mythical creatures, possible love connection (deacon and myranda perhaps.) I love the ending...it leaves you wanting the rest of the story(well done to the author) ive purchased the next 2 books in the series. Thanks for the free book. I hope I enjoy the next two books as well as I did the first.
5	1335657600	As a poor college student, I read A LOT of books off the kindle top 100 free list.  And I have to say, the Book of Deacon is the first book I have read that, first of all I've written a review for, and second of all that I would have paid money to own it was so good.  The book is long but not filled with descriptions of endless battles and pointless scenery-- instead focusing on character development & plot.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and will no doubt be purchasing the next two books in the series as soon as possible.
5	1335484800	I picked this up a couple of days ago as a free download and WOW, was I hooked. The author did an excellant job of developing and twisting the charecters and laid out a plot-line that was easy to believe and follow. I will definitely be getting more of his books, starting with the rest of the trilogy!
4	1335484800	The first 30% was OK. After that it got to be a page turner.An editor is needed, though. There are spots here and there where words are doubled and once, left out. I didn't notice these though until the last quarter of the book. Am trying the second now, so, as you can see, I enjoyed the fantasy thoroughly.
2	1335312000	I began reading this book with the best of intentions of loving it.  It sounded fascinating, it seemed well written, great descriptions, and then I hit the point of no return.I don't care what world you inhabit, as a young girl who has been on the run a good part of your life I just can't buy that you'd walk into a scary tavern, allow your money to be stolen, take the gifts of a stranger (including alcohol), and then invite the stranger into your room. Unless girls in this particular fantasy-setting have the amazing ability to overpower anyone who may come their way (or rape has never existed), it just would never happen. Perhaps, as the author is a man, he doesn't understand the fact that girls are taught from birth (in most societies) that you don't do that kind of stuff.  A well-traveled, despised girl would be even more suspicious and cautious.If that wasn't bad enough, just as I was getting comfortable with the story, attempting to overlook the ridiculous leaps of faith in the horrible judgement and overly simplified luck of this young girl, the stranger turns out to be a fox/beast-man?No forshadowing, no warning, no indication that in this world there were more than just humans...and suddenly, within a chapter, you are expected to accept this premise and the idea that this one particular beast is completely different from all other beasts and happened to find the perfect disguise for himself to blend in with the humans.Perhaps if the author had made mention of this earlier, or if the war that is so hated by the heroine was between humans and beasts, or if somehow she was more wary of strange "men" buying her drinks and then letting them into their room....but all this together made me put down the book.  I just couldn't take it. Too many leaps, not enough explanation.  Fantasy is one thing but you have to make the world and culture something people can relate to in some way.That being said, the writing style was very nice and had potential.  I SOOOO wanted to love this book.  I wouldn't necessarily refuse to read the author again, but perhaps after a few more books.
4	1335312000	I got this because it was free and sounded interesting enough.  I was hooked by the end of the first chapter, and by the time I was half way through, I bought the 2nd and 3rd books.  I couldn't put it down.  My lack of imagination makes it hard for me to read fantasy, but this author does a great job of making the landscape and characters come alive.  I absolutely LOVED this series.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is for the typographical errors in the Kindle edition.
2	1334966400	It was good for about 10 pages then it was more like a YA novel. just not for me.Maybe I can pick up where i left off if there is nothing else to read.
5	1334966400	This is an excellent book of fantasy. Along the lines of Terry Brooks. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire trilogy. I will not give away what is in it...but will say it full of twists and turns and an ending I was not expecting. By the time I was half way through the second book...the heroes felt very real. I was actually rooting for them as if watching the age old fight of good and evil from grand stands instead of reading about it. Some people might find some scenes a bit too wordy or redundant. If you keep reading...the story and characters come alive. Well done and nice since all 3the books were only $6!
5	1334707200	Great book! great read! Though the language is contemporary and the setting is before our time i still love it! i encourage anyone who has the time and the love for a great fantasy read,..... then do not hesitate.
4	1334707200	I don't often write reviews but I felt my voice should be heard with this series.  I know there are complaints about editing the way certain things are written but I think those are things that come with time as well as professional help.  The fact that there are diamonds in the rough like this amid all the unpublished authors makes me want to find more!I love the story.  It is captivating even it plays the rags to hero routine.  It's a neat twist to familiar story. There are some twists that are expected and twists that aren't.  It's a great easy read that makes me twitch to have my kindle in hand more than I have time for.
5	1334707200	I was very surprised on how much I loved this book because it was a free download I wasnt sure how it was going to be but I ended up loving it! I would recommend this book to everyone!! I loved it!
1	1334620800	I read "The Book of Deacon", first in a series of three, and was intrigued by the possibilities in the continuation of the story.  Sad to say the series fell apart on the first page of the second book in the series.  The heroine went from being a savvy survivor to a naive problem child who had to be saved at every turn.  I almost put the second book down but I waded on hoping things would improve.  They didn't and by the end of the third book I was only skimming the pages hoping for some relief.  The magic battle between good and evil became a battle between the humans and zombies followed by the battle with the insect creatures invading form a different dimension. This is not a series I would recommend as good science fiction or fantasy.  Don't read the first book so that you are not compelled to read the rest.  I regret purchasing the remainder of the series.  Although I would have rated the first book a three the combination of the series was one step above zero.
5	1334534400	I really enjoyed this book. I am really sad that the second and third books in the series are not free (I am too poor right now to buy books, I just read the free ones, LOL). Despite being a bit to fantastical at times (main character has too many awesome things go her way, too convenient) it was still a great read. I had a hard time putting it down. I really hope to finish the series as some point.
5	1334534400	I love it! I love the characters and how extremely wonderful they are written and how each of their nature was brought out. Each one having their own character bloom and never crossing into the other or deviating from their set demeanor. I can't wait to read the second book once I am done with the first!!!!! FIVE STARS!!!!!I Love MYN!!!!
5	1334188800	Really good book, enjoyed it enough that I told me husband(who doesn't like fiction books) all about it, and he thought they should make a movie with the plot. About to purchase the second book in the series!
4	1334016000	I purchased the Book of Deacon with pretty low expectations as it was extremely inexpensive, and I'd never heard of the author.  I was pleasantly surprised, and ended up buying the whole trilogy.  Very entertaining.  The only objection I would have is that the violence became a bit too much at some points.
5	1333843200	This was definately one of the best books I've ever read! However, there are definately some sentences or words either misplaced or mispelled. These mistakes however, are easily deciphered and then the sentence will make sense. There are also some repetitive descriptions that takes away some quality. Although, the authors website gives good reasons for all of these errors. Definitely a must read for all fantasy fans!I'd rate this book 4 1/2 (for grammer errors) but that's not possible so I give it a 5 star.
3	1333756800	I think the characters on this book are not well developed. They just don't feel real. The story feels a little forced sometimes, when a character shows up right where he/she is needed in the exact moment, it happens way too often. Other than that the book is light entertainment.
5	1333670400	Loved this book. Couldn't put it down. A few parts were predictable but I am definitely hooked. I am taken in with the characters and their stories. Could easily see this being made into a movie!Looking forward to the next book. I can't wait to read it.
4	1333152000	I actually really liked this book.  It didn't really grab my attention but I liked it so much that I got the other two because it made me really want to know what happens next.  I recommend anyone to read this and the others in the series.
5	1332979200	I have read the first and second books and I am about to start the third. I loved the first two, I can't wait to see what happens next. The writer is just amazing at telling a great story and getting you connected to the characters and hoping that everything turns out alright with them. I am so happy I decided to read this series.
3	1332979200	I was very excited about this book.  In general, I found the story and characters interesting, but I felt the plot rambled around quite a bit and then the book came to a rather abrupt ending. Took a lot of words to arrive at a pretty anticlimactic ending.
4	1332288000	I got it for free, and started to read it. I have been absorbed by it, and have bought the next two books in the series.I have read Fantasy for 42 years - I am dedicated to Fantasy, and I can tell you that this book is among the best series I have ever read. And just the thing while waiting for Rothfuss to finish his third of his first series.The outcome is far from predictable, and keeps you puzzeled, but the end of the book the Heroine to easily becomes master of too much and from the end of the book starts the downfall of the series, which started so well. I had already bought the following books but, they tired me out. There were too many battles and machines and strange killer animal like machines to last you a lifetime. In the end I just looked through the pages and felt cheated because there is no doubt this author has vivid imaginations and that he could write a wonderful fantasy, if somebody could stop him from making endless wars for to books. When the author also starts raising the dead for armies, I bale out. Come of that bad habit, who the hell told fantasy writers it is the very thing to march the dead? It is dead boring.
5	1332288000	I thought since it was a free download that I would try it out. I found that I couldn't put it down and than download the two more that fallows. Ther series really keeps your attention and I really enjoyed reading it.
3	1332288000	when i review a book it mainly base on whether i enjoyed the story, felt the characters were develop and whether i could picture the world that the author tried to create. As far as the writing style i cant say too much bc there r alot of writing styles and since i basically failed english in school i dont have much of an opinion. With that i enjoyed the story. It had alot of action and i followed the story pretty easily. In adventures i always like to imagine that im walking beside the heroine or hero so i can be a part of the action and i felt i was in this book so that for me is a plus. Now with character development was ok  but i have read better but for the start of a series it was enough to keep me reading. Now the romance that is developing in this book is so annoying and just far fetch and since i have completed the series found it to be an awful pairing. I just dont understand why in fantasy books the romances r always so forced or in some cases they really serve no purpose and in this book it certainly serve no purpose. Having read the last two in the series i would not recommend the series because it just doesnt get better but just replays itself in the action sequences, nothing shocking happens and it just becomes predictable
5	1332201600	The Book of Deacon is the first book in a trilogy that is worth reading. I love the characters that come into play, each one has distinct personalities, who I enjoyed getting to know. I happily paid for the 2nd and 3rd books after reading this one!
4	1332115200	I pick this book up on my Kindle for free.  My Kindle was given to me for my birthday.  Searched on my favorite genre and came across this title.  It is a great read and a great story so far.  I will definitely pay to finish the series.  At least I think there is a series.
5	1332115200	I got this book because it was free. I started to read it and now i can't put it down. This book is awesome! I love the way I feel for the characters. I can't wait till I can get the next 2 books and see how the story ends!
4	1332028800	For a free book this was a great way to suck you into the series. Once I started reading, it was extremely hard to put down. Very excited to read the next two books. Great read!
5	1332028800	I gave this book a try based on the good reviews from other readers. I'm so glad I did. I enjoyed it so much that before I even finished it I went and bought the other 2 books in the series to have them ready so I wouldn't have to delay moving on through the story. All 3 were wonderful. I really enjoyed the creative ways that the main characters overcame the obstacles they faced. The best thing about the books were the wonderful characters! They seem like a part of my family now and I'm going to have to go through a sense of loss now that I've finished the books. The author has hinted at maybe visiting this world again. I sure hope he does!
2	1332028800	Since this book was free, I didn't expect too much out of it, but even allowing for that, I found The Book of Deacon to be terribly mediocre at best. The writing was bland and uninspired; the protagonist started out stupid and naive, and her character devolved even further towards Mary Sue status as the book progressed; there were grammar and formatting errors; the dialogue was stilted... And there was a waitress. I'm sorry. For me, that was the last straw. Maybe it's stupid, but it's a fantasy world; it's swords and spells. It's a tavern. I could accept a serving girl, or something like that, but a waitress? Just took me right out of the story.The whole "She's a prodigy!" thing just killed it, too. It felt like the author was shouting, over and over, "MY CHARACTER IS SPECIAL, SEE HOW SPECIAL SHE IS, SHE IS SO SPECIAL" for about half the book, not to mention that everybody hates her for a stupid reason and she's totally an outcast orphan with a heart of gold, guys. It got to the point where, frankly, I felt like I might as well have been reading Twilight.If I had to describe this book succinctly, I'd say that it gave me the impression that Joseph Lallo had just read TV Tropes and decided that it would make a good novel.
5	1332028800	I've read free books before that I felt I should have been paid to read.  You know the story so I won't repeat it.  I enjoyed The Book of Deacon so much that I would gladly pay  for the next two.
3	1331942400	I liked the underlying story and the characters in this book but was disappointed with the slow pace of the plot development.  This is the story of Myranda, a pacifist and therefore an outcast, growing up in a world at Perpetual War and with blind loyalty to that war.  Myranda's chance finding of a mystical artifact makes her the most wanted person in the Northern Alliance. Major story line appears to be the ending the Perpetual War but first solving the mysterious forces driving this war.  Conclusion of book gave some hints towards who must be brought together to end the Perpetual War but I was disappointed that so little progress was made towards better clarifying the major story line direction.  Much of the book was focused on introducing Myranda and her character growth through various trials while introducing some other characters.  While the character development and introductions were interesting, the underlying slow pace of plot development was frustrating.  I was also confused by conflicts between Myranda's staunch pacifism and her actions (OK to not be a pacifist when you are angry?).  I do like the story line and I am interested in where it is going so I plan to read the next book in the series.The Book of Deacon is the first book in the Book of Deacon Trilogy.  The next 2 books,The Great Convergence (The Book of Deacon)andThe Battle of Verril (The Book of Deacon), have been e-published so trilogy can be read without delay if desired. There is also a separate short story,Jade, which is set in the same universe.No major editing or writing issues were noted. The Book of Deacon is 8,362 Kindle locations long. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. Longer books, such as books in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.UPDATE March 18, 2012:  I have finished the second book in the trilogy.  Unfortunately, I will not be finishing this series.  Details are in my separate review for the Great Convergence.  Disclosure:  There have not been any helpful or not helpful votes to this review prior to the update.
4	1331856000	I grabbed this book as a freebie because of the beautiful cover, and because I love big, fat fantasy novels. For me, the first half of the book was a little slow (three stars). I put it down and came back to it over the course of several days. The second half, however, picked up remarkably and cost me some sleep (four stars!). Once the protagonist arrived in a **no spoilers** "certain place," I was well and duly hooked.The good:gorgeous coverlikeable characterslength - I like loooong booksdramatic without being overly bleak - I'm tired of bleak dystopiasfelt fresh and original, not another dwarves, elves and hobbits hack jobThe quibbles:some spelling and grammar glitches which I hear are being fixed - I noticed them, but it didn't keep me from finishing the bookThe end result?  I bought - and greatly enjoyed - the second book.Edit: updating to 4 stars as Amazon apparently considers 3 to be negative.
4	1331769600	Started out slow but as I got deeper into the story it improved.  It now has my full attention and I plan to read the sequels.
5	1331769600	The Book of Deacon is the first book that I downloaded after downloading the kindle app. Actually, reading the blurb is what led me to do it in the first place, and I am so glad that I did. I am hooked on this story and can't wait to read more of this series (although it will have to wait until I finish the other books I downloaded). It's a real page turner that kept my interest from start to finish. I loved Myranda. The book is very well written. I cannot think of anything negatice to say about it. I highly recommend it.
5	1331596800	When I first got this book, I was randomly choosing free or .99 books just to read when I didn't have anything better to do. I decided to read this one first, and I could not put it down. Then I bought the last two books because I couldn't wait to read them. I almost gave it less than 5 stars because of all the sleep I missed from not being able to quit reading for the night! This series, for me, is what a trilogy should be. They take you on an adventure that is well timed and intriguing. The first book introduces you to the story, the second book brings you through the process, and the whole third book brings you through the ending. There have been so many books that were disappointing because they take you through the story well but end so quickly you feel cheated (Eragon, ehem). That was not the case with these books. I thoroughly enjoyed them and am looking forward to more books set in this world from this author. Good job.
5	1331596800	Had a good time reading could not put it down this is one I will read agin and agin And I'm looking forward to the next book
5	1331164800	I was drawn to this book by the cover and price(free isalways nice) I was pleasently surprised with this book, it took me no time to get fully lost within it.  I couldn't put it down I had to finish it. Now that I have read the trilogy I wish the books were available In book form so I can keep them and reread them often. I think the subtle hints of good quality's within the "bad" guys and the bad behavior of some od the "good" guys just makes you want to know more about each character, the author strogly deliver.  Defenitly one of my top 25 book series and I read a ton so that's is saying a lot.
3	1331164800	While I enjoyed this book and may eventually pick up the next one, there were enough problems to keep me from truly getting hooked. In particular, the characters' motivations weren't always clear, and they were often clumsily characterized. The dialog often felt stilted, and I found that I often enjoyed myself more when the characters weren't talking!Pros:* Likable, if flat, characters* Interesting magic system* World I want to explore more* I want to know what happens next!Cons:* Lacking solid character motivations and development* Editing problems* Inconsistent pacingOverall, I'd recommend this book if you can overlook what I listed as the cons, because the pros are definitely there under all the problems.
5	1331078400	I picked this book up for free on my Kindle. I've read hundreds if not thousands of books in the sci-fi and fantasy genre and after finishing it I bought the other 2 books in the series and just bought 2 more books by Joseph Lallo as well. While there are a few fairly predictable outcomes, some poor editing and some minor cheesiness and inconsistencies, the author does a fantastic job of drawing you in and making you care what happens to the characters, particularly Myranda. I'd actually like to see him write an entire series on Lain, the most interesting character in the book in my opinion, but I digress. This has been a captivating story throughout the series and I found myself often having a hard time putting it down. I like Mr Lallo's writing style and story development and look forward to diving into his other works.Pick this up and give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
5	1330905600	I still can't figure out how this book didn't manage to get published into an actual book. If it did, I would probably just buy it to have it on my bookshelf (and make my friends read it.)Most of my friends don't have kindles because they prefer actual books, and it's a shame that they can't read it. I loved this book, and it's probably up there with the most memorable and favorite books I've read. As soon as I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. If you're looking for a fantasy book that is refreshing and that has characters with depth and personality..then you've found your book! The next two books are also available and are definitely worth buying.
5	1330819200	I was just looking for something to read and found this book. Then I could not put it down. I went on to read his other titles as well and loved them too.
5	1330819200	These books are so interesting and exciting.  I had the first one done, but couldn't sleep so had to get the rest of the series.  This author has created a believable world.  I like the idea of magic in the world so these books really hit my preferences. The characters are so real and the psychology behind all their thinking is intense.  Will buy more by this author in the future.  Totally impressed!
4	1330646400	This was a fun, immersive fantasy story with many interestingly fresh perspectives - or at least somewhat refreshing views of standard fantasy components.  The characters were interesting, although the main character was often somewhat frustratingly dense.  The story-telling was rich enough to pull me in, although I felt the plot became a bit plodding in places.I was not impressed with the writer's ability to seam together the various threads of the tale in a manner that didn't jostle me out of the "story" and into awareness of its construction.And yet, the book was still enjoyable enough to make me feel confident about recommending it to other readers who are seeking a simply interesting reading experience. This novel will never rank among the greats, but it is a fun read.
3	1330646400	This is one of the first kindle books I downloaded when I got it last year.  The premise sounded interesting and I admit, it was free so I pulled the trigger.  A few months later I finally got to read it.The Book of Deacon is a pretty hefty novel.  As there were no page numbers on the kindle file (I've found that a lot with cheaper and free ebooks) I'm not sure how long but I would estimate it at over 500 pages.This is very much an origin story.  In fact, it's too much of an origin story.Myranda is a drifter.  She opposes The Perpetual War, a war that's been raging between the north and south of her continent for generations.  Sympathizers aren't well liked in her land and after making the fatal mistake of giving her opinions on the war voice she's forced to go from town to town, place to place in near full solitude.  She keeps the world at bay in order to not leak her opinion by accident once again.During her travels she finds a mysterious sword, one that marks her hand mysteriously.  It's obviously no ordinary sword as assassins and Northern Alliance soldiers are all looking to get it for reasons unknown to her (and unknown to the reader because the reasons for its importance are never mentioned in the novel).As she flees for her life she runs into an underground group of rebels called The Undermine, a half man half fox named Leo and she will stumble upon a well hidden yet completely magical village filled with wizards of all kinds.  She'll also befriend a dragon as well.Sounds interesting, right? A little lord of the rings (or swords as it may  be), meets the civil war with a continent divided, a pet dragon, etc, etc.The problem with his book is its wordiness.  Especially in the latter half where she is going through various forms of training.  These training 'sessions' last for page upon page upon page all leading up to tests in various magical disciplines.  The tests never really seemed to be that impressive.The participants in the Perpetual War as it currently rages hardly make an appearance during the second half of the book as it's all dedicated to Myranda's magical training.As far as the first half of the book, Myranda's constant flight from people and agents that would do her harm was interesting at times but being primarily a loner there was very little dialogue.I think the novel had some good ideas but the seemingly endless exposition of magical training that ended up in less than impressive payoffs for at least 200 pages that I can estimate really killed it for me.Not to bash the author.  I know writing fantasy is difficult, dealing with the different races, warring factions, alchemy, magic, etc and I applaud the effort.  It's just that this book didn't really strike a chord with me.  I know there are two more books that can also be had rather cheap but I'm not sure I would want to invest the time in them after forcing myself to finish approximately 500 pages that failed to grab me fully.
5	1330560000	The whole Book of Deacon series is very well written.  This is book 1.  I was hooked on the first chapter!  It has magic dragons, monsters, inter-dimensional foes and lots of action!  A very well written series!
5	1330473600	I enjoyed the book. It was a book about war, magic, wizards but it was done very differently than other books of that genre. The character development was well done.
5	1330300800	I must start out by saying this book was not even close to what I expected. It was woo much better! I downloaded it on account of it being free, but soon realized just how great a series I stumbled onto. It had suspense, action, a budding love story, and fantasy flawlessly intertwined throughout. A great read for the best price (free!). It was a fast paced easy read that any age could get interested in, not to mention a great use of vocabulary to keep things interesting and teach you a little something along the way, definitely worth your time, and money, to check out.
5	1330300800	As an avid reader of fantasy, sometimes it's hard to try someone new rather than re-reading books I love, but I'm so glad I opened this book.It didn't take long to get involved in Myranda's fate.  I found myself nervewracked by what could happen next and had a hard time putting the book down.  The characters Myranda meets are fascinating and easy to like.  I feel so bad for Deacon though and hope things work out for him.My only two critisms are the lack of chapters, which makes finding my place hard if I swipe up or down on my Kindle instead of sideways, and a few instances of head jumping between characters.  These are not enough to truly detract from the story though. :)I've picked up the next two and am halfway through the second.  I can't wait to get back to it. :)
5	1330214400	This book was ENTHRALLING. I finished it in 1 day and immediately bought the 2nd one. The story premise is familiar, but the characters are amazing. They are so real and human, the flaws they have and the obstacles they have to overcome draw you in and the reading FLIES by. Definitely worth the free price, but be forewarned you'll wanna buy the next two!
4	1330214400	I wish it were possible to give this book 3.5 stars. There are some great concepts in the book, the overall plot line for the series (based on what I've read in the first book anyways) looks promising. Several of the characters are memorable and unique. At the beginning of the book the world feels very open to interpretation, it's unclear whether it will be a predominantly human-only world or a typical fantasy world. As the main character explores a bit more though, it becomes clear that this is a typical fantasy world with elves, dwarves, dragons, etc. which is a bit unoriginal, but not unexpected. The names of some of the secondary characters were very cliche and bothered me a bit. A mermaid named Calypso? really?The main character, Myranda, is a young girl trying to find her place in the world, or at least, simply a warm place to sleep. Myranda's personality (or sometimes lack thereof) was the most frustrating part of this book for me. For most of the book she is simply reactionary rather than actually operating as her own agent. She is shuffled around the world, rarely making a decision for herself. The story is often from her point of view, but we don't often get a good glimpse into her overall motives or desires. Or when we do, she then does something contrary to what the reader thinks she would based on her personality.Despite some frustration with the main character, I bought the second book in the series almost immediately after finishing this one. I found my curiosity about the world and what happens to some of the secondary characters enough to want to read more.
4	1330041600	I LOVED THIS BOOK!! When I read Fantasy I like to suspend belief and just enjoy. I wish I could give this book 4 1/2 stars. I enjoyed the characters and found myself not wanting to put this book down. The only reason that I could not in all honesty give this book 5 stars is that parts were very predictable. Some of the "secrets" I figured out before they were revealed and I am not always the brightest bulb in the bunch. That being said as soon as I finished this book I immediately actually PAID for the next two book downloads for my Kindle and I don't do that very often. I have finished #2 and will soon be reading #3. I have not been disappointed.
4	1330041600	Not a bad read for a free down load. Enjoyed the book so much I paid for the other two books, wanted to see how it ended.
5	1329782400	Considering the fact that this book was free, i honestly had not set my hopes up high on this book being mindbogglingly. In a sense it really wasn't, but I'm not going to say that it wasn't good either. Even though I sometimes wanted to punch the heroine in the face, a majority of the book was good. One of the things i like about the book the most was that the author made his characters human. They weren't perfect, the main character was, to put it bluntly, a coward, not that there is anything wrong with that but usually authors tend to make their characters too perfect. Overall a good read and i will be buying the next book in the series, it ended with a very bad cliff hanger with which i must know the end to in order to satisfy my curiosity.
3	1329696000	I was intrigued by the high ratings and the low price of this book (it's free).  I also like books with strong female characters.  The book began with Myranda finding a sword that started her on a journey of discovery.  I like the Myranda character but a few times, I do wonder about the decisions that she made.  I question whether someone with her hard life would do things like allowing a stranger into her room.  I would be very suspicious of someone giving me something for nothing in this war torn country.  Her gifted ability seems hard to believe.  Was it given to her when she touched the sword or was it something she was born with.  I like the plot but it doesn't seem complete so I bought the next two books.  More things fell into place but there still seem to be loose strands like Trigorah's story, the priest/Ben, and Desmeres.  For some reason, the world just doesn't seem that big.  You don't hear much about the other nations.  There were a few times where I got lost and had to reread passages because of phrasing.  Overall, I recommend this book based on the price, the plot and the writing.
4	1329523200	I downloaded this kindle book because it was free and had good reviews.  The book is written in the 3rd person but focuses on the main character and her thoughts and trials.  Overall I found the book a bit long and a bit slow in the beginning but the second half gets much more interesting if you hang in there.  The book really doesn't have an ending, and the ending seems a bit abrupt but I guess that is what the 2nd and 3rd books are for.Overall the book is creative and I found everything believable, especially for the adventure/fantasy genre.  The book is well written and has some, but relatively few grammatical/spelling errors.  I think I will definitely read the other books in the series, but I'm not compelled to read them right away.  While I think this is a solid read for the genre, it isn't a book that "I couldn't put down" so I wouldn't rave about it to others.
5	1329523200	I read this book on my Kindle a while ago, and I adore it so much, I reread it.It has a really interesting plotline, characters I couldn't help but fall in love with, and was just brilliantly written. I saw it as a free download with good promise originally, and quickly after starting just fell in love with the story, I couldn't put it down!I would recomend this to all my friends and am now aiming for the next book.
2	1329350400	This book grabbed my attention by the ratings and the price. I was confused by the summary but quickly dived into it with the skepticism that the story will unfold it self. However, I had to wonder the situations that allowed this woman to go through where not only unbelievable (not as far magic fantasy) but in a normal struggle clash then high climax then downfall. Too many mishaps and too many unanswered questions linger for me to fully stay with the story!Example: She is between the age of 18-25 never does say exactly. She is wonder the land of her birth from the south to the north cause she is a conscientious objector after her uncle dies from a lynch mob however she goes on unscathed from rape or worse death. You don't find this out til after she finds that blasting sword and fate meets her to her next demise. Which is 35% of the book at this point cause the author spends a lot of time describing the scenery and the need to survival. I wonder why until the midway in when all she is face with are challenges that had me rolling my eyes. Seriously about 65% of the book is her cheating death or leaning something that doesn't effect the book as towards a moment/flow at all! She meets with a fox man name Leo/Lain (goes by many) that you find out 75% of the book is actually an assassin to turn her and the sword over to the bad guys. Who they are you? You just find they aren't human. He is actually the Chosen one to stop this war that's been going on that sounds like decades. He was about to hand Myranda over to the bad guys but when he didn't get paid he let her go without the sword. This is where the sword is no longer seen nor asked by Myranda. Then by mere fat chance she meets up with him again. She doesn't know he was the one to betray her. She saves his life from the experience she learned from the previous encounter of a new character. What a coincidence many are like these through the story. Like meeting her baby dragon we find out towards the end (as always) that he was there following her along her journey of discovery and survival to keep her safe was his words. At this I had to wonder if the author was grabbing ideals out of a hat to pitch to the story. Now if that sounds like the cruel picture of an assassin that the author pictures at the end of the story I didn't buy it! Myranda is so press for awswers she does the thing she hates most and she sccumbs to a striking blow to the fox man. He then hands her a memorable and leaves the next day to go back through the cave. I guess running from destiny or to make another book. Who knows and who cares.....Deacon is the man who wrote the story of Myranda and he is an illusions wizard. He is also describe of being born in the mystical paradise land that Myranda finds herself in the rest of the book of. He is 25yr old.  However it was miss dialogue that he was 250years old in an argument with her over her accelerate level of magic. He tags along with her on her studies and you get the vibe that something will go there with them. It doesn't as of yet.  I was also wondering in the dark weather Deacon had any intentions with her other than friends. It lead that maybe but then he let her slip away and I was baffle at the ending. This book might appeal to Harry Potter readers but I was confused, hoping for more, disbelieving, and utterly disappointed! I gave this a two star cause it was a hell of lot better than the stories that I've read.
4	1329350400	A rather long book for being free, I picked it up because my wife had read it before me, and enjoyed it. (She has read all 3 in the series)What strikes me is that it doesn't seem to have a real 'structure', it seems like it is missing a true denouement, and it feels like that overarching story just got arbitrarily cut off where it did, though perhaps it is more a flaw of the style, it could have been cut to end a few chapters earlier, and it would have been a bit more decent to have the later chapters in the next volume.
1	1329264000	I did research all the book reviews first, I love fantasy and was looking forward to a good story.  However, I didn't even make it past 16% (kindle) of the book and stopped.  Only once before (out of a hundred books) have I actually stopped reading the book; regardless of how bad I may find a story, typically I let my curiosity win and follow the book through.  NOT WITH THIS STORY,  I was just so bored, I simply couldn't go on.I love fantasy stories BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REALISTIC,  they take me from the real world and allow me to imagine `what if'.........so if there is a half man half animal character,  LOVE IT!.  But when the story is written so that the character is just so dumb, and the events so weak in the delivery, maybe I could describe it as unrealistic events, but not the fantasy kind of unrealistic......??The main character  has been on the road from a very young age, and is still a youngster..... she gets kicked out of endless towns  just because she is against the war....I mean that's it basically, because she has said she thinks any death is a waste regardless if it is an enemy or not, that's all she says  -  and everyone hates her - really - couldn't we come up with something a bit stronger, a little more depth.  Like maybe there is a magic spell in the kingdom and any time someone openly speaks out against the war everyone around them dies.......something more.She is so trusting of strangers that she leaves her ONLY money bag hanging from her body, easy for the taking, when entering a run down, shady tavern, with drunk men!  She welcomes a dark mysterious stranger into her room  - big male - alone with little girl, wouldn't she at least have enough smarts not to do this, but simply because he paid for the room, well come on in. If you are a female, this would be even more reason why I wouldn't let a stranger in my room, if he paid for it!  While she is walking to shelter, it starts to snow and it seems like in 2 seconds it is up to her knees and she can't walk..........next she actually gets tied up without ever waking up - I guess it was magic, I tried to make it past all this, but the endless detail when she is trying to escape the ropes she is tied with just put me to sleep,  I couldn't make it paste this scene.
4	1329264000	I enjoyed this book mainly because the main character is set in a sci-fi fantasy world full of magic and action with a bit of suspense and surprise.  While this is not an epic tome like Tolkien's LOTR, it does hold my interest nonetheless.  If you have time to spare, it is worth a read.
2	1329177600	I go to the negative reviews first, especially if there are only a couple vs a TON of positives, to see what the dissenting voices had to say.  This time, I had to join them.I really, really wanted to like this story.  I could get past the perfection of the main character, and the painfully 2-dimensional people in a world where even a priest won't forgive her for being a pacifist.  I like fantasy; I like her new friend and the concept a lot.But the dialog....the dialog was just too much for me.  It took me back to high school and creative writing classes.  That being said, I'm still curious enough to know what happens that I will probably go back in a few months with a fresh perspective.Concept alone is not quite enough to bump this to a 3 star rating, but when I try it again I will change my review accordingly.
5	1328659200	This book looks great but I can not get it to work for my iPad kindle app so I can't read it but I really think it would be a great book if I could download it to my iPad.
5	1328572800	I thought this was a great book! It pulled me in right away and I couldn't put it down! Before I knew it, I had read for hours and it was already passed midnight!!!
5	1328486400	The characters are well rounded, not your "typical" heroes. Hell, this book is not typical ANYTHING. Sci Fi, fantasy, a little quest narrative...fantastic. Can NOT say enough good things about this author. Self published, his editing is done by friends, so if you are annoyed by typos, grit your teeth and get lost in the story. :)
4	1328486400	I love to read. It's one of my favorite things to do. Since I got my Kindle I've been reading alot of books that are free or "cheap". Some of these books aren't even worth the time to download them. This is not one of them. This book is a very good read, with it's own style of magic and fate. The characters are fun and addicting. I was lucky to have found this book when the 2nd was already out and the third was being released. I read them all and was not disapointed. I hope that we get more stories that envole some if not all of these charactes.
1	1328400000	Based upon the many positive reviews for this book I was very much looking forward to reading this story. Unfortunately I have given up - a very rare occurrence for me. And I think this is probably the first book I have ever rated under 3 stars.This book desperately needs an editor. It may possibly be a very good story, but the flaws in the first few chapters overcame my patience. As the book opens, the main character is trekking across an inhospitable landscape. She happens across things just as she needs them. She encounters an individual who is friendly until she says (in not so many words) that war is stupid and then the individual isn't so friendly. He tells her to go to village B instead of village A, because in village A they are patriotic. You then discover that she'd been heading for village A but based on the advise of an unfriendly stranger (would YOU trust that?) she instead goes to village B which we are then told has a bad reputation for having a significant criminal element. She goes into a bar, narrowly avoids being the center of a bar fight, accepts a very expensive bottle of wine from a stranger, then lets said stranger into her room against her better judgement but with apparently no suspicion that he could mean her harm.At this point I just gave up - the coincidences encountered by and choices made by the main character were simply beyond my ability to suspend my disbelief. None of the above is explained, the motivations of why the main character is on the move is not explained(beyond that she's seen as unpatriotic for believing that war is a waste of human life), and there is a lot of convenient coincidence. I'm glad other people were able to get through and enjoy the story - and I hope the author finds a good editor so that if I encounter a book of his in the future I will be able to enjoy it as well.
5	1328313600	I read the entire series and enjoyed this series very much.  Totally loved the fantasy story, very well written and original content.  Loved the books!  Price was amazing for the entire series
5	1328313600	Found this book to be refreshing and entertaining. I enjoyed the triology and have recommended it to all my friends.
5	1328313600	I got this book because it was free.  I was not disappointed!!  The story begins with Myranda, a poor girl wandering from place to place trying to make sense of her life.  Then she finds the sword and everything changes.  I could not put this book down!!  The series are pretty long books but well worth the time to read them, I find myself wishing the author would continue the story!  What an imagination!!  I would have to say, some of the best fiction I have ever read!!
5	1328227200	I loved this book.It was very well written and I was never bored.The characters were very well-developed.It's been over 6 months since I read it, and I still remember it pretty clearly; it was that good.I highly recommend this book.
5	1328140800	Congratulations on having written a most enjoyable book. After finishing the first book I immediately bought both of the remaining books. You have a fine imagination and an incredible feeling for the emotions of your characters. I can't wait to begin book 2 - The Great Convergence.
4	1328054400	Like many, I picked this up because it was a free download. I wasn't expecting much, but this is a great story! The characters are interesting and the story, though a familiar setup, is well done. I did spot a few instances where it looked like a word had been left out or words had been run together oddly "lik ethis", but not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of the story.Left me on such a cliffhanger I immediately purchased the second book.
5	1327968000	when I purchased this book on amazon for free I was not expecting it to be well written or exciting. However as I started reading I was shocked at the fact that I couldn't put it down. I had to stay up practically all night just so that I could finish it, and as soon as I did I purchased the second book in this trilogy and started reading. Again I stayed up until 5 in the morning to complete it as it is quite a lengthy story.But my mum said that I cant buy the last one until I review all the books I have already bought. So I am posting very short reviews (not including this one) in anticipation of the next book.
4	1327968000	First off, I'll tell you that I got this book free for the Kindle. Free! How can you beat that right? I read a lot, and go through a lot of dreck just to fill that reading niche. This book was much more than dreck, I happily would have paid for it, and am going on to buy the rest of the series. It follows the time honored tradition of mundane misfit, somehow tossed into great things through fate, and some how they manage to come through it with their honor intact and we get a great adventure. However, for some reason I can't really pinpoint, this book isn't just like a million other books with that same basic shape. I really enjoyed it and was upset to realize I was at the end of the book! I know my husband and teen son will want to read this as well. I highly recommend this as a read for anyone who likes fantasy. You'll know a good thing when you read it.
4	1327881600	The book was very good and entertaining.  I liked the Main character and the dragon was a delightful addition to the book.  The book had a nice plot and I liked the direction the book went.  I would recommend this book if you like Sci fi fantasy.  I try to read only free or .99 books because I read at least 5 books a week.  This book was free when I read it and I really enjoyed it.  I will purchase the 2nd book and see how it goes from there.
5	1327795200	The first book was free and I thought I'd give it a try. I am SO happy I did because all three books were wonderful! Getting to the end had that fixed feeling of YAY I wanna know what happens and AWWW I don't want it to be over!The book feels like your reading a RPG story. I could almost see myself playing the main character on a game of some sort. lolFor me personally there was just a little bit too much fighting, or rather the fighting scenes were to drawn out, but that is my only real  "con" about these books, everything else was just right.Over all: A perfect read for a very low price, I recommend at least getting the first book because it will most likely get you hooked. :)
4	1327795200	This book is probably one of the best books on amazon, i would have gladly paid 20 plus dollars for it, and the fact that it is free is amazing... i already bought the second on and cant weight to finish it. It has great imagination, and the author has clearly planed the setting of the story, as i have found no contradictions in the "natural laws" of the authors world. I would recommend it to any one. The characters have real depth and i cant weight to continue finding more about them....
5	1327449600	I have purchased a number of the lower priced books since I got my Kindle for Christmas and you can't get much lower than free.  Many of the books were in the "ok" category - this one was a huge step above that.  Very polished and well written.  I did not get the feel that this was a one shot, "I want to write a book".  This author studied their craft and it shows.  Now to buy the second book.
5	1327276800	I must say that when I started reading the Book od Deacon, I didn't expect much, but as the story evolved it became a lovely surprise and just kept me glued to my Kindle!!! Now I've already purchased book 2 and can't wait to see what happens next.When reading the Book of Deacon I really felt with the characters and even when expecting something I would still not believe my own belief, as I hoped that the characters were "better than that". But still eveything fell in place and even with my guts were correct, everything in the story fell in line and became true to the characters :)Sorry if my review seems a bit messy... it's already 5:30 am as I had to finish the book!!! I just got hooked!
4	1327190400	This book was really entertaining! There were a few minor grammatical mistakes, but not enough to weaken the story.  Above all, the author is an exceptional story-teller.  That is the most important thing to me. I owe it to him to buy the other two books in the series, since I enjoyed this one for free. Great Job! I look forward the rest of the series.
5	1327190400	I began and finished this book in two days. I would have read straight through but I didn't want to miss anything by being sleep deprived. I would and have recomended this to all my fantasy/scifi reading friends!
5	1327017600	This book caught my eye because it was listed on Amazon for free, so I decided that I had nothing to lose by downloading it.  When it started off it seemed like it would be the same as so many generic fantasy books before it, but from the time Myranda is told to leave the church she tries to shelter in things get very interesting.  I found that I could not keep myself from reading any chance I got and I blazed through this book, and then I purchased the other two and tore through them, as well.  I found myself immersed in the world and emotionally attached to the characters and their struggles, and that's really what you want out of a fantasy novel.  I highly recommend this entire series, but if you are hesitant, feel free to download the first one for free and see for yourself.
3	1326931200	I downloaded this book because it was free, and it was as good as many books that I have bought. I enjoyed the story. Sometimes it was a little slow, other times I couldn't put it down. I varied between loving the book and being bored with it. The main character was female, but I found it difficult to connect with her. I usually love a pinch of romance, but the bit in this book didn't have enough emotion for me. I'm still trying to decide if I want to buy the second book. I am not going to recommend this book to any of my friends unless they're fresh out of things to read. On a positive note, this book had nothing inappropriate. I'd definitely let my children read it.
5	1326758400	I have been out of touch with this sort of reading, Fantasy Fiction.  But I was intrigued by the book reviews for this author, Joseph Lallo.  This is a wonderful story, very well written keeping it interesting from the very beginning which for most authors is hard to do but not this one.  I loved it!!! I especially liked the main character, Myranda along with her little dragon, Myn.  This first book of this series keeps you interested and wanting not to put it down.  Page turner!  I thought that I would write this before I continued getting too far into the next book, The Great Convergence.  If this tells you anything at all, it is that I can't say enough about this series.  I have one more book in the series and am afraid for it to come to an end.  I look forward to another series by this same author and will buy it in a second.  Mr Lallo, immediately was able to create a bond between the reader and the characters.  I just can't say enough about this book.  I looked forward when I was able to pick it up again after having to be interrupted at work or home, just so I could get away...Wonderful reading!
4	1326672000	I will admit that I got this book because a friend read the synopsis and recommended it to me. Once I sat down and had a few moments with it, I realized that I just could not put it down!The story to me was very rich. This is a world that I can imagine easily, with a character that I could identify with. While I was wishing some parts were more drawn out, I take that as a good sign that I just wanted to know more about Myranda and her time in certain places.There are certain parts of the dialogue that were a bit awkward to me, but Myranda's naivety drove me up a wall sometimes. I understand her decisions from a character viewpoint, but there are some parts that just made me want to shake her. In all honesty, however, this again shows how deep the character was affecting me. I wanted to see her achieve, to hear more of this fantastic tale.I simply can't wait to buy the second part of this story and keep reading. I love where it ended, and I think for a free book, this was worth every moment of my time.
5	1326672000	I picked this book up for free a while back.Never read it until a few days ago, and then the story captivated me.Outstanding is all i can say... just wow.
3	1326585600	What I liked:Classic tale of 'nobody' who develops powers and becomes important, goes on an adventure. There was one good plot twist, some good action scenes, and overall you want to know what happens.What I didn't like:The story felt a little half-baked, as though the cause/effect and motivations of the characters weren't well thought out. For instance, we're told early on that the lead character can't stay in one place because of her political philosophy. That's laughable. She would be fine simply moving to a new town and keeping her mouth shut. A similar head-scratcher occurs when a group of men are murdered through magical means, and then the townsfolk are in a rush to track down said mystical, dangerous, powerful killer with their pitchforks. Huh? It would be like someone with a machine gun kills a few people, and you rush at them with a sword. No one would do that unless they were some enraged family members, which these people weren't.There's also very little physical description of characters or their emotions. I couldn't tell you what anyone in the book looks like save a couple of people. Similarly, facial expressions are never really conveyed, which gives interactions between characters more of a 'sterile' feeling where very little emotion is conveyed.Another issue is that the motivations of the warring factions are very cloudy. I'm not sure exactly how a war could go on forever, or why anyone would want it to. Regardless, we're told that the main character wants to stop the war, because war is bad, but beyond that I don't really have a sense for the structure of the opposing side. It's hard to root for the hero when the villain is so nondescript. One random other annoyance is that the main character is given the option to have a lot of her most pressing questions answered by someone who will know the answers, and she doesn't ask one of the most basic questions that would be at the forefront of her mind given the root cause for her adventure/struggles.Lastly, the story doesn't have as many layers and intriguing plot details as I would have liked. Fully half of the book is devoted to training, and besides the final sequence in that, there isn't much beyond just, "And now she learns this element, and now she learns that element" etc...So overall the book is entertaining, but it just needs to be more carefully thought out, revised, and given a bit of spice. It's a little like a boiled chicken breast, flavorless and vague, but ultimately somewhat fulfilling.*edit* Well I just saw that the author self-published and actually responds to the reviews of his books, so I'll buy the last 2 to see how the story ends and give him a few bucks since this one was free, and worth paying for.
5	1326499200	This book was so much fun to read. I loved every page. I read a lot of fantasy and it's hard to find a good one anymore, but this was fantastic.Now I am about to read the second book to this trilogy and I can't wait.
2	1326153600	This is a review of the entire series.First the magic system and everything surrounding it is pretty cool. Kudos.However, this book is so uncomfortably predictable it ruins itself. Something good happens? Uh oh something melodramatic is going to happen to wreck it. Someone gets super powers? Uh oh now we have to take them away. As for the characters, the author never builds them up enough or sticks with a perspective long enough for you to identify and want to like the character. Many times it switches point of view in the middle of a paragraph, which is incredibly jarring. The characters are typically shallow, always behaving in the same generic fashion with none of the gritty detail that gives characters life. Lets take Lain for example, you never learn about him personally, he's always the brooding anti-hero, but thats as deep as it gets.The biggest problem is that it's nearly impossible to identify with the characters and really get sucked in to the book.There are no plot twists or anything surprising. The characters are never conflicted or torn between decisions that you can really relate to or empathize with. overall this was pretty disappointing. For a free book, it was fine. Compared to real books, it had a concept that could stand up reasonably well, but the execution was mediocre.
4	1326153600	If you like the Inheritance Cycle then you will probably like this book. I've only read the first two so far, but they are entertaining. There are others who point out the flaw in the writing, granted there are some, but it isn't distracting as you read the story. There are a few instances when I'll be asking "well why doesn't she just do this or that" after she learns some new skills, and it doesn't always make sense why she doesn't do something, but eh it's not my book. I probably couldn't even write something as entertaining. Overall I've enjoyed it and it is fairly action packed so it flows quickly. When I pick a book to read I'm looking for it to capture me in a story, and this one does.
4	1326153600	This is a delightful story of a woman's plight under difficult war and climatic conditions.  The relationship between herself and the young dragon kept me spellbound and the story up to the point where they reached the secret sanctuary is outstanding.  The long descriptions of their experiences in the sanctuary slowed the pace and spoiled the quaulity somewhat.  I was also disappointed in the almost abrupt ending and the realisation that there are two more works that follow this delightful book. I'll definately be buying the sequals in the trilogy.
5	1325808000	The author as created an entire world complete with history, diversity, unity, magic...essentially anything a reader could ask for! More importantly the story is littered with action, fighting, magic, mystery, and a bit of a budding romance ;).At first Myranda made some decisions that annoyed me, but she is true to her personality, and that's what matters to me. She also is dynamic; my only criticism is that everything seems a bit TOO easy for her. I do suppose being a prodigy means she's much more powerful than normal, but honestly this girl can do no wrong. There are many characters in the book, each endearing in their own way. The big mystery is Leo (coughcough), but my heart belongs to Deacon!Anyhow, much of this book is dedicated to Myranda and learning her powers. The author is incredibly detailed about the process and I liked reading about the different tests she had to pass to gain Master status. Overall, the book is paced very well and has moments of nonstop action.Very enjoyable - although I was lucky enough to download this book for free, I think I'd be willing to pay for the next one
3	1325721600	I'm new to the arena of fantasy which was brought on by A Song of Fire and Ice and when I saw this as a free ebook I thought why not? I really liked it at first until a few things didn't makes sense and I couldnt understand why Myranda wasn't more street savvy and grew tired of her training period. I am still left wondering why it is named Book of Deacon if his character wasn't introduced to more than halfway through the book. I realize this is a trilogy and this question may be answered, but I will get the next book because I haven't given up on Martin's dying series and I won't give up on this one either. I like the authors writing and believe that most authors gain more skills the more they write and one thing is for certain, you won't feel cheated by word count! It's free, I recommend giving it a whirl.
3	1325721600	As an avid reader, I tend to like my books well thought out, well written, and stock full of engaging characters. Did this book deliver all of my preferences? Mm...Just barely...It definitely wasn't awful, but nor was all that remarkable or entertaining.  My biggest complaint would probably be the writing. One question I'd like to ask the publishers would be:Where was this guy's editor?! I mean, I was floored by the sloppy, redundant word placement and writing inconsistencies that a *novice* would be ashamed to miss. With such phrases as "She was *fairly* climbing on her," it displays a limited grasp of description and word choice. Which leads to my other problem:The author's tendency to go on long tangents of expository or introspective detours. You couldn't go two paragraphs without being bombarded by massive info dumps. Worse is how it persists, even during a suspenseful scene. Instead of being descriptive and painting a picture or evoking a sense of depth, it feels more informative. It really distracts from the narrative and falls into the trap of telling instead of showing.The  only "action" during the last half of the book goes like this. Every single day Myranda learns a certain magic from one of 4 teachers, every day she talks to Deacon, she eats, she then talks to Lain, she complains, goes to sleep, repeat. Up until the last quarter of the book, this is literally all that happens in that exact order and mentioned with agonizing and repetitive frequency. Basically it dragged on and on forever until it became a chore to read.But I agree this book could be decent and nice at some points. And it made up for its many pitfalls with Myranda, Leo, and Myn being likeable enough characters and getting decent character development. But that was all it ever was; nice, decent, okay. It had potential, but the best it could evoke from me was tolerance and mild entertainment value.
4	1325462400	This book is several notches above the average free Kindle book, with a comfortable narrative style and intriguing characters that place it solidly in the ranks of quality fantasy literature.  The first half of the book gets 4.5 stars, with a compelling plot and thoughtful action.  Disappointingly, the second half of the book only gets 3.5 stars, since it changed pace and almost seems like a separate work entirely.  While still interesting, I wasn't nearly as engaged through the end, and was sad to see that it never really regained the momentum of the first part.  Still definitely worth the read, and I'll be looking for more works by this talented author!
3	1325376000	I agree with the review by Sheryl A. Wells.  The grammar in particular was a big turn off, but the author has acknowledged (on his Amazon authors page and his blog) that in the future he needs to spend more time proofreading/editing.  In all three books, "lie" is consistently misused.  Bad grammar is a sure way to ruin the reader's experience.That said, the characters were likeable and the central conflict development was engaging.  The author is self-publishing, and learning as he goes, so I'd say this was a more than decent first effort.I liked this free book enough to purchase the remaining books in the series for a low price.
4	1325289600	Just finished reading this story and liked it a lot.  Quite a few fantasy cliches but interesting story that is well written and I plan on buying the other books in this series to find out how it ends.What I liked:- Good storyline with a lot of interesting questions and plot turns that kept me reading- Solid world development- Well written, especially relative to many indie kindle books.  There are a couple grammatical mistakes here and there but it is clear the author (or somebody) put a lot of time and effort into making sure the writing flowed well and was clear and easy to read (in some ways it felt a little bit too polished, I think the author might be served by letting go a bit and have his style come through a bit more in the future).What I was less impressed by:- The writing is a little heavy handed with quite a bit of telling instead of showing.  The story is narrated but we never really get a feel for the narrator.  If the narrator was a more obvious character so that us being told what to think were more obviously the POV of the narrator it would be less irritating.  This is a pet peeve of mine so others might find this less annoying.- I would like to see more subtle character development.  The plot moves the characters along and we get speeches/thoughts from characters explainig their motivations but it feels a bit heavy handed at times.- There is a lot going on that never gets explained that I assume will get more play in the following books.- This is obviously the first book in a series, there is really no stand alone story told and concluded in the first book.(Spoiler ahead)- Like others have said the characters/storyline are a bit cliche.  For example, The heroine with a pet dragon finds a magic sword that propels her on a path of destiny foretold by a prophecy...)Despite all these criticisms, it is a solid fantasy story and if you like the genre you will probably like this book.
5	1325203200	Which in my mind, is a major victory. And, of course, the ploy for making the first book free. A ploy which works very well, mind you, as I fully intend to buy the next two books, both of which are nearly as long as this delicious monster, and together the price of a single paperback.The Book of Deacon follows the a young girl named Myranda. Orphaned and made homeless by war, the tale follows her through the snowy kingdoms of the north as they endlessly war against Tresson, a kingdom to the south (the fighting has gone on for more than 100 years when we meet Myranda). A "sympathizer" who hates war, Myranda is often an outcast among a people blindly following their leaders, making her way from place to place, doing odd jobs to survive. Along the way she finds a dead man who saves her life, a sword that risks it, and a variety of odd friends who both help and hinder her. In fact, the ragged vagabond finds she might have a bigger role to play in life than she ever imagined.The book ends on a not-too-cliffhangery note, but definitely leaves you wanting to know more. Some aspects of Myranda's personality are just a bit too pat, but the tale is so engrossing you'll scarcely realize them.My only complaint? No chapters. Which meant that as I was devouring this book on my Kindle at 2 o'clock in the morning and wanting to go to bed, there was no good place to stop and I just kept reading.
5	1325203200	I do not typically leave reviews for free books, mostly because many are free for good reason. Occasionally, however, I manage to stumble across a wonderful one. This was one of those few. The writing was a bit too grammatically correct in dialouge, and the basic plot is one that has been used before. But the story its self was fantastic. I crawled into bed thinking I would read only another chapter or two, and ended at 5in the morning with a finished book.If you are a fantasy fan, then you will enjoy this. It has everything from excellent character development to an intricate plot, involving many characters that you are lothe to leave. One of my favorite parts was that there was only the slightest touch of romance, one that remains unrequainted. I finished my reading spree by buying the next two books. I can only hope that they will be as enthralling as this one was.
3	1325030400	Saw this book for a free download. I decided I would give it a try. I am currently half way through and am having a tough time wanting to finish it. I am just not that impressed with it. It is a very simple read, so maybe I am just wanting something with a little more complexity in it. The characters, to me, are not developed very well, and parts that the author could have expanded on them, he quickly rushes the scenes. The events happen so fast!POSSIBLE SPOILERFor example... The scene where our hero learns of her new healing skills lacks the depth and struggles she faced. She basically had no struggles with it or with her teacher. Without probelms our hero is given a task and she accomplishes it without a hitch. I understand their are naturals but a little error and difficulty would do ll. It's a very important scene in the book, I just felt it was lacking. Some of the conditions our hero finds herself in, and survives, seem almost a bit unrealistic as well. And there is snow... So much snow...The book would be great for the younger audience, say 13 years old and overall is a pretty good, easy, quick to read book.I will finish this book, but doubt I will buy the next in the series.
2	1325030400	This book gets off to an interesting start.  Myranda, an orphan, a wandering misfit in a dystopian world, finds a sword with some kind of power that marks her hand and also makes her a mark for the bad guys.  She befriends an odd creature or two along the way, gets some help from unlikely sources, has a bit of good luck with the bad as she moves through the plot.  Because she is alone, she speaks out loud to herself, which is not only amusing, but endearing. She meets Leo, who is a great character. He is a creature that is a man-fox. He is curious, has a bit of spunk and enough wildness to capture the reader's interest right away. Lallo has laced the plot with lots of good if well-worn material for a nobody-who-becomes-a-hero story. How can you go wrong with a baby dragon as a best friend, I ask you?Yet, it happens; the story slowly goes wrong. And you might consider some of what follows to be *spoilers* so read on with that in mind.The problem, I think, is that Myranda spirals into what my kids would call a Mary Sue - a too-perfect character.  It isn't enough that she's pretty, that she's good and thoughtful and 'pure' (the word is used many times to describe her, her heart, her soul etc).  Those are good things to be. However, she starts to become darned near irritating because it seems she's also a prodigy, mastering difficult magic in hours that others must take weeks, months or years to learn.  Great masters of magic literally tear apart the building in a fight over who will train her first! She passes every test to prove her mastery within weeks of beginning!  She masters several new weapons at the same time!  She has a prophecy spoken about her!It is unrealistic enough, but she does so in a kind of MarySueville, populated by diverse but mostly unexplored groups of people and creatures who only want peace and knowledge and learning and to heal the world of what ails it.  There is also a nerdy Gary Stu (good and thoughtful and smart) magician who is in no way jealous of Myranda's rapid rise in skill and power, but instead follows her around like a lovesick puppy.  While none of those things are bad in themselves, the combination keeps the story feeling very shallow and difficult to stay attached to.  In fantasy, since the story will involve essentially unbelievable and unnatural happenings, the characters have to connect the reader to the story solidly, so that the reader can suspend disbelief and stay involved in the story. If the characters don't have enough depth, or enough personality to keep the reader interested, the story begins to feel too unrealistic a world in which to stay immersed. After she gets to MarySueville, I couldn't keep my mind on the story very well at all.  I could only think about how irritating Myranda, and then the other characters, were becoming.The author asks at the end of the story for criticism so that he can improve his writing skills. I hope he considers this when he begins his next tale.
5	1325030400	Tired of all the cr@p that dares call itself Fantasy these days?  Well look no further! Joe Lallo is a name to be remembered and an Author to be followed.Here is a book that picks up your imagination from the get go and doesn't let go until the last page.If you are like me and are trolling through the free books hoping to discover a pure delight, then go ahead and get this book...you will not be disappointed.
4	1324944000	This was a great book in a page turning trilogy. It has some grammatical errors, but the story line is fascinating. I read the whole trilogy in 3 days. Couldn't put them down.
4	1324598400	I've said it before and I will say it again... I'm a sucker for fantasy. I liked this book. Joseph Lallo has a nice writing style and the story flows really well. I do have to admit, I saw a lot of typos, grammatical errors and repetitiveness. Those are probably the worst comments you'll see from me about this book. However, these are critiquing comments.The story of Myranda and her faithful reptilian companion is a very good one. It is the first in a series and I am looking forward to the next two books. There are some interesting creatures in this story, different views on magic and how the characters utilize it. I also have to say, that while this is fantasy, the story may be long, but it keeps going and only slows down ever so slightly. Not enough to bore you, though. I've read some books that you just wish they would get on with it, but this story is one that delivers just the right amount of information as it goes along. The information given paints the picture of the world that Myranda lives in and even though it is in some pretty heavy turmoil, there are areas I would love to see in real life, of course.
5	1324512000	Yes, I downloaded this book because it was free.  Yes, I did not expect much.  Sometimes it is just wonderful to be wrong!  The book captured my interest within a few pages and I literally consumed the book.  I even took the time to email the author to thank him for this delightful Christmas present.  I will buy the second book and will follow the author as a emerging literary force.I am always intriqued with human nature and as much as this book deals with magic and mythical, the human nature of the story is astounding.This is my first review of any book and I probably am not very good, however, the comments are genuine and I respect the job that Mr. Lallo has done.  I am on to reading the second book!
5	1324512000	O.K.  I just stayed up till 5 AM to finish this book.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  I went directly to Amazon.com to purchase the 2nd book in the series but I read a review for the second book and found out that Myn dies in the next story.  Myn was such a great character and I was so certain that she would be a huge part of the story as she grew up that I am so disappointed that I don't know if I want to read the next book.  So very undecided.  But anyway The Book of Deacon was a wonderful fantasy novel and I really enjoyed it.  Some grammar errors which don't bother me at all especially since it was free to my kindle.  I was definitely willing to spend the 2.99 on the next book in the series but not sure that I want to read about the death of Myn.
5	1324425600	I had just finished a science fiction book that I did not particularly like and felt that I needed a change.  So I switched to fantasy and downloaded this book since it was free and had a reasonaby good review rating.  I have only read the first half of the book but I am already pleasently surpised.  The characters are all well writeen and I have found myself smiling as I read about them.  Interaction between the heroine and the other characters make her shine even more.I will definitely by the other two books in the trilogy.
4	1324425600	I found this book very enjoyable. There was an occasional error involving missing words, incorrect word used, and other grammatical errors, however they were not sufficiently pervasive to ruin a good book, even for a picky reader like me. I had a few moments of irritation with the characters, but overall I think they were well portrayed. I hope in book 2 (which I fully intend to get) we are given a reason for the main character to be such a prodigy, and at the center of fate... Without discovery of more of her lineage, it just seems unlikely for the daughter of a soldier (and who was her mother? The best I can recall, nobody special) who has been on the run for the majority of her life to be so well educated and so adept at learning powerful mystic arts. Then again... a nobody who changes the world for the better is a very common theme.- I tried to avoid giving away too much information about the book in this review... I've seen some that tell the entire story. :) Let me know if I struck the right balance on this, my first review. Thank-you!
5	1324339200	I got this book as a free download two days ago, and were it not for my classes, I would have finished it yesterday.  I just purchased the second book in the series, which is only 2.99!  Wonderful book, great character development, and I can't wait to get to the next!
5	1324166400	It's a fantastic book and I'm having trouble putting it down to get work done.  I'll be purchasing the next book in the series after I finish.This was a free book for the Kindle.
4	1323302400	It took me a while to start this book but when I got into it I could'nt put it down. Its about a young woman trying to survive during a never-ending war. While Myranda is battling a harsh winter, homeless, poor and lonely she finds a long dead soldier in a field. She touches his ornate sword and her life is changed forever. She becomes hunted by the army's Elite soldiers, a hired assassin, and other unknown creatures.I really like the character of Myranda. She is very smart and has excellent survival skills. She is kind, loving and generous. There was a few times where Myranda would do something that I would think of as stupid, and then I realize that she is just smarter than me and the seemingly 'stupid' things she does actually save her life. Myranda is adopted by an orphan baby dragon in the course of her travels and she names her Myn. Myn is a lovely little character and she is incredibly protective of Myranda.There was alot of character development in this book. And while I usually like that alot, sometimes I felt it took away from some of the action and I got a little bored at times. That is why I gave it four stars instead of five. I know that I like alot of action and tend to get bored easily, so someone who likes to take things a bit slower will definitely enjoy this book.All in all, I would definitely recommend this book. It is very well written and something for just about everyone.
5	1322179200	Wow! I got the Kindle version of the `Book of Deacon' for free. I was amazed by just how good it is! My goodness, I couldn't put it down. I downloaded the 2nd book [...] to my Kindle and am 96% done, already downloaded [...], the 3rd book of the trilogy. This is fiction that takes you on a magical journey.
5	1321920000	AT FIRST, I thought the book would be pleasing, but not quite as memorable and beautiful as this one. The characters were insanely likeable. The female protagonist excelled in an uncanny way but she DID NOT BECOME A MARY SUE. She was a well rounded, perfectly rendered character. There were parts where I chuckled or thought "Oh, how clever", and, once, even laughed loudly (much to the confusion as my cat, who was resting on my stomach). There were NO plot holes, not gaps that needed filling, no disgustingly WRONG inconsistencies. The story was complete and, even though it was merely the first third of a trilogy, I felt satisfied after it, not rushed as if the story had been chopped short.It was good-surprisingly so- and I strongly recommend it.Thank you for your time.
3	1321833600	This is a solid effort by a novice writer. A previous reviewer has mentioned that the books have now been edited, and says no one need worry about this issue any longer, if that is so then the author either has only a grammer editor or needs a new editor altogether, as the errors are glaring and pervasive. There are still word errors, and poorly written sentances as well as stilted, awkward character dialogue/interaction. It is passible for a first try and with further revision and effort it could become printable. I would not have choosen to self publish a book in such state, however if he had no other forum to submit the text to for review I can see how self publishing here would hold strong sway over the author.The story is fun, although the dialogue leaves much to be desired and the pace is erratic. The beginning needs a full revision and the author needs to learn a lesson in character interaction, the story generally feels as if it has been dumped on your head with little to no warning. He also needs to work on developing the societal interactions and norms within his world, because for the first half of the book the main character feels fake, undefined and unnatural, mainly because the author tries so very hard to force her and her world into reality for the reader. The plot lines are clear, sometimes they are much too obvious, but the author needs work on character development as well as storyflow. Much of the book feels awkward and forced and I think that while the author does have a lot of talent it is unrefined and unfocused, which is why publishing houses are around. I believe that for a self published novel the author has done well, and with how difficult it is to break into the writing world this may well be the first step towards being officially picked up. With the right team this author could go far. Right now it is really a book for the people who enjoy the childish writing style of YA fantasy, or people who can ignore the flaws and take it for what it is. A good story with awkward character interaction, development and dialogue and passable writing that shows a strong promise.I would like to end by saying that regardless of my above critiques I will be buying and reading the rest of the series. Unrefined talent must be encouraged and with any luck one day this author will be able to find a team to tear into his books and really help him reach his potential. And I hope this review will be taken, not as a discouragement to the author or other prospective readers but as an honest assessment of the text. I do believe that anyone interested in straight forward fantasy should check this out, it will provide an enjoyable read, especially for fantasy enthusiasts.
5	1321574400	The Book of Deacon was one of the first freebies I downloaded to my Kindle. I honestly wasn't expecting much but I thought I'd try it with an open mind. Within the first few pages I was engaged and remained interested through the whole book. I found the characters to be realistic and believable. They aren't all good or all bad. They make mistakes and have honest personality flaws. I didn't always like the main character Myranda, but the author kept her true to the whole. The plot had plenty of twists though I did find some portions overly simplistic. Overall, the book is more character driven than plot driven. There were no glaring editing issues.I liked this book enough to purchase the second in the series and I plan on purchasing the third.
3	1321488000	It is an interesting story that had potential. Myranda is an average girl in the midst of an ongoing war. Through an accident the army turns to hunt her. She meets many helpful characters along the way as well as learns some about magic. However, I cannot give the book more than 3 stars. The story is very jumpy and causes the reader much confusion. The sentences do not quite flow.  Much of the important detail is not written. This breaks the flow of the story.  Some parts even seem to contradict. For example, knowing someone is a great teacher is a sure way to know that the creature is not a baby. Mistaking that makes Myranda seem much less intelligent than she is portrayed to be.  There are multiple spelling errors and no formatting for chapters. Again, I still believe it had potential. If edited and more detail added it could be a good novel.
5	1321488000	I really enjoyed this read as I initially have an inclination to the fantasy genre to begin with. What I notice about most fantasy novels, however, is that I never usually favor the main character for some reason. This is not the case with The Book of Deacon. The characters apart from the main are very true to their personalities and they were portrayed wonderfully. This was a very good start to a trilogy, I believe, and I look forward to reading the next two that follows up with this one (mostly because the book ended with such a cliffhanger).I definitely recommend this book for fantasy lovers, and if you're not too inclined to the fantasy genre, this book is a good way to start.
5	1321315200	The title says it all.  This is a fun, fast paced story that will keep you wanting to read more and more.  Lots of Character development.Highly recommend!
4	1321056000	The Book of Deacon seemed like a giant storm of adventure being thrown at the reader. This is not a bad thing, many fantasy books fill the pages with excessive nonsense.By 1/3rd of the way through the book the main character (Myranda) had been knocked unconscious 3 times, befriended a hatchling dragon, became a magical healer, met a unique friend/nemesis, and had yet to meet the title character.I have not read the rest of the trilogy yet so my review is entirely of The Book of Deacon.Overall Opinion:Deacon was a book that was tough to put down because something was always happening. I enjoyed the book but felt a bit overwhelmed at the amount of adventure.Character:I was quite surprised how quickly Llalo was able to confirm who Myranda was. I felt that I instantly knew about her beliefs and what her goals were. The supporting characters need some development but that may come in later books of the trilogy. There weren't very many deep seated emotions or extreme secrets and twists, but the characters were all believable.Story:As described above, this story was a jam-packed action-oriented roller-coaster ride. The story starts as an underdog tale but eventually turns into a superstar story. We are thrown into a believable snow covered wasteland of sporadic villages but eventually end up in a figurative garden of eden.Ideas:There were not any new ideas regarding magic and fantasy, but the world that was created was very easy to picture and the reader is immediately drawn in. I could picture Myranda trudging through the snow and could smell the mustiness of the inn she sleeps a night in. I feel that the world is quite unique.Make into a Movie?This could be a very good movie, however there was a lot of time spent in training. The passage of time and skills improving would be very hard to wrap up in a couple hours. It is very packed with adventure so if some fluff was cut out it would be an interesting possibility.If you are looking for a book of action and adventure with familiar elements of magic, this is most definitely the book for you. This is not an in-depth, or dark look at the fantasy genre but it is very human.
4	1320710400	The entire story comes from the point of view of Myranda. Myranda is a self-reliant young woman, orphaned very young and raised by an uncle. The novel starts with a prologue, which I found to be unnecessary. When the actual story opens, the uncle has been dead many years and Myranda is alone.The author, Joseph Lallo, does a modest amount of world building, yet leaves the reader short of being able to submerse in the world. The character depth is the same. I was interested in what happened to Myranda, but did not care enough about the character to worry or `pull' for her in her trials.The book is laden with too much exposition, lending to the distancing from the characters. The plot is good, and moves along at a decent pace. Action scenes not bad, but not done in a way that grabs the reader. The skirmishes tend to be short and not enough detail to draw you into the moment.All in all a good `first book' from this author
5	1320624000	This is not the typical Tolkein knock off that Fantasy Fiction has come to become.  Solid character build, solid writing and story line.  Exactly enough twists to keep it interesting but never so many that it gets confusing.  Great trilogy. I look forward to more from this author.
5	1320364800	The Book of Deacon is a good book indeed.I really enjoyed this tale. It is quite long but well worth the read. Joseph Lallo has a really unique way of telling a story. Those who love fantasy will really enjoy this story as well.I could tell you the details about this story but I refuse to give any spoilers. Instead I will only quote the author by telling you the given synopsis describing the book."Product Description --Myranda is a young woman more interested in staying alive than being a hero. Orphaned by a continent-spanning war that has gone on for decades too long and shunned for failing to support it, she has been on the move since she was only a child. One can hardly blame her when she thinks that the chance discovery of a fallen soldier's priceless cargo is the moment that will change her life. No one could predict just how great that change would be. It will lead her through an adventure of rebels and generals, of wizards and warriors, and of beasts both noble and monstrous. Each step of the way will take her closer to the truth of her potential, of the war, and of the fate of her world."You got to read this book is all I can say from here!I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars.
4	1319932800	The whole reason for this book being on my kindle is that it was free and I needed something to read. I must admit that it served its purpose rather well. I was drawn into the story from the first and when I wasn't reading it I was wondering what would happen next. However, if it wasn't free I probably would have been more than a bit disappointed  with it.The main character was supposedly in her twenties, but the way the book was written made it seem like she was in her early teens, and to top it off, with mood swings. Not very well developed at all. The other characters are also a bit lacking, although I still felt for them as they overcame various challenges. The ending was okay as far as endings go, I think it could have used a little something extra, maybe an unexpected twist?I'm not sure if I'll buy the second book, as you do have to pay for it. Overall, I'd say the book has a certain quality  that makes you want to finish it, but you probably won't want to read it again any time soon. For free, it's a good buy.
4	1319673600	I have low expectations for self-published fantasy books - I've tried more than a few and most of them aren't all that great.  Book of Deacon (I've only read the first book in the series so far, since it was free, but just purchased the second - hoping it lives up!) was a happy surprise.  It certainly shows some of the faults of self-publishing, such as the occasional typo (although nothing too terrible) and some problems with scene pacing and dialogue, but all in all it's quite good for a book that wasn't professionally edited.  I'd compare it favorably with the early works of Brandon Sanderson (which as far as I know, was professionally edited), in terms of writing quality .The setting is less imaginative that Sanderson, though - a little too vanilla fantasy for my tastes. Elves, dwarves, pixies, mermaids, etc. all live up to their stereotypes.  The magic system is pretty well thought out, but doesn't really (at least not yet) offer a plausible "balancing" mechanism, which is a pet peeve of mine.  Granted, this is a common failure in many fantasy settings, but really, if you've got nearly all-powerful mages running around, they're the fantasy equivalent of a nuclear bomb - they should be dominating the world (see Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen), and if they're not, there should be a plausible explanation.  I digress, though - that's more of a critique of much of the fantasy genre in general than of this series in particular.On to the strengths - the mythology and world building is pretty well done and tosses just enough curve balls to keep you on your toes.  Some of the reveals in this book probably could have been put off a bit longer to build tension, but no serious complaints - the overall pacing of the plot works well.  The characters are interesting and given some reasonable backstories to explain their motivations.  The choice to have just two POV characters (one primary, one secondary) keeps the story moving at a good pace while introducing plot elements that would have been difficult to plausibly reveal by just focusing on the main character.  I occasionally found myself wishing for even more POV characters, but sometimes it's nice to have the plot move along a little faster than a Robert Jordan novel (the entire trilogy is probably about the same size as Eye of the World, I'd guess).It's hard to rate self-published books - compared to other self-published books, this is a 5 out of 5.  Compared to all that's out there in fantasy land, it's probably about a 3.5 - worth checking out, certainly not groundbreaking.  Still, if you're looking for a fun, relatively quick read (I finished this in about ten hours), and definitely if you like supporting independent authors, give the series a shot.
4	1319587200	This was a good book- a few of the other reviews mentioned issues with typos, spelling, etc. but I believe that the author has had the book  proofread? edited?) since then, because I didn't find any glaring errors.The characters are likable and fleshed out well.  Myranda's training can be *very slightly* boring compared to the running from adventure to disaster that had been going on before, but it's actually worth it for character development, and not really done to death.--On the trilogy: It was quite good.  The characters progressed in a pleasing (and logical) manner, various different elements came together nicely; if you like the first book, it is definitely worth it to read the next two books.
3	1319068800	If you like easy reading fantasy fiction  you will enjoy this book.  It is worth reading and the price is right.
5	1318809600	I read this book over the span of 3 days (which is insanely fast for me) and I was completely blown away. The story went from awesome to just downright epic. Needless to say I purchased the second book mere minutes after finishing this gem and I cannot wait to read my way though it.
4	1318204800	Let's be very honest, it's hard to resist a free book for the kindle. This cover looked cool and the price was right (FREE) so I purchased it. Flipped through this book very fast, especially for me. Great read, I really enjoyed this. Will be looking into the next book.My big peeve for this book was that there were a number of typos/errors throughout the book. But, overall, it was still a good story. In the end, that's what really matters.
5	1318118400	The description of this book doesn't do it justice. While it was painted more as a war saga, there is more of an intimacy built among the characters than what I anticipated or had initially hoped for. The author paints a vivid picture of the characters and the environment, providing plenty of detail to bring it to life, yet also moves the story along at a quick pace and isn't afraid to bring on the adventure. In literature where anything can really happen, so often it seems as though authors are timid to push and twist the storyline. Not this time! If you're looking for a good trilogy that will suck you in, you should definitely give this one a try.
3	1317772800	"The Book of Deacon" is the first of a fantasy adventure trilogy by author Joseph Lallo. This is Kindle book that is a 586 Kb download and was free from Amazon.com at the time of writing this review.SPOILERSOn a foreign land, the Perpetual War has raged on and on for 150 years between an alliance of three smaller northern countries and larger, stronger country (Tresson) of the south.Myranda, our heroine, is against this ongoing war (an opinion contrary to the popular positive feelings towards the war by the majority of the populous). Shunned as an outcast for her beliefs, she stumbles across a magical sword and soon after meets a person by the name of Leo (Lain). Unbeknownst to her, these two seemingly unrelated events will change her life forever.END SPOILERSThe Pros:1.) the idea for the overall plot was intriguing.2.) initially well written with an engaging style.3.) interesting and intriguing cover art.The Cons:1.) nearly all (with only the rare exception) of this story is told from Myranda's POV. This was initially ok, but I found I grew tired of her character after a while...I began to look forward to the occasional but brief encounters with her main adversary, General Trigorah Teloran.2.) *spoiler*...the latter third of this book got really bogged down with Myranda's studying the main elements of magic (fire, earth, air and water) from the Masters. Myranda's brilliance was beyond doubt and she'd pass all her tests with the highest results ever. Unfortunately, while the outcome was never in question from the beginning, this section took up almost the latter third of the book, while dragging out the obvious.3.) *spoiler*...areas of questionable realism/believability. For example, early on Myranda is gravely wounded and is rescued by two resistance fighters. They don't have the skill to heal her so they send her to a wizard that can...now get this...they send her, gravely ill, ALONE and WALKING on a five day journey to the wizard's place...simply unbelievable. You know it's hard garner any strong feelings for a story when the author puts in something like that. There were other things as well, but maybe not as prominent as this incident.4.) no map...a story geographically diverse enough to warrant one.Impression:I liked the overall idea for the story...the beginning captivated and held my interest completely. However, as the story focused so intently and continually on Myranda, I started to become bored and even a little annoyed at times with her character.A little more time and development of Deacon's, Lain's or Teloran's story/character might have given the reader a welcome break from the ongoing continuing saga of Myranda.And as mentioned above in 2.) the outcome was so obvious, that the last part of the book was, in many areas, easily skimmable.Despite an enticing ending for this book, I'm not sure I could take another book so dedicated to just one individual (at least not this one).Could I recommend this book...with some reservation, yes...it did have some good moments, especially early on.As it is 2 1/2 to 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson
5	1317600000	Full of adventure and magic, wizards, warriors and the occasional dragon, this book is far from perfectly written, (and it certainly isn't going to be the next Lord of the Rings) but I couldn't help but give it five stars; I just couldn't stop reading it. Why I couldn't stop reading it is a bit of a mystery because it's not a terribly deep book, not the kind that makes you really think and keeps you up at night, but just a pleasure to read.There are page breaks but there are no chapters in this book. Instead of making it drag on like one might expect I feel like it might actually make the book read faster because there isn't really a place for your brain to stop and disengage. The very very last bit of the book will probably explain to readers why there are no chapters, but it's a fun little addition so I don't want to spoil it.I guess this review isn't exactly screaming "must-read!" but I suggest anyone interested in a quick adventure/fantasy read give this book a try. The plot is fairly simple but sometimes it's just nice to not have to think so much.This was a free kindle download when I got it, and I will probably eventually be purchasing the rest of the series.
5	1317427200	This is so beautifully crafted, reading it makes my heart break that the author is not earning royalties.  a LOT of work went into this...I know, because I'm a writer too... A LOT OF WORK went into this gorgeous, layered, rich story.Why on earth is this free?  I'm not meaning to complain, here. I think it's great that it's free, because if it hadn't been, I most likely would not have found this author.But ... this is so beautifully done, I stopped several times while I was reading it, just to mourn the fact that it's free.  That's a first for me.The only thing unfortunate about it is the title, which isn't compelling enough to  adequately represent the haunting, beautiful writing contained in this piece of work.Who will like this:  readers who liked The Hunger Games, the Pendragon series by D.J. Machale, books by Garth Nix or Terry Brooks; readers who like fantasy with danger and more sophisticated themes will enjoy this.  It's an exploration of the effects of war on society and an individual coming of age story; it's also an examination of the effects of isolation on a person, and what it means to be "outcast," whether by choice or force.the author is comfortable in the world he's created, so the reader can slip right into it--there aren't so many made-up words and names that you become aware of the writing and are constantly jolted out of immersion in the story.Snap it up while it's free!**edited:  it looks like there is an update to this book, I'm assuming it's been edited.  I love authors who do this - they're showing that they care about the quality of their product, and showing respect to the readers as well...another reason to appreciate this author.
5	1316563200	This book is probably called epic or high fantasy, and I don't read this genre much, because I admit to getting confused with all those books that have a rapid-fire introduction of a million characters with unusual names, and then I get bored and put them down. This book is easy reading, never mind the length. I found myself picking it up and losing track of time. I'm not an expert on them, but I know what I like: an interesting story with an early hook, likeable characters, a strong plot and some surprise twists. The Book of Deacon has all of that and more: a kick-butt heroine, dragons, wizards, magic spells and battle scenes. It is suitable for any age really, though probably mid-teens and up would appreciate the story most. If you look for a "maturity rating" in your books, yes, this is considered a "clean read", though there is romance too.All in all, fans of fantasy books are in luck, or even folks like me who occasionally pick up a book based on its appeal and not its genre.RaeBest O' Books Reviews
5	1316563200	I absolutely loved this book. It was clean, with still a lot of action and suspense. The detail and writing was great! I thouroughly enjoyed the book, and the writing was so well done, it was easy to get lost in. No matter your genre of choice, you will not regret opening this book. Loved it! It caused me to buy the second book, and that rarely happens! Thank you to the author, and I compliment you on your talent.
5	1316476800	Like most of the reviewers of this book I am astounded by the cost of such a fantastic story (its FREE), the Author has come up with some wonderful characters that are enjoyable to travel with. I loved having a book of a good length that I could sink into. A great lead character....swords..fighting....magic....all the good ingredients are catered for. I am writing this review whilst downloading the next one in the series, I would recommend this book to any fantasy reader. This is short review as I cant wait to start the next book....cheers all and enjoy.
3	1316390400	Two empires have been fighting for 150 years, and that is bad.  There is a girl, and she is good.  She doesnt like war, what good girl does?  She finds a magic sword (of course), a fantastical pet/companion (every hero needs one to be sure) and she learns magic and fighting (you didnt think she would train in knitting, surely?)  There is a boy that likes her.  There is a prophecy about, que music suggesting great originality, "the chosen".All boxes checked, we are good to go with fantasy in the classic (if not original) tradition.  For good measure, throw in a half-man half-fox, a few baddies with mysterious motives, some mysterious goings on, and what else do ya need?Like cotton candy, I found the book easy reading, mildly pleasant, totally harmless, but forgot about it right after it was gone.  The book has a young adult tone, no sex and it doesnt dwell on the violence.  Much and more time spent on the training, which is a little repetetive with the exception of the final test which was quite creative.  The plot and baddies are not really much revealed, and there is not a heck of a lot of action -- fights tend to be over in a page or two (and often much less).  The romance consists of the shy boy . . . not doing much about it.  Not a lot here, really, but what there is is pleasant enough, especially, perhaps, for the YA audience.If you like Frodo, want to study at Hogwarts & etc.., you might well try this book at free, and might enjoy it quite a bit.  Or not.  Maybe you'll feel like you've read it already and fall asleep mid-way.If you liked A Song of Fire and Ice (the current best selling fantasy epic) and want something similar what to do should already be obvious to you . . . look for something else.Conclusion:  Recommended - somewhat
4	1315353600	The first few chapter of the book was boring, too many explanation. Although when you reach almost the middle part, that's when the excitement begins. The story does rely on same story plot for fantasy book where a nobody becomes a somebody. However the book has its own fairy-tale and adventures that is worth reading.
5	1314057600	I am picky on what I read, I like things to show up in a novel a certain way. This trilogy gave me everything I look for in a fantasy novel and is a perfect representation on great fantasy novels. This is one of those books you cannot put down, it is interesting, it completely draws you in with imaginative accounts, very well addressed characters that you feel you know, and magic. There is so much these trilogy has to offer, pick it up and you will not be disappointed, and for a free book it is well worth the read. Enjoy.
4	1313193600	I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative of this book, and was so drawn to the characters that I purchased the remainder of the trilogy. HOWEVER--someone NEEDS TO go through and correct the typos, the spelling errors, the misplaced words...It became quite distracting by the end.
5	1313020800	I downloaded the first book, this one, just because I was looking for a free fantasy novel.  It turned out to be a very intriguing novel.  Of course, then I had to have the second and third novels, although I delayed reading them for a while just so I could have a treat ahead!  Now I have finished all three and the author has hinted that we may see these characters again.I am not a professional editor or author, but I have read several thousand books in my lifetime.  There are a few authors that I have come back to again and again and Lallo has now taken his place in that pantheon.  He has a talent for taking characters and growing them into people that you want to know and re-visit again and again.  I re-read very few books, but this trilogy will be on my re-read list.  I will wait with bated breath for a visit to this world again.
5	1312416000	Mr. Lallo has just put his imprint on the world of Science/Fantasy.If he does nothing else he will be remembered for this book. I just finished the first book of the trilogy and all I can say is  WOW!!! The story to this point is superb. The book is an easy read and is not overblown with useless verbage and descriptions that are not necessary to the story. The book has numerous hooks that draw you in and won't let you go. I'm not going to attempt to predict the path of the story because I'd probably be wrong.I purchased the remaining two thirds of the trilogy within about five minutes of finishing this one. Can't wait to feel the hooks again.
5	1311897600	I had the pleasure of reading this book this week.. I am a huge sci-fantasy fan and this by far is one of the best new authors I have read.. I look forward to reading the next 2 books. And that is saying a lot because when I first read this I did not realize it was a trilogy and probably wouldn't have read it if I had. I prefer 1 book stories, but this was worth the read and I wanted more..more and more.. I can't say I found anything I disliked about this book... GOOD job Joseph Lallo.. hope to read more from you in the future!!
2	1311206400	I did not make it past 18 percent (whatever page that is)on my kindle. it started out with promise, but the one to many inconsistencies ruined it for me, along with the apparently endless descriptions of tavern food.the heroine is supposedly on the road since age 6, but is so trusting of strangers that she leaves money dangling before their eyes, ...really, she didn't learning anything in 15 some odd years of on the road travel?she apparently survives in blizzard like conditions, assumes horses only pull sleds have no endurance, and despite being warned everyone is out to get her, goes merrily into town after town, getting into the expected trouble.I know its fantasy but a little common sense.  this free book leaves me digging though my real book shelves searching for a real author , like salvatore, or wurts, or West or elliot.  just to remind myself that good fantasy exists!
5	1311206400	Don't you just love/hate it when you start a book you can't put down?  I definitely got caught up in this book and loved it.  I have to agree with others-there were a lot of typographical errors that stopped the flow.
5	1310601600	Myranda lives in a world that has been torn by war for more than a century, and she is one of the few who dare long for peace. That alone is enough to make her an outcast. Her inadvertent discovery makes her one of the most wanted criminals in the land. The Book of Deacon is an entrancing work that will keep you guessing until the very end.
5	1310428800	I didn't know what to expect when I downloaded this free book to my Kindle, but once I started reading I knew I had found a winner.  I loved the story and couldn't put it down.  I wish we could buy the whole series for our library at school.  I had to buy to other two in the series, but they were worth it as well.  If you like books that have adventure, dragons, magic, and other interesting characters you will enjoy this series.
5	1310256000	Like most, I downloaded this book because it was free.  When I got around to reading it I was surprised by an engaging story that made me look forward to reading the book whenever I had the chance.  I believe it is now one of my new favorites.  The characters are well-deveoloped and the storyline, though slow at times, is all necessary for the full tale to be told.  As soon as I finished this book I immediately bought the others and finished the trilogy in its entirety in the weekend.  While the other two books were not as long or as detailed as the first, the movement of the storyline would seem to require the more condensed story.  This was unfortunate but did not detract from the overall interesting story.To answer a few of the criticisms I have read in other reviews, yes, there are a number of typos within the books, but as they have been self-published without the benefit most other books often have, this is understandable.  Mostly you can understand the intention of lines, and unlike even some paper books I've read, at least there's no missing pages!As to Myranda being a Mary Sue, or too good at everything...well, some of that is explained in later books, so I hesitate to answer that.  If you want a bit of a spoiler continue reading....Myranda is revealed to be a Chosen, and while the methods of her choosing are different that some of the others, most of the Chosen are meant to be prodigies.  This would explain her quick learning of the magic arts, in addition, sometimes people are just good at some things.  I didn't find it to be a problem when it applied to her ability to learn.  Quite in contrast would be when she went to the outside world.  I continually found myself wondering, why, if she was a master, she ALWAYS seemed to run into troubles her magic was unable to counter.  If you are concerned about her being so good at everything, read the next few books.  She's not.  She's just good at learning, not always application.Overall, I found a series that I really enjoyed which has been a difficulty when it comes to fantasy of late.  If you enjoy Fantasy novels you will like this book.
5	1309996800	I enjoyed this book very much. There were some parts that I raised eyes at, but this was a great book. I had trouble putting it down. I loved the Full Master test and how quickly Miranda can think on her feet. I look forward to reading the next 2 books in the series.
5	1309737600	This is not a short story by an amateur writer, this is a full novel that is delightfully written. The characters are so real you come to know them and want to know how the story will continue.  I could not put this book down, but when I did it was always in the back of my mind. I am excited to download the second book in the trilogy.
5	1309478400	This book was a well thought out Fantasy. Each character was well thought out. Myranda is an interesting main character. What I love about this book is it isn't cliche' at all!! Excited for the rest of the trilogy!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Perfect for walking with your kindle! (Watch out for parked cars in the road, I ran into one reading this)
5	1309132800	This book combines great characters with a wonderful and flawless plot into a captivating and clean story. It is a bit slow at some times, but it is still facinating.
5	1308960000	I am currently reading the last book in the series and I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole series.  It has been a verrrrry long time since I have come across a book and series that has kept me up way past my bedtime simply because I wanted to know what happened next.  This author did an excellent job at building these characters into people that I care about.  It was wonderful to watch him masterfully develop these characters personalities and they each are so different.  Their goal is the same, but for different motivations and different approaches to the ultimate goal.  This is a classic good versus evil book, but so much more.  He expertly shows how each character and what they stand for and their inner beliefs change the others, and make them question themselves.  Myranda is a strong leading character and her personality and beliefs never waver.  I cannot say enough about the talent of this author and I hope to read some more of his work when I finish this series.  Kudos, Mr. Lallo for writing such and amazing book with characters who practically jump off the pages.
5	1308787200	I love the development of the characters, the plot build up, the whole story.  I was kept in suspense,  nothing was given away too early.  The only problems I had was the distraction of the poor spelling and the obvious lack of proofreading.  I liked this book so much, though, that I would like to offer my services as a proofreader to the author, for no charge.  I have worked as a professional proofreader.Over all, great book.  You'll want to get the rest of the series to find out what happens.
4	1308614400	I downloaded this since it was free and I was wanting something to read.  It is not my normal type of book but I was very surprised and pleased.  I have already now read the other 2 in this trilogy and I enjoyed the whole story.  The price was good for the other two at 2.99.  I would recommend the trilogy to those who liked the Lord of the Rings and that type of books.  I did find typos throughout the books but wasn't that big of a problem. I wish they were also in book form because I would get them for my son.
2	1308528000	After reading the strong reviews for The Book of Deacon, I was expecting a strong, suspenseful book.While individual sentences are well crafted, Lallo suffers from too much "telling" and not enough "showing." A good novel allows the reader to understand the emotions of characters through their actions and words - The Book of Deacon simply tells you how they feel.Ultimately, the book is bogged down with pages upon pages of exposition, with little movement of the plot or development of characters in the first 20%.Lallo has potential, but still needs to grow in order to capture readers.
3	1308268800	I always enjoy looking into new fantasy books, and with a free Kindle edition, I was more than willing to give this one a try.  The overall story was good and I really did like the setup and the setting, but the writing leaves something to be desired.  The more I read, the more rushed the story and writing felt, and the less I cared about any of the other characters in the book.  Most of them come and go with no time to find out about them, so there's no reason for me to care what happens to them.*probally spoilers, don't read if you want follow it for yourself*There's also the feeling I get about halfway through that I'm reading a story about a Mary Sue.  For those that don't know, a Mary Sue character is a term usually used to describe a character that is made so awesome and nearly perfect that everyone loves them and they're so wonderful at anything they try.  That is our main character.  She finds a magic sword, and now everyone is after her.  The bad guys want her because she found the sword, and the rebels think she is awesome just because she found the sword.  From there, she learns magic in record time, befriends almost everyone she meets, and becomes the most popular girl in the village.There are also many plot points that get dropped and never resolved, such as the sword.  I understand with a series that you want to leave some parts of the main story open, but the sword is the whole reason she ended up where she did, so it would be nice to have a clue WHY the sword is so important.  There were other minor plots that just disappeared, as well as characters that I thought would be main characters.  By the end of the book, I had so many questions unanswered that it was just a confusing mess.As I said above, there are good points.  The actual storyline had a great deal of potential and I liked the setting.  However, the book itself suffers from the the random fantasy cliches and Mary Sue-ness of the main character, so I can't see myself getting the next two.
3	1307750400	Ok, first things first.  I picked up this book via my Kindle because of its price (free).  And for a free ebook, it is more than worth its cost, which is your time.  I would not have been upset if I had paid a small amount to purchase this book.Now, onto the book review itself.  This is a simple tale that relies upon the tried and true fantasy formula of a "nobody" coming into their own as a previously undiscovered prodigy has been used by many fantasy authors.  This formula therefore requires either significant character development or a type of twist to the story to rise to the five star rating.  While this first book utilizes this formula, the character development is still somewhat lacking and even the "education" process wherein the heroine in this book learns to control her power is simplistic and repetitive.  If the author was attempting to write fantasy targeted at a child or young teenager, this might be appropriate, but I did not get that impression.  I believe this was fantasy that was to be consumed by an adult audience, therefore the lack of sophistication compels me to remove a star from five to four.So why did I give this book a three star rating?  Editing!  It is a shame that a good tale should suffer from clunky language, and both grammatical and spelling errors.  A professional editor could definitely assist the author in polishing this story.  At that point I would be happy with a four star rating for this story.So overall, as it currently stands, I give this tale three out of five stars.  A good read, one that I would not mind paying a small sum for, and definitely worth the current cost of only your time.
5	1307577600	The world unfolding in an entertaining and readable manner.  The undercurrent of an anti-war book written for a new fantasy world.  There does seem to be a bit of misandry as a prevalent theme also, but there are two other book to evaluate that criticism.
4	1307404800	It sounds like a backhanded compliment but this is a great, free book. Many times I shy away from free books because the quality is lacking. That is not the case with "The Book of Deacon". I highly recommend this book if you like fantasy adventure.There are a couple of typos and I wish that there were chapters rather than just a page break but the content of the book is what matters and it is good.
5	1307145600	I had the opportunity to download this book for free off of Amazon's free downloads.  I am so glad I did!  My family took a trip to Squam Lake and instead of swimming and hiking, I sat in the sun and read this book.  I had such a hard time putting it down, I started to take it with me on the car rides.  It is so refreshing to read a good fantasy book with a female protagonist.  While yes there are a few typos, there aren't enough to take away from the entire book as a whole.  I definitely recommend "The Book of Deacon" to any fantasy lovers.  Like another review said, I never found myself skimming over any sections!
4	1306886400	I'm a big fan of fantasy and this is a well crafted work.  I like the characters and story line, as well as the reluctant hero that is developing in the character of Lain. Myranda is also a good character, but almost too good - I am wondering if she will ever show any flaws that will make her more real.  I would have liked to see more exploration of the culture that Myranda came from as well as the south, but maybe that will come. I bought the next two books as soon as I finished this one. The only thing that detracts from the book is missing words in sentences. I didn't notice misspelled words but there were at least a dozen instances of words omitted in the sentence that would have made the flow smoother. Additionally, there were a few incomplete or fragmented sentences which also affect the flow. But it isn't enough to detract from the story. Well worth the read.
5	1306713600	A refreshingly original book.  If you like fantasy books, this is something you should read.  I loved it and did not want it to end.  I just downloaded the next book in the series.  I can't wait to get started.
5	1306713600	This was an incredibly good book. It was free through Amazon but LOL it worked, I am hooked! Just bought the second book.
5	1306627200	I'm a huge fan of fantasy. However, I'm always hesitant with authors that are new to me. This is due to the fact that while I love good fantasy, there is sadly a great deal more AWFUL fantasy out there than good. I only downloaded this book because it was free. I can't say how delighted I was to discover that it was well written and captivating. While not to the level of the true greats in fantasy, it really was well worth the read. I honestly couldn't put it down. The characters are well developed "real" people, not stereotypes at all. Other than a few truly evil individuals, most characters are very true to life. Not shining princes that can do no wrong, nor fully evil people. They come out as realistic individuals. Each with their own struggles, good points and issues.While there are certainly some of the same classic good vs. evil, magic, dragons and other standard fantasy cliche's, the author does a great job of making her books very much her own. Never once did I find myself feeling as if I had already been to this land in another series. Nor was I able to guess what would happen well in advance.With finances as they are, I'm not currently buying many, if any books. However, after reading the first one, I just had to at least check out the next two - The Great Convergence and The Battle of Verril.  At only 2.99 each, I broke down and purchased them. Getting to read an excellent trilogy for only $6.00 is a heck of a deal.The Kindle version does have many of the typo's and editing issues that I find so common in free Kindle books.  I'm starting to believe that this is due to them being transcribed to digital as cheaply/quickly as possible and not due to poor editing in the original novels.  None of it was so far out there that I had trouble figuring out what was supposed to be said. Just slightly annoying, as I hate reading misspellings and such.Still, I would highly recommend getting this series while it's still such an amazing bargain!  I was also tickled to read, at the end of the last book, that there may be more books coming to be set in the same land, and possibly containing some of the characters I have come to love.For the price, this book and it's author earned the 5 stars from me without hesitation! I'll say it again. If you are a fantasy fan, get all three while they are so cheap!
5	1306368000	This book was a happy surprise for me. Being unemployed, my book budget is limited,so,to be truthful, the price was its first draw--free! However, once I got past the annoying device of introducing the story as a a chronicle written in antiquity, the story rolled along nicely. The story stands on it's own, without using the chronicling at the beginning.It works just fine at the end, after we get that Deacon is it's author, though. The reason it bothered me was that that the chronicler would not have been so emmeshed in the view point character's mind or in the minds of the ancillary characters, since they did not speak to Deacon.This might be a personal preference, and it didn't distract me for long, once into the story I kept reading.I think the author does some solid characterization, no deus ex machina plot saving, the pacing is good. In fact, this is just plain old-fashioned good story telling. Believable characters, interesting plot and nice writting.It please me that it won't be cataloged on my Kindle in the "If you get really bored you can finish one of these" A catagory that has been growing way too much. Thanks for the nice read!
5	1306108800	I was transported to a land of fantasy while reading this book. How many books can you say made you feel as though you were actually one of the characters looking on as the story unfolded? Joseph Lallo has spun an intriguing web of characters, lands far, far away, and snares any reader daring to read the first page. Think of your favorite author. Have one in mind? Read The Book of Deacon and you will have a new favorite author...Joseph Lallo. Hello, Hollywood? Someone needs to sit up and take notice of this book!!!
4	1306022400	So, like others, I got this as a free Kindle download.  It's a very good book - enough so that I will not hesitate to purchase the last two books in the series as soon as I finish this review.Myranda is an orphan of a war that has continued through generations of her people.  Her home city is obliterated, and she's left wandering in the northern kingdoms.  And because of her total loss of home and family, she hates not the enemy, but the war itself.  A position that leaves her a friendless wanderer in a land where patriotism is the overriding force of the day.The main characters have been developed well.  You can see as the heroine grows and changes through the course of the story.  There is a particular bit of growth at the end that is done rather well.  Lots of character backstory is hinted at, that I'm sure we'll see develop through the course of the series.The story itself is good.  The author keeps the story concise, and moving along.  You're not inundated with unneeded characters, and he doesn't waste time of over-developing minor, throwaway characters (a trait that I wish David Weber would develop more).  And the story is told mainly through actions and conversations, not lengthy passages of exposition.  This provides for a good pace to the story.So, are there some weaknesses?  As has been mentioned in other reviews, there are some typos in the text.  But I'll say that I can vouch for the author's comment in another review that he's fixed a lot of these, as I didn't find too many.  And honestly, I've encountered just as many typos in books published by Del Rey and other top-line publishing houses.  There are a few passages that I think could have used a little bit more description - the one that stands out is the heroine's confrontation with the grey cloaks just before she gets rescued by the Undermine.  The passage where she whirls to stab one with her stiletto seemed like it was missing a line or two.Some readers might find the world-building a bit murky, but I tend to think that was a conscious decision by the author to keep the focus on the character and not weigh down the story with tons of exposition.  We are given just enough to understand that character, and that's all we really need.I think the biggest weakness is that perhaps Myranda is a bit too good at everything she sets her hand to.  She reminds me of Pug from Feist's Riftwar Saga.  Everything she tries to learn, she masters quicker than anyone else.  I'd have liked the story a bit more if, during her training, she'd had to struggle more to master something, rather than being a natural who had more conflict with her trainers than in her learning.  I'm left with the feeling that if she's not taken by surprise or treachery that she's going to dominate any straight up fight she's put into.So, to sum up...  if you have a Kindle and enjoy fantasy - you SHOULD read this book.  It's a very good story, with the promise of more good things to come.
5	1305936000	This was a free download I happened upon and was pleased to discover that it wasn't a blurb to entice me to buy the rest of the book. It's also a fairly long story at 8000 plus on the Kindle. It's a page turner and a fascinating read. Many times I read a free download but choose not to pursue the next books in the series, not so with this story! Also, the books are very reasonably priced at 2.99 to make it a bargain not often seen on Kindle, sad to say. Thank you for the wonderful books Mr. Lallo!
5	1305936000	It's 10am, I'm tired and need more coffee.. why? Because I was up until 1am reading this book. I couldn't put it down. What a great story! I can't wait to dig into the next one.
5	1305849600	This book showed up as a free download yesterday.  I woke up this morning and figured I would start a few pages of this book over coffee.  Seven hours later, I finished the book and bought the 2nd book in the series.I'm struggling to find the words to describe why I enjoyed the book.  It was a book about war, magic, wizards but it was done very differently than other books of that genre.  The character development was well done.  The good characters had flaws and the bad characters had redeeming qualities.  And, most importantly, I never found myself in skimming mode.  And, of course, the ultimate positive review of any book is to immediately purchase a 2nd book by that author (which I did).  If you are a fan of fantasy fiction, you will probably enjoy this book.
5	1305676800	Seldom do I download a free Kindle book that I am as satisfied with as I would have been if it were something purchased from the bookstore.  This happens to be one of those rare times.  I'm now off to purchase the rest of the series, I hope the writer continues with the same level of skill in his storytelling.  I like a good epic tale!One minor complaint, the book could stand another go-round with a proof reader.  Alter is a verb, Altar is a noun.****update 9/7/11****the author has worked with a professional editor and so the book file will soon be updated with a polished copy. [...] bookofdeacon.com/2011/09/06/a-letter-from-the-editor/If grammar and spelling are the only reason you haven't picked the book up, you no longer have an excuse :)
5	1297036800	I am an inactive, 33 year old, overweight American. I prefer watching tv to jogging, pasta to salads, and driving to walking, and I have a list of excuses a mile long as to why I don't exercise.  I've tried it all, the turbo-jams, the pilates, the Zumba, and I even bought one of those Dance Dance Revolutions mats (horrible on carpets, even with non-slip pads) and they all collected dust after a week....until Dance Central. This year, in desperation I joined Weight Watchers and after 5 weeks of watching every morsel going into my mouth I've lost 2 pounds....sad, demoralizing, and yet somehow inspirational.Despite being an obese white-chick I like to think I have rhythm, a little soul, a little shake to my groove thing.  I don't.  Really...I can sway my hips and shuffle my feet, but I have no concept of any dance move that happened after the Running Man.  Yet, when I saw the commercials for Dance Central and saw those cute little teens bopping about I was inspired. I imagined myself dancing around in cute little outfits, and finally getting to a club and have moves I wasn't ashamed of. So I bought a Kinect, some games, and specifically Dance Central.I'm in LOVE! I began over a week ago, sneaking the disc in and making immediately for the first routine, and Lady Gaga's Poker Face.  I took it easy, selected easy levels, and within minutes I was moving and grooving.  Even better, I was sweating! I practiced, I performed, I even battled against myself (sad, but true, I kicked my own butt).  Then I moved on to the next song, and repeated the process.  Before I realized it I had spent an HOUR shaking my sad little groove thing, laughing, and groaning as the camera on the Kinect took pictures of me dancing and displayed it for me in full horrific form (a motivator for weight loss if ever I saw it).I had a blast!  I spent an hour dancing and sweating! And I thought about it every day until I could get home and do it all over again!  I even downloaded the four songs I had been working with (I've moved to MEDIUM!) and listen to them on the way to work, imagining myself dancing to it.  Sure, I have aches where I didn't know it was possible (my elbows? really?) and my neighbors are probably sick of hearing Hey Mami and Evacuate the Dance Floor, but I'm having a blast.  Me.  Sloth-incarnate.Is it sustainable exercise? Oh yes. Will it grow with me as I (hopefully) shrink? Why yes, as you move up in your abilities you have more music and dance routines to choose from. If you get far enough you can even download new songs and routines from Harmonix if you choose.I can't say enough about Dance Central. Easy to control (without controllers either), easy to navigate, a blast to do, and incredibly addicting! I'm even thinking about inviting friends over to play....can you say Dance oFF!?  Electric Boogaloo watch out!2 more hours of work before I can go home and DANCE!
5	1202169600	is anyone else bothered by the end of the Publisher's Weekly review? "the ending to pat too make the plot memorable"the to and too is mixed up. kind of takes the power away from their opinion.anyway, loved the story!!
