5	1405296000	P&P is an icon for the ages. A month ago my grand daughter was in her high school play as Mary, the bookish sister.
5	1405209600	Great book
5	1405209600	Classic story, you never get tired of it!!
2	1405209600	It was o.k. but skipped around a lot.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more when I was younger.  I did see the movie, which I enjoyed.
1	1405123200	Hardest read ever.
5	1405123200	I really enjoyed this book! Loved the language and enjoyed getting a feeling for those times! You have to wade through it at times but it is worth it!
5	1405123200	A wonderful story. Set in the 1800's, would be very interesting if someone adapted it to modern times. A classic like Romeo and Juliette. I  rented the recent movie which was also outstanding.
5	1405123200	Just awesome
5	1405123200	How am I qualified to critique a classic like this?  It was great to read Jane's novel again and reopen the time capsule into a bygone age.  Wonderful!  Consider her young age at the time she penned this masterpiece;  her humour and insight were astounding, her storytelling skills were brilliant and her ability to step back and record the social standards and mores of the time simply amazing.
5	1404950400	I reread this book several times a year,and each time I find something new to enjoy--use of language, humor, etc.
5	1404864000	I love it!  Amazing how much of a page turner it is even with so little actually happening in the story.
5	1404864000	Excellent read.
5	1404777600	This is almost funny!  I'm not even going to pretend I could ever possibly rate or review Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice!  lol  The work clearly stands alone as a literary classic.  This version, for Kindle, is fine.  It's fun having it with me all the time.  I can look at it on a whim whenever I want.  :)  But, there is something about the printed page...  Happy Summer reading!  Cheers!
5	1404691200	I love this book and the story.  The 'modern' adaptations do not do it justice.
5	1404518400	Wonderful!
5	1404518400	best story of the ages
5	1404518400	I read this in High School--and was happy to see it was offered in Kindle Format! I shall be reading this one again soon...
5	1404432000	An all time favourite! My first kindle read. Will never tire of it.
5	1404432000	this book is a staple in my library. i get lost in the romance, clothes, parties, back drops etc. it is a feel good book without being corny or sexual. pride and prejudice rocks!
4	1404345600	a good classic
5	1404345600	In my opinion, one of the best stories, ever.  Don't be put off by the superfluous language.  It is a window into a different time in history and how people spoke.  That being said, it Is remarkable that a woman of that era was so brilliant.  Geniuses are born in all eras and of all genders.
5	1404345600	Perfect book, perfect story - can't go wrong with this, forever!
5	1404259200	Pride and prejudice is the best book I've ever read. I found the stowy stunning!
5	1404259200	This is my favorite novel of Jane Austen's, and one of my favorite novels. I asked my literature-writing instructor why I might be preferring this novel to Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, for example. He explained it in terms of classic story structure. When you have a strong male protagonist (Mr. Darcy), you need a strong heroine for counterbalance. If Elizabeth Bennett were mealy-mouthed, it just wouldn't do. There would be little dramatic tension. And we can't image Darcy falling for someone without spirit. Classic story structure requires an individual overcome a series of obstacles to reach their goal said my instructor. There are four primary outcomes to any story: they reach the goal and are happy, reach the goal and are unhappy, don't reach the goal and are unhappy or don't reach the goal and are happy anyway.In this case, Elizabeth Bennett is in need of a husband, a good one to match her intellect and character. When she meets Mr. Darcy, although there is some initial attraction, there are the obvious obstacles: difference in social class, his remote aloofness, her annoying mother and obnoxious sisters, another suitor, lack of opportunity to meet, Elizabeth's pride etc. How they overcome these obstacles provides the dramatic tension.When Darcy acts arrogant and superior, Elizabeth reacts strongly and lets him know of her disinterest. The dramatic tension increases as we sense underneath they are both attracted to one another and might make ideal mates if these superfluous obstacles wouldn't keep getting in the way.Someone wisely said each story is either a David & Goliath tale (lone individual with limited resources overcomes a giant problem) or a Romeo & Juliet tale (two star-crossed lovers try to overcome obstacles to getting together.) Is this a more modern enactment of Romeo & Juliet with a different ending? Possibly. It's a tale most of us can identify with and have experienced personally at least one, if not all four, of the endings. It's a classic love story written in Austen's inimitable style.
5	1404259200	I have always wanted to read this book, but never had.  I purchased the audio book and it was fabulous!
5	1404259200	Jane Austen. I have a complicated relationship with her works. I love them because I can escape reality and believe in a love that realistically speaking I know I would be opposed to. But that's why I read her romance- because it was ahead of its time and because it really pulls at my heart strings no matter how many walls I put up.
4	1404259200	Great to reread an old favourite
5	1404259200	I love it!
5	1404172800	Love Kindle FREE!
4	1404172800	Classic love story!!!
5	1404172800	Ended the book with a smile on my face. Why did I wait do long to read this??!!
5	1404172800	It was thought provoking and an easy read.Much funnier than I expected, in a very dry fashion.The women of consequence are strong vibrant characters.
2	1404172800	I've heard rave reviews about this book, which made me anxious to read it... it was so dull. Definitely not my style.
5	1404086400	I enjoyed the book.  I wasn't expecting to like the classic as much as I did, but I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I ended up buying her complete collection to read.
5	1404000000	The most classic love story there ever was. No matter the amount of times read, it still gives the same emotion.
5	1404000000	An excellent book is well worth the recommendation if you enjoy the old English period of grandness and stature and romance.
5	1404000000	I chose this book because it was a classic I had not read before. I particularly enjoyed reading about that time in history and seeing how much had changed for the better.
5	1403913600	I have  read this book more than any other and love it. You can not find a book in today's society that expresses the innocence of love and the importance of lasting respect and regard for your spouse.
4	1403827200	The story itself is a wonderful read, the version, however, is lacking. There were sections that were oddly separated, one instance in which a sentence began then was abruptly ended without sense, and several instances in which dashes appeared in the place of names, particularly &#34;--shire.&#34;I did, however, love how this wonderful story unfolded and will be purchasing a hard copy to ensure proper spelling, grammar, and the full use of names. Had this been an excellent copy, I would have rated it 5 stars.
5	1403827200	Loooove this book. I have read it countless times and each time feels like the first time. I'm obsessed with the book. If you have not read it, you are missing out.
1	1403740800	Very boring!! Not interesting at all!!  This book did not hold my interest. When I read several chapters, I decided not to finish the book. Thought it would be good but was not!
5	1403740800	I make it a rule to re-read Pride and Prejudice every few years.  I find myself have a different reaction every few years as a consequence, so while I will write this with conviction, I suspect in a few years my opinion may be different.As one woman to another and this time more seasoned then the one who has read this work a few years ago, I love the common sense applied in this work to judgment of character.  Unlike in my previous years, this time I noticed right away inconsistencies in the anti-protagonist character of Whickam. To put it simply, in a man&#8217;s words do not match his actions, the man&#8217;s character is at best is suspect.  More to the point, Austin warns us that in long term relationships, even more then affectation, we should seek mutual respect toward each other not just of the heart but of the mind, if we hope that our relationships will endure.  In other words, no matter how much we may like the person, if we do not respect him, the content of his mind, his sense of dignity and his moral grounds, no amount of heat, passion, and interest can hope to maintain a relationship.  This is a lesson I sadly did not fully grasp when I first read this novel as a young adult, and now that it has taken me 37 years to learn it, I find it very sad that I can only find it affirmed in Austin&#8217;s work, instead of having had the advantage of grasping it as a life lesson decades ago.As to the subject of the two main characters, its interesting how different they both appear to me now as opposed to when I was younger.  I recall thinking Mr. Darcy, in the past, to being the best man possible.  I had a bit of a girl crush&#8230; But not now.  With what I think is a much more sober mind, I find him, especially in the beginning, to be haunty, aloof, oafish, rude, lacking in class and basic social skills, and completely inappropriate, and if I find this with the eyes of a woman who lives in the 21st century, I cannot imagine how this stood out during the time period when this book was written.  Likewise, I find Elizabeth also non-sensibly proud, rude, prejudist, pessimistic, and taking too much pleasure in finding flaws and fault with people (although so many do deserve it.)  In short, the Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy that we meet in the beginning of the book are in no way people we would like to be friends with, even in modern times!  I have asked myself, then, why this deep affection for a character in a book.  What I can say is, with some amazement actually, is simply the power and force of his love for Elizabeth.  He changes his behavior, his entire demeanor, because he loves her that deeply, and because that love teaches him the greatest lessons of his life.  He evolves as a result, something most people seldom do.  He is able to evolve because his core characteristics, who he is at his core, was sound.  His love for her has made him a better man, and this, I think, teaches us not to love Mr. Darcy, but to love the potential in all men that we encounter.  That potential exists for many.  This example is presented to all.  Will the men in our lives take it?  It is a choice that is up to them.
5	1403654400	This was an entirely different story than I thought it was.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  And so it happens quite often, after I read the story, I began to read another book which made reference to characters in &#34;Pride...:&#34;  and I was quite pleased that I understood the reference.
5	1403568000	This is a marvelous story about a woman who refused to accept the limitations imposed on her by a rigid society who managed a subtle rebellion against those strictures, who saw clearly the faults of those she loved, was able to recognize her own failings and wise enough to know when and where and with whom to let go of the barriers that threatened her happiness.
5	1403568000	gotta love it! many have seen the movie, but if you haven't yet read the original novel, you MUST! adds depth to characters, plot, themes, etc.
5	1403568000	Much fun in reading an old classic.  Good story line always a winner.  I never did see the movie but now I will.
5	1403481600	The themes and characters are so timeless that is would be impossible not to relate. It is also funny while tackling a serious issues. A must read!
5	1403481600	After many years of good intentions a long flight provided a good opportunity to read this book in one sitting. I enjoyed the writing and the characters so much that I read Emma the next day.  I have ordered several other books by the author- the ultimate recommendation.  I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice more than Emma, but both were lovely summer reads-languid and gentle but with enough witty bite to keep the story from becoming too cloying.
5	1403481600	My all time favourite book - Pride and Prejudice - with Jane Austen's powerful character sketches. Loved reading it again.
5	1403395200	5 stars of course for anyone who has ever read it (over and over) A genuine classic that never grows old.
5	1403395200	I now understand why this classic has withstood the test of time.  Although the conversations are written in another century, the content remains as fascinating as if written in today's style.
5	1403395200	Love this book just like I love the movie if you want to read a book that entertain  this is the book for you
5	1403308800	It's always a pleasure to read this book, I love the story line as well as the manner of writing!
2	1403222400	I know there is a movie as well, haven't seen the movie either. I just was told by many people to watch it or read it but I couldn't get into it.. I'm sure it's great though!
5	1403136000	If you never read Pride and Prejudice do yourself a favor and read it.  Worth the time and a good read.
5	1403136000	I had read this book a lot of years ago. I enjoyed it and I found that although it is a lot different from the books written more recently it was still very enjoyable
3	1403049600	It was good.  It gave you the feeling of being there.  Sometimes the wording tripped me up.  I need to read more of the old English style.
4	1402790400	I was immediately hooked by Mr. Bennet's dry humor when faced with the antics of his wife and daughters.  Only 4 stars because it dragged a little and got somewhat &#34;wordy&#34; due to the interaction of characters observing English &#34;civility&#34;.  All in all a worthwhile and witty read. And everyone who deserved it, and some who didn't, got a happy ending.
5	1402704000	Loved this book so much!  Most definitely my favorite book. My heart was throbbing the whole entire way. Love, love, loved it!!
5	1402704000	I somehow started this book without knowing anything about it other than that it is widely lauded. Upon completion, I can say I greatly enjoyed the characters, story and language incorporated in Pride and Prejudice.
5	1402617600	I give this book the brightest rating because it is such a good story !Anyone who wants to read a book that leaves then feeling good and well.pleased will be thoroughly satisfied with this book.
5	1402444800	This book is so beautifully written and captivating.  An amazing love story. The characters are well developed and surprise you and evolve.  I love the dictionary built into the book I used it quite a few time to help better understand the dialogue
5	1402444800	Let me preface this short review by saying that I am a once-a-book reader. I do not reread books. When I came upon P&P a few years back I was instantly attached to all of the characters. I related to Lizzy, and sometimes Jane. Mr. Bingly was my dream until I read about Mr. Darcy. Oh, Mr. Darcy! I love the old English grammar and text. The words are so vibrant and the descriptions bring everything to life. I feel like a teenage girl in love again when I read about Mr. Darcy and Lizzy's romance, even though I am a married woman with two kids. This is the one book I will read over and over again.
5	1402358400	This has been one of my favorite books for years and I am very glad I was able to get it for free on my kindle.
5	1402358400	I actually dip into my favorite passages, one which I just finished.  It began with Elizabeth thanking Darcy for his help with Lydia, and, getting caught up in the lovely story, I read till the end.  Oh, how I relish over and over his words of love and introspection: "By you I was properly humbled."  These are deservedly one of the most beloved couple in literature.  I also, compulsively read P and P variations and sequels.  While Austen's elegant language can not be reproduced, the stories are often so wonderful that it doesn't matter.  Strongly recommend, and the variations and sequels, too.
5	1402358400	I loved the descriptions.  It was like being there in person so long ago.  The characters were powerful and I either loved or hated the character.
4	1402272000	i love it but whos who? p.s a wee bit confusing.:)elizibeth is the main charictor in this book.i is really confusing in the beggining.
4	1402272000	A fun summer read - holds your attention with great characters and it's just the right length. Wraps up a bit quickly though.
5	1402272000	I will confess often being in the same state of mind as Elizabeth Bennett , weather right or wrong, and I feel that connecting with a character is the most Important thing to me either than the book being so intriguing. Darcy is a well sought after character, in many an opinion, and for good reason. If you like a romance between an outspoken woman and a seemingly prideful man, you've got  yourself a read.
5	1402185600	Price and Prejudice is by far my favorite Jane Austen novel. I read it at least once a year, and I can never get enough.
5	1402185600	My favorite of all novels.Nobody does it better.Even if you have seen the movies and the television shows: PrIde an Prejudice needs to be read!!
5	1402099200	Jane Austen is amazing! This book I read, listen & watch several times a year! It's an everlasting classic for a reason. I just love everything about this book!
5	1402012800	Amazing!! Hard to read but all the more worth the read. I encourage you to read it, never have I encountered a book I liked more.
5	1402012800	I've seen the movie and watched the video several times so it was fun and interesting to read this novel knowing what the characters looked like etc.
5	1401840000	This has always been one of my favorite novels. The absurdity of the mannerisms of the day are very nicely balanced by the true regard of Elizabeth and Darcy, and her sister and Bingley.
5	1401753600	This is my all-time favorite classic book.  Jane Austen is an incredible author!  I have read this book more than once and I enjoyed it immensely every time.
4	1401753600	I hate your books it not interesting for me to readI want a book that will make me want to read it.And try to put something interesting for people to like the book.Get a interesting book that will make people laugh.ONYINYE present her family
5	1401667200	This is a great book. Anyone that likes classics will love this book. It was very hard to put down.
4	1401667200	What can you say about a classic?  The sisters are silly.  The Dad is sarcastic.  The Mom flighty.  The Older two sisters are smart, composed and concerned about the family.  The suitors are welcomed, dismissed, dismissing and lustful.  Pride and prejudice abound from the women, and the men alike.
4	1401667200	I  have enjoyed mainly because it has broadened my meanings of the meaning of words. Many more words added to my vocabularyreading this book It is so amazing in the slow change in people's attitude and understanding...This book gives you an insight on how the Rich and The Famous truly think and what  is so important.  I did enjoy
5	1401580800	A great, classic novel and vocabulary lesson . The Kindle version is great, as it helps with the archaic/literary vocabulary.
3	1401580800	active ,so you don't want to put it down till you see if your thoughts are the same as the author. I like the mystery .
3	1401494400	I thought I would like it more than I did.  The flowery language was impressive but sometimes almost boring.  The content was a bit shallow, I felt.
5	1401494400	This is a very interesting book because it reflects the personalities of the rich and not so rich people.  It makes you stop and think about personal judgement of people and how wrong you were in the end.  Lots to learn from this book.
5	1401494400	I've read this book at least four times, but our bookclub voted on it for May, and I re-read for sake of discussion.As always, I discovered new tidbits previously missed, so took notes.  I'd forgotten how delightful the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth was, and must admit I realize the misunderstanding they underwent happens in modern day relationships also.Countless reviews are here, but I must reiterate how wonderful it was to read Jane Austen once again. If you are new to Austen - grab a notebook and pencil, and albeit you may struggle with the language, it is so beautiful and deep once you are a few chapters in you'll wish we all spoke this way today.I've decided to re-read this beautifuly written novel at least once every two years. It teaches so many important things, and refreshes us about the true meaning of pride versus vanity.Rhonda
4	1401408000	I can't believe I haven't read it sooner.  A. True classic.  A book for all women.  GreAt book club book.
5	1401408000	The language is sometimes hard to get through, but it is definitely worth it. I started trying to listen to it on CD but it was too hard to keep track of the characters. Much to discuss about how we tend to do the same thing today. Interesting comment about the difference between pride and vanity. &#34;Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.&#34;
5	1401408000	Pride &Prejudice and their negative impact are shown in such a way in different characters in this book.  While these qualities may be seen in different ways in people today, there's always the hope that they will be resolved as they were in Miss Austens  historic & timeless story.  Wish I would have read this classic earlier.
1	1401321600	I must surmise from my reaction to this classic that I have no appreciation for the finer things in life.  The female characters are a bunch of air heads that are significantly over indulged and have nothing else to do but simper  and fret.  The male characters are not paragons of thought either.  So much of miss  Austen for me.  Maxmontgomery
5	1401321600	I have read this book numerous times, it is still my favorite!  It is one of the greatest love stories of all time.
4	1401321600	An instructional tale regarding the progression of good love and the advancement of the thoughtful and kind. And a well written warning regarding the frailty of shallow connections and the limits of the foolish.
5	1401235200	Although it starts a bit slow, give it time,  once you become familiar with the characters you will love it. The mother is hilarious, the father is adorable. English is not my strong subject, but oh my goodness, once you tune into the english language back in that era you will comprehend and the writing becomes visual in your imagination.
5	1401235200	Great book!  Such a wonderful and simple time.  I would recommend this book to everyone, male and female.  Very enjoyable.
1	1401235200	I know it is a classic and I thought I could stick with it but it is just too sophisticated for me and beginning so dragging and boring I just only finished 10 chapters before giving up on it. I do wonder if the plot ever gets interesting.
5	1401148800	What a great story. I never tire of reading it. I love the characters.Jane Austen is still  the best.
5	1401148800	No romance can ever compare to Austen's Elizabeth and Darcy. They are the epitome of all that is right with love and have inspired daydreams of future happily ever afters for generations. Austen truly is unequalled.
5	1401062400	It's my favorite book. This kindle version makes it easy to read especially when you can make annotations and make use of the dictionary right on the spot.
5	1401062400	It was free, so that's a plus I guess. I require more words to submit. potato fire pants juice and
5	1401062400	Can't believe I've reached this stage of life without ever having read Pride and Prejudice.  Totally delightful -- wonderful characters and laugh-out-loud funny in parts.  Just wonderful writing.  If you, like me, have gone through life so far without opening this book, remedy the situation immediately!
5	1401062400	Pride and Prejudice is a classic that is truly one of the greatest novels of all time. I loved it!
5	1400976000	Her writing style is perhaps the best I have ever seen for a novel. The pace of the book moves along quickly and she lets you know what you need to know about every character in a very concise way. She gives you a good picture of aristocracy in England at the time, but more than this she gives you the story of a family and shows you why this story is perhaps more important than any other as the decisions that happen within this family come to have importance for many other families and individuals; showing you why these decisions could be the most important decisions that happen in any society. The story is both engrossing and memorable and I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1400976000	I love this book so much!!! I have read it multiple times and it gets better every time I read it!!!!
5	1400889600	Precise writing, entertaining dialogue, laugh out loud moments, Mrs Bennett is one of the most hilarious characters ever written. Delightful start to finish.
5	1400889600	First read Pride and Prejudice when I was in school and took the will they/wont they story between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy to heart. This is the template all romantic comedy's aspire to but few can match. Full of sharp writing and in Elizabeth Bennet you have a ground breaking intelligent and independent woman we all can all emulate.
3	1400889600	No nothing is required for me. Sorry but you don't tell me what to do. That is all I have to say.
5	1400716800	Too many people dismiss Jane Austen as a writer for women. In actuality, she casts an acerbic eye on families, young women, young men and the state of society. This is the prototype romance novel, and none of the many written since has ever surpassed it, but it is much more than &#34;just a romance.&#34; With any luck, those who read this will move on to her other novels, in which a small focus brings universal conclusions.
5	1400716800	This is a book that can be read over and over again.  Reading Pride and Prejudice is like visiting old friends - very comforting, familiar, and relaxing. I also find that each time I read it there is some phrase or passage that passed my notice before, but in the rereading becomes deeply meaningful and often inspirational.
5	1400457600	It's Pride and Prejudice, this is probably the 4th copy I've purchased.  Good binding, nice cover, excellent for traveling.  Love this book.
5	1400371200	I wanted to something reliable for a long trip and this held up well. I downloaded it to my tab and it was perfect. I had read it several times in the past. I once heard that when Churchill was in the War Room during Dunkirk, this was what he read.
5	1400371200	Even though I've seen bits and pieces of this story acted out in movies, this was, surprising, my first read through.I loved reading this classic style of writing and exemplary word selections. It was a pleasure to look up a few words in the dictionary.This may prompt me to read more Austen books.
5	1400371200	Lovely book - highly recommended! I can't believe I waited this long in my life to read it - I think it was because it seemed like compulsory reading in high school, which I why I probably avoided it. Great book!
5	1400284800	Just finished it again.  I absolutely love Austen 's characters. While the language is very different the substance is timeless.
5	1400284800	Jane Austen is awesome and all her novels are truly spectacular. Darcy and Elizabeth's love story will always be one of my favorites!
5	1400284800	This is a novels that one can't just read once (the characters become friends that must be visited from time to time), and every time, one feels the  awesomeness of this novel.
5	1400284800	I adored this book. Full of interesting characters, painted in such a way that makes you yearn for an all around happy ending.
5	1400198400	a novel  exceptionally written. An unforgettable portrait of the 800 countryside bourgeoisie and a timeless love stoy. Not to be missed
5	1400112000	I love the movie and choose to read the book to get the full story as cinema can never due the work full justice.  I am so thankful I took the time as this will be an addition to my list of favorites forever!
5	1399939200	While at times it's hard to understand (Old English phrasing) it is a great book. It is a very romatic theme.
1	1399939200	I disliked they cut out all of the scenes with zombies.  This was obviously edited to try and appeal to a wider audience.
4	1399852800	I wanted to read this as I have heard so many people praise it. I found it just ok. I do not really see the appeal and if Jane Austin's other books are with the same pace and detail I see no reason to read another.
5	1399852800	The best book I've had the pleasure of reading!  I adored the characters and the beautiful story!  I was transported to another time, perfectly brought to life to make me feel a part of it.  I became very well acquainted with the characters - building and knocking down my opinions of each, as the characters also do!  I loved the beginnings, the conflicts and the brilliant and touching ending!  My heart has not been the same since!
5	1399852800	Love this book! A classic!I recommend it for all! It can be slow on occasion, but if you don't have enough patience then you're not privy to enjoy such detailed words.
4	1399766400	Shockingly, I rather prefer the movie to the book! Having said that, Jane will always be #1! You will definitely be satisfied.
5	1399680000	Only Jane Austen could create such a world as that found in early 19th century England within the drawing rooms of Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley, and people it with characters whose foibles, doubts, pretentions and longings one could recognize today.  In other words, this book is a timeless classic that only improves on each reading.  Never was a love  match more creatively crafted than that between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.
2	1399420800	to long
5	1399420800	It was indeed a great pleasure to read this book...not only for its intricate plot, but for its romanticism, beautiful expressive language and exposure of human strengths and weaknesses. The contrast between selfishness, pride and true self esteem was also evident. I commend Jane Austen for her brilliance and eloquence. It makes me want to familiarize myself with "all" her works. What an amazing writer and person.  Thank you for this inspiring work.
5	1399334400	There are no ill opinions that I may direct toward this book. I love it, and have learned to appreciate it even more following its second perusal.
5	1399334400	Pride and Prejudice is one of the timeless classics.  It depicts English society when it was extremely important to ensure that daughters married well in society or they would remain a burden on their families.  But Darcy and Elizabeth's relationship is the ultimate - misunderstandings, affection not known at the start.
5	1399334400	I love Pride and Prejudice more and more each time I read/listen to it. If you are a fan of Jane Austen or like period work, you can't go wrong here. If you enjoyed the movies READ THE BOOK!!! It's even better:) Plus it last longer;)
5	1399334400	Took me years to finally read and it was better than all the movies and so well written for its time.
5	1399334400	I have been waiting to read this book with my book club and it didn't disappoint.  I had been concerned that the style of writing would slow me up or make it difficult to read, but it was so enjoyable, I didn't really notice.  Excellent scene set-up and character development that made you either love or pity or hate the character.
5	1399248000	I don't know why i waited so long to try this classic novel, I enjoyed the movie but I suppose I always imagined it to be a woman's book. I was very surprised that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a bit wordy for me, but the story is so engaging and the characters so wonderfully described that i am now a confirmed fan. Wonderful book!
5	1399161600	Jane Austen is an amazing writer for her time.She makes you think and feel part of the book.l will read more of her books.
5	1399161600	The old English grammar brings character to the story. Elizabeth and Darcy are truly in love. You must read it.
5	1399075200	I had to read this book in high school so I thought I would get it and REALLY read it this time. Loved it so far.
5	1398902400	I love everything Austen, and especially when it's free! Pride and Prejudice is one of her best novels, if you can even compare. I've read it many times and hope everyone else does too.
5	1398902400	Jane Austen is one of the best classic fiction writers ever. Since most everyone has already watched some of the theatrical versions of this story, I recommend reading the book. It's far better than the movies!
5	1398729600	I had never read this book before  for some reason...loved every page of it!  Wonderful story that had me hooked!
4	1398729600	I have never read most of the so-called &#34;classics,&#34; so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was pretty good but not a page turner.
5	1398729600	This is a timeless story and a great read. One of Austen's best novels. I never get tired of reading it.
5	1398643200	Bought this to add to my collection of classics. I haven't read it yet but all Jane Austen books are very good.
5	1398643200	perfect
5	1398384000	This is my favorite classic story.It has charm, wit, nice story, interesting charactersand a great variety of characters.There is nothing I dislike about this book.
5	1398297600	Mr. Darcy was considered to be a very prideful and arrogant man by those who lived in Hertfordshire; which in fact he was shy and uncomfortable around strangers. Along with the fact that he was born in an era when your superiorship depended on how much your family was worth, how respectable they were, and their titles. Elizabeth Benton on the other hand, was unique to most of the women in that era, she was very sensible and saw more than most. She is very outspoken and speaks her mind, though sometimes judges a person on others opinions without getting to know the person (Darcy), that she is judging. The outcome is surprising from beginning to end. Great story for all ages, listening with audio makes it more interesting. Jo-Ann D.
4	1398297600	intelligent and witty, this book is sure to change the attitudes of people and influence readers to look deeper into the heart and character of an individual
5	1398211200	Love this story! Ms. Austin does a fabulous job creating witty, generational dialogue between the characters. The characters are characters anyone can relate to and this love story is written in such a way that women & men alike would enjoy to read.
5	1398124800	I choose this rating because this story is very good.  it is well written, has great character development and a good plot.  I laughed and couldn't wait to see how it would end.  It doesn't matter that this book was written a long time ago, it is still a great story!
5	1398124800	It's different from other stories today. Very clean and respectable. It has a lot of funny and sad moments. I would encourage other young girls to read it also
5	1398038400	This is a classic and is so much better than the movies. It was so much fun to read the language of the time and how things were unsaid but said.
4	1398038400	An interesting and enjoyable read set in another era.  Author's approach to telling this tale was noteworthy in that she really kept the focus in line with the title itself throughout, driving her point home of the traits of Pride and Prejudice permeating the society she is describing. Not my favorite story of all time, but well worthy of my time to read, and it did hold my interest fairly well. Great to add to your reading experience if you are in a quest to read classics, as I am.  I may venture to read another Jane Austen piece one day, so no regrets here.
5	1397952000	It is no error that this book is universally admired as a classic of English literature.  It remains a very readable and enjoyable tale that has stood the test of time with good reason.  A must have for every library and serious reader.  Enjoy!
5	1397952000	I loved reading this book.  I love Jane Austen!!! Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett are two of my favorite characters ever!
5	1397952000	The Bennett's are a close knit family of a father, mother, and their five daughters. Elizabeth is the 2nd eldest and is whom the story revolves around. Elizabeth is insulted by Mr. Darcy early in the story and is hard pressed to forgive him. Mr. Darcy has a hard time overcoming the silliness of Elizabeth's family and bungles a proposal because of it.  The story of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy is a timeless classic and a delightful read!
5	1397952000	Jane Austen has always been one of my favorite writers. Pride and Prejudice is in my opinion her best work.
5	1397865600	I love itSeen many movies many times still enjoyed reading and rereading the novel. Language shockingly and refreshingly modern.
5	1397692800	I love this book.  I've read it many times--not to mention having watched the movie at least a dozen times.  This classic regency romance sets a high standard for now-a-days authors of books in that genre.  Ms. Austen is an amazing talent.  What is even more amazing is how much she accomplished, considering the opinion of women during the time period in which she lived.  The story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is sweet, and thoroughly engaging.  Elizabeth is spirited, outspoken, and fearless.  While Darcy is arrogant and prideful.  It's wonderful to see Elizabeth bring him down a peg or two.  LOL
1	1397606400	Never did like this book.  Please find a willing producer and make it a 3D movie maybe it would appeal to me and others.  YUK!!!
5	1397606400	Pride and prejudice &#8211; words figuring heavily in my relationship with classic literature. Truthfully, I&#8217;ve never had a keen interest in the classics.  I pretty much went straight from Nancy Drew to the racy stuff hidden in my grandmother&#8217;s closet&#8230;anything Harold Robbins, I was in heaven. I hadn&#8217;t the time or interest in classic lit beyond the high school scraps I suffered through and promptly forgot.Over the years, my prejudice against old, fuddy duddy stories and long dead authors remained. Contemporary bestsellers instead of ancient tomes for me. And, lest one surmise that a burgeoning good taste led me to read Pride and Prejudice,  let me set everyone straight. Rather, the impetus was my purchase of  P.D. James&#8217; Death Comes to Pemberley,  and  the realization this murder mystery involves characters from Pride and Prejudice.So, because my anal retentive self cannot read a book series out of sequence, I dug into Austen&#8217;s classic. Now, having read and enjoyed it in so many ways, I&#8217;ve layed down my prejudice and found a bit of pride.Whoever said there&#8217;s nothing new was so right. The story of the Bennet sisters could easily be transported into modern times. Yes, woman have options other than marriage and children now, and can certainly support themselves. That&#8217;s huge. But face it; ultimately, most long for a family like 200 years ago. When I think of my own angst years ago, and I see young women today, I despair that not much has changed, including the bid to make the right marriage. Is he educated, what university did he attend, does he have a good career, what is his family like? Okay, maybe something&#8217;s different. Men ask themselves the self-same questions about women, and instead of the amount of livestock the prospective spouse holds, we&#8217;re interested in stock portfolios. Whether it&#8217;s cows and pigs or corporate shares, Austen&#8217;s tale of machinations and intrigue, jealousy and jockeying, ring just as true today.In addition, Austen&#8217;s characters are as well-fleshed out and believable as any contemporary ones. Whether it&#8217;s the feisty Elizabeth who gives Darcy as good as she gets, the brooding Darcy who&#8217;s social skills leave much to be desired, or Elizabeth&#8217;s grasping mother who plays favorites with her daughters&#8230;.all are fully alive and bring technicolor images to mind.  So, since it&#8217;s just as fun to read about romantic antics of 200 years ago as today, I&#8217;ve laid down my prejudice. The classics rock.And pride? What am I proud of? First, that I&#8217;ve added to my embarrassingly puny list of classics read. Yup, with this one, that must bring my grand total up to&#8230;maybe two.  Also, while the story is indeed rather simple,  I was reminded while reading that the English language 200 years ago was anything but simple and straightforward. If long-winded, twisting, and winding sentences are not your thing, Jane Austen might not be for you. Indeed, I had to re-read quite a few passages twice or thrice, but I am proud to announce I persevered, and actually enjoyed reacquainting myself  with this manner of speech, tiresome though it was at times. My advice &#8211; read only when fully awake.Actually, I purchased a boxed set of Austen works, so I still have Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion waiting for me. But much as I loved my first Austen, I am not making any promises when I will get to them! After all, I have P.D. James' murder mystery sequel to read.
5	1397606400	There's not much to be said - You either love literature or you don't.For those who do, it's a wonderful read.
5	1397606400	Amazing after chapter 30 a little slow before then :) made to read for English but really enjoyed it after getting into it
5	1397606400	Very hard to read. You have to read it slowly to understand the Old English Way of speaking.  Very good storyline.  It ended too abruptly.
5	1397520000	I am a great fan of Jane Austen, and this book is probably my favorite. I love her sense of humor.
5	1397520000	This is one of my all time favorite books about this time period. Defiantly a must read if you haven't read it:)
5	1397520000	This book holds the heart of women inside. I have read it more than 10 times and will read it 100 more times.
5	1397433600	I have loved this novel since the first time I read in it when I was in 7th grade. I'm so happy to be able to have a digital copy that I can pull up and read anytime I want.
4	1397433600	I enjoyed this book better than the movie. The book contained more detail than the movie. I had not read this book before and will someday read it again.
5	1397347200	Amazon has provided some great classic literature. The story of Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy is a timeless romance.
5	1397347200	could have been so boring but deep understanding of human behaviour keeps the story interesting- humans are pretty much the same whenever wherever
5	1397347200	Beautifully written. All of the common elements in classic literature are elegantly intertwined into the plot. However, it does have a dry humor to it, and requires more than one read-through to fully grasp the intelectual writtings of Jane Austen.
5	1397347200	Thoroughly enjoyed this book. First Jane Austen novel I've ever read...adds so much more detail to the lovely movie versions.
5	1397174400	Still a classic. Would it get published today? Yes. Would the author land a 3-book deal? Absolutely. Would it be made into a movie? Wait, already has. This book proves great writing stands the test of time. I also picked up a copy ofSummers' Love, A Cute and Funny Cinderella Love Storyfor light, fun, easy reading because, sometimes you just need a good laugh.
5	1397174400	This is the standard .that all other historical novels are measured against. Ms. Austen was a genius with pen and parchment
5	1397088000	Great book, just not for kids under 16. Hard language, by  u can get the just of it. Loved it!!
4	1397001600	I felt because of the English's way of speaking during that time period, it was a little difficult to read.  Once I got passed that aspect, it was worth the time and effort spent.
4	1396828800	Great read but not applicable to our times. The rich no longer have the same prejudices. The internet was the great equalizer.
4	1396828800	I like reading old tales, occasionally and this is still a great Classic!  Would recommend to anyone whom is tired of the todays books.
5	1396828800	Really this was the second, of my journey to read a classic.  My first was Anna Karina by Tolstoy, if you have never read a classic please do your self a favor and pick up one.  Yes the verbiage is different than what is spoken today so it sounds a little hokey.  But, back in this era you soon find yourself thinking; this is kind of genteel way of speaking, and their conniving ways to get what they wanted. I don't want to say to much, I do however want to peek your interests.I am a huge fan of Clive Cussler, James Patterson, John Sanford, Patricia Cornwell, Danielle Steele, Tom Clancy, Michael Crighton, David Balducci, Dan Brown, Pat Conroy, J.D. Robb and many more; so you see reading Pride and Prejudice was way out of my comfort zone but, I truly enjoyed going back in time.
4	1396742400	This was a holiday read for me and although I have read it several times it certainly reads differently as you get older. I think younger audiences would struggle with the wording and there is a lot of head hopping, but who can resist a happy ending?
5	1396569600	Great book.  Now I see why so many people love this story.  Worth the read! I highly recommend it. A++
5	1396569600	I love these old classics. My daughter needed to read them for school. I am happy to share my love for these books with her.
5	1396569600	Classic and I have read several time and enjoyed movie version as well. Something I share with my grown daughters.
5	1396483200	Love the story. Makes me happy every time I read it! Who doesn't love a love story like this? Scrumps!
5	1396483200	Pride and Prejudice was accurately titled. Jane Austen is a remarkable writer. Written in first person, this book allows you to see into the inner personalities of each character. The plot is practical and the English, educational. Once you've read this book, you'll want to read Sense and Sensibility (also by Jane Austen), just like me.
5	1396396800	This is a classic, I love this book beyond comparison! I can't get enough, if you haven't read it......you must!
4	1396396800	Now I know what everyone was talking about. Mr. Darcy. Where can I find one? Loved it. It was surprisingly funny at times.
5	1396310400	I have always enjoyed Jane Austen 's books for the purity of the tale and for the way they all talk. I can't help but wish our own language were purer and without so much slang. A very good read!
1	1396224000	This isn't even readable.  It's like People magazine written in 18th century English.  I have no idea why this book shows up on the top novels lists.
5	1396224000	What's not to love about Elizabeth Benning and Mr. Darcy?!  I had seen many renditions of movies before I finally got around to reading the book.  The Keira Knightly movie stays pretty close to the storyline.
4	1396137600	This was my first Jane Austen. Another reviewer suggested this book as a starting place, and I so agree. I loved Elizabeth and Jane, Bingley and Darcy. Such a fun story and although hard to read at times, it was terrific.
5	1396137600	What can be said about Jane Austen's writing but true brilliance? I read the abridged version as a child and delighted myself by reading the whole book now. Such awesomeness!!
4	1396051200	The book was interesting in that it depicted the customs of the time.  Living in a modern society where one chooses whom he or she wants to marry, it was rather difficult to relate to the situations in the book.  Elizabeth was a bit of rebel because she said what she thought and did not adhere to the customary role of a young girl.  It was an enlightening look into a time gone by.
5	1396051200	Love this book. It is a classic love story and makes it easy to relate to the characters. I couldn't put it down
5	1396051200	always a good read; a classic story that never tires.  There have been so many different movie versions you begin to believe you've heard it all before but the original can never be outdone.
5	1396051200	Jane Austen delights and captures the readers imagination in the lives of the Bennet family and is an inspiration to all that love prevails where there is honor and goodness.
5	1396051200	Amazing book of course, but the great thing about Amazon and Kindle is that you can get the book very reasonable (in some cases free) and buy the audio or read it with print that is bigger than 6 point like most books!
5	1395964800	I liked this book when I first read it, many years ago... now, I think I enjoy it even.  It is such a perfect narrative of pains and joys that always accompany the process of falling in love.
5	1395964800	You will have to read this book to understand the title and all that it means. Elizabeth and her sisters are the victims of motherly pride and they endure the prejudice of snobbish upper class individuals who feel that they are not as good as themselves. It is as reflective today in it's issues as it was when it was written.
5	1395964800	My favorite classic book. Its absolutely witty, a good brain teaser. It had me in hysterics from laughing so hard.
5	1395878400	This edition is pretty bare bones, but hey, it's Pride and Prejudice and it was free.  What's to complain about?
3	1395878400	The characters are interesting. The scenery mentioned sounded like someplace I would like to see.  Story is similar to little women.
5	1395792000	I love Old English, pastoral settings, chaste romance, family drama...it's all here.  This wonderful book is a classic, which has stood the test of time.
5	1395792000	This book is an intelligently written soap opera, very sensitive to nuances in interpersonal communication, relationships, motive, trust, things of that sort. It is very insightful about human nature and contains some passages that are downright hilarious! I enjoyed it thoroughly. I found it lots of fun, and will probably even reread it, which I seldom do.
4	1395705600	Good, classic story. A little dense in parts, but what else is to be expected from such an old book?
4	1395705600	A classic which bears re-reading if only to be reminded that human foibles are not limited to any one era.
5	1395532800	Although I have read this before I did not enjoy it any less on rereading it. How great it is to revisit the classics.
5	1395360000	I love this book so much! It's a classic. Jane Austin really makes you feel something for the characters and their story. I highly recommend it. The movie is good too, but the book is WAY better!
5	1395360000	best late night read ever for those who like high quality british classical romance&#8230;and the english language, ah, what a pleasure!
5	1395360000	This book has amazing characters that you can truly recognise in people that you know. It's great to encounter such very modern women that I can identify with today, and to recognise that the human condition is eternal, no matter when you were born.
5	1395360000	I've a read it a few times now, and it is even better now than the first time. Jane Austen wrote amazingly believable, and often quite likable, characters.
5	1395360000	A truly elegant classic; full of life, civility, heart, and charm. No production comes close to capturing the heart of this work.
5	1395360000	I love the older novels but I sometimes get lost in the language because no one speaks like that anymore.
4	1395273600	Although it was at times difficult to read and comprehend because of the style of writing and big words, I greatly enjoyed reading parts of the book that was left out of the movie starring Kiera Knightly.  It's a must read classic!
5	1395273600	I love this story, I am swept into the countryside of England and this family. You really become a part of it. It may be classic but you can still relate today. Plus I love Mr. Darcy.
5	1395273600	This is the second time I read the book, not to mention how many times I have watched movies under the same name. Every time it gives me some delight. I couldn't put it down until my eyes were sore and I enlarged the font size to again and again.This time I admired how clever the author had sequenced the events: Lady Catherine insolently demanded Lizzy to terminate her relationship with Darcy came at just the right moment - when Lizzy and Darcy's relation was  fuzzy. Such intelligence from Lady Catherine was the perfect step to move the story forward.
5	1395273600	Exquisite dialogue and story bring me to the pages of this book every couple of years.Like a visit with an old friend.
5	1395273600	At first i was a bit skeptical about readings this novel (as it is so old), however, this novel is well written and engaging.There was never a time when  i was bored.great book!
5	1395187200	A story I read over and over - so it's great to now have it on my Kindle/phone! This edition has good editing - I haven't noticed any typos/formatting problems like some free digital copies of classics have.If this is your first taste of Austin's brilliance, then you're in for a treat of witty banter, and the danger of first impressions and stubbornness, and the gradual discovery of Mr. Darcy's dreaminess. The subtle social commentary on the ridiculousness of &#34;romance&#34; and the hunt for a significant other is as true for today's online dating society as in Austin's regency period.  Enjoy!
4	1395187200	To be fair, I just read this book because I want to read &#34;Pride and prejudice and zombies.&#34; Besides that, I couldn't help to imagine the characters as represented by the actors of &#34;Bridget Jones Diary.&#34;  Anyway, I liked the novel, and the edition is quite nice.
5	1395187200	Reading it almost every year, I never tire of the characters, the plot, Miss Austin's writing style and insight into the human I heart.
5	1395187200	A classic tale of romance. A must read for everyone!! I'll admit the language takes some getting used to, but once Jane Austen sinks her claws into you it's impossible to stop with just one.
3	1395187200	Have wanted to read some old classics for some time now and enjoyed reading this story.  Interesting to go back in time with the English setting.  Seemed a bit long however, with some details that could be jumped over.
4	1395187200	A little slow at the beginning, but picks up and turns out to be quite poetic and captivating.  Witness a love like youve never seen.
4	1395187200	I have loved the Jane Austen movies for years and only recently have started reading her books. (I know, it is a terrible admission for a Jane Austen fan to make). Despite being written nearly 200 years ago, knowing the story line made it fairly easy reading. I love Pride and Prejudice because it is a moving love story as well as a wonderful character study of the people she brings to life. Reading it convinces one that things haven't changed all that much in the last two centuries.
4	1395187200	It has been a long time since I read one of the classics, but this book really is fun.  At first it seemed frivolous but the more you read the more engaging the story.  I wouldn't describe this as a 'must' read but it is an historical review of upper class society and the stringent rules placed upon their lives.  I found it interesting to compare to our lives today.  We humans really haven't changed all that much since the early 1800's regardless of our income levels.  It is possible to cause people pain when we step outside the boundaries of our personal moral codes.  This book provokes a good discussion between the definition of morals and ethics.
5	1395100800	Jane Austen is an amazing author and captures the fascinating early 1800s perfectly in this coming of age tale of 3 sisters.
1	1395100800	Looking forward to Sarah Price's take off of this book.  I bought this to prepare myself for her book but it was hard to follow and I know hers will be great!
5	1395100800	As a Jane Austin fan, Pride & Prejudice is my absolute favorite. This addition was wonderful to read and was lovely to be read to.
4	1395014400	There are some words that are not correct, and also some places's name were left to be blank!!!! That is
5	1395014400	Great content. Great literary style. Study of human nature stands the test of time. Gender roles are dated but largely realistic even today.
1	1395014400	The most boring book I have ever read. I have nothing more to say about it except that it is certainly a waste of time.
5	1394928000	I read this book at least once a year and never get tired of it. Great literature, brilliant author, fabulous characters. So much of life and human nature presented with so much grace, humor, and insight. I am so glad that Jane Austen gave us this masterpiece. The world does not need this little review to know about Pride and Prejudice, but I post it as a tribute to one of the great writers of all time.
4	1394928000	Comforting and lively. Simple but good read. Great for reading while traveling around the winter months. Easy to read through.
5	1394755200	This book is great. I understand why it's a classic! 5 stars! I will definitely read it again and again.
5	1394755200	It is said that unless a book is 100 years old , do not read it .This book is in innumerable prints since more than a proof of the fact that it has proved the test of time. Jane Austin is the favourite author of generations. My grand father, my father and me also and so also my daughter are were her fans. Proof is in the eating.
3	1394755200	did not get a chance to read. kindle is a first generation and it was doing stupid stuff when I tried to read so did not read many i downloaded
5	1394668800	this is one of my favorite books of all time!! the characters are the best and I just plain love this book!!!
5	1394582400	The language is beautiful and fascinating.  I love the different types of love and marriage depicted. Everyone should read this book.
5	1394582400	Quaint but still sharp, romantic yet astute... melt away into bygone era and vocabulary, relish the characters and the plot.
5	1394582400	I have always loved Jane Austen and I love the ability to listen and read together at the same time.
5	1394582400	I hate this novel. I find it unrealistic and stupid. But this is a good version of it. Nothing was missing or different. Buy it
5	1394582400	Read and retread time and again, every media adaptation I come across I watch over and over, but for details the book always delivers the most satisfaction.
5	1394582400	Having watched the DVD, decided it was time to actually read the book. Really enjoyed this classic.I love Amazon's free books program for Kindle.
4	1394496000	kind of talks in circles but a great read good characters and a lot of fun.  Glad I finally got around to reading
5	1394496000	I have always loved historical novels and this one has surely set the standard for many another writer. A great read!
5	1394496000	I was required to read this book for my class and I must admit, I have fallen in love with it. A true classic. Although it is long and has parts that are rather mundane, overall the book speaks about female empowerment and the destruction of social expectations on Elizabeth's behalf. One of my newfound favorites.
5	1394496000	The greatest of all Austen novels. The charm and romance of such a wonderful classic, that I was able to add to my collection at the best possible price.
5	1394409600	Reading Pride And Prejudice and other of Jane Austen's books, and other similar writings, calm my mind, re-introduces a more extensive vocabulary and the conversations both verbal and written amaze me. One can aspire to improve communication during our current forms of four letter acronyms to answer a question, four letter words to convey emotions and give a number between 1 and 10 to describe any number of feelings.
5	1394409600	Very lively reading. Enjoyable although quite old fashioned particularly the need for women to be married. But that was how it was at that time.
5	1394409600	I can't believe that I have never read this classic novel!  Even though it is 200 years old it reads as if it were written yesterday. I finally understand all those comments about Pemberley, Longbourne and Mr. Darcy that before just went over my head.  How nice to discover this jewel at the ripe old age of 56.  I don't know why it took me so long!
4	1394409600	Mr. Darcy is just great and he's ruined the chances of me ever  finding a real man perfect. This novel is the epitome of girly romance.
4	1394323200	Thoroughly enjoyed this story.  Shocking how prejudice of status and money was so apparent in that society and that household income was public knowledge
5	1394323200	Great little book. It's nice to keep it in my library of kindle books. Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to brush up on your reading.
3	1394323200	I dare say Jane Austen's character herself somewhat reflect through Elliza's figure, playful, stubborn, but amiable and sensitiveDepend on what you looking for, this novel could be interested or boring, that's why i rated it 3 stars. The content is not too complicated or adventurous, however i quite enjoyed reading it.
5	1394236800	This being my first romance novel I find it more akin to a novel in the pursuit of pushing forward human progress and dignity. A shedding of the old ways of courtship, manners, behaviors and a step toward a more balanced field of love.I also think it could be viewed as a guide to manners and civility. The secrets kept, though not for long, the arrogance of both parties, though subdued, prove to be good examples of miscommunication and misinterpretations.
4	1394236800	I have been reading this book for a while now and found it to be &#34;Just Okay.&#34; To me there wasn't enough action to hold my interest to the point of no wanting to put it down. Being a published author myself, I still would recommend it mainly because it was well written with good grammer and punctuation. I would recommend it to others.
4	1394064000	This is a tradition for my family to read and watch on special occasions, or long rainy weekends.Just the right balance of humor and well written drama.
4	1394064000	This format is extremely helpful when doing research for literature class. So easy to navigate. I never mind myself spending hours looking for a specific phrase or quote anymore
5	1393977600	Everyone should read this book at some point in their life...and if you forget it, read it again. My 13 year old loved it, I had forgotten the ending, so reading it again was great.
5	1393804800	This is one of my favorite books.  I have read it before and will read it again.  I thoroughly enjoy historical novels.
5	1393718400	This is a lovely adult fairy tale that I go back to time and again. I'm attracted to a time when character and virtue and reputation were the order of the day.  I like the fact that the characters converse intelligently. The phrasing sometimes has me laughing out loud, but then it makes me wish I was attentive to the words I choose.
4	1393718400	I will reread Pride and Prejudice.  Will get more understanding of some of the characters.  Elizabeth had strength and was ready toadmit her mistakes about others.
5	1393718400	This is one of my favorite reads of all time.  If you haven't read it or haven't read it in a long while, treat yourself!
5	1393632000	Though I am very young, and thought to not appreciate the book, I really enjoyed it and the lessons it teaches.
5	1393545600	Lively and the most popular stories of the classic... It's a.wonder how a.person.change in the world and is to make the most if it.
5	1393459200	Jane austin is one of the classic writers that will never go out of fashion. Her works will continue to inspire generations to come.
5	1393459200	This classic is some of the finest in writing...Still witty and very applicable to life in many ways...Times may change,but people remain people.
5	1393459200	I just love Pride and Prejudice. It is one of those rare books that always fill me with happiness!! Such a comedy of manners. Truly a masterpiece.
5	1393372800	I've lost count of how many times I've read this book. Austen is a spectacular author...this book being my favorite of hers!
5	1393372800	Amazing love story between two destined souls. It's no wonder movies and love stories take their cue from this story.
5	1393200000	It is such a classic that I enjoy rereading it on my Kindle though it's been on TV several times.  Both the Keira Knightly version and another version.
1	1393200000	Writeup said it was an audio book. Only 6 pages were audio. It is a good story, but I wanted an audio book for convenience.
4	1393200000	Beautifully written with great characters. Easy to visualize the time period and the voice fits the time and place. Great read.
5	1393027200	I enjoyed rereading this book as an adult without the pressure of literature class. I found more humor and nuances which did not seem to exist to a teenager.
5	1393027200	Could not put it down so sad to have it finished.  Love the way Jane Austen writes can't wait to read the next novel.
5	1393027200	An excellent example of a classic. I cannot recommend this selection enough! Again and again, I return to this gem as a way to pass the time.
5	1392940800	Great book, once you pick it up it's difficult to put it down.  I love Lizzy, she's a breath of fresh air, probably one of my favorite female heroine.
5	1392940800	One of my favorite classic novels. I love Jane Austen 's writing and the characters she brings to life in her work. This is one of her best.
5	1392854400	Love me some Elizabeth Bennett.  That is all I need to and can say.  I think everyone wants a Mr. Darcy.
5	1392854400	I loved this book.  I have seen the movie many times but have never read the book fully.  I was not disappointed.  The book is even better than the movie.  I will be reading the book again.
4	1392768000	It's a classic. Romance at its best. Was pulling for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to hit it off the whole way through. happy ending.
4	1392768000	This is a classic and once you get past the archaic language it is an enjoyable read. I really appreciated the point of being true to one's self is an admirable trait and that you can't  allow yourself to get caught up in the uncharitable thoughts of others.
5	1392768000	Pride and Prejudice was one of the first books I put on my Kindle.  Like most in my generation, I read Pride and Prejudice and other Jane Austen classics in high school.  I enjoyed Jan Austen even back then.  Now in my 50s it was even better read.
5	1392768000	Re-reading the classics and they are so much better now that I am older (35 compared to high school age when I read them originally)!
5	1392681600	I first read this book at school and couldn't understand what all the fuss was about when I returned to it years later it was like a different book, obviously uninterested children begrudgingly reading out lines in class does not do it justice. I loved it, I loved Darcy and Elizabeth, I cringed with embarrassment at Mrs Bennett and was really surprised by the humour and dry wit of Mr Bennett. I've since gone on to read this book many times and each time I seem to get a little more
5	1392681600	After many years I decided I would start to read the classics. This, I believe was the first one I picked up. I enjoyed the way it was written, as well as the characters. Although I am not a romance novel enthusiast by nature, I found this charming, well written (doesn't it just go to show that you don't need profanity, gratuitous sex, and violence to write a great story), and a joy to read. Recommend highly.
5	1392681600	And now I know why it's the most loved/read novel of all time!  Can't explain why it's such a compelling read.
4	1392595200	This book was easy to read and the content was very interesting. Caught my interest right away.I would recommend this book.
5	1392595200	I plan to get the unabridged book to see what I may have missed with the kindle version.  Oh, to have such power with words as Jane Austen!!  If you like to challenge the brain at times, and feel a full gamut of emotions while reading.....  read this.  If you prefer passivity and laxity while leisure reading....  pass this one by.
5	1392595200	There is nothing to be said, other than this is the stick by which all other books should be measured.
3	1392595200	Liked but didn't love it.  Everyone should read these classics if nothing but an opportunity to enjoy the English language of the time.
5	1392508800	rating 5l saw the movie and really liked it, so Idecided to read to read the book.  I really enjoyed the book.
5	1392508800	Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels is all time. Definitely recommend it to anyone who had not read it.
5	1392508800	Feel like I have travelled back in time to England.  Very lively characters that you really come to know and care about.
5	1392508800	I loved reading this.  I would recommend to friends!  Very good read!  Thank you!  I loved reading this.  I would recommend to friends!  Very good read!  Thank you!
5	1392422400	I found the role of women, courtship, and social mores of that time period to be very interesting.Even though everything has changed in today's modern world, the feelings and observations about human nature and relationships are surprisingly still relevant.
5	1392422400	I Love this story. Im So happy to have discovered the classics....i will read this several times over, I'm sure....
5	1392422400	what can you say that hasn,t been said  a classic read , had this book for many years & all my children have read it
5	1392422400	I have seen the movie from 1995 over and over agin. After seeing the movie I enjoyed much more reading the book.
5	1392422400	pride and prejudice is a book written by jane austen.It depicts a world of emotion,  feeling.It is about two common but major faults.About love,position,money,character and hard,easy situations.
5	1392336000	What can I say? This book is a true classic to read over and over again&#10084;&#65039;Would recommend it definatly!
5	1392249600	Not only is it a classic, the book is timeless. The English language usage is excellent but despite being &#34;old&#34; is easily understandable. Hey and no one can put down a good love story!
5	1392249600	I've read this on paperback quite a few times. I needed to get it for my kindle, this is my go to when I don't know what to read and I need to pass the time. It's always good, never boring. One of my favorite books.
5	1392249600	I took a lot from the book. It made me learn english. Also, I think it is a necessary book to read for a young lady.
5	1392249600	I loved this book in high school, while in college and life beyond college. It is a classic at any
5	1392163200	This book should be read on everyone and it is very enjoyable People should read more of Jane Austins books
4	1392163200	Love Jane Austin you cant go wrong :D buy the book and be mesmerized by Elizabeth's strength. And Mr. Darcy's daring proposal.
5	1391990400	Jane Austen never grows old. This is a delightful story and I reread it at least once every other year.
4	1391904000	While it is a little slow at first, once this book picks up there is no stopping it. It's a great story o  false feelings misinterpretation, and romance.
5	1391817600	Probably the most popular novel by Jane Austin.  I've read them all and this one is my favorite although every one of her works is a joy to read.
5	1391817600	Warning! You will find it hard to put this book down; especially as it gets towards the end. I enjoyed every twisting moment, and the laughter I get from certain characters.
5	1391817600	These characters are wonderfully depicted.  The mother is such a twit.  The cousin is such an ass.  Jane is so wonderful, in face and disposition.  Dad is aloof, but caring, in an odd and complex way.  And Elizabeth is intuitive, irreverent, and empathic.  Their story roped me in.  I love this book, can certainly see why it's so widely praised, and expect to read it many more times, with new insights and understanding to come.Other things I thought to add after writing this yesterday:  Some of what's amazing to me about how we come to learn about the characters in this novel are the things that aren't there.  There are no specifics in the descriptions of what people look like or what they wear.  Other than a single rainstorm, we never really know about the weather, for example.  The descriptions of the settings are very spare.  Instead we're given conversations and letters that help us form our impressions.  From Elizabeth we're given thoughts, feelings, and insights.  From her we learn what isn't said.  There is very little to distract us from the characters themselves.My main takeaway from this first reading of Pride and Prejudice has to do with my own experience with what is assumed and unsaid in my own life.  There are things I wish I could say but am inhibited to, though not necessarily by societal norms.  There are things I believe I don't need to say because I assume they're understood without saying them.  But they're too often not.  The novel places us in a time period when what was proper was important, and yet today many of us  still carry around these self-imposed restrictions on expressing feelings openly and honestly.
5	1391817600	After watching the movie starring Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to read the book.  Though some of the scenes were different, the story seemed to stay its course. There wasn't a night went by that I was not fully engaged in Elizabeth's story.  Having seen the movie, it made reading the book all that much better, allowing for voice-overs as I read.  The only part I found a bit disappointing was that the scene at the end of the movie was not included in the book.  It was such a sweet ending scene.  Loved it!  Would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
5	1391731200	This was my fav movie so I read the book. The books always are better. Now this is my one of my fav books too.
3	1391731200	I expected more depth of plot, but it is an enjoyable and easy read novel.  I thought it would be more political.
2	1391731200	I found this book long and dragging, no real signs of love until the end. I also did not know what was going on half the time.
3	1391644800	Drawn out for the true value of the book. A great message and love story. They just don`t write like this anymore. I respect the writing.
5	1391644800	This book was a bit different from the new version of the book, but it was truly an awesome story. In some ways the book was better than the movie because it explained more in detail.  And in some ways the movie was a bit more romantic.
5	1391644800	This has been one of my favorite books, now that I have it on my Kindle Fire, I will read it again & again!
5	1391558400	Great book which draws you in to the lives of the family! I loved every minute of it! Every young woman should read this!
4	1391558400	Great story.... timeless journey when it comes to love, chivalry and an old fashioned southern love story...  I'm a sucker for romance and enjoyed each character.
5	1391472000	The storyline with a strong female, Elizabeth, in a difficult struggle in that era's society of &#34;stations in life&#34; was to me the most engaging of all Jane Austen's novels. From Mr. Darcy, to her sisters, to her other suitors and the obstacles Elizabeth encountered I was engaged throughout. Often I find period novels do not appeal to me BUT this was the exception!
4	1391385600	It was a pleasure to read this again after so many years with an adult perspective. The first time was in high school, when less experience with the syntax took away a lot of the enjoyment. I recommend reading on a kindle as I found it most satisfying to look up definitions as I read. This is a must read for anyone who is soon to be testing for colleges; it has all theverbiage you need.
5	1391385600	For me, this is the best of Jane Austen.  The language and morals of the times are so eloquently presented.
5	1391299200	If I were the person reading this I would get this book. the general mood is romance. this is a good book for young adults and kids with very high reading levels. I am in 5th grade and I had to read this book for school. I'm 10  and I loved this book and I think you will too. amazing and it is british literature if your into that.
4	1391299200	The story works its way around the characters so interestingly, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.
5	1391299200	Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book of all time. I have read it more times than I can count. It is just so amazing!!
5	1391212800	Jane Austen has written a novel that is interesting enough to trap even the most anti-drama and unromantic reader.  I don't as a rule read anything but Mysteries.  This book, however, captured my attention from the beginning.  I was intrigued with the characters and Jane's ability to make you feel like you were the character in the book.  I have also seen the five-hour mini-series written from this book and am amazed at how it followed the book.  I recommend this book to all readers.  It is a character building book as well as a clean, old-fashioned romance with a touch of intrigue and suspense.It is an excellent choice.
5	1391126400	I loved the movie and really enjoyed the book as well. Jane Austen's writing style is easy to read and entertaining!
4	1391126400	This is a good book but it's kind of confusing at the start. It was very good once you got the characters straight.
5	1391040000	An incredibly beautiful love story.  So well written.  I did not think in would like it half as much as I do.  I could hardly put it down.
5	1391040000	I am in Love with Mr. Darcy!  He is my new romantic hero!  This is a must read for both guys and girls!
5	1390953600	Jane Austen shows her talent the most with this story. The charming characters are so pleasing to read about, and the themes inside, though obvious, are gracefully woven in. It should attract many of those who love romance, but also those who enjoy a good classic.I love reading it on my tablet. It works very well.
5	1390953600	I love having this best of books on my Kindle - I can pick it up any time I have a dull moment. I've read it so many times I could really pick it up anywhere and jump right in. Interestingly, reading it electronically, I see things in Austen's incomparable prose that I've never taken note of before. A fun first Kindle experience!
5	1390953600	The kids I know are glued to the computer/smart phone/kindle already.. Why not help them learn something all while reading a book.  Provided hours of entertainment and taught a few good lessons along the way..They go back to it several times as well..
5	1390953600	I've read Pride and Prejudice so many times in my life that I can actually quote some parts of it.  It will always be one of my favorite reads.  Each time is a new experience with different insights.
5	1390953600	This is a very interesting book , keeps me wondering what happens next. The life and adventures of the characters lives are so interesting.
5	1390953600	I read &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; again after years because I wanted to read &#34;Longbourn&#34; and thought I needed a refresher. It has been so much fun to go back and read a book that I read years ago and find it as good as ever. I probably appreciate it more now than when I was younger.
2	1390953600	It may be a classic, but I found it to be the most boring book I have read in a very long time
5	1390953600	Pride and Prejudice plays out like any run of the mill romantic story where boy meets girl and they immediately develop a mutual dislike before eventually, slowly, warmly falling for each other. However, what makes this book a timeless classic is the unforgettable characters, the spunky Elizabeth, the dignified Mr. Darcy, the acerbic Mr Bennett and others. Their hopes and anxieties, heartbreaks and reunions as well as their pride and prejudice is beautifully portrayed with just the right touch of satirical humour that results in a tale that lives and breathes with vitality every time it is read. Jane Austen's greatest work has truly transcended time and resonates among readers worldwide as much today as it did in Victorian England. A must read for all.
5	1390953600	Jane Austen is without a doubt a wonderful author. I can read this book over and over again. I only wish the story was longer and we could see how Elizabeth and Mr Darcy's marriage played out. I can imagine very much in love with little ones.
5	1390867200	I've always loved this story. I find myself anticipating the ending every time, regardless of the fact I've read the book perhaps more than a hundred times since I was 13. If only Jane Austen had written a few sequels (sigh).
5	1390867200	My first Jane Austen read--and what a read it is!! I can't believe I waited so long to read this amazing classic. Better late than never, right?
5	1390867200	Just consider the no, of books that are take-offs,,,,Hundreds, and that's amazing. Have loved it for years and collect rare copies.
5	1390867200	Pride And Prejudice is my favorite book of all time.  I could read it over and over and enjoy it every time.
5	1390867200	How interesting to revisit this novel at different stages of my life. I see new things in it every time and see the characters in somewhat different lights each time. The older characters become more interesting and the younger ones more tiresome. That the author captured this at such a young and sheltered time of her life is an ever surprising revelation with each re-read.
5	1390867200	A classic-I couldn't resist the price! As an English teacher, I don't have to worry about carrying around more books!
5	1390867200	That socialization and marriage model exists there to this day.Wish I had read it years ago, but with 63 years under my belt I think I could not have had the understanding of it as now.
5	1390867200	That one word says it all! Usually I zip through a book but not this one. The language is perfect and had to be savored, as did the story. If you haven't read Jane Austen, this would be a great start.
5	1390780800	I read this book when I was a teenager in high school. Fast forward some 20 years later and I am adding this book to my collection on Kindle.
5	1390694400	This book is a classic! One of my absolute favorites! The ups and downs and introspection of human character makes for a great story!
1	1390694400	ok well I'm young so of course I hated this book. I love the movie but the book www the o my reason I read it is because either had to do it for a book report.
3	1390694400	This is one where I've seen the movie numerous times and finally read the book.  I was surprised to find that I didn't care for Jane Austen's style of writing.  I love her stories though.
5	1390521600	This is a great book to read! The plot is very engaging. I recommend that everyone reads it. Great book!
5	1390521600	Enjoying last year the bicentennial of its original publication, Austen's book is the gold standard of romance novels, a brilliant character study, and an antidote to the culture's current confusion about what marriage is (and isn't). What more could you want - for free?
5	1390435200	I read this every few years.  It always proves worthwhile.  I take something away from the experience each time.  Never a disappointment!
5	1390435200	This is a great classic book for a free down load. If you want to read the classics, this is a good choice to start with.
5	1390435200	I'm certainly no authority, but I think that this book more than lives up to its reputation as a timeless classic and would be enjoyed very much by almost anyone.
4	1390348800	Loved it! I now understand why this book is a must read. It is espectacularily written. Girls: read thisbook urgently!
5	1390348800	Excellent reading and entertaining. A little wordy, but once you are in the rhythm of reading you can't put the book down. A true classic!
5	1390348800	I have read this book many times. I enjoy the story and the romance it inspires.I love it! I would recommend it to everyone!
5	1390348800	This book is absolutely amazing. It is sort of long, so be patient, but it is worth the read. I first read this in seventh grade, but it is written in Olde English so if you have difficulty understanding olde english I would recommend attempting this book in 8th or 9th grade. I would not recommend looking for a copy of the story translated into modern english because the way it is worded makes it that much more appealing.I love this book! The story is wonderful, the characters are lovable and witty, and the descriptions of the enviorment are so exact that you feel as if you are actually in the story. Not to mention Mr. Darcy is one of the most amazing fictitious love interests in the history of literature, and Elizabeth is one of the most inspirational and realistic characters ever created! This is, and forever will be, my favorite novel of all time!
5	1390348800	I wanted to check this off my 100 books to read before you die! I was pleasantly surprised and now know why it was on there!!
4	1390262400	Jane Austen paints a picture of 18th century England that is unparalleled by any other writer.  A must read for anyone who is looking for a classic novel.
5	1390262400	A best selling book by a world renowned author. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful love story which shows how communication is the key to happiness when internal insecurities and external forces lead to misunderstandings. The characters and their stories are well though out and I'm sure many can identify with them and their problems. This is a must read for both those that admire an engaging story, resulting from the brilliant work that went into this novel, and for any and all romantics at heart.
5	1390262400	This was the first book I read on my Kindle HD and it was a good choice! I love the way Jane writes, the language, the humor and the outcomes - it was a great read for the cold month of January!
5	1390176000	It was witty and had a great story line. I am not usually a fan of &#34;historical reads&#34; but this was a delight.
5	1390089600	I bought this kindle version with the audio option so that I could listen to it on Audible.  Great price and excellent reading of a classic.  Hearing the story told in a British accent makes it so much better.
2	1390089600	So, girl tries to marry rich guy. Decent to read, but I wouldn't say I had missed out on anything if I had never read this book.
5	1390089600	I've been meaning to read this book for years, I'm so glad I finally did!  Excellent! I would recommend it!
3	1390089600	Not really my cup of tea.  The prose I am sure is beautiful for that time period, but for me appears quite stilted.
5	1390089600	So easy to read on Kindle. I picked up more details of the story than when I read the paper book.
5	1390003200	I loved this book.Thank-youIt took me a while to get into this book. For anyone to read it is well worth the effort.
5	1390003200	This is one of the few books I can read again and again.  I am always surprised at what else I reveal each time I read it  it always seem like the first time, even though I have two different copies of this in movies.  I am looking forward to starting on of her other books soon.
5	1390003200	I really like Jane Austen's books, and this one is my favorite so far. It was interesting seeing the difference between the book and all the different movie and mini-series books made about it. I think books are better because you can really become engaged in all the intricate details and descriptions.
5	1390003200	What is there left to say, Jane Austen tells the story of our youth. Each time different yet each time new, I re-read the story of Miss Elizabeth Benett with the same pleasure.
5	1389916800	Pride and Prejudice has got to be my all-time favorite book.  It is funny and sharp, and romantic and devastating. I got it for my Kindle just so I would always have easy access to it.
5	1389916800	An essential addition to any library.  A classic story that never gets boring, though sometimes it is difficult to follow some of the words and phrasing.
5	1389916800	Read it once, twice, 10 times, it's never enough!  I've read it and listened to it on cd.  The use of language is beautiful and romance is portrayed in a way that's not an embarrassment if a young girl reads it.  I love it!
5	1389916800	My favorite book of all time. I fell in love with the movie and I love that the book gives more details.
5	1389830400	A book to read again and again.  Enjoyed every time I have read it. A must read.  I would love to meet Mr Darcey.
4	1389830400	I have loved this book from the first sentence. The love between Darcy and Elizabeth is portrayed so well I never want it to end. I recommend this book for anybody who is onto true romance.
5	1389744000	I had always heard of the author and this title, so finally got around to reading it when I found it free on my kindle.  Wow, such vocabulary!  I look forward to seeing the movie now.
5	1389744000	I re-read this in honor of the 200th anniversary of its publication last year. This re-reading, as well as that of some other"classics," has taught me why they are so named. Never having been assigned P+P in school, it remains a favorite, but such pleasure upon re-encountering this novel suggests that other, heretofore dreadful-because-they-were-assigned books, may well be worth a second, leisurely,look.
5	1389744000	I really really enjoyed this book. I am 50 years old and have never read it before, I didn't have to read it at school.  Anyway I was not ready for it to end, I want to read more about Mr. Darcy and Miss. Bennett (Mrs. Darcy)!
5	1389657600	And as with most classics, well worth the read. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Love Jane Austen stories, both in print and on the screen.
5	1389657600	&#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; stands at the head of all English novels.  Jane Austen was one of the four or five greatest writers of fiction in that language.  In &#34;The Great Tradition,&#34; F. R. Leavis explains why.  This novel rewards rereading, each time inviting the reader to discover new insights into Austen's wit and ironical insight into the relations within families.  To call &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; a masterpiece of fiction is an understatement.
5	1389657600	This is my favorite Jane Austen book, and one of my all time favorite books.  I just love this story!
5	1389657600	I am obsessed with this book, and all of the versions of movies they continue to make of this book. Great read.
5	1389657600	I was required to read this book years ago for an English Lit class in high school. Sadly, I didn't give this beautifully written masterpiece the time of day back then. After I caught myself watching &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; on BBC one afternoon I decided to give Pride and Prejudice on more chance. I'm so happy that I did because I didn't realize what I was missing.
5	1389484800	Don't hesitate if you have never read thisclassic before.  Then watch the video versionwith Keira Knightly which brings the storyeven more to life.
5	1389484800	a truly pleasurable read. Elizabeth  Bennett and fitzwilliam Darcy's journey towards each other never gets old. I couldn't enjoy jane Austen's brilliance more.
1	1389484800	I love the story but found the narrator was very quick in the reading.  These are words and language that should be savored.  You don't drink a fine wine in huge gulps!
5	1389484800	My daughter had recommended this book to me many years ago but I had not gotten around to it.Then on my last vacation I saw the Kindle version listed and went for it and I could not put it down.It has a great cast of characters, and I loved the language and the importance of conversation and the examination of every nuance of what is being said, implied or being left out.It is also a very interesting look at family and the dynamics in the interactions between members with different levels of refinement both social and and intellectual.It just so happened that this vacation included a big family reunion and was amazed and amused at the parallels between the book and what was going on around me.I've realized that I'm not a very good book critic since all my reviews seem to be five stars.The main reason for this is that I'm only moved to write a review if I love a book.This is one of those.
5	1389398400	It is one of my favorite books! So worth the time. Love Jane Austin! Everyone should have a copy. Wonderful me time treat.
5	1389398400	I would read this book everyday if I had the time! I love Elizabeth,Jane,Mr.Darcy,Mr.Bingley,etc. Best book of all time. AMAZING
1	1389398400	The typos were so bad I couldn't follow the story line at times.  Maybe it's just the Kindle edition!!  This was a horrible and confusing story. Nothing but people being shallow and thinking they are better then everyone else in this story.  No connection between the characters to even like any of them.  I wonder if the original book was this bad.... how could it ever have been such a classic and well loved book?
5	1389398400	This Kindle edition is great. The book is known as a classic for a reason. If you haven't read it, you must. It's simply captivating.
5	1389398400	First read at school aged 14, revisited many times since. One of the first downloads for my 50th birthday kindle, just finished reading again, just as fresh  .
5	1389398400	I love this book. Now on my Kindle I can read  chapter when ever I feel like it. Print is big so you can see clearly.
5	1389398400	Yes, it's kind of hard to read. Yes, I have to use the dictionary every time I read it.It is a lot like being pregnant and giving birth, the end result is so beautiful, so amazing, and so worth it. When Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth that he ardently admires and loves her it takes my breath, every time, it doesn't matter how many times I've read it. Do yourself a favor read this classic if you never have before.
5	1389312000	A comedy of manners and a love story tangled in strict societal pretense and class competition. Loved it.  Loved Elizabeth.
5	1389312000	The book is well written and I can relate with Lizzy very well. Such a bright woman. Love this book of romance in a gentle manner.
5	1389225600	This is definitely one of my favorite books ever! Great characterization, storyline, everything. Will be reading much more of Jane Austen! This book is for those who like a captivating story that is well written.
5	1389052800	I had resisted reading Jane Austen for years because I had made up my mind (without ever having read anything by her) that her books were boring. I couldn't have been more wrong. I couldn't put this book down, and once put down, I could not wait to pick it up again. Jane Austen may be long dead, but she rocks!!!
5	1388880000	I'm embarrassed to say I waited so long to read this book. Afraid it would be too boring for me (I like suspense), I was reluctant. I was so wrong. This is my first experience with Austen and I can't wait for my next!
5	1388880000	I never tire of visiting the world of Elizabeth Bennett.... Jane Austen's observations of society and relationships are fresh as ever.  Bonus: Kindle owners can get this book and many more for free.
4	1388880000	the best book ever written by Ms Austeen in a time so long ago and far away , shows us romance never changed thru time, just the expectations of the suitors.  Mr.Darcy and Lizzy are still Romeo and Juliet With different social scenarios and eras!
5	1388793600	I.love.all of Jane.Austen's. books but Pride abd Prejudice has to be my favorite!!!! And having it on my kindle makes it even easier to read
3	1388793600	it was a long read but it did have a surprize in the end i enjoyed the read quite a bit though.
5	1388793600	This book is so well written with characters that are well developed and a good bit of lively wit that it is impossible not to love it!The story draws you in so nicely that it is no wonder it is among the list of timeless classics
1	1388793600	Austen tells a story of an interesting milieu and era where marriage determined the standing of a woman. However, this was not enough to keep up my interest and reading through the endless dialogues of gossip, i felt the same annoyance as when sitting next to a loud mouthed idiot in a train.
5	1388707200	I got this as a gift for someone. It is not too bulky and it fits the phone perfectly!Great protection and still slimming on the phone.
5	1388707200	I think that this is the most popular of Jane Austen.  It is my second favorite and it has some of best drawn characters in literature.  I have read some of the recent riffs on this book.  I loved "Death Comes to Pemberly" by P.L. James and laughed aloud at Seth Graham Smith's "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies".  The latter has the fittest fate for Mr. Wickham, if not the most delicious sparring between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine.  The inspiration for those two is still far superior and inspired such authors as Dickens and the Brontes.  That is remains a favorite today is a truth to be universally acknowledged.
5	1388707200	one of the best books ever and for free how could ever go wrong I highly recommend get it today.
5	1388534400	I have read this a billion times. It never gets old! Waiting on my Darcy.....lol! Five stars and on to the next Austen book.
5	1388534400	I admit it, I watched the Pride and Prejudice movie before I read the book. The movie was great - the book is even better! It did help that I understood the story line before reading since it can be hard to comprehend at times due to the older writing style.
3	1388534400	i'M STILL STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS BOOK. i WANTED TO READ IT AFTER READING &#34;MY OWN MR DARCY&#34;. tHE language is very tough to wade through.
5	1388448000	Such an amazing book- I become completely engrossed in it with read. Quite easy to follow and always captivating. Love!
5	1388448000	This book never goes out of style even with it's old English language. It has all the elements of a good story and romance. I have had it my library for years so just had to add it to my Kindle.
5	1388361600	I found it exceedingly difficult to get into this book. I think I began it here times before I finally committed to seeing it through. But wow was it worth it. The delicates dance of courtship that still exists today was exquisite. And I cried in the final pages. If you have never read this classic book, please give it a chance!
5	1388361600	A most enjoyable book.  Simply entertaining and I will undoubtedly read this book again. One of the most treasured books in my library.Rafalvo@roadrunner
5	1388361600	a classicentertaining, fun, humorous,comforting, A great read on a cold and sleet filled day. grab a quilt and a mug of tea.
5	1388275200	The language, the manners, the discreet romance...  the best book.  I've read it over and over & I can't recommend it enough!
4	1388275200	One of my favorites for a long time, it's hard not to love all of the characters and drama surrounding them. That said, it has its flaws.The writing isn't brilliant, but it's earnest. The characters are dynamic, but sometimes the dialogue is a little overwhelming and over explanatory. The emotion in particular is more often verbalized or thought about than conveyed.But what it does, it does well. Jane Austen captured the traits of her over the top caricatures beautifully. The situations that make you cringe really make you cringe. She also had a good handle on theme and perspective. Pride and prejudice of course appear throughout, but so do concepts like love, family, and secrets.I still consider it one of my top 10 books for all that. It's one of the classics, and it still influences romantic literature and movies. It's worth a read (or a watch of the A&E; Colin Firth version of the movie)
5	1388275200	The characters in the story were so easy to relate to on all sides. This was such a great read!!!
5	1388188800	I have concurred that a little Jane Austen is good for my soul and I should read her at least once every year! Her intelligent writing, contemplative characters, and romance that goes beyond superficial attachment to a sincere depth of affection makes this book undoubtably a classic! ( it also makes me write like I've swallowed an 18th century dictionary, which isn't half bad!) This is a must read!!
5	1388188800	I have watched the movie so many times, and decided to read the book.  I love Jane Austen, but was surprised how different the book was from the movie.  I think I like the movie better.
5	1388188800	Enjoyed the book so much, had to have the movie.Wonderful book.  Have read and enjoyed the movie.  Granddaughter read it also. I recommend it.
5	1388102400	Jane Austen is an amazing writer. Her dialogues and how her characters develop throughout her novels always keep me engaged and wanting more. I have lost count how many times I have read this book and it still keeps me riveted every time .
5	1388016000	I had only ever seen the movie. I have wanted to read the book for years but was never given the opportunity. I am so glad that I found the book for free. It was a bit different than I expected. I really loved it independently of the movie, though. Jane Austen wrote with such a beautiful way of arranging words that I would describe it as artful.
5	1388016000	Most folks have heard of this, at least.  Austen once said of the romantic lead, &#34;The only way to find a man like Darcy is to write him.&#34;Of course most people know this today by the movies.  If you've seen the Keira Knightly and Matthew Mcfayden version, you have a general idea of the plot and a good portrayal of the key turning points.  If you've seen the BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, you've got a pretty good idea of what's going on with all of the second-tier characters as well.  (Sadly, the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version, written &#34;down&#34; to supposedly dumb American audiences of its day, is not even a good introduction to the book.)But if you really want to soak up the life of the Bennet family and the girls' various suitors, suitable and un-, you need to read the book, whether online or in print.- Paul Race, School Of The Rock
5	1388016000	An all time classic. One of my favorites and the standard bearer for everything that came afterit. Not to be missed.
5	1387843200	I took a break from my usual reading of fantasy and sci-fi to satisfy my curiosity about this book. I am very glad I read it. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!
5	1387756800	brilliantly crafted with delightful characters and matchless dialogue, this is a masterpiece of English literature that is as fun to read as it is impressive.
5	1387584000	I&#8217;m sure no introduction is needed for this classic tale! While I&#8217;d read it before and have watched several TV and movie versions, it never gets old. And the original writing style is as beautiful now as ever.
5	1387584000	This is my third time reading this book and I have to say that no matter how many times I read it, it never gets old to me. It only get a better!!!! If two people are meant to be, they will always find their way to each other &lt;3
5	1387411200	I can't believe i've reached the age of 40 without reading this English classic before. I loved it. The way they speak to other, everything is so polite and correct and respectful, although repressed. A few days after reading I saw the film on TV as well. Great book, recommended for all.
5	1387324800	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic and must read for drama lovers. The characters in the book are very fascinating and so is the storyline. This novel is full of wit and wisdom.
5	1387238400	I liked the colorful storyline, and the characters had depth. It was a moderately paced writing and very enjoyable. I'd recommend this to someone who likes a little drama with the romance. Not to mention a pinch of sassiness from the beloved Elizabeth.
5	1387065600	I can't believe it's taken me this long to read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Of course I've seen the movie(s) and adored the story as it is told on the screen but this novel is a classic for a reason and now I know why. I officially love this book!
4	1386979200	Original, historical. A joy to read, although most of us know the story. A book for your holidays.  Easy reading on Kindle, even in hight level light conditions.
5	1386892800	This is my favorite book ever! Jane Austen was such an artist. I love this love story that doesn't have a lot of love, don't know if you understand, but it's amazing and everybody has to read it because of the plot and Mr. Darcy, of course.
5	1386806400	Amazing as it has been since I first read it many years ago! Mr Darcy will forever be Colin Firth in the imagination and the Englishcountryside a must to be re-visited. Jane Austen's best!
5	1386806400	Great classic. About halfway through it really blows up and is almost impossible to put down until the finish. Loved it.
5	1386806400	I've read this novel a few times. Great every time. A classic read for everybody. The movie adaptation is great too.
5	1386806400	I love this classic novel by Jane Austen. I love to read about the people and the relationship of that era specially narrated by a woman. The problems of women in those times are very different from those of ours, but at the same time many similarities can be found. We don't have to marry into money in order to survive anymore, because we can find jobs and still be respected in the society, but we do struggle with our relationships still. We are confused as to the feelings of the men in our lives and we cannot figure out whether the love of a man is worth crushing our pride. I think these challenges are even more for the modern woman because she is more of the same status as the men in the society and cannot justify her lack of pride by want of a better life through marriage. It is a great novel about the intricate relationship of people in a family and in a small society and very well written. Definitely recommended to everyone.
5	1386633600	I love this book.  Even though I have a book, kindle is better for me because then I can read in the dark when needed
5	1386460800	The Kindle edition was well done and good quality.  I believe that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best stories ever told.  I think all women hold out hope when they are young that they are secretly loved by a rich and wonderful man.
1	1386374400	I know this is a classic; that's why I tried it but I couldn't get through it.  The language was too tough for me!
5	1386201600	I'm a thirteen year old girl and yet I couldn't understand it at times it was still a really good book. I choose this book because my teacher suggested it to me and our reading in school is for a grade. I decided to read it because it was the only thing that was in my reading level that looked interesting. (I have a high reading level.) The beginnings and the middle parts of the book gave me confused feelings. However the ending made complete sense of the plot and I must admit that it was a very clever, and very interesting ever for a girl my age. I do have to admit at my reading level, age, and skill it encouraged me to expand my vocabulary and my Language Arts skill. I love this book. I would recommend it to any one who loves Romatic books, a good plot, and/or is looking for a good book. :3
5	1386115200	I love the civility of the old English romance and pompous attitudes .  It is so contrary to America and their easy relationships, at least in my years of knowledge.
5	1386028800	A Book we had to read in school but I read the Cliff Notes instead.  Now that I am older I appreciate the style of writing that has long since disappeared.  The story was well written and the use of the English language was remarkable.
3	1386028800	The English language in the time period is very hard to comprehend. It was sometimes hard to understand the story line
5	1385942400	Can't beat the timeless story of miss Elizabeth and her crazy family or the snobbish Mr Darcy who almost let's love slip through his fingers when miss Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's prejudicem to heart and let's her pride get in the way
5	1385856000	Which I truly am. Although I have been crossed in love. Broken hearted even.  I never give up on love! Since my earliest memory of my first encounter with this book I have always loved love.  This literary masterpiece as taught me to be patient and wait for it and  to never settle for anyone less deserving. This will forever be apart of my personal collection of books. And will always be my favourite book of all time...well outside of the bible..which calls for it's own review!
5	1385856000	Always makes me laugh, cry and swoon.  I could almost wish all writers were as capable of the kind of command and use of wit as Ms. Austen displays in her writing. She writes like Da Vinci painted.
5	1385596800	I have always loved this book every sense I first read it in Junior High School.Jane Austen was writing the story the same way people use to write letters. It is very descriptive. She make you feel like you are part of the story.
5	1385424000	it Jane Austen at her best, when I read her works I feel like I am in the that time line love almost all her books
5	1385424000	Needless to say that this is one of the most pleasant books to read for a young woman. I have enjoyed it very much.
3	1385337600	I downloaded it for my wife because she wanted it but when she saw that it was on a tablet she kind of stepped back and she didn't read it, so i can't tell you if i like it or not, but all i can tell you is that it works since i tried it.
5	1385164800	Though the plot sounds very boring, the love lives of some sisters, the way that Austen writes the book makes you yearn to read more and more! This book is a classic for a reason!
4	1385164800	A definite Jane Austen classic.  Was a little difficult to read because of the time it was written but it's a CLASSIC. I enjoyed it.
5	1385164800	I've never read this woman before, but I love her writing style and I loved this book!  It was some amazing I couldn't put it down!
5	1385078400	I love reading this book it is my all time favourite. It is well laid out and now it is in a much easier format, so I can have this and other Jane Austen books with me when I travel.
4	1385078400	With a strong will and an independent mind, Elizabeth Bennett overcomes a lack of fortune and family embarrassments to find true love with very honorable but misunderstood Mr. Darcy.  Despite its age, the story still fees current.
5	1384992000	This book is 100% wonderful!! Perfect for any age! Must read. Jane Austen is a wonderful author, I'm onto emme now&#8230;
5	1384560000	I have read this book a few times over! Can not and will not stop reading over and over again!
5	1384560000	I love this novel! The characters. The language. The story. This is my third time reading it. I have it both in print and on my Kindle. I will never tire of it: it is so beautiful and romantic. It is not poorly-written or trashy like some popular novels today.
5	1384300800	This book gets better every time I read it! It is so romantic and charming; much better than modern romance novels!
5	1384041600	As with Sense and Sensibility....I could not put this book down! I felt myself connected to each character...feeling admiration and disdain as I read each chapter. Jane is a literary gem. :)
5	1383868800	This was a really good book! It was a easy read and a fun book to read!!!! I will be reading it again!!!!
3	1383782400	I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it to just about anyone. I don't wanna give away too many details about the plot. Excellent read!
5	1383609600	I love Jane Austen and I've read this book so many times, I never tire of it. I bought it because I wanted a digital copy for travel.
5	1383609600	Always a classic and aways will be . For men and woman and children. Enjoy a story that has stayed thru the ages.
5	1383523200	I always prefer the classics to the newer novels. In particular, I enjoy reading period pieces and sharing them with my young home schooled student.
2	1383523200	The story of this book is well known, and I began to read it with this in mind. I hoped it was an enjoyable read although a bit futile.I didn't count on the dialogues being as boring as they that are ... My God, the dialogues are so insipid and irrelevant ...
4	1383436800	Oh my goodness , slot of works used to describe a simple story, but that's how all the classics seam to be. I did however enjoyed the book. On to another classic.
5	1383264000	A classic must-read! Literature at it's best! One that can be re-read at many times in life. A keeper for your bookshelf.
5	1383264000	I loved this because it is so tender.  I loved all the parts in it.  Have read it many times.
5	1383177600	It's by far the best book I have ever read!! So Romantic!! This book is my new favorite novel and will be reading it again.
5	1383004800	This is a magical book. It is so, so good. A must read for any classic literature lover. READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	1383004800	One of my very favorite books. Jane Austen was amazingly talented and this is only one of her many classics.
5	1382918400	I have heard of this book over the years but had never read it nor seen any of the 'movies'.  What a great peek to an earlier time concerning women's role in society and their lack of property rights.  It was also a romantic read. I  watched the 1940 move with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier afterwards. This is a great pairing!
4	1382918400	This is a great book filled with words of wisdom. This is a great book filled with intelligent philosophy. I really enjoyed reading it and clearly even back then they had a good idea we would be encountering the troubles we are facing now and they tried to set up protection devices (through our laws) but it seems we just ignored the subtle warnings. The law is no longer there to protect the people and we have forgotten our history and why we have a constitution and what the Magna Carta is for. This book is well written and easy to read.
5	1382745600	This book was fantastic. Having seen the movie I could see the characters faces with every description. It lived up to my expectations. I truly recommend it to anyone who can appreciate witty dialogue and lively lover exchanges. A lot of fun to read.
4	1382745600	A great book, Glad to have a digital version to not have to take a physical copy on those times I want to reread it
5	1382400000	The book is wonderful and one that you will want to read more than once. Then the movie is also very very good. But please read the book before you try to view the movie so you will understand it better. Love the old classic books that I started reading when I was 12.
5	1382400000	I was pleased to find a free copy of my favorite romance for my Kindle. Plenty of people have reviewed this, so I won't go into detail. As for the format - it is not tiny print as some have said. I could read it just fine. The formatting could have been improved, however, with a page break between chapters and no extra blank line between paragraphs.
5	1382400000	If I could repine for one thing, it would be that classics so beloved as this do not have sequels to encourage everlasting affection but Miss Austen has left me with such violent happiness that I am glad she attributed Lizzy and Jane never-ending happy endings.
5	1381968000	I enjoy reading historical romance books.  This was a bit slower to read, but I did enjoy the story.  I do recommend this book.
5	1381968000	This is my favorite book.  I read it and then watched the PBS video series as well.  Excellent view into the customs of the times.  I love Mr. Darcy!
5	1381881600	I will admit that the first time I tried to read Pride and Prejudice, I was quite young and found it difficult to read.  Now, 'Many' years later, I have again read this classic novel and the story is in every right a true historical classic.  For any who truly love historical regency romance this story is a must!  It is a great read no matter your age and it is the truest view of the regency era a reader will ever find.  LOVE IT!!
5	1381795200	There are too many great quotes and insights into human nature to recount, carried by beautiful words and an engaging story.
5	1381795200	I loved this story from the start and truly hated to see it end. No matter how many times you read it you cannot help but become involved, fall in love with the characters and root for Darcy and Elizabeth.
5	1381795200	I love this book I have read it many times and every time I fall in love with the characters and language.  It takes me back to a time when you could express yourself with out using foul language to do so.
5	1381708800	I've always enjoyed this novel by Jane Austen, even more so now that it is digital and therefore portable. Allowing me to take it with me on road-trips and to school. I'm rather happy with this. :)
5	1381622400	The language and the complexity of the story and the characters makes me want to read this again and again.
5	1381622400	I read this book at least once a year and see new things in it every time. A timeless classic.
5	1381536000	Love it love it love it! I could hardly put it down! I've seen the movie with kera nightly like a million times! Was so thrilled cuz I could get they book for FREE! My new favorite book!! &lt;3
5	1381449600	One of the best classics ever written! The relationships in this story have inspired so many other &#34;continuations&#34;.  It's always popular.
5	1381276800	I LOVE JANE AUSTIN AND THIS BOOK!!!!  It's a wonderful romance when your in need of a good clean love story.
5	1381276800	I have always loved the movie so I decided to read the book it was based on and was not disappointed  it is now forever my favourite book the story is ageless every women should at some point in her life indulge in Jane Austen's novels and having read all of them after this one must say this is the best of all!!
5	1381190400	The book started with five sisters and in the duration shortly after the beginning a promise of two couples in love. A change in beat from an unexpected elopement with a silly young sister. Family politics and the devotion of friends give romances more emotion that will leave your desire of happiness and satisfaction with this book fulfilled.
5	1381190400	I read this book over and over. I buy dollar copies at used bookstores to thrust upon friends who admit to having never read it. I love this book.
5	1381104000	This book is absolutely one of my favorites, and is a timeless classic. On top of that, it's kind of awesome that there is a free virtual version here, for people without an actual copy. I'd recommend it to ANYONE, even if it's not for a school asignment, but this free kindle version makes it very easy to get your hands on it in a short amount of time for school.
5	1381017600	I recommend this book to everyone. I have read it a few times and it never loses its ability to hold my attention. Love it!
5	1380931200	Good book. It is a book  that will also improve your vocabulary. I enjoyed. A couple of slow places. One can learn something about themselves while reading.
5	1380672000	I love this book! It is highly recommended to adults and people who like adventure or romance.  It is awesome!
5	1380672000	This is a classic novel I have read several times. I love having it downloaded to my tablet so I can have access to it anytime.
4	1380672000	This was a great book to read on my Kindle phone app, while waiting in line, during appointments, or relaxing in my downtime.  I'd seen the movie, but had never read.  Many more classics on my bucket list.
4	1380499200	To be truthful I originally downloaded book onto kindle just to try out my new Kindle however once I started reading it compelled me to keep going to find out the fate of the sisters.  Not an easy read but well worth the effort.
4	1380412800	The story is interesting. Though it is better to read slow. The language is not straightforward. Not flowering, but maybe I can say too &#34;elaborate&#34;. Though that is not the right words either. Anyway, it's the language at that time.
5	1380412800	This is so enjoyable an escape that I am sure there will be a fourth reading. Good, clean fun. The best book I think that is just for fun
4	1380412800	I love the story but the wording became a little boreing. I don't read very well, and it was hard to follow. Is there a version where the wording is a little more modern?
5	1380153600	Very enjoyable read!  Written in English in another era did not keep me from understanding the story.  I found it to be a great love story..
5	1380153600	My library is reading Jane Austen for the month of October.  I could read this book over and over again.
5	1380153600	Being a somewhat of a romantic, it's not surprising that I enjoyed this book immensely. But at myself also being a masculine man, that I enjoyed it more than a manly action flick/book, should come as a surprise. Though it didn't to I who loved the movies so...
4	1379980800	I enjoyed the book but had a hard time with the books words sometime. It was written from a different era and hard to comprehend sometimes.
4	1379894400	Darcy is every woman's dream man which they see in shadow when they close their eyes to sleep. Classic novel.
5	1379894400	Some books truly can fight against time. Still one of the best books i have ever read. Love story that always inspires.
5	1379894400	It is a great story and was obtained at no charge. How great is that? Debatably the best Jane Austen story.
5	1379808000	This book is so incredibly warm, you feel like you know the people.  Austen 's book is about people, and first impressions, and the prejudices of social class.  The people are lively and funny.  It also is very informative about the position of women and the expectations of making a good marriage.  I highly recommend it.
5	1379808000	The very best of jane systems work. I downloaded this copy because it was free as it seemed silly to pay for a copy when I own at least two hard copies.it is a fine copy.
5	1379721600	Always love the classics, the length is tedious and sometimes hardtop follow after you lay it down for day or 2,
5	1379635200	I have read this novel several times and find myself turning the pages in a constant state of interested suspense.  It is a refreshing relationship novel rather than insipid romance and Iparticularly enjoyed the  strong female roles and the exploration and exposure of both the foibles and strengths of all the characters in the novel.
5	1379462400	Who wouldn't love such a fantasy of having a handsome and filthy rich guy who falls hopelessly in love with a poor plain Jane with spunky personality? It gives us all women hope!!
5	1379462400	I'll admit, in my 20 years I never had read this book but only watched the movie about 100 times and know all the lines from start to finish so I finally cracked it open (via the kindle application) and was blown away.  This book is so excellent that I cannot put it down!  If I did not have classes to go to it would be done in a day, hands down.  I cannot believe my teacher in high school said that it was boring,dry, and hard to understand therefore we should just watch the movie- oh how wrong she was!  Yes, some of the words may be a bit hard to those of a younger audience and even some older.  This is why google was created!!  On the kindle/app you can even hover over a word and it looks it up for you right then and there!  The book is only a bit different from the movie, obviously written far before the film was made, but just in case all that you have seen is the movie do not fret- it does not ruin the book!  The film is sometimes line for line the same as the novel.  This is obviously a classic that has been read and reviewed for years and years but if you have never read it- stop everything and read it now!  It has become my favorite book of all time, but I have yet to read Jane Eyre so this could change!  Another great novel by Jane Austin- Brava!!
5	1379376000	Great experience with this seller.I now adore eBooks and love Jane Austen. Will definitely buy from this great seller again!
5	1379203200	The movies I've seen based this title give it no justice...you really feel involved with the characters' point of view. I felt the ending had great closure.
3	1379203200	I always have a hard time getting through the &#34;classics&#34;..this on is no exception.  REad it because it is a classic but not because I enjoyed it.
5	1378944000	i really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys light books. its a simple book and easy to read.
5	1378857600	Jane Austin's novels and especially Pride and Prejudice stand the test of time. Great stories about realistic people who have depth.
5	1378857600	What can I say? It's a classic. The writing is amazing, the jokes are funny and Austen knows her stuff.
5	1378684800	this is really a great book and it can be hard to read but once you finish it you won't regret ever reading it. i love this book.
5	1378598400	My sister and I really love this book so much because of everything that happens and the romance and comedies.
4	1378598400	I am just starting it, and it is so far easy reading!  I still don't like the ebook layout of no page numbers and just one page of floating words.
5	1378512000	Can you read anything bad in Classics? If you liked the movie, you'll love the book more, no one can replace a good book for a representation of it.
5	1378425600	A timeless classic everyone should read!  Wanted to read it for awhile.  Glad I did. I like Jane Austen's books.
5	1378425600	Fantastic read! Wonderful love stories! Jane Austen brings you to a family, the core of a family, and lets the fun begin.
5	1378425600	It's a lecture that take your time in a fairway romance... Just like Austen can do... A good story in a 1800 girls perspective!
5	1378425600	If you're looking for a book to calm your nerves before bedtime, this will do the trick.  I was very glad to read it on my Kindle, because of the Kindle feature that lets you look up definitions as you read.  I felt my vocabulary expanding as I went along.  The story itself is pretty mundane (thus good bedtime reading), but the characters and historical setting, convey an amazing sense of how society functioned when this book was written.  Probably one reason it is considered a classic.....
4	1378425600	It does meander a bit in the middle but it is a classic for a reason. I will always enjoy this book.
4	1378339200	I wasn't sure what to expect but found this book very enjoyable and readable. It's a lovely story of love and family, and changed misconceptions. I am sure there are much more erudite reviews than mine but I quite enjoyed this story.
5	1378252800	good product that i am still using. will order from them again. why are they requiring us to type a certain amount of words for a review?????!!!!
5	1378252800	A classic that I love to read over and over. The story of two sisters and the trials they must endure to find love and happiness.
5	1378166400	Product description was perfect, price was perfect delivery was perfect. A perfect transaction&#8230;Will purchase from this vendor again as the need arises...
3	1378080000	This book was slow. If you are in to romance and all of that jazz then this book might be for you, but I thought it was really boring
5	1377993600	I chose to read this novel because I felt it obligatory to read a classic piece of literature. However, I was surprised by how engaging and thought-provoking it actually was! Read it for Austen' s mastery of the English language; read it for the love story and drama; read it for the character development; read it because it is so readable, accessible and beautiful in every way.
4	1377907200	This is an amusing book with very nice, detailed descriptions of characters and events. An excellent classic that must be read.
5	1377907200	I cannot say more than that I love this book, I have read it at least 10 times. Great story.
5	1377820800	This is my all time favorite book and was glad to be able to read it in bed at night on my kindle fire during a low period in my life~it really made my day~I have read the hardback book countless times so wasn't sure I'd enjoy it on the kindle but it was a pleasant reading experience.
5	1377820800	This item came much more quickly than expected and was super easy to change out. One suggestion is to be really careful when closing the door. They are easy to break.
5	1377648000	Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorite books.  I read it years ago, and just re-read it again prior to reading the sequels to it written by Anna Elliott.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes classical literature. It leaves you feeling good after you read it.
5	1377475200	I enjoyed the read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic read.  Jane Austen is a favorite.
5	1377475200	Oh, I love Jane Austen's writing, wit and sense of humor. Her characters could also live in modern times. A smart woman, ahead of her time.
5	1377388800	How else would anyone rate Jane Austin but spectacular?  Her characters come alive and the lifestyle of the period is perfectly imparted.  She is a great read.
5	1377388800	Jane Austen has some pretty amazing talent with words. Not just a simple book, because to understand her style of writing you have to really think sometimes, but it is a great read. She has a way with words that is very fresh and unique.
5	1377302400	15 years ago I first picked up this book. Now I try to read it every year around my birthday and it is by far my favourite book of all time. The character are so well written and you find yourself become part of their world. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life!
5	1377216000	This book is a classic, and one which I would mark as recommended reading for anyone.  Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors
5	1377216000	This is probably my favourite novel and I am not alone in my opinion as it consistently rates in the top rank of Most Popular Novels. I have read it so many times that I can quote quite long passages and I can return to it like an old friend.The plot is quite simple, with no &#34;Gothic&#34; drama of the type found in &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; for example, but the characters make the book.  Each character is beautifully drawn, both in physical appearance and in their specific characteristics, one can close one's eyes and see them and hear their voices.  Jane Austen was an acute observer of people and her witty descriptions keep the reader smiling. This book was a natural for my first Kindle selection.
5	1377216000	The best love story ever..I can read it over and over a hundred times more..It always has a freshness to it
5	1377129600	I cannot say enough about how good Austen is at drawing you into her world. The characters are so fully fleshed out as to haunt you as real people. Read it, watch the movie, love it for the rest of your life. Seriously.
5	1377129600	One of my favorite stories of Jane Austen. I have read several times and still find it a great read!
5	1377129600	The number of films and broadcasts made of this classic tale, with its extraordinary insights into human character and behaviour are all the testimony needed to its popularity. One of those rare books than can happily be read a second and third time.
5	1376956800	What romantic at heart wouldn't love it.  jane Austen at her very best.  Could read it at least once a year.
4	1376870400	For a high school student, the language of this book took some getting use to. However, as soon as i got the hang of it i began to realize the striking underlying message of the book. Great read for students especially for those in AP English!!
5	1376784000	I have read the book before, and I still love it!It is funny, well written, good language and fantastic characters.
5	1376697600	What more can be written in praise about this wonderful book? Excellent and fun read. A classic that brings a smile.
5	1376697600	Fantastic book an insult to early life in England and with a delightful story you will enjoy it as much as I did
5	1376611200	It transcends time and is a wonderful historically based period piece love story. Always fun to re-read. I loved it, AGAIN.
5	1376611200	This book is very very excellent. Although it is a little long and a little confusing, the ending is just amazing! I love this novel and highly recommend it to readers of romance.
4	1376524800	If you are looking for a great filled with humor, lost love, longing, and characters you want to reach into the book and slap...this is that book!
5	1376524800	The book was so good and I do own the movie.  I have watched the DVD many times and I can't stop until it is finished.  Wonderful story.
5	1376524800	It was a joy to re-immerse myself in 19th century prose. Reading it in ebook form is a special treat, as you can open a dictionary just by touching the word in question. Also, having seen several movies and TV series retelling the tale, it was good to go back to the original, and reconsider the various film versions in light of the book.
4	1376524800	One of the classics.  The book is well written and the story keeps you interested.  I am glad I finally read it.
5	1376438400	I enjoyed reading this book. Even though the language sometimes became a little clunky, it was never very difficult to understand. It is the perfect book for someone who loves happy endings.
5	1376438400	I love this book. Even if I didn't understand some of the words or meanings, I looked it up. It's a wonderful book and so much love is going on.
5	1376352000	I really admire how the author made this  romance novel so innocent and intelligent. I have read contemporary stories that were set in this time period but not half so interesting. The verbal banter is extraordinary, and the title is so fitting. A must read!
5	1376352000	It took me a while to break down the book so I could understand it in today's language, but it was so worth the effort and I loved every page. Great book!
5	1376352000	Jane Austen was a most perceptive lady, and she made observations of human nature which are still poignantly true today. She recognized peoples general foibles, the ridiculousness mankind has a tendency towards and wrote about it with wit and a bit of humor.  I can't think of one character she's ever written which was unrelatable, I recognize them all in a friend, an acquaintance or relative and I laugh at her insight and pragmatic consideration towards simply accepting people are what they are and you may as well just go on with your life.  Pride and Prejudice is probably her best example of this ability for conveying true humanity in a very excellent and interesting story. Elizabeth Bennett is a well-rounded and most interesting heroine, and Mr. Darcy a perfect opposite who turns out ultimately, to be perfectly paired.  There is a full family, a comprehensible social circle and so many goings on, you won't lose interest. Read Pride and Prejudice and enjoy one of the best stories in literature.
5	1376352000	The book may be 200 years old, but Jane Austen's sense of humor and understanding of human nature is timeless. The story is captivating, fast paced, and sprinkled with quotable nuggets of wisdom.
5	1376265600	it gets better with age....i remember i read it on my language the very first time back in 2005 after i saw the film adaption and hooked by it.then i read the original version on english. what i felt is how perfectly the author used humour,romance and irony at the same time. the book is absolutely competitive among those authors who are married(such a pitty that Jane Austin didn't get married).every time i read the book, i get a whole new level of understanding the book.from the misunderstanding between the couples to become life partners to each other, they got through a lot, and this is what made the novel so fitting and understandable even in our time.all those characters in the novel can be found in our real life, this is why  i love the book as well.this book is one of my favourite book of all time, and one classic romantic stories that all women who loves to read a love story on a cosy sunday with a cup of tea or coffee.
5	1376179200	This story is beyond compare. It has all the endearing qualities one could hope for in classical literature as well as the accessibility of a quick paced novel. The story is relatable but far from tired, moral without imposition, and continually diverting with it's easy flow through the entirety of the plot. The underlying love story more than once invites sighs of admiration from its affected audience. We commiserate with the emotional turmoil experienced on both sides of the protagonists' affair, and are almost equally affected by the experiences of the lesser characters. The range of characters is wonderful, encompassing both the refined and the utterly preposterous. Something about the simplicity of this novel's time and place adds greatly to its effect, and amidst this simplicity a new, unfamiliar complexity of interaction, behavior, and expectation is unearthed. This is the most perfectly executed novel I have ever read. My heart gave way so readily to the characters and the enchantment of Longbourn, Netherfield, and Pemberley that I have  revisited, and continually enjoyed, the story three times now. I highly, highly recommend this book to you and anyone else who might be interested in reading a novel of substance. Please, enjoy.
5	1376179200	I've always loved this novel -- what's been called a comedy of manners.  Austen brilliantly observes the thoughts and actions of the characters with irony and humor while weaving romance throughout.  But I used to think of it as superficial because she kept a proper decorum in her stories.  As I get older, I've come to appreciate aspects of her writing that I hadn't noticed before.  For example, the manners that I found stuffy and tedious, now seem to me to be the social grease of getting along with others, illustrated well in her stories.  I can learn something from her.
5	1376179200	This book is a wonderful book that is delghtfully witty and entertaning. It portrays the stunning similarities between modern and older societies as well as our prides and prejudices.
5	1376179200	Read it! Mrs. Bennet is my favourite character. I love the way that woman can change her mind about everything, in less than a second.
5	1376092800	I have read this book several times in my life, and I never get tired of it.  Jane Austen brought to life a family that is as endearing, exasperating, and at times humorous as any real family.
5	1376092800	I have read this book before and it was just as good second time around. An interesting period story for all women young and old. Love Jane Austin :-)
4	1376092800	After seeing this book at the top of several book lists, I decided to read it since there was a free copy.  Although I wasn't sure that I would like it at first, I found myself trying read as much as possible. I think the author did a great job with each of the characters, and there were a couple of surprising twists.  I would highly recommend this popular classic, but be sure you have a dictionary or internet access available when reading it.
5	1376006400	Loved this book. Once again I'm going to miss these characters! I love this novel because it had romance of a different time period. I can't wait to read another Jane Austen book.
5	1376006400	I fell in love with Darcy when I first read this book in high school and can't say enough good things about it! More than just a love story, it pokes fun at social norms and conventions, making for a witty read. Sure, you can watch the various film versions that are out, but the pictures in your head are always better! Can't recommend this book highly enough!
5	1376006400	I love Jane Austen's prose and variety of characters; I wish I could write like her.  Pride and Prejudice is the best of all her novels.
5	1376006400	classic book, love it.Read it after watching the 1995 TV series.In comparison, the 1995 version is the most accurate of all the TV versions
5	1375920000	I have read this multiple times and have over watched the movie. Every time I read it, I am reminded of my relationship with my husband. At first meeting him, I had nothing kind to say of him. As time went, my love for him grew. Now, we are happily married with two sons. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!
4	1375833600	Elizabeth Bennett is living a young adults life learning what it takes to be a lady and a member of society. She watches her sister's obsess over getting married, witnesses her parents loveless marriage, and longs to travel and find happiness.  She is also very opinionated, a trait which catches the eye of many young men in the town. Unlike her sister's, Elizabeth is picky about her suitors and refuses to settle just for the sake of being married. A good story of growing up and learning about life. Fun read.
5	1375833600	Everyone knows this is a great read. I enjoy this book. I have read it many times.It is a time gone by and a true classic.
5	1375833600	Very good for your teeth.You can get a sample first from your dentist. The benefits to your teeth and following what your Dentist tells you are important they work together. A good purchase.
1	1375747200	This book did not download. I gave the product more than enough time to download and it never appeared on my home screen.
4	1375747200	So interesting the way Austin wrote in the 19th century. Reading was hard to get through, and sometimes hard to understand. However, 19th century and 21st century human nature is exactly the same.
5	1375660800	This book is a must read for people of all ages. The story of Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett is heartfelt and keeps you on your toes.
5	1375660800	I love the setting, and language of the book!!! I must admit it seemed a little long, but it was totally worth it!!! It's a great story of love and romance, there is something in it for almost everyone! The book has altered my perception of people, the developed of Mr. Darcy is so fantastic, he goes from a surly, unlikable character, to one that any girl would kill for. If you like this book you should definitely check out Mr. Darcy's Diary, by Amanda Grange. It tells the whole story from Mr. Darcy's perspective. You may find that your opinion of certain characters shifts a little. But a definite must read for anyone who likes books.
5	1375574400	as I have three versions of the films made from the book and the book you can l tell i am a real fanshe writes almost for a stage play and her own world was fasinating to me
2	1375574400	I did not read this book in school, so I decided to give it a try.  It was written in 1813.  I am so glad I read it on my Kindle because you can see the meaning of words when you don't know them.  There were a lot of words I was not familiar with.  Ms. Austen writes in the manner they did in those days and it is very hard to follow.  I had to reread pages to get the meaning.  Also, we are so removed from the society as it was then, I could not get excited or interested in the story of classes of people who have so many rules and are so intent on getting their female children married off to the proper husband.
5	1375574400	My daughter was sitting here watching one of her tv shows and the teens on it were talking about reading Pride and Prejudice for school.  My child hasn't had to read it for school but said she wants to read it so we looked on Amazon and found the Kindle Edition FREE.  I love that there are these classics available for FREE!  Thanks Amazon!  Getting all the FREE available books for Kindle makes the Kindle pay for itself through the past 3 years!
5	1375574400	I loved the book but I was already a fan. I have seen many versions of this book in films with many different actors and liked them all. Some more than others but loved the different interpretations of each one. I like  to go back and read the book myself every so often to keep the authors original vision in my head as I watch some of the film versions. I almost always like the authors vision the best and don't like actors to stray from it. As many  times as I read the book each time I see something new in it or find something I had forgotten about in the story line. A good book can be enjoyed over and over. You know where the story starts and where it ends but you get to enjoy the journey thru the book each time you read it. At least I do....hope you will too.
5	1375488000	I have lost count of how many times I have read this book but it seems fresh every time.  Having a copy in my Kindle library is the logical thing to do.
5	1375488000	This is and always will be my favorite romance of all time. I  re-read it often and love it every time.
5	1375228800	Never did read this in high school, nor did I ever see a film of it. Thought I should read it before I die. Glad I did. Not sure why it's considered such a masterpiece, for I think of it as a rollicking good summer read. The writing is witty. I can "see the movie in my head" and that's a sign of good writing to me. I did gain insight into the way we sometimes mistakenly perceive the notion we have of ourselves. I did pause to consider how might I be like Elizabeth in my thinking how fair minded I am when, indeed, I may have a very wrong picture. I truly enjoyed this book and may try some more Austen when I get through a few other books that  require my time.
5	1375142400	Great service! Fast Shipping! The item arrived as promised and without delay. I will order again the future for sure!
5	1375056000	This is truly a work of art. It is a classic for a reason, and definitely one that everyone should read at some point. Austen's writing is ingenious, and the sentence structure and vocabulary just make you want to sign with pleasure. Wonderful, wonderful read.
5	1374969600	There is no doubt it is a time tested classic. Authors today do not share the same writing style. However I must add in order to put the details into this story it is quite long.
5	1374883200	A sublime read... Jane Austen's characters are intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable.  An excellent author and wonderful book (and wonderful to have on Kindle!).
5	1374883200	I recently reread this and have no idea why it seemed like such an effort the first time around in high school. I think I'd become too used to Stephen King's understated efficiency, but have on my second read of this over ten year later come to appreciate this as representing its own brand of understated, stylish, and evocative efficiency.Having read some books relatively contemporary to this one since, it's not unthinkable to imagine that it's impact may have had as much to do with its themes and characters as it did with its easy, flowing style. In hindsight, it may have just been the rapid introduction of so many characters that had overloaded by likely-strained senior year perceptions at the time, but all that was smoothed and established second time around, meaning I could focus totally on that stylish flow and quickly efficient wit.There's really no point recommending this book 200 years after its publication: you wouldn't be reading this at all if time's verdict hadn't already been given.
5	1374883200	Had read Sense and Sensibility, as Austen is one of my father's, YES, father's, favorite authors.  Must admit I saw the movie version of this one first, but decided the book must have a bit more detail than the film.  It does, and is well worth the time!
5	1374883200	This is a wonderful book that I have read many times. The classic romance that Mrs. Austen created is a work of genius that anyone who enjoys classic literature will love.
4	1374883200	I liked even though it was hard to understand at times. I just spark noted some chapters. I love jane austen.
5	1374883200	Been putting off reading this worthy tome for the thick end of half a century.  Eventually succumbed to the temptation of a free Kindle edition, and totally seduced by Austen's prose.  Wish that I had read it years ago.
4	1374883200	Sometimes the writing style in classics is too thick, tough to get interested in.  And the story is old fashioned.  I have to admit that this is one of those stories for me.  It just doesn't keep my interest.  But how can i possibly rate it lower than a 4?  It's a classic and many people love it (and maybe some day i'll get into it).
5	1374710400	3 times and love it more than ever!  Love it!  A masterpiece of her time and ours, one that will never go out of style!  Love it!
5	1374364800	How can you beat a Jane Austin book? The writing and the story were wonderful and I couldn't put it down. I must reread this book every year.
5	1374364800	I read this Austen book after having read a couple of amusing parodies. I have since seen a couple of versions of the book on video. I'm most amazed that such a young woman, with virtually no world experience, could have written such a complicated book, with such twists and turns of plot. She was extremely talented in other ways and I recommend all the books I have read, &#34;Sense, etc&#34; and &#34;Persuasion&#34;. &#34;Persuasion&#34; is the favorite of one of my daughters. I need to see that video and read it again since the movies tend to iron out some of the confusion of these complicated plots. These may be considered books for women but I'm a romanticist having been raised by a mother along side two sisters, having married and raised three daughters and managing banks with mostly women employees. Sorry, but I cry with great emotion (even with commercials on TV, if they are moving to me) So there!.
5	1374278400	This is one of those pieces you get into quickly and simply cannot put down.  I kept hoping, as I came to the end, that there was more of this story to be read.
4	1374278400	Pride and Prejudice was a favorite of required reading for me in school and after several I enjoyed reading it again.Well worth a second read as an older person.
2	1374192000	I tried my best to read this so-called masterpiece without falling asleep yet it proved almost impossible. I admit it might be enjoyed by many people yet it just isn't my cup if tea...
5	1374192000	It was definitely not a quick, easy read, but I very much enjoyed every bit of it. I will absolutely be reading more of Jane Austen' s novels.
4	1374105600	For me it was a little slow at first, but got more interesting as it went along. Because of how popular it is, I  guessed I just expected more.
4	1373932800	A little slow at the beginning but the story line is great. The language can also be difficult to understand  sometimes that you have  to go back and read a few sentences again.
3	1373932800	I had to get this for an english class I'm taking in college and I would have to say this book is rough to read.
4	1373846400	Genuine book with genuine characters. The book drew me in more than I expected. Good summer read a a a
5	1373846400	Truly a classic. A story I can read & enjoy time and time again. I would also recommend the movie; they did an exceptional job of bringing Austen's delightful characters to life.
5	1373846400	I've read this four times now.  I love the way she writes with all the twists and turns in the story.
5	1373846400	Jane Austen is the wittiest novelist in the English language and the most observant of individual personal mannerisms.  No question
5	1373587200	A must have in everyone's book collection. The wonderful story of love and it's struggles in society and overcoming class.
5	1373500800	Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers and the character of Lizzy is one of literature s most beloved heroines. A classic!
5	1373500800	A favourite read that delights more and more each time.  Such elegance and wit contained in beautifully constructed prose, this is a novel forever fresh and of enduring brilliance that should be read many times to be fully appreciated.
4	1373500800	This book was very compelling and well written. It caught my attention and the ending was perfect. Overall, a good classic worth reading.
5	1373500800	I have read this before but still love the story and the characters. It still is my favourite Jane Austin novel
3	1373414400	Can't say I fell for Mr Darcy - or Lizzy or any of the Bennet's.  Probably good socio-historical novel, but I could have lived without it.
5	1373328000	This is a great summer read. What a great story, no matter how often I've read it. I can't get enough of the Bennetts and all their antics
4	1373328000	Rereading this lovely novel gives a picture of what it was like for women in the olde days.  A little hard to relate to today, but some of the issues are still around!
5	1373068800	I love this book. Many people relate to characters in movies or books, and I relate to Elizabeth. She and I are very similar. I read this to understand about human failings and the hope that love brings.
5	1373068800	I usually can't really get into the classics, but this was a very riveting and enlightening book. I recommend it.
5	1372982400	Some books, and this is one, are indifferent to your opinion. They have stood time's test (200 years), have enduring themes (love and money) and believable characters. Your opinion of them says more about you than about the book. So yes, I love it for theme and characterisation and writing that makes Hemingway sound wordy.
5	1372723200	Jane Austen captured her world and made it timeless in Pride and Prejudice.  What makes it so great is that once you remove the costumes, manner of speaking, etiquette and replace those with our era nothing much has changed because the &#34;pride and prejudice&#34; of each succeeding era remains essentially the same despite the advancement in technology.
5	1372723200	Amazing love this story, writing style, and grace. This book captivates and entertains, it truly makes you feel like you're a part of their world.
5	1372636800	Don't make up your mind about someone's character before you have exhausted all the facts.  And sometimes it is good to let others know how you honestly feel about them, although it can certainly be risky.
5	1372636800	I've heard of this book before so when I seen it, it yelled out to me &#34; read me&#34;. And like any normal person I did!!!
5	1372636800	What a great read. This book by Ms. Austen is wonderfuly writen about the Edwardan Era of the British Empire. A must have for your Kindal Libiary.
5	1372636800	This is absolutely my favorite book. I . Have read it more than ten times and every time it pulls me in and I read it in 2 or 3 days. Now that I have finished the book again I'm going to go. Watch the movie!! Happy reading!
4	1372550400	Good book a little difficult to keep up with at times.but enjoyed reading it. Would recommend this book highly
5	1372464000	Without a doubt, this is by far Jane Austin's most well written work!  She surely was a lady well informed.
5	1372377600	I was glad to have this for my Kindle.  I loved reading it again. Timeless principles are communicated by Jane Austen.
5	1372377600	I can easily see why this classic has stood the test of time! I am glad I finally made the time to read it. Anyone who is a romantic at heart should read it.
5	1372377600	Jane Austen is amazing!!!!! I love love love her writing! She is a genius when it comes to romance! Best love story ever!
5	1372291200	Fabulous story and great use of vocabulary. I loved the romance as well as the hardships. Just amazing. I loved it.
5	1372204800	This was a thrilling look at an impressively adventurous life and an exciting time in Kenya.  I was excited the whole time I was reading it.
5	1372204800	I don't know why it's taken me so long to read this. It's a great classic! I would recommend it to everyone!
4	1372118400	Ms Austen's stories are very good... the characters are interesting and she brings them to life.  However, the quaint language and long complex sentences may make the read too tedious for some.  I am not a speed reader anyway, so it didn't bother me after I got into the first book.  I plan to read them all.
5	1372118400	I have read this one twice. My only problem with the book is that I didn't want it to end. I wish Ms. Austen had written a sequel, but 'twasn't to be (sigh). My favourite characters are Lizzie and Mr. Darcy, of course. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet's sense of humour and Mrs. Bennet's histrionics. Some readers may not like Lydia and Wickham, but there could hardly be a story without them. Of course, we all know individuals like Mr. Collins (a name-dropping toady) and Lady Catherine (a snide, condescending snob). With its variety of interesting personalities, Pride and Prejudice is my favourite Austen work...give it a go.
4	1372118400	I had previously seen the movie on our PBS station, and upon seeing subsequent books (Charlotte and Rosings), which looked interesting and are suggested to be follow ups to Jane Austen's book, decided to read the original book.  I found the language a little difficult to follow, but enjoyed the book nonetheless.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, I would recommend reading this book keeping the aforementioned &#34;old English&#34; language in mind.
5	1372032000	The depth of human nature and interpersonal relationships is clearly demonstrated in a time without technology when people had nothing else to do but relate to one another.  Loved it.
5	1371945600	Surprisingly I enjoyed this, not sure why as it's not my usual cup of tea, but I felt quite chuffed with the experience.
5	1371945600	Keeps today's audience engaged as well. Classic for a reason. If you're on the fence, is recommend reading it, totally worth it
3	1371859200	I was looking for something a bit more challenging than the trivia which it deals with.  I have actually not finished it.
5	1371600000	I had never read this book before, nor have I seen the movie it inspired. I was delighted to discover that I truly enjoyed it.
5	1371600000	Jane Austen was amazing for her time.  This would be an incredible book even if it were written today.  I have read it twice and purchased the move as well.  LOVE IT!
5	1371513600	It was quite good! I've read it before but I recommend to ppl who r not afraid of a little romance and looking up up the meaning of some tough words.
5	1371427200	This book is timeless, very well written, and engaging. The antagonists are entwined descriptively in the lives of the protagonists, creating an interesting pull between evil and good. Definitely a good read or re-read for those who read it years ago!!
4	1371427200	A timeless classic to read over and over.  Great to pass on to the kids when they need something to read.
5	1371427200	Jane Austen was a favorite growing up and I still can go back and enjoy..that is what makes a classic.
5	1371427200	This was a hard read in many ways but to reach such an end a as this book has is wonderful.
5	1371340800	Got the book for free. It's brilliant. It is a very good and funny and educational story with a very happy ending. The kindle version is of high quality and I haven't found any mistakes.
5	1371340800	This one of my favorite books.  The book is very well written.  Each time I read, it is like reading it for the first time.
1	1371340800	I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate the classics.  I tried to read it on two different occasions, but I couldn't get in to it.
4	1371168000	Relaxing read. No big crises in this book. Enjoyed the style of writing. However, some of the sentence structure (typical for that era) was challenging.
5	1371168000	hadn't read this since High Scool.  Enjoyed it very much.This requires 10 words or it won't let you out, stupid!!
3	1371168000	After starting this book, I realised that I had read it years before, so didn't proceed with it.  I don't like reading books a second time.
5	1370908800	We have had Pride and Prejudice in the canon of English literature since 1813, and now 200 years later, Amazon wants a review of it. I suppose that by modern standards, the novel could be said to be too wordy and tells more than it shows, but that would be as ridiculous as trying to find things 'wrong' with this classic.
5	1370822400	I love this book. I love all the characters, the wit and liveliness of Eliza, the frank practicality of Charlotte, the sweetness of Jane, the silliness of the Bennett parents,  and the complete character of Darcy. It is a romantic book. I love the complete change of Darcy.  I believe her aunt and uncle describe it best, "that one of them at least knew what it was to love."  I read this book every couple of years, and every time as  I approach the middle I am engulfed. It is a classic read. I love how it is funny and endearing all at the same time. It is a great read with complex characters and an engaging story.
5	1370822400	I enjoy reading books from this era.  I am a romantic at heart.  I love Elizabeth's character.  So worldly for that time.
5	1370822400	I know 13 in the anniversary of this classic, not sure if it's 1813 or 1713 or earllier or later. But thought this summer would be a good time to read it. Though some of the phrases threw me, I really enjoyed the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Going to buy the audio version and listen to it on the beach each summer. Nice easy breezy read. Saw the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Graphic Novel at my local library and am going to read that, would seem to be better than just the PPand Z book with no pictures.
5	1370822400	Perfect book to collect, if you are Jane Austine fan.  And it is pretty neat to have an audio option to listen to.
5	1370736000	This book was amazing! It was a little boring at first, but got better as it went on. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did. The romance and suspense that Jane Austen puts into it is timeless. Next I will be reading Sense and Sensibility. I hope it is as good as this book.  -Hope Venema
5	1370736000	I loved this story. I liked the characters. I love the romance part of the plot of the story. I would recommend it.
5	1370736000	I never actually read this book in high school and until I watched the Lizzie Bennett Diaries, I wasn't interested in ever reading it. I'm so glad I did, this has to be one of my favorite books.
5	1370649600	I love this book. Perfect ebook version. But when reading you may just need a dictionary that would help if you don't know what countenance means and other words probably used in Modern English in an age where reading was actually fundamental and mostly everyone had a some form of wit as Elizabeth and, quite evidently, the author have in the story. Also be aware of the many sentences where `of the latter` is used, because Austen does use a lengthy sentence structure. The author is referring to the last thing previously mentioned. Pride and Prejudice is a great read for those with a love of literature and language but i also recommend for anyone with an understanding of the meanings if diction, details, language, syntax, and imagery for this book will require some knowledge of the latter to avoid a bewildered experience.
5	1370649600	I fell in love with the movie from the first time I saw it. Now that I have read the book, I understand so much of what happened in the movie.This book is sweet and I love how innocent it is. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of today's perverse society, to those who are tired of reading and watching stories that are filled with sex and violence...
5	1370563200	...she's a genius. I love all her book P&P is my favorite. Persuasion is 2nd, S&S 3rd, & Emma 4th...& the rest have equal footing.
1	1370563200	there are some words out of order! it's a mess!!please take back this publication from the site or get it fixed!
2	1370563200	The plot line and underlying story were great, but the complicated verbosity of the author's language turned me off immediately. Dialogue was not often clearly attributed to a specific character and confused me sometimes. I made myself finish it just to say I did.
5	1370563200	Even though I knew the basic story of this book I'd never got around to reading it. I'm so glad I finally did, the writing and feeling conveyed by this book is wonderful and I'd thoroughly recommend to anyone!
5	1370476800	I read this at least once a year.  This e-book was flawless and free-how can you go wrong with that?
1	1370476800	I HATE IT!!!!!!!! I just skipped to the 100% to write a review. It was sooooooo boring !!!!!!! Not interesting at all. I have been at 6% since JANUARY AND IT IS NOW JUNE. You should never read this EVER. You can die if you do. It does not deserve a half star.
5	1370476800	Have not read much of this book, but I have liked all Jane Austen books so far and I am sure this one will be no different.
4	1370390400	Of course, we all know this classic novel.  It is amusing to reread it.The characters are often prickly, sometimes surprising, but always amusing.
5	1370390400	Simply a classic. I could read this book over and over in fact I have 4 times now. Love it!
5	1370131200	This is such a fantastic book! I have read it over and over again and will read it again and again!!! It is perfectly written and shows how love works in such strange ways! The dialogue of the different characters is perfect! The character's themselves are FANTASTIC! Each has their own faults and virtues. Read it. Gives hope by showing that through normal and unfortunate events love can be found! Great read!!!!!!!!
5	1369872000	This is one of my favorite books. I liked being able to take it with me, and not have a bulky book.
5	1369785600	Language of Jane Austin transported me to another time where self expression was an art form compared to our expressions of today. I found myself resisting the style of writing, feeling it was getting in the way of the story. Then, as I settled into the nuances I realized the writing played an equal role to our beloved characters and locations.A valuable experience worth the efforts.
5	1369785600	Love this book! It's a little hard to read because of language, but it's still worth it. Totally amazing! Sweet.
3	1369785600	In today's culture of egocentrism, I wanted to learn more about a culture in which often the prime concern was for others.  A book one wades through, rather than devours.  Worth the wading, however.
5	1369699200	Every sentence crafted beautifully. Her insights still seem insightful and apt all these years later. The characters sing off the page.
5	1369699200	I love this book, but it's so freaking long! Besides that, it's a very dramatic book, and it kinda gives me the feelings of the 1800s...to say the least.
5	1369699200	Really, this book is a little unfair to all man living. The portray of Mr. Darcy in Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice leaves every women wanting so much more of their real life counterpart. This really is a classic worth reading and reading again.
5	1369699200	This is an absolute classic and was a joy to read. I love all of Jane Austen's novels, but this one might now be my favorite.
5	1369612800	I read this novel at least once a year and will do so forever.  Romantic, beautiful characterisation and a lost world of manners.
4	1369612800	The reason I liked this book was because it was really sweet and it right me about more vocab words that I have never heard before. I love this book!
2	1369526400	I read even less of this book.  S&S was easier to read than this.  The style of writing was confusing and boring and hard to follow.
5	1369267200	A wonderful classic! It is a great read and timeless. The characters are exciting to follow. Elizabeth is a wonderful character. Smart,strong yet kind and thoughtful.
5	1369267200	I read this at least once a year and often when I don't have another book going I pick it up at bedtime.
5	1369180800	This book is a classic that stands through the test of time. This is one of my favorite books and have read it several times. If you love &#34;love&#34; stories then you need to add this one to your collection.
5	1369094400	I am an older dude. If you are a &#34;connoisseur of human folly&#34;, this book is for you. True, it is a love story -- but it is more than that. Jane Austen uses her characters as various modes of exploration of the dimensions in human interactions and perceived judgements and the folly resulting thereof.  The witticisms bantered back and forth are absolutely stunning. The best is by far the garden dialog between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine de Bourgh (you must read &#34;Lady Catherine de Bourgh&#34; in the melodic, over dramatized voice of Mr Collins in the BBC 5 hr miniseries on Pride and Prejudice).The dialog never bores and the depth of character development is unsurpassed. Jane Austen is rightly said to be second only to Shakespeare on insights into the human psyche.
5	1369094400	It's pride and prejudice! everyone needs this on hand for when you need a great love story!OR Persuasion or Sense and Sensibility! or....
5	1369094400	Good book! I had to read this book for a project.... I'm not saying you should love it; just respect it.
5	1369008000	I have always loved Jane Austen! Pride and Prejudice never disappoints me. It is always the go to book for me.
5	1368835200	always feel the need to reread the classics...It's in my blood!!  but the ease of having the kindle app and being able to get books on my ipad from my amazon account ...love love love
5	1368748800	I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is a witty story that really had me rooting for the main character.
5	1368662400	Honestly, I had no idea what this book was about. Whether it was from ignorance or a disregard, I can't say.The first 100 pages or so were almost unpleasant to read. The story and characters take a wonderful (and expected) turn that really drew me in. Everything about it was enjoyable from that point on.For other male readers, I hate love stories and I'm not a fan of chick flicks or anything of the sort, but I loved this book.
5	1368662400	I have dozens of books on my  Kindle, but I like to have the classics to.  This story is one of my favorites.  I always look for them in the free downloads.  The quality is good and I am never disappointed.
5	1368662400	What a classic.  I love this book.  No matter how many times I read it I still think it is great.
4	1368576000	I love having this downloaded on my smartphone because I can read this great store anywhere.  This helps when waiting at a doctor's office or in a long line.
4	1368576000	I never thought I'd ever say that I liked a movie better than a book.  Parts of the book get a little tedious and move slowly.  But the overall story is great.
4	1368489600	The classic love story that transcends time.  If you can struggle through the language and big words it leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy.
5	1368403200	This book is fantastic! Way better than the movie. However I wouldn't recommend this book to a child, a person 12 or older, only because contents maybe confusing to minors.
5	1368316800	Very good. The best of its kind. I loved everything about this product. Writing this review is extremely stupid and time consuming.
3	1368316800	It is hard to keep up with the characters in the beginning. I actually had to watch part of it on TV to keep the characters straight as I read the book. It is a classic so I will go back and try to read it again.
5	1368316800	Jane Austen has a talent of taking such true present principles of human society and stating them just so in her books that they catch her readers by at first surprise, then strike them with the reality of the statement itself. Jane Austen incorporates many of these statements into this book, and creates a comedy within multiple love stories with slight twists that predict the book from becoming too predictable or boring. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys Jane Austen already and who likes classic love tales with slight bits of humor and intellect integrated into the events and conversations of the overall story.
5	1368144000	I re-read it about once every four or five years.  An excellent story of life in England during the 1800s.
5	1368144000	That is about it.  It is a classic novel with fantastic and timeless characters.  A wonderful must read for anyone who enjoys classic period novels.  Thanks Jane
4	1368144000	I have read this several times over the years as a&#34;go-to&#34; when I need something amusing that will take me into another world. This other world is very shallow but complex social world Victorian??? England. It only covers one caste, though-I would guess middle or upper-middle wannabes. Anyway, its a fast read, and never fails to amuse me, especially as I see some of this behavior still being played out here in my own very provincial village.....Always, Hope
2	1367971200	Stopped reading after ten chapters.  Suppose Sci-Fi and Fantasy are more interesting to me than this &#34;gossip&#34; soap opera (manipulative) type story.
5	1367884800	Five star!THIS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR ANY ONE WHO LIKES LOVE STORIES!It was great,I loved it a lot!
5	1367884800	One of my favorite stories. I have seen the movie version and read the book hundreds of times. Love it.
5	1367712000	One of the best novels of all time, and by far the best thing Austen ever wrote; so much so that it's hard to believe the same author penned her other boring, turgid books. Light, witty and entertaining as well as being a snapshot of her time and class, Pride and Prejudice is rightly hailed as a masterpiece.
5	1367712000	No matter how many times in reading I am always amazed by the masterpiece Jane Austin has created. A true classic leaves the reader always wanting to know more of Elizabeth and Darcy's story.
5	1367712000	love it! a wonderful classic that everyone should have on their shelf. A look into history and love through a very talented writer
5	1367712000	Hence I am giving it 5 stars - wonderful to read with the English Languageand usage of wordsFeel more should follow the use of words and meaning instead of usingsuch unnecassary language which to many is offensive where to  have abetter knowledge of the usage of words more readily available!!
5	1367539200	Brushing off my classics, i took to reading Pride and Prejudice again. For someone living in the 21st century and having read all genre for more than 1/2 century, i found the style, the old English, the length of descriptions and dialogues absolutely boring. I liked it though, because the story is revolutionary for a writer of this epoch, and love stories are timeless and poignantly good for most.Better yet was the chance to discover a new author (of my generation and era this time) who endeavored to writing a follow-up on Ms. Austen's great story: "Georgiana Darcy's Diary" from Anna Elliott. If you have loved "Pride and Prejudice" you would want to linger in the company of all its characters and read it.
2	1367539200	Although this book is known as a classic and read in many schoolrooms, I found it long and boring. Austen writes in a way that I felt was rambling - a lot of useless conversation in the story and difficult to follow the English style if writing. The base story is interesting but easily could have been delivered in a shorter version.
5	1367452800	What's not to love about Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  It was about time I read this book, and I enjoyed it as much as the generations before me.  Elizabeth Bennet is a modern woman-- a wonderful character to befriend.
5	1367452800	Don't want to be repetitious with other reviews. It is an  awesome book - Witty and at times comical. Jane Austen at her best. I have an &#34;off the rack tablet&#34; and purchased the kindle version. I haven't experienced any issues as others have with this version. Came through crystal clear with a full page of print - no problems at all.
4	1367452800	This is a great read.  Love the period and the manner of life and times.  Sometimes you need a read over to get the jest of what they are saying.
1	1367366400	Way too wordy.  Just when it,s to get intresting, gets worried again.  I like more action.  Do not recemonned the book .
5	1367366400	Always one of my favorites. I love this story better than any of Jane Austen's other works. It is one of the few books I've read more than once. There's a reason why any book becomes a classic. This one deserves that title.
3	1367280000	This is one of my favorite books to read and so I got it for my kindle library. However, this version does not finish. It skips many pages at the end of the novel and so it is not complete and if you have not read this before, it will be very confusing.
5	1367280000	A classic to be read again and again. I carry the characters with me and feel intimately acquainted with them, so well are they described.
5	1367193600	This is one of my absolute favorite books ever! I completely recommend this book to anyone who loves romance and classics as much as I do.
5	1367193600	This favorite Austen novel is improved by being available on Kindle, because you are able to easily look up the definition of many archaic British words. It was as enjoyable a read this time as it was the first few times.
4	1367193600	If the Seinfeld TV series was based on the premise that nothing happens, then Jane Austin was his precursor. Nothing really happens but it is told in such lovely language and interesting conversations that you just sort of roll with it.
5	1367107200	The characters are well developed, the story is compelling, and I couldn't wait to find out how it all ended!  A true classic that transcends any era.
4	1367107200	This book is simply timeless. No matter the number of times you read it; you fall deeper in love with story!
5	1367107200	I finally decided to read this classic novel. I just loved it. When i tried to read it before i didn't like the was it read. That was before I started watching Downton Abbey. I am used to the way they talk now and just really loved this book.
5	1367107200	Anyone that has never read a Jane Austen book doesn't know what they're missing.  I've read all of her books and watched all of her movies.  She knew how to write a book that would stand the test of time!
5	1367107200	I admit it! I am smitten by Darcy and have been since I was 13 years old. I return to him and Lizzy at least once a year, usually at a low point in my life when I am in dire need of simple pleasures. A re-read of Pride and Prejudice is guaranteed to revive my spirits and firmly knock me out of any thoughts of wallowing in self-pity or doom and gloom.  So what a treat it was to get this e-book for absolutely nothing!You cannot read Jane Austen's novels without being struck by just how skilful she was at deploying the English language. That is why I can continuously go back to her books with no risk of boredom. I find myself completely caught up in the sheer brilliance of her work.But, as I openly admitted before, I really go back time and again to get my annual Darcy fix. Why do I love Darcy?:1. He's obscenely rich2. He's good looking3. He's intelligent4. He is brooding and arrogant - the original "bad boy" of literature5. He is smitten by Lizzy who is clever, vibrant and atypical of what men desired in her era6. He loves his sister7. He realizes the error of his ways and consciously embarks on a self-improvement project for Lizzy - Let's face it, all women believe that they are capable of changing their man for the better (well, in our opinion anyway)8. He is not afraid to take drastic action against injusticeThese characteristics are fairly standard for the male heroes in romance novels, but there are few of these heroes are able to compare favourably with Darcy. So I will probably continue to be smitten by him for the foreseeable future, and that's fine, because it really is no hardship to read Austen's masterpiece every year.
5	1367107200	Exquisite writing that is very addicting and good for the vocabulary, this classic is an easy read and well worth it!
5	1367020800	What can I say!  It is a wonderful classic and enjoyable every time I read it!  The language is delightful after reading so many modern books with contemporary dialogue.
5	1367020800	Pride and Prejudice is one of the best classic literature ever written. I could not have enjoyed this book more.
4	1367020800	Great book, nice classic! But the first part was so terribly boring. Now I'm talking in Jane Austen language haha. But yeah, I read this book for a project and writing it on conflict, man vs self and man vs society. Might be hard, but I'll take the challenge
5	1366934400	Just can't even describe how much I really love this book. The movie is good, but the book is always better!
4	1366934400	I had to read this book as part of the curriculum for my last year in secondary school. The book started off a bit slow ans unappealing, but as I progressed through, it got terribly interesting. I would consider it a predecessor to the modern Soap Opera. It has drama, relationships, and quite a bit of gossip. If you fancy a good Soap Opera, and like old-school writing styles, you'll definitely enjoy this book.
5	1366934400	I love this book.  It takes you back to a time when things were completely different.  We can make choices as women.  Great book, great reading!
5	1366934400	no issues with this addition. i enjoyed the book and even purchased a hard cover to have a nice physical representation of my read (thats how i roll)
1	1366848000	Tried to download it to my kindle reader on my phone it never showed up and it won't let me do it again.
5	1366761600	Another fantastic AP English read and LIFE read. Pride and Prejudice is very enjoyable and yes there's a movie but really, just sit down with the book. It contains witty dialogue and beautiful quotes in the English language.
5	1366761600	I so enjoyed reading the book after seeing all three, yes folks there are three movies.  Tho I must say the first one is nothing but a Hollywood glitz, glitter and no substance.  The other two moves followed the book rather well, the book was able to fill in a bit more.  Really good reading.
4	1366675200	Not knowing what to expect, I can now say I really enjoyed this love story. The characters were most realistic. A great story.
1	1366588800	This was inane - I didn't get past the third chapter. Not a book for me. Hope some-one else likes it.
5	1366588800	As appropriate today as when it was written. A must read for everyone. We all have a little Pride and Prejudice in us even if we don't want to admit it.
5	1366588800	I completely fell in love with the book. It is a very good adaption for the Kindle Fire. Keep the good work!
4	1366588800	This is a good book to read or reread when all other good books at hand have been read,  or  the reader  needs the comfort of something familiar,undemanding and charming.
5	1366502400	I have read this classic many time;  I reread it almost every month.  If I have a time when I have no new books to read then I turn to my old faithful and I find something new in it every time.  It is my security blanket I think.  So beautifully written and such a sly, tongue in cheek sense of humour, I laugh out loud all the time.  Very relevant even today.  Peoples characters never really change and this is such a study of certain types of people, it is educational in a sense;  as the essense of the characters are all around us in this world.  All her books are enjoyable, but this is my secret vice.If only I could write with this sensitivity I would be so happy.
3	1366502400	I haven't had a chance to read the entire book yet but it gets my interest after a chapter or two.
5	1366502400	She is my favorite author all her books are really quite excellent I think people shou really read it quite good.
5	1366502400	This book has passed the test of time and makes for very good reading. I would recommend it too the newer generation.
5	1366416000	it's wonderful at any age.  It's interesting and fun to read.  And for a brief time, I am there with them living their lives.  I.  highly recommend it to anyone especially for those that love historical fiction...it's the best.
5	1366416000	This is absolutely my favorite book ever, it is a great story, I've read it over and over and when I read it I can't put it down!
5	1366416000	A wonderful storyteller, Jane Austen keeps the reader engrossed.  I enjoy her portrayal of strong females in a society of male dominance.
5	1366416000	To this day there are few writers that are able to compete with Jane Austin and write with so much wisdom and understanding about  hopes, dreams, families, and personal relationships. How much are we mistaken even today because of Pride  and Prejudice ?
5	1366416000	If you are looking for a book to get lost in, this is it. It is a wonderful read. I would suggest this for anyone.
5	1366329600	This book is the best. The really long movie is good too. Read/watch it, YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN
5	1366329600	Ms Austen is a pleasure to read. She brought her characters to life; love her family dynamic. And the unfolding of the love story rings true, from her day to ours.
4	1366243200	The language throughout the book is intricate and formal, I loved the creative formal use of words throughout the book. The storyline was intriguing; however, somewhat predictable. Overall, a well-structured and convincing novel.
5	1366156800	This is the ultimate romance novel.  It is so well-written, with characters so well-described, that it is impossible to think that I could possibly write anything but to say that this classic of English literature is personally my most favorite novel since the very first time I read it many years ago.  Although there are no sexy scenes in this book by today's standards, there is a great deal of sexual tension, many humorous scenes, as well as an accurate description of English country life during the early 1800s.  Overall, Pride and Prejudice is pure perfection.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the original romantic fiction novel.
5	1366156800	This is an amazing book book and  I would recommend to anyone who wants a great and interesting book to read. The way Jane Austen wrote this book is amazing and I would give it 5 stars.:)
5	1366156800	Really good! Beginning is slow but it gets a lot better. The book is inspiring and shows the daily life and manner of Austen 's time.
5	1366156800	It is very intresting book about live and morals in England 2 hundred years ago. You will have close look into relationships between men and women in the 18-th century.
5	1366156800	Appreciate the Classics as you get older. Hated this book when in school and you had no choice but to read it, BUT, choose to read it as you age gracefully and really appreciate it!
5	1366156800	Every time I read this book it's as good as or better than the last. Classics are called so for a reason. Read and enjoy this book.
5	1365984000	I LOVE this novel.  I think that the characters are some of Austen's best, and I love the relationship between sisters Jane and Elizabeth.  This is one that I enjoy rereading over and over again.
5	1365984000	There's no doubt that this book is well worth the read. It's sweet, romantic, full of insight and one of Jane Austin's bests.
5	1365897600	I read a version of this novel at least once a year. It always delivers an expected joy. I recommend it to readers of all ages.
5	1365897600	I have read this book numerous times and always find something new to enjoy. I now have it on my Kindle so I can revisit it when ever the mood strikes me.
4	1365897600	Great book! Some things were hard to understand. Altogether it was a great book. Definitely would recommend. Awesome story line
5	1365897600	Wonderful book without doubt the best Jane Austin that I have read  - witty and classic who does not want to be Elizabeth?
5	1365897600	I love this story, it's so funny in some ways. I have a hard time to follow the way it is written, but I love it all the same.
5	1365811200	Ms. Austen has a great way to develop characters. They are funny and clever. I really enjoyed the story she was able to create.
5	1365638400	Jane Austen is one of my all time favourite authors! Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic romantic novel, it deserves all of the praise and fame it has attracted in the centuries since its publication. I couldn't recommend a better book!
5	1365638400	Jane's writing are all wonderful.  This is one picked for a book club.  I gladly read it again.  So many more of her books are equally as interesting.
4	1365638400	As a non-native English speaker I found the first half very difficult to understand, however the second half is much easier to read. Definitely a book all people must read!
4	1365638400	Though written in very formal English, the novel was captivating.  The novel is timeless and deserves a second reading from any who read it long ago.
5	1365638400	I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I would recommend it as a mandatory read!  Now I want to see the movie!
5	1365552000	I love Jane Austen. She makes us really identify with the characters and teaches us about a time when love wasn't everything in a relationship, but her heroines are so passionate and have strength to fight for their feelings.
5	1365552000	Don't know why I decided to read this but I really enjoyed it.  Had to read  a little slower to understand the way it was written. Plan to read more Jane Austen.
5	1365552000	This is one of my favorite books ever. I enjoyed it so much and I recommend this book to everyone.
5	1365465600	One of the best books ever written. Witty, entertaining, sweet love story and a great peek into social customs of the 1800's.  My 12 year old daughter just read it and loves it as much as I do.
5	1365465600	Such a delight.  Sorry that I waited 50 years before reading.Would highly recommend to anyone from age 12 to 100.
5	1365465600	can't beat Jane Austen in spite of seeing the movie and reading the book years ago. what's not to like?
5	1365465600	A study of the lifestyle of the mid nineteenth century.  The mores and standards the must be met for the sake of propriety.  In this time Elizabeth looks for independence, love and happiness.  She must maintain strength to uphold her family with their pride and prejudices while being in misery from a love that seemingly eludes her.
5	1365465600	Enjoyed it much better this time as I could imagine the people after seeing the BBC adaptation.  No wonder it is a Classic.
5	1365465600	Not one complaint, I read this in two days it was such a beautiful story! Really keeps you wondering what happens next.
5	1365465600	Can't go wrong with the classics...I can reread them, I can share them with the grand-kids, I can share them with friends, I can read the ones I always meant to read but never got around too...and most importantly -- they're FREE on KINDLE!!!
3	1365379200	It's really different read for me this time . I've never read anythinjpg like this I really find it interresting
5	1365379200	Pride and Prejudice ti a good book to read hard to put it down. everyone should read whenever they can
5	1365292800	I absolutely love the way this is written. All of the characters are fun to imagine. It is one of those books everyone should read at least once.
5	1365292800	My favorite Jane Austen by far! And so convenient to read on my iPad! How happy I was to find a free copy on Amazon!
5	1365292800	Written with all the grace and charm of the time period. The book gives many of the characters quirks and perspectives left out  of the films. A great read.
4	1365206400	Book was for my daughter - for school - everything was fine with the purchase word word word word word
3	1365206400	I am an old man. Finally got around to reading this book just because I had heard of it all my life.  It was ok...just not an old man's book as far as I could see.
5	1365206400	My absolute favorite of Austen's novels, and to my mind, the best book ever written.  Elizabeth Bennett is the most charming and delightful creature in literature, and you can't help but wish you had a friend like her.  Supposedly very much like Jane herself, it's astounding the author never married -- she is irresistible.  I take this book on every vacation and always find something new in it.  And I ALWAYS cry when when Jane tells Elizabeth that her fiance loves her and Elizabeth replies &#34;Of course he does!&#34;  (OK, it reminds me of the Jennifer Ehle scene in the Masterpiece version.)Everyone should read this book.
5	1365206400	What a lovely,beautifully sewn tapestry this book is. I hated reaching the end as much as I hate swallowing the last piece of the most delicious dessert that I won't ever get a chance to eat again.Why didn't I ever know how fabulous Jane Austens writing is? It should be required reading for everyone or at least every female who can read. So glad this only the first of the J.A. library. I can't think of how it will feel to come to the end of the last of this collection.
4	1365206400	I liked the added narration. It put extra oomph into a conversational novel short on action, a good thing on an 8-hour flight!
4	1365206400	I first read this before I was old/mature enough to understand Austen's talents in both storytelling and satire.  Glad I read it again as an adult.
5	1365120000	I love my kindle! Having my favorite authors on the kindle books is just wonderful! And it was free life is great
5	1365033600	I must admit I was bored with the first half of the book. As the necessity of groundwork became apparent in the second half, I began to appreciate all of it. A most enjoyable read, I recommend it vigorously.
5	1365033600	Cannot go wrong with Jane Austen. Love story, life story, and she leaves me wanting more. Elizabeth and I are very simmular.
4	1365033600	Book was very enjoyable. Easy to see how the British comedies got their start. it's important to visualize the characters in the book.
5	1364947200	i have not read this book at all so when i saw it was on my kindle i had to get it
5	1364947200	This book is my comfort book. Always cheer me up when I need a little lift from my daily stress!
3	1364947200	This classic doesn't quite make it to this century. There are better things to read.Sorry, I once loved the story.
5	1364947200	I love reading, and this book is one of my favorites! It is so descriptive that while reading you may find your imagination drifting of in the time the story is written and for moments you live in middle of all the traditional (ridiculous) rules. As a woman you may be thankful living in this age! ;) A romantic and historical novel well written and easy to read. Enjoy!
5	1364860800	I truly enjoyed this story. Jane truly was a great writer. I couldn't put this book down! I even watched the movie several times while reading the book; which, only gave a face to the character and color to the environment. Thank goodness the movie was exactly as the book! I look forward to readingore of Jane's stories. I know I will be glad I did!
4	1364860800	I confess now that I did not enjoy Pride and Prejudice. The problem with loving a film is that the novel rarely will be loved as much, for usually the imagination is not able to create when the mind has already decided on perfection. I adore the film adaption of Pride and Prejudice starring Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. However, I still recommend reading the novel, for Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful depiction of the struggle for self in a less-than-perfect world.Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen chronicles the relationship between Fitzwilliam Darcy, a wealthy young man, and Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest daughter of a man of modest means. The five Bennett daughters are in desperate need for husbands, as their father's inheritance is entailed. When Mr. Bingley, a wealthy and charismatic young man, moves into their neighbor, he falls in love with Jane, the oldest daughter. He also brings with him his friend, Mr. Darcy, who behaves snobbish and offends Elizabeth at a local ball. Although they immediately dislike each other, they are forced to spend time together during a variety of circumstances, which changes their perception of each other, sometimes through direct confrontation.Pride and Prejudice is a hallmark novel. On the surface it is just another historic romance novel, but with uncovering it is revealed to be a true search for self-identity and understanding of other humans, in the dirtiness of their limited economic means and horrible manners. It is about the practical role of marriage in our society--what are the consequences of marrying for money? For social prestige? For love? It is a novel about relationships, between siblings, parents and children, friends, enemies, and new acquaintances.  It is a novel worth reading, but I recommend you do it before watching the film.
4	1364860800	After getting into it it was a good book to read. It was hard for me to get into it.
5	1364774400	I enjoyed this read especially because it was FREE. Its nice to have inexpensive and free options when you are low on cash.
5	1364688000	Love ms. Austen 's flowery literary style! Look forward 2  reading it a 3rd time. Hope her skills rub off onto me.
5	1364688000	I love  to read and read and read the classics ! They never  fail to refresh and often times give a different thought upon a matter you have been pondering. Recommending this book for the reading of today's youth is a pleasure. It has a very useful moral that the youth of today should readily fan  to heart.
5	1364688000	What a great classic Jane Austin story.  A pleasure to be able to read on my iPad. I can read it over and over again
5	1364601600	So romantic, sly and funny it comprehensively undermines the whole subjugation of women basis of the civilized society she so perfectly renders without polemic or rage.  Lovely stuff.
5	1364601600	Admittedly one of Jane Austen's best efforts, this book is a must read for pretty much anybody.  Great historical novel with good writing and full-on characters!
5	1364601600	Always love Jane Austin no matter what she writes or how often I read it. This one of my all time favorites
5	1364515200	One of the greatest novels ever written.  One I can read over and over.  Wonderful characters, deep and insightful social commentary. I would recommend to anyone.
3	1364515200	Story about people in England and the way they class people and how they look at people who have money and power.
5	1364515200	I love Pride and Prejudice, have already read it several times in my life, and am happy to have permanent access to it on my Kindle!
4	1364428800	It is very hard to write something original about a story that is `universally' this well known. I mean there can't be many people in the world who haven't read the book or seen one of the many movies and TV-shows that have been based on this story. I know that I can never think of Darcy with imagining Colin Firth with his wet shirt plastered to his chest. And that brings me to my first issue with this book, which isn't book related at all if I'm honest. I discovered that I really don't like reading a book (for the first time I should add) when I'm already completely aware of the story in it. What is more, I don't like having other people's ideas of what the characters look like in my head before I have had a chance to form my own. With this book, unfortunately, that was unavoidable and I know it influenced my enjoyment of the story.On the other hand, I did enjoy reading Pride and Prejudice. I liked the insight it gave into life at the turn of the 19th century. I loved having a closer look at how the middle and upper classes lived and interacted. The descriptions of the interactions between those of different standing were as fascinating as it was unimaginable to this modern mind.The way the title is reflected in the two main characters - with Darcy's Pride running head first into Elizabeth's Prejudice - was a joy to read and maybe not as specific to the time the story is set in as I would like to think.And that brings me to my next observation. It is astonishing to think how little romance novels have changed over the past 200 years. In this book we find all the elements we would expect in modern novels: the misunderstandings, the dastardly villain, the broody and seemingly distant hero, the quirky and spirited heroine, the nice girl and the vixen they all make an appearance and play their role in the story. In fact, were this a modern romance I would call it predictable and uninspired so well does it cover every possible plot device. Remembering when this book was actually written I will call it clever.Another thing that fascinated me was the social commentary Jane Austen provides in this story. The snobbery of the middle classes, the contempt of those in the higher classes for those they perceive as being less than them, and the importance of money when it comes to being able to marry someone made this story historically significant as well as an enjoyable read.What I really appreciated in this book is the way in which Jane Austin allowed her heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, to find her own way and come to her own conclusions in a time when women were rarely alone long enough to think, never mind act, for themselves. As Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n says in his book `New Ways to Kill Your Mother' this is achieved by separating Lizzie from the family members who might influence her at crucial times in the story."Power instead is handed directly to the heroine and this power arises from the quality of her own intelligence. It is her own ability to be alone, to move alone, to be seen alone, to come to conclusions alone, that sets her apart."I also have to admit that after reading this book I've come to a new appreciation of P.D. James' `Death Comes to Pemberley'. I've read enough reviews by others to realize that many readers disagree with me on this, but I find that her story gives a rather satisfying sequel to Pride and Prejudice. I may have to read that book again at some point now that I'm more intimately acquainted with all the main characters and back-stories.Overall I have to say that this was a pleasant reading experience that I would probably have enjoyed more if I had not been as intimately aware of the story as I was.
5	1364428800	Such a classic book. So happy I can read it on my tablet! Thanks Amazon for providing this book for free!
5	1364428800	I fell in love with the movie and when I added Pride and Prejudice to my Kindle I could not put it down, I love the way Jane Austen wrote.
5	1364342400	This book is well written. Very easy to read. Once you start reading it you won't wanna put it down.
5	1364342400	One great Story  I just can't stop reading Jane's collections ,  they are so good,  Love it!  Love it! Love it!
5	1364342400	Excellent book. A very good read. Ending is what you did not expect. Very difficult english. One of the best books out there.
5	1364256000	A pleasure to read intricate love stories, with the language of the Victorian times. A story that happens in our everyday life, without the sirs and lady's...
5	1364256000	So Darcy was proud and Elizabeth was prejudiced... Or Elizabeth was proud and Darcy was prejudiced? Or everyone was a little proud and a little prejudiced.Guys, don't read this book if you're just trying to make yourself more attractive to the ladies. Read it because it's worth reading. Who knows... You might learn something!Anyway, Elizabeth Bennett is one of the most memorable characters of English literature. Austen's &#34;play-by-play&#34; description of conversations saves time but after a while gets a little boring. Power through those sections and appreciate the way she paints characters, even minor ones. You will not regret reading this book while you are still young and can learn something from it.
3	1364256000	I have wanted to read this for a long time.  If I had lived in the time period it would have helped me understand some of the story line.  I have to stop and read another book and come back to it.  I will finish it!
5	1364169600	I really enjoyed reading this book. It is well written and there are characters that are up-to-date. So it makes easy to relate to this book. I recommend this book to everybody who appreciates good language and richness of content
2	1364169600	I really wanted to read this book after hearing so many references to it over the years. I also really wanted to love it but I was very disappointed. The characters were shallow, self-indulgent and reeked of snobbery with no redeeming qualities at all. I know this was the essence of the story as suggested by the title, I was therefore determined to read the whole book to give it a chance. But it was tedious to read with it's old fashioned phrasing and having to look up so many redundant words. Maybe my expectations were too high but I just don't get the fuss made over this book.
5	1364169600	Pride and Prejudice is my latest addition to my collection of classic books.  It is well written, interesting and a great read.
2	1364169600	I found this book to be along the same line as Sense and Sensibility. As a Christian that desires to fill my mind with profitable reading, reading that builds character, this is not a book I would want to fill my thoughts with. I did not even finish the book because of that.
5	1364083200	I enjoy reading books from this era. The fact that this book contained no ugly language kept me reading it. Very interesting almost like watching Downton Abby.
2	1363996800	This was the most difficult book I've ever read. I spent nearly as much time reading the dictionary as I did the actual book! After several weeks of reading (not to mention the dozen or so failed attempts at it over the years), I finally made it to the end. I've read many other period pieces, and never had as much difficulty with the language. I'm guessing it's Austen's style of writing that gave me such difficulty, more-so than the time period.As for the story itself, all I could think of was how petty and shallow everyone was. Not to mention insipid. We learned nothing about the characters except who they liked or didn't like, and how much money everyone was worth. I find it difficult to believe that this was the only thing that concerned people during that time. Nothing was said of the careers of the men, or the interests of the women (with the exception of the little mentioned Mary). The entire story was like reading a gossip rag.
4	1363910400	It was good to get Pride free on my smartphone and be able to have it with me at all times and read when I had free time.
5	1363910400	To put it simply, it's a timeless relatable story that everyone should read. I've also been on a mission to watch every adaptation. So far, the 2005 movie version, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, and Lost in Austen have been my favorites. I recommend them all.
5	1363910400	this is one of my favorite books, I will read it over and over again.  Reading on the paperwhite is easier than an old nook.
5	1363910400	Must read. The beginning is a little slow but it's well worth it in the end. I enjoyed it a lot
5	1363824000	I've loved ALL of Jane Austen's books. Pride & Prejudice is definitely a favorite of mine. I can reread Jane Austen books many times over & never tire of them.
4	1363824000	I'm a slow read and like to absorb it gradually.  I'm still reading it and the more I read the better I like it.
5	1363737600	I love Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy! I especially love how Austen explains what becomes of our silly characters after their engagement, for some reason the movies and miniseries always leave those parts out.
5	1363737600	I was re-reading this book for a book club discussion.  The Kindle version worked fine, and I found it easier than going to the library to borrow the book.
5	1363737600	Classic book. Found it very interesting and delightful. Would recommend to anyone. Jane Austen  is an excellent writer.. Try it you will enjoy it.
5	1363737600	This is one of my favorite time periods to read about and I love Jane Austen style writing.  Excellent book!
5	1363651200	I can't complain for the price, this book is a great read for any avid fan of a kindle book. I use this book, in my iPhone for on-the-go trips and it's handy-er than a physical copy. Really great!
5	1363651200	This book is better than the movie. I just finished reading this and now I want to start it all over
5	1363651200	I can read this book a 1,000 Times & still find it interesting. Each time I read it I can't put it down
5	1363651200	I like the story line and the period of which it is written, I like historical fiction - facts with a touch of imagination.
4	1363651200	I chose this book because I have seen the movie and I knew I was missing something. I love to have the blanks filled in. The only issue is the manner of speech which is a little hard to follow.
5	1363564800	Great storyline, kept me wanting to read more and not put the book down. Delivered instantly as a Kindle ebook.
1	1363564800	I hated this book!  It is like a Victorian Keeping up the Kardashians.  How superficial can you get?  I realize that in that era the only hope for a woman was to marry well.  Why promote that idea as a romantic one in our present day lives is just stupid.  I see nothing romantic in the book whatsoever.  The snobbery is almost unbearable.  This is one of those situations where you read hoping it will get better, it never did.  What a waste of my time.
5	1363564800	Enough said but I have to use 13 more words so let me say it again... the best book ever written
5	1363564800	I've loved this book, and other Austen books, for years. This is definitely worth having on your kindle! 5 stars!
5	1363478400	It is a novel about the interaction between different classes of people, of their pride and prejudice.  It's location is in England, but the same factions occur here in America.
1	1363478400	The storyline is boring.  The characters are not well developed.  Subjecting high school students to this will make them hate reading.
3	1363392000	I felt it was a very hard book to read.  I guess I liked the movie better.  I like a book that is easy to read and don't have to think about what I just read.  I'm going to try again because I love the movie.  A lot of characters to figure out.
5	1363392000	I was surprised to find how similar to my own were the dilemas of young women in a past time. I could easily identify with these characters. This is more proof to me that human nature remains the same over time.
5	1363392000	Who cannot fall in love with such an innocent story. Only the dullest of us all. Time never fades Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. They will forever be.
5	1363305600	This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read it over and over. It will never get old!
5	1363305600	Mr. Darcy is my favorite romantic character of all time. Ever since I first read, and not watched the movie which I never sat through, the book of which I am currently reviewing. All the natural romance of the 1700s, and the best part is that there are no sparkling vampires. (No offense to Twilight fans.... vampires just shouldn't sparkle)
5	1363305600	My all time favourite book! Never gets old and can read it over and over again. Beats any modern day love story by miles.
5	1363305600	I never get tired of reading this book.  It's easy to read and such a great story.  It is amazing!
5	1363305600	I really loved this book, and I'm a seventeen year old guy! That should say something. If you can respect a good love story then this is the perfect book for you. Due to its time period, some of the words used may need to be looked up, and that's why I would recommend this book for high school level readers. Great read!!!
5	1363219200	Good layout for a freebie. Nothing extraneous.It doesn't contain any historical notes or explanations, but, hey, it's a freebie, so I'm not complaining. ))
5	1363219200	No explanation necessary, but this book gets even better each time I read it.  I love Jane Austen!  A must.
5	1363219200	This book is one of my ultimate favorites! It is a love story where it is all about character development and some quest has to be completed. It is amazingly written. There is a reason this book is a classic
5	1363219200	While my favorite Austen is Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice has perhaps the best writing and character development of all her novels. Mr. Bennet's descriptions of his family are priceless! Mrs. Bennet is so richly drawn a comic character! And the foppish pastor, Mr. Collins, who goes on and on about Lady Catherine De Bourgh's patronage and condescension to the point of high comedy! Elizabeth Bennet is a woman before her time - strong, independent, outspoken; no wonder she is her father's favorite. A wonderful read!
5	1363132800	How does one review Pride and Prejudice?  A classic is a classic for a reason.  Love the opportunity that one has to re-read the classics through my Kindle.
5	1363132800	Dreams do come true in Ms. Austen's book Pride and Prejudice! Favorite characters? Of course, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy... Oh, the romantic tension that developed between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, even though they both tried to hide their love for each other because of their Pride and Prejudice, was splendid! A forever romance book for keeps for every "happily ever after" romantic who believes in true love no matter what... ~The end :)
1	1363132800	This book was the most boring book I have ever read but I had to read it for a bet
5	1363046400	As unual this book was well written and was a delight to reread after many years that passed since the last reading.
4	1363046400	One of the first romantic novels. Highly romantic and it is the cultural customs of those 19th century days that hold yourinterest. It's a love tale with a bit of a punch.
3	1363046400	I am having trouble staying interested in reading this book. It's in old English so the verbage is different than we speak nowadays. But I know it's a 200 year old book, so of course the wording will be different. Plus it keeps bouncing around between characters and calls people by a couple different names. I am not enjoying this book very much but I do not like to not finish a book when I start reading it.
5	1363046400	I have read this book several times - one of the few for me.  The quietly humorous narrative told by a spunky heroine who is not afraid to see her mistakes and change over time combined with the evolving love story gets me every time.
5	1363046400	I love this book.  Also love the BBC version of the movie.  You just can't beat finishing up a good read with watching a good movie of the book.
5	1362960000	I absolutely love this book. Though it's my first time actually reading a book AFTER seeing the movie, I have to say there were no &#34;spoiler alerts&#34;. This has become one of the few books that I will re-read.
5	1362960000	Everyone should read this at least once in their lifetime -seeing the movie or tv drama is not the same.The words are sublime and the whole book is just perfectly written.
5	1362873600	I had never read a Jane Austen book before, and found it to be a very enjoyable read. I can't wait to read more of her books in the future.
4	1362873600	Just an interesting read.  Really eye opening to see how different cultures and classes approach the matter of love and marriage.
5	1362787200	I love to read, but rarely take time to read because of work and my daughter.  However, once I started rereading Pride and Prejudice, I made time to read.  I had, like everyone I know, read Pride and Prejudice in high school.  Now that I am older I can understand the complex relationships, formal attitude of the characters, importance of reputation and language of that era.  The character development WAS the book.  This is not a suspenseful or sexually provocative book, it is a book that delves into the psyche of its main character with the draw being how this character holds true to her values and beliefs.  I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read it.
5	1362787200	I have the actual book, rather than just the computerized version. I love the book much better but its nice to have this one on the go.
5	1362787200	One of my favorite pastimes is comparing film to the source book. So, when OPB aired the BBC series starting Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, I had to read the book. To make a long story short, Miss Austen acreated characters that have stood the test of time. They have depth, virtues and faults. The twists and turns in the plot add interest to draw out her sketches of human behavior and paint glimpses life that would otherwise be lost. Eliza Bennet is an independent and intelligent main character who proves adaptable, sensible and very adequately romantic.
5	1362787200	You can't beat Jane Austen for telling an intriguing story. There is a good reason this novel is a classic. The characters are believable and their actions compelling. I am an English AP teacher, and teach this novel for the witty dialogue and vivid period depiction.
5	1362787200	Such a delight to be absorbed in the cadences of Victorian England.  No one does it better than Jane Austen.
4	1362787200	Not an easy book to read, but basically a good love story.  Unfortunate the status of women in that day and age.
5	1362700800	This novel embodies the best of Jane Austen, Wit, insight, charm and romance are all packed into this story of two people who find each other despite their bad first impression.
5	1362528000	One of the few books I actually wouldn't mind reading in school. Such an amazing love story! Excellent for any age.
4	1362528000	Loved the wittiness and characters :]. Not necessarily a page turner but good read definitely worth adding to the list!
5	1362441600	Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
4	1362441600	Enjoyed this story but after reading more modern stories found the descriptions and dialogues too wordy )If one can say that) and am very pleased that I live in this century.
5	1362441600	If you never read it...read it. If you did read it...'re-read it because it will be twice as good. Men and women need time to explore each other like Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. Courting is a wonderful way of the past.
5	1362441600	Haven't read this yet, but have it on my Kindle.  Will read it some day.  So glad to get it FREE!
4	1362441600	Always wanted to read this book. I imagine that it would be slammed by critics today. The conversations, descriptions and rambling make reading more work than enjoyment.
5	1362441600	Pride and Prejudice was real written and pulls the reader into the plot. The characters become like old friends and I felt sad to leave them when the book was finished.
5	1362355200	Jane Austen has been a favorite author since I was in my teens and while Persuasion is my absolute favorite of her books, Pride and Prejudice comes a very close second. At first I loved the romantic story but as I have matured and re-read the story many times, more and more subtlety comes to light. Jane Austen's wicked humor, social insight and dead-on characterization makes all her books really enjoyable. Pride and Prejudice is  a window into what life was like for young women 200 years ago.
5	1362355200	I am sure that when Jane Austen wrote her book, she never dreamed that it would remain a best seller for 200 years!It is writing that one comes back to time and again when you're tired and weary of the modern novel!There are few authors who can claim this privilege!
5	1362355200	Such a great book! Get lost in a great classic. Love that you can now read it on the kindle!
5	1362355200	Love Jane Austen books and it is one of my favorite movies so I needed to read the book. The book is always better than the movie, it gives you that bit more that you needed to know.
4	1362355200	a superb photograph of the way we were and of all the misery we are able to inflict and self-inflict. Are we all that different now?Probably not, we only use a simpler lingo.
5	1362355200	One of my favorites, Love the book. Will read many, many times more. If you have never read this it is a MOST!
1	1362355200	I had always said when I retired and had time that I would read a lot of the  classics.  Well, this won't be one of them.  I just couldn't get in it.  I hope the rest of them aren't as boring.
5	1362355200	I really love the movie and the story behind it. I love how this book brings you into their world. =)
5	1362268800	I love this book! The romance, the humor, and the characters we can all connect with set this book apart from other classics. Jane Austen was a genius... who doesn't want to be Elizabeth?
5	1362268800	For some reason I had never read this book. It was on our high school reading list but I made another choice. Once you get past the language and immerse yourself in the story I t was hard to put down.
5	1362268800	I love the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. It took me awhile to realize the big deal. But after reading the book instead of just watching the movie it makes much more sense.
5	1362268800	Gotta love this classics. Can never go wrong with getting a book by Austen. Excellent writer and plus it was free!
5	1362268800	This book is Austen at her best.  This classic never gets stale no matter how many times I read it. Great story, fascinating characters and wonderful descriptions of English society and class differences. You just can't go wrong with Jane Austen.
3	1362268800	I was wholly engrossed by the novel. But this particular version of the book purchased for kindle is really bad. Text at some pages are not aligned. It was similar to reading a PDF in kindle. Better to read the book through PDF.
5	1362268800	Miss Austen is the most dear friend! Oh how we laugh and conspire together! She has given me Mr Darcy, whom all young ladies should have, and she has shown me myself, whom I know better from her dearest Lizzie.
5	1362182400	Its a loved classic, I can read this book over and over! I stayed interested through the whole story. Love it!
5	1362182400	This is my favorite book, i have read it many times over and every time i get sucked into it unable to put it down. I am not a big fan of other period classics as such but there's something about Lizzy and Mr Darcy that get me every time.
5	1362182400	Great story!!!  Jane Austen is surely one of my favorite authors; she creates stories and characters readers can easily get caught up with.  One of my all-time favorites!
5	1362182400	I could read Pride and Prejudice again and again and still enjoy every page. A true classic to be enjoyed
5	1362096000	When I need comfort, I turn to Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennett is one of my personal heroes, and Darcy is an excellent match for her.The first time I read it--when I was 17--I was keenly aware of the brilliant comedy in the book. As I re-read it again and again over the years, it still makes me laugh, but it also makes me think of Jane Austen herself, and how a woman whose life was so circumscribed by her circumstances could manage to create such an astonishing array of characters, with such depth.Don't miss it. And for goodness sake, DON'T CALL IT A ROMANCE! It's a comedy of manners.
5	1362096000	This is a classic English literature, so it has a fairly complex vocabulary and indirect way of communicating that is not quick to read. I certainly expanded my own vocabulary in reading it.  The story itself has sufficient twists and turns to be quite enjoyable.I definitely enjoyed this story.  (And you can share it with the kids, as there's no sex or profanity in it.  Whether they'll understand the nuances of phrase or not is a separate question...)
5	1362096000	The movies are great, but you need to read this classic to really enjoy Lizzy and Darcy's story.  Easy read.
5	1362009600	I have never read this classic before, but love the movie.This book was excellent, I would recommend it to everyone!
1	1362009600	I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)
5	1361923200	Its one of the greatest novels ever written in the english language, and every time I read it is like reading it for the first time. So brilliant it almost hurts
4	1361923200	i first read this  book for a class in HS . A couple of years later now in college my interest for this book grew and i just knew i had to read it again, I just simply loved it. I
5	1361923200	After having seen the Colin Firth movie version so many times, I was excited to start reading the book. I was not disappointed in the least. Romance in a pure form - I hated to see it end!
5	1361923200	Chivilary and romance all rolled up into a very tantilizing story of sister looking for the right man to sweep them off their feet. Lost romance and misunderstood relationships and how to indure the pain.
4	1361923200	love story --classic ----All must be read and enjoy the Jane Austin collections. You can also enjoy the movie versions.
5	1361923200	Enjoyed the book very much. The characters were well described .This was a book club selection and I will probably read more of her books in the future, time permitting.
5	1361923200	Anything by Austen is a must-read and P&P is the best of all.  Her manner of capturing the nuances, foibles, and speech of her characters make them come alive and ensure that this book will continue to be a classic in any era.
5	1361923200	Once I got back into Jan Austen's narrative style, I enjoyed the book as much as I had when I read it many years ago.
5	1361923200	I read the Jane Austen books about once every 5 years.  I never fail to love them.  Excellent writting, great character development and a wonderful story.
5	1361923200	Great book to read if in need of romantic indulgent!!! I love this book and I would and have read it over and over again....
5	1361836800	One of my favorite Jane Austen books.  I have read it over and over again.  I actually read it while watching the story on t.v.  The book was soooo much better.
4	1361836800	This book is still relevant in the world of today.  The  characters remind me of people I know.  I liked it.
5	1361836800	I only regret Jane Austen did not write more books than she did. So fun and true! I read it many times.
5	1361750400	I had never read this book as a young person and am really enjoying the author.  The version of writing is slow to read and comprehend, but the story is captivating.
5	1361750400	A true classic. An all-time favorite. I recommend this read to everyone! I love that Amazon offers free Austen e-books.
4	1361750400	I loved this classic! A little long but well worth it. Something I will read again and again. Wonderful book.
5	1361750400	Absolutely incredible. This creative love story shows the trials and triumphs or a man and a woman destined to be together.
4	1361750400	This book is very hard to read but made easier with the kindle, great story line, funny in parts too.
4	1361750400	Classicly  a period piece, thus slower to read due to the verbiage, but, certainly worth the read! I enjoyed her characters and though the places were not as richly described as I would have liked, it was enough. Several new (actually &#34;olde&#34;) words have been added to my vocabulary!
5	1361664000	Classic Book!  Great to have it on my Kindle and ready to read whenever I want.  If you haven't read this novel yet, you're missing out!
5	1361664000	If you have not read this since high school, you may find yourself quite delighted, as I did myself .
5	1361664000	For being still in high school, I enjoyed this book so much that I should think it a must to read again when I am older. This was by far the best "classic" I have ever read and may just be one of the best books I have ever read.All books will now be held to a different standard. The characters were completely enthralling. This book is the embodiment of all great reads.
2	1361664000	Guess I am giving this book an unfair report, as I didn't get to even get it read.  So Inshouldnt be a judge for the book.
4	1361577600	I loved the plot. However, since this is an old book, the plot was alittle confusing. One of the best love stories of all time.
5	1361577600	What a fantastic book which was brought to life by the BBC series starring Colin Firth.  Now I can hear them talking and I just love this book.  I can visualize my English ancestors in the village.
3	1361577600	Must admit that I only read it so that I can say that it is done. I found this a bit slow. All character development and gossip and very little action. Some people love it, just not me. Side note: I read it using the kindle app on my iPad and didn't have any of the problems mentioned with font size and spacing that some others mentioned.
4	1361491200	Quite an interesting book if you can understand the language and wordiness of the time. I found Jane Austin's ability to show how pride and presumption can affect our lives very valuable.
1	1361491200	I know it's a &#34;classic&#34;, but....yawn.n.n.n. - archaic language and perfectly useless characters. Little more than local gossip among the local teens!
5	1361491200	I still think Jane Austin should be required reading for every junior high school girl.  It is romantic history at its best.
5	1361404800	Sweetest love story. I love the back and forth between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, they were absolutely meant for each other!
5	1361404800	Delivered instantly to my kindle. It is an absolute classic that I highly enjoyed. I would recommend my friends to get this too.
1	1361404800	I have been waiting for 3 weeks for this mug to be delivered. When I finally received it and opened the box, the message printed on the mug is &#34;Don't tell me to keep calm&#34;, which isn't what I want at all! Is this a joke? It is totally different from what is shown in the photo on the web page!! I have submitted a replace/refund request to the seller, but haven't got a respond yet. I wouldn't recommend anyone to order this, as it has been such a hassle.
5	1361404800	This is a must read for all Who enjoy romance.  On of the best love stories with none of the sex that defines a romance novel in the present.
4	1361404800	Good read. I enjoyed it much more starting about page 100. Book club book success. Glad I was some what m made to read it. Not one I would have picked up on my own.
4	1361404800	Fun book to read employing an exciting play on words. I love the intelligent embedded satire relating to personal relationships among the characters in the book. Highly recommended.
5	1361404800	a wonderful book recommend for all to read.  Old book and still a good one to read.  Wonderful read for all
5	1361404800	My wife and daughters LOVE the characters MS Austen created.  They are oft-quoted in my house, and usually to a laugh or two (&#34;Oh, sister......!&#34;)A little late, but thanks, Ms Austen, for creating such timeless characters!
5	1361404800	I can't imagine ever reading another novel with as much dept .Miss Jane, I tip my hat to you!!!  The ultimate book
5	1361318400	Loved this book,also the characters.a few of them worked my nerves,but I still love how well written they are.Elizabeth is my favorite because she is headstrong,independent and outspokenWith so many intricate lives and plot lines interwoven,it kept me completely engrossed and it made wanting to know the fate of each character!!I loved her Austin's writing style,this book not only observes the social hierarchy of the times in which it was written,but also human natures and personalities that are eternal.I recommend this book for everyone of every time and place.
5	1361318400	A bit like a modern soap opera with all the love twists and drama, yet it moves at a steady pace.
5	1361232000	With author Jane Austen, how can you go wrong.  If you enjoy historical romantic fiction, you will enjoy this book.
5	1361232000	These are not my type of books. But I loved it anyway! The whole concept of 'I hate you so much' turned 'I love you so much(even though I don't want to)', is my favorite. I can't get enough of their bickering and denial of their feelings and everything. I may not usually read this sort of thing or pay attention to the author, but I love this particular story!
5	1361232000	I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to the end! The poetic use of language to convey the thoughts of the main characters were so aptly rendered to stir a feeling of presence in that era! Well written and highly recommended!
5	1361232000	I'm not a big reader, but I had trouble putting this book down.  When I was done reading it, I rented the movie for 24 hrs and watched it 3 times.
5	1361232000	Marvelous classic love story, a really great read. I would recommend it to anyone, Jane Austen's writing is entertaining and extremely amusing
5	1361232000	Always 5 stars....it really is such an epic story you can't help but love it. I want to reread it right now!!
5	1361145600	I recommend this book for all to read if you are a romanticist. This book is about chivalry, friendship, total loyalty among sisters and most of all true love over coming obstacles of power and money. I love the part when she is confronted by the Aunt and all her responses. She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady.
5	1361145600	I HAVE READ THIS BOOK MANY TIMES. WATCHED COLIN FIRTH IN THE MOVIE...GREAT..RECOMMEND FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE CLASSICS AND ROMANCE
5	1361145600	It's one of the first books I've read in English. I've read it many times after in English and Polish and I never get bored with it. I absolutely love it. For the language, storyline, heroine.
5	1361145600	This was an unexpected read for me. I honestly would recommend this book to others looking for a nice read.
5	1361145600	I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen.  The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character.  You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc.  This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger.  She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them.
5	1361145600	This is a wonderful classic of English literature. Besides, it is a really good novel not only about love, it is also a criticism about an English age.
5	1361145600	This was my third time to read this classic 19th century romance novel; as always, it was a delightful read. The witty banter, passion, and humor are expertly woven together to produce a story that is not only interesting, but riddled with new, interesting words and facts (this was where I learned what an entail was, long before Downton Abbey). I would recommend this to anyone!
5	1361145600	I can read it over and over again and never get bored of it! Highly recommended to start off if you're new to Jane Austen's books!
3	1361145600	Honestly, I found this book pretty boring.  The premise of the novel is a big &#34;so what&#34;.  I really am not sure why this is such a classic and by people swoon over Jane Austen.
5	1361145600	Such a beautiful and well told love story! I fell in love with Mr Darcy while becoming envious of Elizabeth's charismatic character at the same time.
3	1361145600	Okay, I'll admit that at 14 y o and interested in modern biographies and war stories, Pride & Prejudice bored me stupid.Re-reading it now (from a sense of obligation) I actually can see the humour in it, the easy development of characters and their relationships and interactions.I can now identify characters to loathe (the girls' mother) and which I can like.But I guess it will never be more than a tedious &#34;okay&#34;, I guess.
4	1361059200	More detailed than movie. I liked this book because it gives you an idea of what it was like in that time.
4	1361059200	I like this book in my library because I get a chance to get back to a time that I would have wish that I was never part of.
5	1360972800	Wonderful! It had been 30 years since I first read Pride and Prejudice.  I have in recent years gotten into reading the P&P variations and I love them.  Nothing beats the original though.
5	1360972800	Read it!!!!!If I can read this book(comming from a girl who doesn't read at all) you can read it.
5	1360972800	This book was really good I highly recommended it .It's a little more advance for children under 13  enjoy iy
2	1360886400	Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates.  Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading.
5	1360886400	best book ever!! draws me into it so much! makes me stay up real late at night to read it!
5	1360886400	There is nothing  to be said  said about Pride and Prejudice that had not already been said.  It truly is one of the best books ever written.
5	1360886400	I enjoyed revisiting  this novel which I read as a teen. The language was especially engaging. I recommend it to lovers of Victorian English.
1	1360886400	Eh this book was okay but i didnt really like it because i didnt understand it very much so eh
4	1360800000	The book was ok.  It was just a little drawn out for me.  I doubt that I would read it again.
5	1360713600	probably the best Jane Austin book I HAVE READ and I have read a few of them sorry it was finished
5	1360627200	Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers.  Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it.  A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us.
3	1360627200	It was a good book, I like the story line, but I'm not a big fan of the 18th Century English language, I found it very hard to understand some of the statments that the character were making, I had to reread them several times.This was a assignment for class, is really the only reason I read it, but I did enjoy.
5	1360627200	I love Pride and Prejudice. I love Jane Austen and I simply wanted to add another 5 star review to this free version for it's awesomeness.Cheers.
5	1360540800	Pride and Prejudice is an awesome book. You can not help but fall in love with Mr. Darcy and admire Elizabeth, she is a strong and smart woman, he is sexy and handsome. It is obvious they are meant to be together and the fact the it is him that realizes he is in love with her sooner than she does, it makes it even better. :-)
5	1360540800	This was my second reading of the book and just like some  new dish  I find something new to like each time. I love this story!!!
5	1360540800	I have seen parts of the movie but never the entire story so it was enjoyed.  Some sections were a little extra explanatory but overall well written and enjoyed.
4	1360540800	I READ  the book some time ago and then saw the movie and wanted to refresh. My memory. It was just as good as I REMEMBERED.
5	1360540800	My only regret in reading this piece is my decision to delay it so long in life. The language is lively, the attention it commands is constant, and the parallels that can be drawn across time hold true.
4	1360454400	I gave this book a four out of five as it is an absolute classic, I have read this book a few times now. great book
4	1360454400	It is an interesting novel written 200 years ago but still in vogue.I don't know anybody else I could recommend it.
5	1360454400	One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls."I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature.
5	1360454400	This is a classic that I have read several times.  Each time I return to it I find new levels of inspiration.  I recommend it to  anyone who loves period pieces of worth.
5	1360454400	I've always liked Jane Austen, and this is one of her best, I feel. The ending isn't my favorite, but it's not as if I can change it. I would recommend Pride and Prejudice to all lovers of love stories.
5	1360454400	P and P is one of my favorite stories and the first novel I reread on my new Kindle paperwhite.  I loved them both
3	1360454400	I just purchased this because it was free and I had already read it a long time ago. If you like the classics, this is a good buy.
5	1360454400	I had never read the book, though I had seen the movie many times. I really enjoyed it and would read it again.
5	1360454400	great on kindle (=i'm so glad I got this when it was free. i Love Elizabeth and Mr Darcy.
5	1360368000	I've wanted to read this book since I saw the movie. It's such a charming book. I adore dear Lizzie and her character.
4	1360368000	I am about 75% of the way through this book and can say it is enjoyable, even for a guy.
5	1360368000	If you like classical books then you will adore this one. pride And prejudice is an astonishing book full of the full wrath of Jane Austin's romance.
5	1360368000	this is my desert island book - my favourite of all time. I have read it over and over again and it never ceases to entertain
5	1360368000	I just love the book love the caracters and the review the writer gives on each one in her own way
4	1360368000	I have watched the movie many times, so I wanted to see what the book was like. I really enjoyed it. I am glad my Kindle has a dictionary so I could really appreciate the story.
5	1360368000	I know, almost everyone has read the book, but in case people are looking for a free book and haven't read this one and are considering it, READ IT!!! It's amazing! Jane Austin captures your heartstrings and never lets go. Still swooning.
5	1360368000	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice gets better with each read because there are so many hidden character traits and character development that you can't possibly catch in one read. Everyone should read at the very least Pride and Prejudice!
5	1360281600	Love it! A must read. Human character shown at its best and worst. I can't wait to read more Austen!
4	1360281600	Thank you its in great shape  and it sounds Good I love it!I use it all the time on my phone.Deborah
5	1360281600	Jane Austen has yet to let me down.  I was introduced to her with Northanger Abbey and was pleasantly surprised with the humor; this book had humor of the same type but it was refreshing to see it coming from a female protagonist. Two thumbs up (and more if I had them!)
4	1360281600	This book is a must read for all those who truly love the English language. The story holds the same messages now as it did  200 years ago.
5	1360195200	I love this book, I took a class in Jane Austen and I will read this over and over again.
4	1360195200	This is probably the most well known of all Jane Austen's work and I'd never read it before my class assigned it. I'm so happy to now own it on my ipod!
5	1360195200	This book has been one of my go-to happy books for a long time. It doesn't matter what's going in my life, Pride and Prejudice is always a fun, readable, delightful time.
5	1360195200	Of course this was an excellent read and I am excited to begin Sense and Sensibility!!! Glad I was able to get it free on my Kindle!
5	1360108800	This is my very favourite book of all time and I shall most likely read it again and again until I know it by heart. I recommend it to anyone and everyone in hopes that they should have the pleasure of being affected by it as I have.
5	1360108800	Really enjoyed reading this book finally.  I had seen the movie and the play.  I enjoyed it very much and will be looking for Sense and Sensibility next.
5	1360108800	This book is a classic for a reason.  I get lost in the time period and how today we can be so similar even though things are so different.  Great love, great book.
5	1360108800	The story took you back to old England, loves lost and loves restored. I would recommend this to men and women.
5	1360108800	I have watched the three versions of P&P on TV/Movies and loved them. So now I wanted to read the book.  So far I am loving it also.
4	1360022400	Some things were harder to understand however I really liked the use of 3 different possible loves and how they played out. I'm planning on reading it a second time after others have been read
4	1360022400	Beautiful, classic story.  The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age.
5	1360022400	One of my favorites. This book is a classic and I highly recommend it! Don't be discouraged by the style.
5	1360022400	"Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how."First read. Very enjoyable. Loved Mr. Collins. Bravisimi. Oy, vey!
3	1360022400	I thought it was a good book, but definitely a hard read. I had to read it for school. And I thought it was a great love surely and I liked how the women rolled were powerful.
3	1360022400	This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be.
5	1359936000	I was surprised in myself that I had never read such a good classic.  I have seen the movir, etc, but that never compares with reading the book.. I am so glad I read it.
5	1359936000	As is probably expected, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this enduring classic. I have long admired Jane Austin's careful understanding of affection and love. It is a wonderful book to recommend
5	1359936000	Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had just completed reading Emma. I was so bored by the tedious nature of Emma that I couldn't see what the inspiration was of such a following as portrayed in the movie "The Jane Austin Book Club" which I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired to read some of her works. I prevailed and went on to read another of her books, Pride and Prejudice. I am pleased to say that I'm hooked and am looking forward to reading another of her works. (I still feel that Emma was very tedious and boring though)
3	1359936000	It's okay!!!!!!!!fine to me not the best in the world but it's okay I'm fine with it it's okay thanks
5	1359849600	Jane Austen cannot but become a favorite after reading Pride and Prejudice.  It may have taken 36 years to get to it, but I couldn't devour it fast enough once began.  I was amazed at how easily the personalities were painted in Elizabeth's language of each man.  You can't help but know each man exactly for who he is as Elizabeth does, not always timely but eventually the truth comes out.  Splendid storytelling.  Exceptional literature!
5	1359849600	I had to get this e-book to read for an academic compisition test. Convinient because it was free. Plus a good read.
5	1359849600	I loved the book so much. It is such an easier read than I thought it to be. I was greatly entertained.
5	1359763200	In the Pride and prejudice era, a woman's means of survival and finances was determined by the men in her life-first her father and then Her husband.  This is the story of the five Bennett sisters and their quest for suitable husbands.  Their felicity in life depends on overcoming pride and prejudice to follow their heart in matters of matrimony.  This was a fun story that left me longing for social norms of yesteryear.
5	1359763200	detail and descriptive language.  Some of the material in the book was pertinent to todays life.  Hard to believe it was written 200 yea ago.
5	1359763200	I read it in high school but really didn't appreciate it then.  Upon re-reading it I loved it even more.  The story line is relevant, and the story is a classic.  Enjoyed very much and definitely think it was better the second time around!
5	1359763200	Such a change from all the vulgar books out these days, easy to see why it's a classic. Loved it
5	1359763200	Very good book. Understand why it has stood the test of time and movies have been made of this classic.
4	1359676800	Realmente un cl&aacute;sico, que he le&iacute;do varias veces y puedo seguir leyendo. Digno representante del romanticismo, describe las costumbres de la &eacute;poca en la campi&ntilde;a inglesa
5	1359676800	It's a classic, no two words about it. But most of all, it brings to mind the author (Jane Austen) who managed to intertwine her own experiences into this book (the movie 'Becoming Jane' is worth seeing on the occasion).Brilliant language, captivating dialogs and complexity of feelings.
5	1359676800	Love the times this was written in, romance, etiquette, loyalty, less stress with slower pace of life, and family commitment.
5	1359590400	I love the classic British romances, but this one most of all. The language is dated and a dictionary is needed to understand fully Miss Austen 's meanings. Many other authors fail to fully satisfy the way this does. Every young woman dreams of her own Mr. Darcy.
4	1359590400	IT took Elizabeth to the end of the book to realize that she was in love  with one she had perceived to be different. Love does that to you.
5	1359590400	I first fell in love with the story after watching the movie. The book is so much better, it was all I hoped for and more.
5	1359590400	In high school, my enjoyment of old European art was always hampered by my gratitude that I'm not any of these exasperating people or in any of their stifling situations. I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman.
4	1359590400	This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)
5	1359590400	A classic for a reason.One has to concentrate on the verse.  Adjusting to the style of so many words takes getting use to. I loved the characters and story.
5	1359590400	Well I'll tell you that at first I could not understand what they were saying but I got the hang of it. This is my new favorite book. I Love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, or shall I say Elizabeth Darcy. I recommend this to people  who like a good romance blindness and you got to be able to understand the language in which the book is written in. Then after or before you should watch the movie or/and the short tv show of pride and prejudice.
1	1359590400	Amazon.com is amazing, so I'm not giving it one star because I hate Amazon.com because I don't. But I found Pride and Prejudice extremely boring but maybe that's just me. It was just so hard for me to read I like almost died it's so exasperatingly long and sooooooooooooooooooooo boring!!!!!
5	1359504000	I absolutely loved this old classic.  If you haven't read it yet, you should, after I got used to the older English way of speaking it just flowed beautifully.  A must read!
5	1359504000	Placed in my file by error. Did not purchase this book. However, a great book of encouragement available at Amazon.com is Footsteps of Recovery.
5	1359504000	pride an  prejudice was by far the BEST book of read this year. It's absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!I recommend EVERYONE to read it,especially if you're into romance
4	1359504000	Jolly good read - deservedly one of the most famous novels ever - can't believe it is now 200 years old - although the word pride does not carry the same opprobrium today as it did then  and prejudice is probably a greater evil today as it was then- probably worth thinking if it as Arrogance and  antipathy
4	1359417600	A classic I just read for the first time. I can see why it's a classic!I'm sure I'll be reading it again.
5	1359417600	I have read this book and have seen the movie so many times that I know the book by heart. It is such a romantic story in a world that is far from the one we live in today. What an adventure that ends just the way you hoped. I love, I love, I love you!
3	1359417600	I enjoyed the story. Very interesting as how women where suppose to behave. I'm glad we've as women have evolved.
5	1359417600	I have lost count how many times I have read this novel. I own more versions and copies of it than I could ever justify. Beautiful from start to finish and more enlightening with each read
5	1359417600	Doesn't matter how many times I read P&P I never get tired of it, it's still the best!  Perfect example of true romance, will always be a must read. Many people opt for just watching the movie however, i recommend you give the book a chance and read it least once, it will not disappoint!!
5	1359417600	Unfortunately watched the movie first but the book by no means disappointed. My newest favorite. I fell in love with Mr. Darcy all over again.
5	1359331200	An out-of-this world experience, especially for the missus who had studied the hard copy at school in her teens.  Today is the 200th anniversary to the day of this novel first being published in the UK, so this review comes with all the stars it duly deserves.  Congratulations for making it possible with modern technology.
5	1359331200	This book has been my favorite since the first time I read it.  I try to read it once a year and dream of someday having my own Mr Darcy!
4	1359331200	This book is a classic, and it is not by accident. Austen's way of writing is fine and poetic, and each characters are very realistic. The famous love story has a precious lesson behind it, and it makes you reflect about yourself and your relations with others.
5	1359331200	Nothing better than a classic Jane Austen book read on a modern technological marvel! Love my Kindle and love being able to download the classics for free!
4	1359331200	After enjoying several movie versions of this book I wanted to read the original, and was not disappointed. The only (minor) thing I found was the &#34;soap opera&#34; quality of much of the dialogue.
5	1359331200	I have been reading Pride and Prejudice every few years for the past thirty years at least. It is always a pleasure. The Kindle version gives me one more access to a book that I love. The characters in this novel have endured the test of time for a reason. They were well thought out and developed by a master of her craft. Every time that I read it I feel as though I am visiting old friends.William E Sherrill,
5	1359331200	Jane Austen makes a great chronicle of life. The way country people behaved and their thoughts. Just a wonderful and timeless book.
5	1359331200	I'm like the details. The word neighborhood was spelled wrong. I'm liked the end.of the story where she said they deserved
5	1359331200	Jane Austen is the queen of female writers. Her prose is timeless. Her heroine is feisty,gutsey,witty, and unwilling to compromise. Her hero is often misunderstood. Her outcome is delightful.She has not been surpassed in 200 years.
5	1359244800	It doesn't matter how many times I've read this, I love coming home to the beauty and creativity of this classic tale.
5	1359158400	I loved this book.  If would have read it in high school I would never have understood it or appreciated it as much as I did now.
5	1359158400	This book is a must read for every one!  Beautiflly written, and the narrative as unique as the author herself.
5	1359158400	Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book. This is my go to book, for a good dose of true romance.
4	1359158400	I personally enjoyed the book. A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference.
5	1359158400	Beautifully written from start to finish. The story captures all of your attention as it slowly unfolds. I get lost in all of the beautiful words. Highly recommend to strong and romantic women and men alike.
5	1359158400	This book  is  undeniably a great love story that warms your heart. It is very entertaining and full of rich and gratifying literature for the soul.
5	1359072000	Having seen the film and I think I have read the book before too, this reading absolutely took me into romantic bliss. Well worth the reread and I think I'll wait a bit before the next reading. But I will read it again. Recommended for anyone who has a slight romantic bone in their body.
5	1359072000	I love theses slippers, the are so comfy and warm. Because they are an enclosed slipper, no on can stand on the back as you walk and you don't trip up so eay. They. So remind me of the ones I had as a child. I am going to order another pair in another color, as there was a variety to choose from. Clarks shoes and slippers are the very best, when I was young that is all my parents would let us waresaying you need your feet for the rest of your life so take care of them with the best, and  my father said that brand was Clarks.rks
5	1359072000	Love, love, love this book, I have read it so many times, it just takes you back through a time portal
4	1358985600	Freaking awesome, but a little less romantic than I expected. It tends  to focus on other people's affairs just as mush as the main characters, and at one point I skipped through some of that extra jazz. It makes for a good read though, and gives really good insight to how society was way beck when.
5	1358985600	While I haven't read this version yet I seen it for the kindle and knew I had to have it.I love the book, I love the movie (BBC version with Colin Firth), and I love Jane AustinI have to admit that I watched the movie first having avoided the the book for years. I thought it would be to dry and boring. Having seen the movie I had to find out what was left out, so I took the leap.I loved it! I do think that having watched the movie helped. It was pretty well true to the book a few things left out. I did find some parts a bit dry and the speech awkward and don't think if I were younger would have had the patience to move thru it. It is good and definitely worth the push.
4	1358985600	Starts off very slow, but comes into its own near the last 100 pages. Great read. I'll definitely be looking into more Jane Austen books.
5	1358985600	I have to read this book several times a year. I love how Elizabeth and Darcy have sparring matches and how their love stands the test of time. I give it five stars.
5	1358899200	Still a great story;even after multiple readings. Timeless. Will read it again in the future. A personal favorite of Jane Austen"s work.
5	1358899200	My favorite book.  Being able to re read this on a stormy day or on a sunny beach any time I want to on my kindle is the bomb.
4	1358899200	I found P and P to be extremely slow at first, but became excellent from the middle to the end.
1	1358899200	I'm only giving a 1 star review because of the single issue referenced in my review title (it would be lovely to have separate 'formatting' reviews). It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right. And of course, the story is great, and everybody should read it.It seems the language attribute for the book is not set to 'English' and so (again only on K/KT/KPW) one gets 'Dictionary Not Found" even though an English dictionary is available. On my Kindle Touch, it does a lookup in the Italian dictionary that I happen to have on there (and of course fails to find these English words). Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly. But that only fixes that instance. Fresh downloads from Amazon will still have this problem, at least until it is fixed.
3	1358812800	Haven't read it all so I can't really say if I like it or love it.  Maybe when I get a chance to read more of it I'll know how I like it.
5	1358812800	Great story for anyone who has had to deal with the convoluted workings of a family. Meeting new people, making friends, or falling in love is never easy and it's made even more difficult by the human failing of not being able to be open and honest with others from the beginning of the new relationships. This book is more than a window to the past, it is a relevant look at how many relationships florish or fail in our own times.
5	1358726400	I hadn't read this for many, many years. It's amazing how a life perspective can enhance something I thought I knew already.
5	1358726400	Pride and Prejudice, I can now say, is a classic for a reason. Though hard to understand at times for the old style of writing, it is a very entertaining story that I believe is worth the effort. (I must admit that I was able to follow along better because I have seen the movie, which can act as a guide.)
4	1358726400	The story line is good but the writing style takes a little getting used to.  Jane Austen writes in long complicated sentence structures that sometime required me to reread a time or two to understand.  I consider it a good mental exercise for my aging brain.  I will continue to read her works.
5	1358726400	Just an amazing book com the older days to read and the characters are so superb in actions and words
5	1358726400	This is the first book by Jane Austen I have read. It was thoroughly enjoyed. I will be reading more by this author.
5	1358726400	Titles as old as this are often found to be dry and boring to present day youth. Pride and Prejudice is something to be read by all teens. By choice hopefully.
3	1358640000	I haven't completed this book but from what Ive read so far I feel I will get great satisfaction from reading.
4	1358640000	What can I say this classic literature really have me insight to the past and kept my attention piqued. This is definitely a must read !!
5	1358640000	What can one say regarding this all time classic.  One cannot help but enjoy the vexations and joys of the Bennet family.
5	1358640000	It took me 48 years to read this book and was delighted that it kept on the edge of my seat!
5	1358640000	I have always wanted to read Pride and Prejudice, so you can imagine my joy when I found it for FREE on my Kindle.P&P; was exactly what I thought it would be, one of the greatest books Jane Austen has ever written.I immediately fell in love with Elizabeth's character, and just as immediately began to hate the characters of Lydia and Mrs. Bennett, Jane Austen wrote them so realistically that the three of them reminded me of people I knew in real life. You know an author  is amazing at what they do when they can actually make you feel some sort of emotion with their characters, especially when the character is meant to be loved or hated.Well, that's all
5	1358553600	A must read for all generations.  I had seen the movie but never read the book until now and wished I had sooner.
2	1358553600	I got what I paid for. I paid zero and I got a story written about 200 years ago.  Pride and Prejudice is about a poor girl and a rich english noble.  Not much of a plot, Will the girl become a princess?  I do read love stories but they should have a interesting story plot.lee sullivan
5	1358553600	I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
5	1358553600	I like Pride and Prejudice, so naturally I'll rate this edition highly. I like the story, and I like learning about that time period too.
5	1358553600	Ships quickly. Item as described. good to use. will recommend it and buy it again in the future if needed.
5	1358553600	love this book, have always wanted to read it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
5	1358553600	Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story
5	1358467200	The best characters, lessons, and humor. I'm always inspired by the upright character of the times, and the knowledge of human nature Austen displays is intriguing.
5	1358467200	Classic! If you haven't read it in a long time read it again and if you have never read it READ IT!
3	1358380800	I chose this book because of the author's fame but found I could not relate to it just now.  I will try to read this book again, later.
5	1358380800	I love this story. Somewhat challenging to read due to the old English, but such a powerful story none the less.
5	1358380800	I dont know what shall I say about it, I am in love with this book. I am sure everyone knows Mr. Darcy but you should read the book before you see the movie
5	1358294400	I read &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; when I was in college and thought it was an awful bore!  I decided to re-read it and am I glad I did.  I have a much greater appreciation for Jane Austen now than I did as an 18 year old.  I am sure I will re-read it again in a few years......
4	1358294400	Jane creates a colorful cast of characters to people this moral tale of  hasty judgement.  As always her heroine must suffer mistakes on her part and bear the frailties of others to find happiness.
5	1358294400	My resolution is to read more classic literature.  I love this book  so I decided to start with a book I had read a long time ago.  Once I ordered the book, I got it immediately.  The service is exceptional..
4	1358294400	Pride and prejudice is a moving rmance story depicting well the class societ of England and how in the end love prevails over class restraints; pride and individual prejudices.  This book causes deep introspection of one's values; beliefs and mores.
5	1358208000	If you like the classics, you will love this. Wit, drama, and comedy. Amazing.However, if you don't like the classics, you may find the language difficult to get into at first, but I believe you will soon fall in love with these characters.
5	1358208000	This is a classic novel everyone should read.  Jane Austin is witty and creative, this book is not just for a high school English class.
5	1358208000	One of the best romances in the world of literature. Every woman wants a Mr Darcy although in the BBC adaptation I actually preferred Bingley ;)
5	1358208000	People can often be dismissive of chick lit but all you need to do is read Pride and Prejudice to know that books based on men/women and their misunderstandings when done well can't be beaten. I go back to this book at least once a year and it only gets better and better.
4	1358208000	I loved the story and all of the characters were so relatable. My favorite though was Mr. Bennett. He was hilarious with his sarcasm and dry humor.
5	1358208000	I can clearly see why anyone who reads English literature has high praises for this story. I enjoyed everything about it. It was well written, well developed, and well presented that it holds the number one spot in my love of books. The tone of the story, the pace of the story, all very pleasing to me. And the language! I highly recommend this story to all who has a love for books.
5	1358121600	I have read thid book at least three times before. I enjoy it each time I read it. I sympathize with Elizabeth having to deal with her silly mother and two of her sisters. This novel gives the reader insight about what it was like to be a woman in England at the time. The main focus of each young woman's life is finding a good marriage. It makes me greatful that I don't live in this time period.
5	1358121600	Pretending to 'rate' such an incomparable classic of great literature as Pride & Prejudice is a pretty pointless exercise, in my opinion.
5	1358121600	Two hundred years after it was written this book remains as witty, insightful and entertaining as ever.  I cannot recommend it enough!
5	1358035200	One of my favorite stories.  Love the old movie about it.  Sort of a different take on the story of Cinderella or the rags to riches theme.
5	1358035200	Great timeless romance! Looking forward to reading another Jane Austen book. I anticipated a happy ending and she delivered. Thanks
5	1358035200	This is a digital version of my favorite book. You can't go wrong with that. It was a great addition to my kindle.
5	1358035200	Loved this book.  Love all the characters.  One of my all time favorite love stories!  All young girls should be required to read it....
5	1358035200	I have read this book five or six times!  It is almost lyrical, or musical in the cadence of delivery.  I do love it.  I will read it again and again.  It is like Jane Austen crystalized a period for us and polished it into a gem to enjoy for lifetimes to come!
5	1358035200	es un muy buen libro y tienes la oportunidad de  buscar el significado de las palabras inmediatamente , es bueno para empazar a leer en el kindle
5	1358035200	I've read this book many times, I love Jane Austen. So now I am thrilled to have this beautiful love story on my kindle fire, which I have once again read.  This story always makes me smile.
5	1358035200	Love love love the book. This ebook had quite a few typos, but nothing that made it unreadable. Plus, it was free, so I'm not complaining.
5	1358035200	It was a good book and i enjoyed it greatly. I read it to help myself when i take the AP test in the spring for english.
5	1358035200	I am in love with this  book. Jane Austen did a fantastic job. I am planning on buying more of he  books. :)
4	1357948800	Good book for females only. I really can't see a male enjoying this book due to the narration of mostly  a female.
3	1357948800	I read this book to improve my vocabulary for the ISSE, SSAT or SAT. It has all the perfect words in the tests and with a click of a finger you can find a definition.
4	1357948800	I had wanted to read this book for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to. It is a good piece, which I very much enjoyed. For me, it didn't totally live up to my expectations of it, but I found it very enjoyable to read. And I can't wait to read more of Jane Austen's books...
5	1357948800	I sooooo love this story, I saw the movie, and I have always been in love with it, I very much loved this book and I recommend this to everybody it is very romantic, very smart, and it has alot of qualities that I very much enjoy.
5	1357948800	Great writer and one of the best observation of human social interaction and capturing the associated emotions.of social interaction. Also, one of the most romantic stories I have ever read.
5	1357948800	PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IS MAGIC!! IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF MY FAVORITES. I TRULY LOVE THE WRITINGS OF JANE AUSTEN.
4	1357948800	I found the book to be very interesting. It drew me into to story. I would defiantly read it again.
5	1357948800	I always loved this story and all the books from Jane Austen. The form that is written, the language, the descriptions are excellent.  I say that I really enjoying reading all these books.
5	1357862400	Have always wanted to read this and finally doing it.  I am only about 20% into it but am enjoying it and finding it hard to put down.  Had seen the movie but as in all movies the book fills in the gaps!  Definitely recommend: A good insight to English life style along with a good read.
5	1357862400	This is a classic book ofLiterature that demonstrates the tenacious plight of a 19th century heroine determined to not settle for anything other than true love. This demonstrates the helpless nature of women in a society dominated by men. Jane Austin is masterful in her craft.
5	1357862400	This book is romantic and comical. A great look at that period in time through the eyes of a family living the experiences.
5	1357862400	A classic novel depicting the motives and manipulations of people.  Really enjoyed it!  Had a hard time putting it down.
5	1357862400	I think this a great book. I have probably read this book 3 times. Just everyone says, &#34;It is a classic.&#34;
5	1357862400	The only way to describe this book and it's characters is literary perfection. Leaves me with a smile on my face. Every girl must read this book.
5	1357776000	An English classic which needs no introduction or explanation! Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!
5	1357776000	Always been a favourite of mine and I still love it.  Was the first e-book I've read and I found it convenient.
5	1357776000	Very insightful and fun.  Easy to relate to the issues the parents face.  The two leads make great role models.
4	1357776000	You really need to use your imagination with this book.  Not because the book is badly written, but you have to let yourself go an imagine what it would be like and visualize this in your mind.
5	1357776000	This book is filled with everything a good book should be. Its funny, serious and romantic. I really recommend it. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	1357689600	Its been my favorite book for last 25 years. It is one of the books that keeps feeling new everytime I read it.
5	1357689600	I love Jane Austen's books and Pride and Prejudice was the firts one I read and I fell in love with it. So I wanted to have this one on my Kindle. I've bought my Kindle recently so i wanted to know how it will work. For me, everything is alright and Pride and Prejudice is a classic. I also own this book in hard cover. Plus, it's for free.
5	1357689600	I found Pride and Prejudice to be captivating. I thoroughly enjoyed examining the many rules of etiquette from that period and marveled at the established social boundaries, comparing then and now.
5	1357689600	BEST WRITTEN AUSTEN BOOK IN MY OPINION. THE FAMILY DYNAMICS ARE HILARIOUS AND HEARTWARMING. LIKE CHATTING WITH AN OLD FRIEND WHEN I READ THIS BOOK.
3	1357689600	Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later.
2	1357603200	Sometimes the language was hard to understand but it helped to understand the movie better by reading the book. Enjoyed the book
5	1357603200	This is written in the language of its day and is very enjoyable as a light read. If you've never read and like old fashioned romantic books this is a good one.
5	1357603200	It is a work of art. How I have fallen in love with these characters!! The interactions between Lizzy and Darcy are so endearing. The language is beautiful!
5	1357603200	One of my favorite books.  Who would I recommend it to?  Any literate person. This is classic fiction and very enjoyable however often you read it.
3	1357603200	Seeing Lizzie struggle with herself and others was well done. Mr. Darcy seemed too cruel to suddenly be so nice. But he was trying to NOT love Lizzie. Fun story, everything tied up in a pretty ribbon in the end.
4	1357516800	This is a chic book, but I do enjoy reading it and seeing how the author develops the characters and the plots.  Have read it about 5 times and frequently go back to sections.
5	1357516800	Awesome book!!!! Loved it and the movie!!!! Will be reading more of Jane Austen, don't know why I haven't read these before!!!
5	1357516800	Loved it in hardcover and in paper back.  Love it even more in e-book.  The characters are as real today as in the Austen era.
5	1357516800	Wonderful, feel like is am being transported to another time. Love her style of writing and the way the characters come to life
5	1357516800	This is my favourite book of all time. It is truly a timeless classic. I recommend it to anyone who is old enough to comprehend what the book is about.
4	1357516800	One of my favorite books. The realization of the truth set them free to love. Oh Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy!
5	1357516800	Wonderful story and loved all the &#34;proper&#34; behavior along with the secret thoughts of a young girl back in the 19th Century.  When marriage was the main course for unmarried ladies and how involved the entire family became in order to strive for that objective.  I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed.  Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one.  The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight.  All's well that end's well, loved the book.
5	1357516800	I wished  I had read this novel in high school. I have been missing out!a terrific,classic read that I recommend to all.
5	1357516800	My favorite book ever! It is wonderfully written and the plot is exciting and hard to put down once started.
2	1357516800	These earrings are much larger than I expected, although that is not the fault of the seller. They are just not my style. But I was very surprised that they were Lucky Brand earrings since the seller specifically said: &#34; Note: new, no tag, no logo and not a name brand item, only &#34;similar to.&#34; See description for details. DISCLOSURE NOTE: *The jewelry we carry is inspired by some of our favorite designers and celebrities, however, we do not sell exact replica jewelry or knockoff jewelry. The jewelry is not stamped with a designer name, does not contain a designer hangtag or arrive in a designer logo box.&#34; They came marked as Lucky Brand, which I was disappointed with because they were going to be a gift and I thought I was buying something unique.
3	1357430400	A classic that should be read once in your life. However, I'm glad to move on to bigger and better things.
5	1357430400	It was a pleasant read.  I have always wanted to read it and I finally found the time.  I am happy that I did.
5	1357430400	I had always wanted to read this especially after seeing the movie. I love to see how the screenwriters either kept to the story or alters it in some ways.
4	1357430400	Enjoyed reading this classic story! I would recommend this to anyone, especially those who love reading about the prescense of mind of those from historical eras.
4	1357430400	I knew this book was a classic, but never read it until now.  I enjoyed  the story, it ended too soon.
5	1357430400	Very well written love story and an interesting study of human nature. Probably of more interest to women than men.
5	1357344000	It is a classic and rightly so. Probably the original chick book. So much dialogue and focus on relationships between people. I thought it was very well written and certain key quotes caught my eye. Overall, a joy not a pain to read for my literature class.
5	1357344000	An entertaining look into the always turbulent and never direct course of courtship and marriage; it is well worth reading over and over again.
5	1357257600	I was in love with the movie and I am now equally in love with this book.  I enjoy the style of writing, and how easy it is to understand.  What a wonderful story of strong women who are able to rise above their class.  Yet, they do it through love and never sell themselves into it.
5	1357257600	a classic. I love it! I always want to read it iver & over but can never find the book lying around home. Thanks Kindle
4	1357257600	Pride and prejudice is a romantic story that shows how two people fall in love through pride as as well as prejudice.
5	1357257600	There is a reason this book has been around for 200 years. Its tale of human nature. Is timeless. The tale of love and miss understanding is equally timeless.
5	1357257600	The book was recently read by my mother who recommended it.I loved the movie and knew I would enjoy reading.  I was not disappointed.Her characters were easy for me to visualize.  It kept my attention and can see why it is a classic.
3	1357257600	Ok book.  Movie was better and easier to follow on than the books.  Liked the characters in the movie better than those in the book,.
5	1357257600	I downloaded this as my first book on my new Kindle.  Classic Austen, good font for the Kindle, phenomenal story line.  If you love romance and haven't read this quintessential book - what are you waiting for?
4	1357171200	The language is at times hard to follow, but the book is wonderful! Beautiful classic love story with a great ending.
5	1357171200	I have always loved this book. I would love to step back into Jane Austen world and see the families, balls, parties, and courting. It is hard to understand the language at first but if you keep going and get into a rhythm it really is a beautiful thing.
3	1357171200	My first read on Kindle and I have to say it was a delight to venture back into the pages of a novel I first read many years ago.
5	1357171200	Pride and Prejudice is one of the classic greats. You cannot help but fall in love with the characters. This novel has humor and romance . . . it's a must read.
5	1357171200	I have started reading the list of 100 books to read before you die and this is my favorite so far. A beautiful story well written.
5	1357171200	Excellent book, I highly recommend it.  I will read it again.Elizabeth character is most inspiring to have an open mind.
4	1357084800	Great classic, couldn't put it down. I liked being able to read it on my kindle. Finding some of the old classics sometimes can be difficult. I like the fact that I can find these through amazon.
5	1357084800	Most importantly it was FREE; glad it was available on the &#34;free&#34; list as it was required for Book Club reading; It made a great addition to my kindle library;
5	1357084800	Good tale! It was funny, heart warming and holds your attention until the end. It is definitely worth the read!
5	1357084800	I bet you just loved that Mr. Darcy. Well, yes. Yes, Tom Hanks. I did just love that Mr. Darcy.
5	1357084800	No matter how many times I read this book, it still makes me smile.  An American classic beyond measure!  It will forever withstand the test of time!
1	1357084800	This is not a good Kindle version. It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased. Get it, buy it, borrow it. However you get your hands on this book, read it and fall in love.
5	1357084800	One of the best books, or maybe the best book I've ever read! I loved it!!!! I am excited to watch the movie, then I will read this book again and again!
4	1357084800	I watched  the  movie and expected the book to be much the same. The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the  language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because  of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works.
5	1357084800	It's important to remember that Pride and Prejudice takes place during the later reign of George the Third at the beginning of the 19th century. The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel.
4	1357084800	I had read it before but enjoyed reading it again. It had been along time since I read it last.
5	1356998400	This edition works smoothly on a Kindle. There are no awkward gaps or strange spacing problems.As to the content of the novel and the style of its telling, nothing I could say would add materially to its nearly universal veneration.
5	1356998400	The language in this novel is beautiful. The story is compelling. I wish all books of this nature were required reading.
5	1356998400	I would be shocked if anyone reading this had never heard of the book before or seen any of the many movies about it, but just in case this is one of the best love stories ever written.  An absolute must read.  There are some unfamiliar words but if you have a dictionary you should be fine.  It is wonderful!!
5	1356998400	I am happy to finally have read it. It is a lovely read that is worthy of being deemed a classic.
5	1356998400	The construction of the story and the storytelling are wonderful. It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature.
1	1356998400	I was very very disappointed when I downloaded this book for my Kindle. According to Amazon customer service, there is no way to tell if any of the free Kindle editions of books are abridged before you download them. In this case, the book is clearly abridged, and it is a very poorly done abridgment. Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged.
5	1356998400	Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me.
5	1356998400	Long read but I read it on a road trip to help pass the time. I love the love between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.
5	1356998400	Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!
4	1356912000	What a great love story!Austen did a amazing job I only wish she continued to tell more about Elizabeth's life after the marriage!
5	1356912000	Great read! I wish we still spoke in such eloquent terms. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great classic. Enjoy.
5	1356912000	a fun book once you got used to the language it was impossible to put down. I highly recommend it!
5	1356912000	This book gets better with time. I love sinking into the old world customs and imagine myself without phone and just pen and paper for communication.
5	1356912000	Reading this book for the second time although enjoying if immensely more the second being of my own choice. Really a splendid author describing quite effectively lively characters.
5	1356912000	Brainy sophisticated and hilarious. A great read! Very interesting and you are entertained by Elizabeth and Darcy the entire novel.
5	1356912000	This  book is the best ever. It's a classic that can still be related to today. It's absolutely beautiful and bound to be a favorite of whomever reads it.
4	1356912000	Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and, at first, this book was no different. I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written. Then again, it's just not my preferred writing style. Also, I got this on my Kindle for free and the formatting was just fine.
5	1356912000	It was easy to download and read. I like having both physical and electronic copies if I can. It was convenient to read because of accessibility on my phone or tablet. Anywhere I got stuck waiting I could start up the book again. Of course the story is a classic too, read it because its my now fianc&eacute;e's favorite and I was brushing up for ideas before my own proposal!
5	1356825600	The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today. Pride can get in the way of almost anything, and so can being prejudice. The modern spin is called Prom and Prejudice. The people changed to fit the time, but not the message. It is a wonderful book worth reading.
4	1356825600	An amazing book. After watching the movie more than 20 times I always wanted to read this. It was as great as the movie and a must read/watch.
5	1356825600	Wonderful look back into a more romantic time. When ladies were proper ladies, and men were true gentlemen.  Sweet love.
5	1356825600	I appreciated the character development. Differences of class and upbringing, coupled with societal exposure and expectation lead the plot through many twists and turns that keep you reading.
5	1356825600	This classic is a great love story for the ages. A must read for everyone interested in literature. Will be read over and over again.
5	1356739200	What is there to say that hasn't already been said?  That in my head I switch back and forth between Colin Firth and Sir Lawrence Olivier as Darcy? I'm certain that's been said.....read it for the first time or read it again. Top 5 best opening lines of a novel ever.
5	1356739200	Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorite novels.  It is a phenomenal read and well worth downloading.
5	1356739200	I have read this book many times and never get tired of it.  It's my all time favourite.  The characters come to life.  This is realisistic of the period.
5	1356739200	I really enjoyed this book. When it was required reading in school and I totally disliked it. It's amazing how much I enjoyed it. I'll have to go revisit some more classics
5	1356739200	great read! Loved the electronic format even though it is a little different from have the feel of a book.
5	1356739200	I like classic stories. This book is nice and is the first one that I got for my kindle so nice.
4	1356652800	I will not go as far as saying this is one of my favorites. However, it is a classic that demands respect and carries with it all the elements of a good read.
5	1356652800	Never being a fan of the classics, I was delightfully shocked at how much I enjoyed this book. Jane Austen has converted me and I now find myself in possession of all of her wonderful books now. What I thought would be a dreadful endurance has turned into a new favorite of mine and opened my eyes to the wonders that this amazing author has to offer. This is a great book for everyone willing to read it!
5	1356652800	Pride and Prejudice is just one of those books that I love to read over and over again. It is one of the best romance books ever.  In fact, my favorite romance book, Jane Eyre is written by the same author.
5	1356652800	Though the language used throughout this book, is the stilted,formal verbiage of an era long past; the charm and humor of the protagonists is readily recognized.  The first time I read this book, was a required reading for a literature class.  Being a more "mature" reader, has greatly increased enjoyment of this volume.
5	1356566400	This is one of my all time favorite reads! While the story comes to a predictable end, the journey to it is such a pleasure that I have reread and written down passages that will probably stay with me forever.
3	1356566400	A classic, this book is a great pleasure to myself and I would recommend it to anyone fond of literature and able to understand higher level reading. Besides, who doesn't love the classics?
5	1356566400	The book speaks for itself. One of the greatest works ever created. It is no wonder that Jane Austen and her novels are still revered today.
3	1356566400	Difficult at first, but soon after enjoyed the love story.  Loved Elizabeth's character and Jane.  Darcy was frustrating!  Mrs. Bennett was quite comical!
5	1356566400	Beautiful story, wonderfully written. I recommend it and I believe everyone should read it st least once. I am glad I did.
5	1356566400	The greatest love story of all times! I can't help but love everything by Jane Austen! Wonderful characters, wonderful read, the movie does it no justice
4	1356480000	Classic Jane Austen at work. Already have the paperbook addition but is definitely a &#34;must have&#34; for my electronic reading collection.....never know when you're going to get stuck somewhere or the urge for a classic read ivercomes you!!!
5	1356480000	I am the proud owner of the Kindle. It has allowed me to buy many books and read them easily. I love the story about the Bennetts as written by Jane Austen.
5	1356480000	Excellent Book!!!! Great read for the holidays--Jane Austen knows how to tell a love story/  Order it now for some reading pleasure.
5	1356393600	Such a great love story! I love this book. It's absolutely one of my favorites. Great book to read in your spare time.
5	1356393600	good read works on my tablet and ereader and on my notebook. good read works on my tablet and ereader and on my notebook.
5	1356393600	Excellent character study.  I find new nuances and information about the players each time I read it. I give it a 5 star rating.
4	1356220800	My teenage daughter fell in love with this story through the various movies before she read the book in hard cover.  Now she loves it on Kindle.
5	1356220800	Love the book &#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34; The digital copy for my Kindle makes it perfect for transportation and easy access.
4	1356220800	I love the old classics and this is one of them. It also downloaded easily to my new windows 8 kindle from the apps store.
5	1356048000	And I've read it more than once! One of my absolute favorite books ever, such a WONDERFUL story with great characters! Definately worth the read over and over again
5	1356048000	A classic for all to read.  A must for all high school students. There are many lessons to  be gotten from this novel.
5	1356048000	There's not much new to say about Jane Austen though in my experience readers of classic novels either love her or hate her.  When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable.  Perhaps it comes with age :-).  It's a great love story to read on a stormy night in front of the fire.  Wonderful character development.  If one prefers more angst I'd recommend something like Rememberance of Things Past :-).
1	1356048000	Another Classic, but it just drags for me. Of course, I don't think I'm in the target audience Jane Austen had in mind. I attempted to read it, because it came with my Kindle.
5	1355961600	All of Jane Austen's writings are exceptional but Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite. It is so well written; full of such amazing, well-developed characters you either love or hate. The plot is so enjoyable and the humor is so well done it's fascinating! Everyone who loves to read should read this book.
4	1355961600	I read this book in high school and enjoyed is somewhat.  Recently I read it again and was far more impressed.  It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful.  There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book.  Her humor is subtle but witty.  It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.The Kindle version of the book is good.  It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle).
3	1355875200	As always this is an amazing book but this version was a pit disappointing. Certain words were left out which would make it hard for someone who has never read the book. For someone who is familiar with the book this isn't a huge issue especially since its free.
4	1355875200	I needed to have a copy of P & P for a class. The eBook makes it so much easier! Great price and you have the book in just the amount of time it takes to download. Couldn't be happier.
3	1355875200	The plot is good...but they don't tell you what each character is thinking, the don't give you an insight into each person real personality
5	1355875200	I wanted to read a classic and with my new Kindle Fire, I did just that.  I enjoyed the story and will read more by Jane Austen.
5	1355875200	Ms. Austen's book revenues will not be affected by anything I have to say about this book, it seems silly to write a review. It is also beyond my skills to praise it adequately. Just read it- now.
5	1355875200	Great book.  Can't go wrong with a classic book.  Love the kindle addition. Can read on kindle and my phone.
5	1355875200	I bought as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's had this brand of slippers before and loved them a lot.
5	1355875200	It's a beautiful story and a great title: the first part, our hero, Elizabeth, fights with what she thinks is the pride of Mr. Darcy. Then, when she discovers he's a gentleman with a very strong personality, she has to turn al her prejudices against him on his favor. It's a beautiful story.
5	1355875200	Such a great read.  The book and movie are both amazing.  I would recommend for anyone to read this book.  Jane Austen was an amazing writer.
4	1355788800	A classic book that everyone should take the time to read. Have to get used to the different ideas & manner of speaking but was very heartwarming.
4	1355616000	This is my fourth reading of this book and I become even more enamored of it with every single read!!
5	1355616000	Jane Austen created Elizabeth Bennett - every respectable man's ultimate woman - and Mr. Darcy - the role model for all gentlemen. She combined romance and wit with real characters and a story that has enchanted every generation since it was published. For some, the language is a barrier, but perseverance will reward any reader with possibly the best book ever written.
5	1355443200	A true classic for any Jane Austin fan. Kindle version was very nice to read through. As much as I love paperback go ahead and use the kindle version.
5	1355443200	All I had hoped for and then some!!! Having watched the movie in its various forms numerous times, I had wanted to read the book for years.  I finally did, and am so glad!!
5	1355443200	As good as I remembered it always being. Loved that I was able to read it for free. Definitely recommend it
5	1355270400	This is by far my favorite Jane Austen book.  Her characters are fabulous and easily come to life from the page.  Elizabeth Bennet is very charming and witty and you can't help but root for her and her zany family.
5	1355270400	Wonderful story...after seeing the movie..I just had to read the book...so worth it!!  The characters came alive in full glory.  Loved it.
3	1355270400	Even though there were more than a few times I had to look up some word that I didn't know. I found this book to be very good
5	1355184000	The one thing I noticed is 18th century communication.It was much more a part of life than the lack of communicationtoday. People thought before speaking, gained knowledgeabout another person through communication. It's sad to thinkThat now we text more, and communicate less.Sad, very sad.
5	1355097600	Admittedly, I'm a Jane Austen fan. That said, I think Pride and Prejudice is the best book she ever wrote. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent, and the story line flows with a sense of inevitability. Oh, yes, I read everything Jane wrote, and almost all of it with pleasure, but I return to reread Pride and Prejudice every year or two for the sheer pleasure of doing so. And what better way to do it than via Kindle?
4	1355097600	Should have read a long time ago. Did not really know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Chosen because is a classic.
5	1355011200	This is my favorite Jane Austin novel. The characters are so well developed and the descriptions so perfect I felt I was there with them. I loved getting lost in the story and couldn't wait to read what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone!
5	1355011200	Jane Austen had great sociological, cultural and anthropological insights at her time. However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc.
5	1354838400	Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!
5	1354752000	Hadn't read this book in years and couldn't put it down just like last time. Very happy to have found it for free and didn't find any errors or differences that would make me believe it was different.
5	1354752000	Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read. Honestly the writing style is not something I could read often, but this is a beautiful-reach in and touch your soul kind of read...Of course the movie is amazing as well, but I stand by what I always say-The book is ALWAYS better.
5	1354752000	I know most teens whine & complain when assigned classics to read for school, but this book is so much more than required reading. I first read it in 5th grade (my reading level was advanced for my age #humblebrag lol) and I read it over and over, never tiring of the crisp, Victorian language or heart-rending love story. Read with an open mind!
5	1354579200	They just don't make stories like this anymore!  So well written for the era into this day. Available on Kindle!
5	1354406400	Love the book -1st time I have ever read this.Suggestion: read it quickly.  If you read slowly you will not gather the concepts since it is so wordy
5	1354406400	I don't know why you would want to spend more.  The color is awesome, the feel of the material is great, and the case fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly and makes for easy waking / sleeping.  I recently traveled and the flip for the viewing stand rested perfectly on airline tray.
5	1354406400	One of the most beloved novels and a necessary component for any library. Print and format is fine for a free domain book.
5	1354406400	I've always loved this book, from the moment I had to read in high school, and every subsequent reading thereafter. It's the greatest romance ever written, in my humble opinion. Austen is an excellent writer, sprinkling her work with surprisingly profound assertions, and witty one-liners alike. I would recommend to anyone.
5	1354406400	What can you say, it's Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I love this story and am very happy to have it on my phone.  I've already read it once.  Download was easy.
5	1354320000	My all-time favorite book. This story never gets old. Austen is the master when it comes to writing about love of the purest kind. Do yourself a favor and keep this in rotation in your library.
5	1353888000	I love rereading this story. The moral of it is timeless. It's a classic for a reason. Easy format, too.
4	1353801600	I have not read a lot of this book yet.  It is very interesting.  It is set in older times when horses and buggies were used.
5	1353801600	one of the best books ever written! These topics are eternal and Jane Austen displays it with such charm you can't stop reading until you finish the book.
5	1353801600	This is in my opinion the best book ever written. Having read the other excellent reviews here there is really nothing i can add except to say that i love Jane Austen and everything she wrote, and that Pride and prejudice is my favourite book of all time. I am an avid reader and i enjoy most genres, but Pride and Prejudice is the only novel i have read again and again over the years. Brilliant!
5	1353628800	As a classic, it can be read and then reread, finding new ways to apply its' story to ones own life
5	1353628800	I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves it. The fabric is thick and will keep you warm. The design is unique and different. I highly recommend this product.
5	1353542400	Somehow never read Austen as a youngster but decided to read it on my new Kindle!  I'm so glad I did!  The story got off to a slow start, dull and dry!  As I plowed on through a lot of dinners and dances some of the characters became appealing, the plot thickened.  Suddenly I was hooked.  I've become an Austen enthusiast  I will be ordering more of her novels.
5	1353542400	I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected. The authors use of english is very enjoyable and more accessible than I thought it would be. Best bit of 200 year old chicklit you can read.
5	1353456000	Truly one of the best stories of all time. Pride and Prejudice will always be a classic. Bravo Jane Austen.
5	1353283200	Have read this book many times and it always delights me one of her greatest works .Jane Austin will never go out of style
5	1353196800	I could not finish this book before I watched the PBS mini series.  Once I knew the characters it was a very easy read.  Just too many facts for my brain.  But it is the best book every.  Great Love story.
5	1353110400	This book was a good play of wit and romance, and I loved the juicy characters, such as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. :) Would reccomend for advanced 13 year olds, but otherwise 14-15 and up.
5	1353024000	Wonderful read! Ms. Austen's characters are so alive in her writing. Much to the chagrin of everyone around me, I couldn't put it down until it was done!
4	1352937600	Tough read, but it's a classic.  Half way through and it's hard to put down.  I recently read Jane Eyre, so I didn't have to look up as many words : )
4	1352937600	Great book for women or anyone who loves to gossip! Also contains great words and gives you a good idea of marriage and romance customs in the past.
3	1352937600	Overall, this novel was a good read. However, it lulled in many places and a lot of determination was required to finish this novel. I am pleased I did though, as the ending was very well written and the portrayal of characters by Austen (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) were very captivating - but not on a level with Dickens.As I suggested to a friend, this novel is a classic, by all means read it. However, don't be in a hurry to do so and if you never get round to it, oh well!
5	1352851200	This book is, of course, a timeless classic.  Beautifully written.  I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle.
5	1352764800	This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual "table of contents" function. (i.e., if you click on "Go to..." the "table of contents" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten "Popular Highlights" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15.
5	1352764800	Pride and PrejudiceLove Jane Austen  Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings.  If you like Jane Austen the you will enjoy this book
2	1352592000	I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the "plot." The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one.
5	1352505600	A must read. Sometimes the greatest loves begin when and were we least expect it. Jane Austen, one of my favorite writers,surely ahead of her time!!!!!!
5	1352332800	Brilliant, as expected, well written , enjoyed very much, as good as expected from the Bbc adaptation.  Will read again
5	1351900800	Ok, so the language can be a little rough at times, but reading this book on my kindle was easier because I can look up the definitions without losing the flow of the book.  I'm on my fourth read of this book and it gets better each time. A must read classic!
5	1351814400	This is such a great novel. I have the paper book, one on my kindle, and also 2 movies. I think this is the best book from Austen.
4	1351728000	A good book and a very interest romance. An history to put in your heart and in your life. Fantastic.
5	1351555200	Good book lots of features i like the characters and the setting of the story i thought it was awsome to read and it had great imageination
5	1351468800	While "Pride and Prejudice" itself needs no review, since it's the best loved romance novel of all time, it's nice to have it available in a format my telephone based reader can handle. Now, even in the can, I'll never be without refined reading material!
5	1351382400	I read this after watching the movie about 10 times and I was not disappointed. More detail and better understanding of their feelings and the characters in the book. I really enjoyed it.
5	1351382400	Fell in love with this novel when I had to read it for introduction to fiction class. Even though the novel lacks the description of nature, it enables one to feel rural England with its green meadows and fields. The plot is basically a soap opera but it is simply fun to read and see how it develops till it reaches the good end. Therefore, it is a truth univerisally acknowledged that the lovel of great literature must be in want of reading this book :).
5	1351296000	a wonderful book,so hard to put down. A true English classic that is hopelessly romanticWould definitely recommend this book
5	1351036800	Jane Austen is a true master.  Her characters and phrasing linger long after the book has been set aside. Austen should be required reading for all.
5	1350950400	My fav movie of all time (the one with Colin Firth, of course); now I'm reading the book on my Kindle.
2	1350777600	I am a huge fan of the movie with Greer Garson.The book is so disappointing.I was hoping to be captured and sadly was not.
5	1350691200	I love this book.  I read this book 20 years ago and I'm reading it a second time.  I love it even more.  I plan to read it again in the near future.  I just love the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  The details of their thoughts make you feel like you know them.
5	1350518400	Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!  Classic romance novel.  Had wanted to read this for a long, long time.  Moderate amount of 'flowery' writing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
5	1350432000	Greatest love story of all time. Amazing story. Well written. A true work of art. Very amazing literature and captivating story
5	1350345600	I was hooked after the first two sentences. I am now surprised at myself that I had not read a single Jane Austen book at nearly 30. I fully intend on reading all of her works. I loved how dialogue based this novel is.
5	1350259200	I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass  on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading.
5	1350172800	It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle. I was afraid the quality may be bad, for it was among the cheap or free classics. It is not the case, the format is very enjoyable. Concerning the book, its fame is sufficient to make clear how nicely written it is. That is definitely  the kind of book that make me really enjoy the english language.
4	1350086400	:)Good book!I love the book. She is an excellent writer. I love ALL her books. They are fun to read, and very addictive!
5	1349827200	I had never read this book but always heard about it....loved it,great exppression on the turmoils of the human heart and people in general.
5	1349740800	If you are looking for the classic love story with the right amount of action, drama, romance and a heroine that draws you in, this is the story for u.
5	1349740800	Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful classic novel. It is the captivating story of two people almost losing the opportunity of finding happiness together by being proud and making incorrect assumptions about each other through the influences of others. The era is one of a leisurely life spent in rambling homes, going to balls and seeking romance. He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well. Throughout the book, the author is so clever in getting the reader to understand the good and bad tension that exists between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett.  It's the kind of book you can't put down when you're reading it and the kind that can be read over and over again.
5	1349654400	Paid less than $200 to use as no-contract phone. This is my first smartphone, and it turned out to be a perfect choice in combination with PagePlus Wireless, which uses the Verizon network.  You can get by with spending as little as $80/year for voice, text, data this way. I am totally satisfied with my choice of this phone.
5	1349481600	This is a wonderful classic, I have renewed my acquaintance with the Bennet family and friends. One irritating factor in the text was the use of -- instead of the county names, which was somewhat annoying. I presume this was due to a lack of precise editing. I would thoroughly recommend the novel to anyone who likes a timeless good read.
5	1349481600	I have read and re-read Pride and Prejudice many times and never failed to be moved by the beauty of the language. In myView it is one of the finest books in the English language
5	1349481600	THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS BOOK BEING A CLASSIC. IT IS A CHARACTER STUDY PAR EXCELLENCE!!!!EVEN THOUGH THE HABITS AND MORES OF 18 CENTURY ENGLAND WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OURS, THE HUMANITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME.THE TITLE TELLS THE STORY---2 PEOPLE EACH DENOTING THE CHARACTER TRAITS GIVEN THEM IN THE TITLE--AND HOW THEY FINALLY COME TO A MEETING OF THE MIND AND HEART.THIS BOOK IS TO BE ENJOYED MANY TIMES OVER!!!
5	1348704000	Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful work.  It is actually quite hilarious at times, especially when looking at it through the lens of today.  A good read for all!
3	1348704000	The Bennet sisters Elizabeth and Jane are of age to court and find a spouse.  Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.This book is suppose to be humorous.  I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along.  In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth.  I don't get it.  I wish I did.  I wanted to like this so much more than I did.  All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip.  It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing.  I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book.  Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty.  I only thought it to be okay maybe a little less than that.
5	1348617600	The reading experience was pleasurable due to the contrast between black text and white page background. I would have loved to see illustrations though.
5	1348444800	No matter how many times i read this book i always find more that i love about it! darcy and elizabeth are a most amazing couple, they dont make them like that any more!
1	1348444800	Not my type of book. I read it all tho. But would not purchase it or a similiar one again.
5	1348358400	Jane Austen is a must read for all generations. Pride and Prejudice is one of her greatest stories. A classic story to be read over and over.
5	1348272000	I have always loved Pride and Prejudice. It is a stroy I read over and over every few years. There are so many similarities to life everywhere and how pride and prejudice could get in the way of happiness if we let it. I love that I can now read it on my kindle as well!
1	1348185600	I did not read the book.    I want this book off my kindle. I am getting  very angry. very angry.
5	1348185600	Very well written British literature. Example of the life and times during this period, giving an insight of day to day living
5	1347926400	There is nothing to say about "Pride and Prejudice" that most readers don't already know. It is a brilliant novel from the pen of Jane Austen, and therefore should be read be every intelligent person. I already had a copy or two of the book, as well as countless film versions, but I needed a large print edition since I'm now old. And it's nice to be able to read the book without my glasses again. So if you're in your 40s and love this book, your home library or bedside table needs this large print edition of it.
5	1347580800	love this book i keep reading it over and over again love jane austen it depicts the trials and tribulations of finding love in those ages
5	1347580800	I love this book and read it every couple years, now I have it at my fingertips, with the kindle app.
5	1347235200	A wonderful tale that shows the importance of upbringing , character and morality.  Ms. Bennet deals with the issues central to life in the 19th century; manners, education and marriage.  Ms. Bennet and Mr. Darcy allow us to hope that there is hope through love and understanding.
5	1346976000	How can one describe Pride and Prejudice in a few words? Impossible. This is one of the best novels in the English language, both for style and content. The various movies and TV editions, though excellent and immensely entertaining, do not do the novel justice. All I can say is "Read it."
5	1346976000	I cna't believe that I hadn't read this before.  I really enjoyed it.  I will be reading more Jane Austin in the future.
3	1346976000	If you are looking for an unabridged version of the book this is most certainly not it. Looks like someone has typed out the dialogue exchanges from the BBC series and filled in their own interpretation of the feelings at times.
4	1346889600	Good story but quite difficult to read. The dialect seems archaic and hard to follow many times. If one can interpret the dialect, the story is charming.
5	1346889600	Watched the pbs version of the book then watched the new version of the movie, so I figured I better read the book.  The book keeps you entertained as you picture each chapter in your head.  Normally when I watch a movie before a book I get disappointed when I get around to reading it, but in this case the book gives a lot of depth to the characters, which makes it one of the few books turned into movies where I would recommend watching the movie first.
5	1346889600	My daughter and I both read this book. She really enjoyed it, more than the movie. I also enjoyed the book, very much.
5	1346889600	This book is one of my favorites.  I have re-read this book at least 12 times.  It is a book that never gets old and is great for reading while on vacation.
5	1346889600	I did read this book in school (many years ago) and had forgotten much about the book.  How important family is and what we in today's world take for granted, love and family.
5	1346889600	The print of this book is attractive as is the simple cover.  The size is standard but handy so I can put it in a tote or bookbag and have it ready for access whenever I  have a spare moment.  So far it is sturdy and doesn't look dog-eared even when it's been toted many places.
4	1346889600	This is the first classic that I have ever read! I think that it was a great first choice to start reading these sort of novels.Recommended! :)
5	1346889600	One of the best reads this summer.  Great writing, story brings you back in time when people actually had manners.
5	1346803200	It's just one of the best book I've ever read! Love it! And the movies are great too. Strongly recommended to read.
2	1346630400	This has not survived the test of time. While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies.
5	1345420800	This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it.
5	1344124800	Pride and Prejudice is a complete masterpiece. I was very disappointed at myself for not reading it sooner. I will recommend this book to anyone who loves reading. Everyone should read this at-least once.
5	1330992000	We had a problem with condensation on the inside of our large windows.  There were puddles on the windowsills.  We thought rain was leaking in, but when we called a contractor to fix the windows, he told us it was condensation.  Using the dehumidifier and making sure all rooms were getting heat from the furnace  (we had closed some off for the winter) the moisture problem was corrected very quickly and a bleach wash on the windowsills and frames got rid of the mold that was starting to grow there.
3	1323216000	I bought these just so I could plug them into my Kindle Fire and try out its audio input using the headset's microphone (it works!). Functionally, it works as represented, and it fulfills my initial requirements well (particularly the low price).But then I tried them with my iPod Touch. I find that like the remote capabilities so much that I want to use this instead of the stock earbuds it came with. However, the wires are thin and tend to tangle. I don't think it is going to last very long.This is almost certainly not really made by Apple, though it is represented as such here. Apple's headsets have thicker wire or insulation and are more tangle resistant.In retrospect, I wish I'd bought the real thing (or something of equivalent quality), and not spent $5 on a cheaper reproduction. True, I could buy 4 or 5 of these for the price of the Apple equivalent, but I will probably not enjoy the experience of using them as much.
5	1257638400	I dont know how some women do it with other diet pills.  I'm 30 years old and I've tried close to 50 different diet pills and gimmicks over my adult life.  The Japanese 2 a day diet pills have done what nothing else has!  I am able to eat when I decide...not when I want to pig out.  My appetite is completely controlled and I don't have cravings.  So I can eat healthy and not feel like I'm missing anything!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
