4	1405987200	Touching.  Beautifully written.
5	1405900800	Love this book!!  Just a great story that was truly enjoyable.
5	1405468800	I really enjoyed this book. Anyone who has lost a child can relate to Isabella and Hannah. You will always wonder who that child would have become. As much as I didn't want this story to end, I could not put it down. I like not knowing how their story wouldend, because it was hard to see what was coming next. this is a good book to read.
5	1405468800	A wonderful story, quick read, and grips your emotions throughout. Had me weeping at the end.
4	1405382400	Such interesting reading about something I knew so very little about. Very engaging storyline.
5	1405296000	This is a very interesting novel with a moral dilemma that the reader varies from one side to the other throughout the book. Several people and I have discussed the implications on both sides. We all agreed that we enjoyed the read. Highly recommend.
4	1405209600	Very interesting book.
5	1405209600	I don't want to give anything away. But I know the choice Izzy makes about the baby is one I might have made. Right or wrong, she followed her heart, not her head. And who among us has not done that at some point in their life? A wonderful first book. I look forward to more by Ms. Stedman.
4	1405209600	Love how thus book paints the story if a man, and his family. His wins and losses. His thoughts, feelings, and emotions.
4	1405209600	I wasn't sure I would like it from the description but, the narration pulls you in.  Well told.
4	1405123200	Still reading...seems good so far
5	1405123200	Beautifully written.  The mystery was intriguing  and the characters tugged at your heart strings.
5	1405123200	Excellent read. Slow at the beginning, but definitely worth reading.
5	1405036800	Well written.  You could feel the emotions of each character.  Wish they could all live together in a perfect world.
5	1405036800	excellent
5	1405036800	What an original story. Heartbreaking and joyful and full of love, as well as anger, and forgiveness. It's a story I'll be thinking about for a long time to come.
3	1405036800	The story starts off a little slowly but picks up.  The character development is interesting but a little weak except for the two major characters.  All in all, an enjoyable read.
5	1405036800	A very thought provoking, memorable story which I would highly recommend.
5	1404950400	I had previously abandoned this book in the first two chapters. I am so glad a friend suggested I revisit it and push through! The character, setting, and plot development are so rich! Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen next, whammo-a new twist! I LOVED this book.
5	1404950400	Is a good book, good story, bit the back and for is a little be confusing sometimes. I like it
5	1404950400	One of my favorite books ever- no story is ever just one way.....lovely, heart-wrenching, alive, real, true, and fair.  A remarkable work
5	1404950400	Loved this book and recommend it to all my friends who haven't read it already.
4	1404950400	Unexpected, emotional, well written story. Definitely worth the read, but be sure to have the tissues ready.  I recommend reading the novel
3	1404864000	Well written, although at times I found myself wanting to speed things along. It's picks up about two-thirds in. I can think of a few ways I would have changed it to heighten the excitement, but overall it was a good read.
5	1404864000	Awsome read with a heartbreaking ending.
5	1404864000	This book told a great story in the most beautiful way. It's a great summer read. I love a book that makes me think! This one did just that. What would you do?
4	1404864000	Very touching and very sad. The struggle between right and the need to protect a loved one. So hard, so heartbreaking.
1	1404864000	I very much liked the idea for this story;the young man traumatized by war who seeks the peace of a lonely island and the structure of important work as a lighthouse keeper,but that's pretty much where it ends. Character development is practically non existent. We have no idea for example ,what kind of person Isabel is before she meets Tom and what would lead her to choose the lonely life of a lighthouse keeper's wife. Though it is common for women who have had multiple miscarriages to become depressed,there is not enough development of her character for us to understand how she can turn on her husband the way she does.The  omniscient narrator is constantly telling what people feel but she does not allow those feelings to be shown by action. I,ve heard that there is a film being made.It's quite possible that it will be better than the book.  To sum up, this story had a lot of potential, but the author turned it into a melodrama.
5	1404864000	Ms. Steadman, I applaud you. Makes me live in the moment and feel your inspiration. Thanks for your research and love for your country.
5	1404864000	A unique story about a life you didn't know existed.  Could not put it down!
4	1404864000	this was a sad, different, strange and good book.. I didn't love the ending but loved the book
5	1404777600	Great book.
3	1404777600	It's been too long. I can't leave a review
4	1404777600	Intriguing, though provoking
5	1404777600	Very well written, well developed characters, good story line, sad in parts, but very good reading.
5	1404777600	Bestbook I've read in along time
4	1404777600	What would you do to make your loved one's dream come true?  This beautifully crafted story make you wonder  how far you would go, and what mistakes you might make in the name of love.
5	1404777600	A beautiful story about undying love, love lost and found again and again. I could not put this book down and didn't want to. It grabs you instantly and doesn't let go. You get pulled into the depths of each character. More books should be of this high quality
4	1404777600	I thought it was a very good story.  It didn't go in the direction I thought it was going, that disappointed me.  In talking to other people about the story it was interesting to see where their sympathy was.
3	1404777600	Many twists and turns.  Kept me wanting to find out more.  I tried to guess how it was going to turn out, and I was not disapponted.
5	1404691200	Great read.
5	1404691200	Great book  - very emotional story with intrigue, suspense and love.  A friend thought it read like a soap opera - in some ways yes, but an incredible tribute to a mother's love.  Gave a powerful sense of what it is like to live on a desolate island and be a light keeper.  Good character development.
5	1404691200	Beautiful story beautifully written of the dilemmas found in relationships when there sadly is no satisfactory answer.
4	1404691200	A very interesting story.  Really makes you stop and think about life.
5	1404691200	Absolutely riveting!  What a read it was.  The characters are delightful -  through happiness and sorrow just as if you were right there.
5	1404691200	Recommended by several friends and did not disappoint. Beautifully written describing the dilemma of choosing between two unwanted options.
4	1404691200	Great read
5	1404691200	This is a fabulous book! It has been a while since I read a book that I could hardly put down, and this one fits the bill - well worth the read and a great story.
5	1404691200	I liked this book very much
5	1404604800	Loved it, great story.
5	1404604800	What a wonderful book!  So much happens and it makes you wonder how you would have handled it. How a simple act can affect so many people.
4	1404604800	No review that is it
5	1404604800	Loved the story read for book club
5	1404604800	Great development of characters, mystery and intrigue. Enjoyed every moment, didn't want it to end.  Highly recommend this well-written story!
4	1404604800	I thought the book was great. It keeps your interest in it just wondering what will happen next and just to see how it will end.
5	1404518400	The story shows how death can bring life back to oneself.  The brave couple who lived, loved and lost on the tiny island, Janus.  How the love they had for a baby that wasn't there's grows.  Reading the book can bring back memories of your own childhood.  Highly recommend this book for young moms and grandmothers!
5	1404518400	This story grabbed me from the beginning and held me through to the very end.
4	1404518400	Well written. Good character development
4	1404518400	Beautifully written.  Compelling story with believable characters. Set against the ocean and natural images and forces that interact with the people who live in that setting.
4	1404518400	At the end of this book I was stunned to learn this was M.L. Stedman's first novel.  The writing is exquisite and the story is both heartbreaking and enlightening. I hope you enjoy this read as much as I did!
5	1404518400	A sad story, wonderfully told. You feel like you're right there with the characters.
3	1404518400	Never quite stirred the soul.  Hannah's decision was glossed over.  Isabel and Tom's fate was assumed to be ok with no real explanation.
5	1404518400	I was drawn into this story, could not stop reading. The author's writing pulled you into each character's emotions. EXCELLENT read!
3	1404432000	This was a little far-fetched and slow a few times but all-in-all it was a good read.  I didn't feel close to the characters, I didn't feel I got to know them well, but I did keep reading and was happy that I did.  I don't recap the story in my reviews as I don't feel that someone reading my review is looking for a book report.  If you need to know what the book is about, read the description.  But my opinion of this story is that it was worth the time.  I can't say that I loved it or give it five stars, but it was interesting getting to know characters that I would never, in a thousand years, come across in my own personal life. I would have liked to have known them a little better though because I enjoy reading how other people live and lived in times past.  I asked myself when I finished this book if it was time well spent and I have to say YES it was. I would recommend this book to you.
5	1404432000	I Loved this book! It's very well written and easy to follow. Your invested in the characters right from the beginning. I never knew exactly where the story was gonna go and how it could possibly work out for Tom and Izzy. You end up seeing both sides and don't know who to root for. It surprised me at the end and I finished it feeling thankful for true love in all lots forms. It's gonna be one of my favorite all time books!
5	1404432000	Im am an old tough guy and this brought tears to me eyes
5	1404432000	THE STORY WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND MOVED A LONG WELL.  IT WAS INTERESTING FROM BEGINNING TO THE END.  I REALLY ENJOYED IT.
3	1404432000	A good plot, but I think it fails to draw the reader fully into the story. I was disappointed by the ending and felt that the story would have a better impact if the author had stopped when Tom was released leaving the readers to draft their own ending. I felt like I was reading a foreign story and unlike many other debut novels it never touched me personally. Debut novels often are based on a single theme. In Memory Keeper's daughter a single wrong decision tears the family apart but you are constantly empathizing with all the parties. In The Art Forger a single decision reels the protagonist to a perilous path and we are with her all the way. In The Yellow Bird we are horrified by the evils of war and wonder what cost the young hero would have to pay. But all through the book we are arm in arm with the protagonist. In American Dervish a young boy slips up and we suffer with him and with the victim for this solitary slip. I  found this element missing in this book. Other debut novels like The Kite Runner draws you in with the culture of a far away land and you are rooting for the underdog even if the end entails losses. This element too is missing in this book. None the less, it is an easy read summer story with an interesting plot. I enjoyed reading it but I was left wondering if they think differently &#34;down under?&#34;
1	1404432000	This was a wonderful book and very well written.  Stedman kept me wondering about the next chapter.  I would give it 5 stars
5	1404432000	Great story! Kept my interest from the beginning. Great character development.
4	1404345600	This is a wll written thoughtful book that was a pleasure to read and hard to put down.  It's a great read for vacation
5	1404345600	The ultimate ethical dilemma.  Chills and thrills and you want to read every sentence, to the very last word.
5	1404345600	Great summer reading!
4	1404345600	I liked the storyline and waited eagerly for it to unfold.  It was well told and believable.  I liked the image of the lighthouse and Janus and the relationship s of all the people.  I liked the thoughts about forgiveness
3	1404345600	I don't remember when I first heard about this book, but I knew right away I wanted to read it, so I searched and finally found a copy. However, it still took me a while to finally get around to reading it, and even when I started it the first time, I ended up putting it down after a bit, though I don't know why. I decided it was time to finally pick it back up and I really enjoyed it!This book was pretty different from anything I've read before. I haven't read many stories set in Australia, nor have I read much from that time period. Tom and Isabel live together out on a lighthouse island, just the two of them. They only have contact with others every three months when a ship brings them supplies, or when they get leave and stay on the mainland every so often. Isabel has had two miscarriages and one stillbirth and is having a very hard time moving on. But then a baby in a boat, with a deceased man, wash up on shore and Tom and Isabel decide to raise the child as their own, thinking she doesn't have any parents left. But their choice will later come to haunt them and they have to decide what's right and what's wrong.Tom and Isabel are well-written characters and I really enjoyed reading about their life at the lighthouse. Funny enough, my bookmark was an ocean view with a lighthouse on it, which I didn't realize until I just about finished the book (: The book was really well written, and my heart ached for Isabel each time she realized she had a miscarriage, or found out the baby was stillborn. I have no idea how anyone copes with that kind of loss and I only hope that I never have to!I wasn't really sure how this story would turn out. Do Tom and Isabel keep Lucy forever? Do they report her to authorities? I couldn't figure it out, but once things started unraveling, I was happy with it; either way, it would have been a sad, tough decision to make, but I think what happened in the book was the best outcome.Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com
4	1404345600	Have your hankie ready.
4	1404259200	See my good review on Goodreads. It seems some loved it, others did not care for it. Personally, I enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't want to put down the book. I loved how the story developed as well as how the characters developed. I had great admiration and empathy for Tom and felt very sad for Isabel. It was an emotional book at the end. A good thought provoking novel.
4	1404259200	This was a book for the bereaved mother book club. We have all lost babies and found this to be a good read with so many options for discussion.
5	1404259200	A wonderfully written tearjerker! Love the plot & roller coaster storyline. Lots of twists and turns to create a romance & love story
5	1404259200	I found this story to be really interesting and hard to put down because I was eager to know what was going to happen next.
4	1404259200	Great book although if it had ended 10 pages sooner, it would have been even better!
5	1404172800	This book grabbed my interest from the beginning and did not let it go. The characters were warm and believable. The situation was eerily substantiated and the ending did not disappoint. This book is simply not just a &#34;chick book&#34; and will grab men as well as the main character's plight will hit home with many. Happy reading!
2	1404172800	Obviously a first book. Easy read but a tear-jerker. Characters not well developed in general so no great attachment or understanding as to who they really were. I found the main character with unbelievable behaviors.
5	1404172800	Kept my interest until the end.
5	1404172800	Kept me on pins and needles for the outcome...An unusual story where I was caught up and hoping for both ladies to get their wish.Well done with a satisfying ending.
5	1404172800	Intense and riveting.  Beautiful characters.  Description of scenery was so real I could feel the moisture of the ocean and taste the salt air.
5	1404172800	This is another good read for book clubs.  Lots of food for thought
5	1404172800	This was a great read! The plot line grabs you and you can't put this book down until you know how it all ends.  Heartbreaking but beautifully written. I felt like I was there and only wish it were longer.
4	1404086400	I thought the book started a little slow, but once it got going I couldn't put it down. You feel so much for each character it's unbelievable.
2	1404086400	I rarely abandon novels I've started but I had to give up on this one.  The characters--particularly Isabel--were caricatures.  The relationship between the main characters was not the least bit credible.  The writing and imagery it created were nice which is why this got 2 stars from me rather than one, but I'm utterly baffled by the praise this book has received.
5	1404086400	I really did not think I would like this book.  The story line was quite disturbing. A baby washes up on shore of a lighthouse island and the keeper and his wife decide to keep the child. This is 1926 and the reasoning is sound BUT...  Of course there is so much more to the story and to tell anymore would ruin the ride.  It is a very well written, fast paced book. The characters are well drawn and you find something to like in all of them.  The last half of the book was a real page turner.  This is perfect for the beach or a quiet read on a rainy day.
5	1404086400	Very moving and well-written.  Characters are so real!
5	1404086400	Very touching story that reveals the depths of what it is to be human. Strong and weak, wise and foolish, loving and whatever is it's opposite.  The author has put into words what is often inexpressible.
4	1404086400	I enjoyed this novel very much. The tangle of moral and ethical issues developed from the first page on and became heart wrenching as the story evolved. The conclusion was inevitable, necessary and unforgettable.
4	1404086400	An excellent read!! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it was slow to get into.
4	1404086400	Good story. Suspenseful and it kept you reading to see how the ending is.  The last one forth of the book seemed to move slowly.
4	1404000000	If you like books about Australia, you'll like this.  Great details about a life and time gone by.  A bittersweet story about love betwen and husband and wife and love of a child.  The first two parts were better than the third in my opinion, but still a good read.
5	1404000000	The author reveals so clearly the moral dilemmas created by an impulsive decision.  You understand so sadly and inevitably the complex decisions and emotions of each character.  A vey good book
3	1404000000	The book started off slower than I would have liked. Overall, I wasn't amazed or disappointed. The ending was probably the most well written part because I actually had a tear come to my eye at the outcome.
5	1404000000	A well written story with strong characters ,and focus on making good decisions even though difficult . I would read it again and recommend it highly!!
4	1404000000	The book is beautifully written, and the characters were well-drawn.  They all had personal turmoils, and it was difficult to find a happy ending for any of the characters without hurting.the others.  However,this was an enjoyable read.
5	1404000000	What a beautiful book. This is a story both joyous and sad which leaves your heart wrapped in sweetness. You suffer along with all the characters and then experience redemption.
4	1403913600	Loved it! Would recommend this book to anyone. It is a fast, easy read and a wonderfully romantic book about how much you can love a child, unconditionally.
3	1403913600	I would give The Light Between Oceans a 3 star rating- especially as a first book by the author. It definitely kept my interest throughout and I would recommend. I kept wondering about the isolating life of a light house &#34;keeper&#34; and how  easily the truth could be blurred in this isolation! Also enjoyed learning about the upkeep of the lighthouse and the importance of keeping the light going/beaming.
4	1403913600	I enjoyed the interplay in the ethical question -- doing what is right cannot always be an easy or clear choice.  The author handled that complexity well.
5	1403913600	This was a wonderful story to read. An amazing life of two people and how every life touches lives of people and the decisions we make.
4	1403913600	The baby is the light, and the mothers are the oceans.  I can not imagine the horror of losing a child, and this story tells of the struggle of two mothers who endure such a loss.
5	1403913600	Stedman has created a beautiful novel -skillfully weaving storyline and emotions. Her story captivates; how quickly we all learn the fine line between right and wrong; what feels right and what is right; and how one person's actions affect others lives. A wonderful read!!
5	1403913600	The kind of book that you want to start reading all over again once you have finished it!  Looking forward to more work from this author.  This was a carefully thought out story with wonderful character development.  I NEVER got bored!
5	1403827200	Such a good read and well written.Having it set in the land down under makes it all the more interesting
3	1403827200	I could not get around the moral choice that the main  character made to keep someone else's baby without any attempt to find out if the mother was still alive. The story became even worse when she continued to hide the truth even after she found out who the mother was.If I didn't have to read it for book club, I never would have finished it.
4	1403827200	This is going to be a great discussion novel for our group.  There are so many themes ... "what if ?"
4	1403740800	Great book on the choices one makes when experiencing emotional heartbreak.  The true definition of love in its many forms
5	1403740800	The writers technique and unusual Australian expressions added a great deal of interest. Every page was a joy to read.
3	1403740800	Not really my genre but it hooked me... I loved the story and the writing was very good. Enjoyed learning about the science of lighthouse upkeep. After the discovery the novel becomes a real page turner; will he or won't he? well she or won't she? Very fast paced ending. Definitely worth reading
4	1403740800	The plot was very different compared to any book I've read. I enjoyed it tremendously. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down.
5	1403740800	I was engaged with the characters the whole time.  The author does a fabulous job of building characters that feel genuine and human.  She is also really good at foreshadowing.  As a writer, I learned so much from her craft.  As a reader, I fell in love with the story.  A must read!
5	1403740800	From beginning to end, and everything in between oceans, this is a novel that traverses the depths of human heartache and grief as well as forgiveness, hope, and love in such a way that every reader will ponder right and wrong.
4	1403740800	Poignant story of two &#34;mothers&#34; and the husband caught in the middle! Good read! I would recommend it for a summer read!
5	1403740800	I wanted some summer reading, and ended up with such a wonderful, heart felt story.  I am so glad to have read this book!
4	1403740800	With fabulous descriptive phrases, &#34;a handkerchief of green&#34;, it is easy to see early twentieth century Australia and feel post WWI losses.  The author so involves the reader in each character that we understand the choices made, good and bad, and are anxious to find the resolution for each character.  it is a great read!
5	1403654400	This was a great book.  I bought it for gifts for three friends and they all enjoyed it also.  It kept my interest, in fact I didn't want to put it down.
2	1403654400	Too Long
5	1403654400	A story of choices and how our lives are shaped by them. A wonderful story of how people have to learn to put their past, however hurtful, behind them in order to move on.
5	1403654400	Such beautiful images written so well. Having visited eastern Australia being able to visit the west through this book was wonderful
5	1403568000	This book had surprising twists that made one consider what they would do in similar situations. Not entirely easy as the &#34;right&#34; thing had adverse repercussions that could prove disastrous.
5	1403568000	I enjoyed the book.  It reminded me of 'Jodi Picoult' dilemma with the circumstances blurring the lines of right and wrong.
5	1403568000	This an exquisitely written story of right and wrong and love depicted against a beautifully wrought background.  I couldn't help but engage with the characters! I highly recommend this book.
3	1403568000	This book was a great book club book Although a bit predicable.The ending was good.  A good summer beach book.
3	1403568000	The Light Between Oceans is a good story about a young couple and their lives in a remote place going a necessary job during a hard time.  I particularly liked the description of the area, the light and their day to day lives.  I really enjoy the sea, and I have been into lighthouses, but never considered the early lightkeepers.
5	1403568000	Beautiful writing! Wonderful story! Easy summer read! Great discussion book for book clubs! I highly recommend The Light Between Oceans.
5	1403568000	I did not care for it.  It seemed too far fetched for me.  I was interested in how the sauthor summed it all up which seemed appropriate.
4	1403481600	A moving portrayal of love mingled with the scars of world war 1 and the premature loss of children , well written prose.
4	1403481600	Loved this book. The author presented major life decisions in a way that showed things aren't just black and white.  The character development was very good, the reader 'knew' the characters and could identify with them.  It made for a great discussion in our group; how we would react, think or do as each of the characters involved.
5	1403481600	My book club choice this month.  Some sadness, some mystery, lots of love, plenty of intrigue, and lots of loyalty between characters.  I loved it, and will pass it on to other reader friends.  Bittersweet ending made me cry crocodile tears.
5	1403481600	I liked learning about light house life.  I cared about the characters.  I felt the complexity of the decisions thAt they made.  And felt their pain.  Good story, well written human morality story.
5	1403481600	Loved the lighthouse life so lonely back and forth of goings on of the main city. Background of life in 1900's
4	1403395200	This is a wonderful book that evoked so many emotions. Have the tissues ready.Life is too short to hate those that wrong us.
5	1403395200	This book really gives the reader a moral choice.  Whose decision is the one you would have done?  Do you respect the characters for their decision?
4	1403395200	Well written and beautiful, although somewhat fantastical at times.  It is an unusual confluence of circumstances, that embodies the complexity of grief.
5	1403395200	My very favorite story. It kepte reading and hung on inu mind for days. I wanted to talk about it. Loved it
5	1403395200	I've never read a story so original and so well-written, yet so heartbreaking. I couldn't stop reading. Highly recommend this.
5	1403395200	A moving, touching story of love and commitment.  The author's skill creates vivid scenes with the reader in the midst.
5	1403395200	I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.  I was able to read it in several short periods and that allowed me to think a lot more about what I had read and the times in my life I had a similar dilemma with no clear cut right or wrong!
5	1403395200	A great book about love with a heartfelt ending. A very clean book, also. A great book for couples to read
5	1403395200	The book was well written and kept my attention well into the nights of a vacation.  The descriptions of the places, especially Janus Island and the lighthouse were so vivid.  The characters were so very real...flawed like all of us.  So much joy, so much sorrow, so much suffering.  I knew from the moment the dead man and the baby in the boat weren't reported that the story would turn bad, but I had no idea what would happen or when.  Some lessons from the book...don't lie ( or don't fail to tell the truth), don't assume anything, don't let personal happiness interfere with your sense of duty.
5	1403308800	I enjoy variety in writing styles.This story was captivating to me.The struggle facing the characters was complex and forced the reader to search his or her own soul along the way for how one would most likely behave in each situation.I thought the characters were well developed.
4	1403308800	A truly good story. I loved the descriptions of the sea and life on the lighthouse site. Enjoyed the good writing. At one point I thought it was a little slow but then picked up the pace again. The characters were well defined and the conflict between them was easy to feel.
5	1403308800	This is exactly what my husband had been looking for in a summer, gardening hat! He can even wear it to town!
5	1403308800	This book was the catalyst that sparked a two hour discussion at my book club. The story of a moral dilemma was written with just the right amounts of sympathy and perplexity. No one character's pain  overshadows  the pain of another's. Heartbreak is unavoidable as difficult decisions are made. Learning to live with one's past, knowing it cannot be changed, but finding a way to make peace within one's self, is a theme that will resonate with the reader of this compelling novel. I expect to read more stories by M. L. Steadman. She has crafted a novel that will definitelyhave her readers wanting more.
5	1403308800	I had to keep reading . Makes you think about choices we make in life. Had to see how it would end.
4	1403308800	loved the settings and descriptions. Very emotional in places. Heartwarming in the end. I could see this as a movie, very enjoyable.
5	1403308800	Makes one think about alternatives.  What would I do in a similiar situation.  No easy answers to the moral questions.
3	1403308800	Slow getting going but captivating as I got into the story. I would recommend it to book clubs and to my friends.
4	1403308800	This was a great, dramatic, emotional page turner.  I think anyone who is a mother or who has tried but been unable to have children would be particularly moved by this book.
5	1403222400	This was a great surprise ending. It keeps you wanting more. I found it hard to put the book down. Lots of twists at the end.
4	1403222400	My book club read this book and we all really enjoyed it plus everyone actually read it! That is huge.
5	1403222400	It's hard to read this book at times. You are drawn in by the wonderful images portrayed by the author but repelled by the emotional tug-of-war between the two mothers. I wanted to stop reading because it was so tense in parts but I couldn't put it down because of the compelling characters. If every novel I've read were this compelling I might be forced to stop reading from exhaustion. But in the end the novel is about life. We have no choice but to live it the best we can hoping we have no regrets at the end. For this lesson I am most grateful to the author.
1	1403222400	The cover sounded great- light keeper and wife in middle of nowhere find baby. Only problem that the baby didn't happen until 3/4 of the book had to be gone through. Ending was good, but too much boring detail led up to the good part.
4	1403222400	Really enjoyed this book, good for travel or the beach; it will keep you turning pages, heartfelt, poignant, compelling and tragic.
5	1403222400	A great tail of love and pain in the lives intertwined by longing of a child which was found and the child returned
5	1403222400	It is a wonderful book. Grips you right from the start.  You come to really care about the characters. I would recommend it to all I know.  I will read another book by this author.
5	1403136000	This book was recommended to me by a friend. I usually do not read fiction, but this book was worth my time.
5	1403136000	Superb -- couldn't put it down. Highly entertaining but can't decide if I like the ending- hmm! Great summer read!
4	1403136000	After the first 50 pages the outcome of the book was very predictable, but nonetheless it was well written, good imagery with a bitter sweet ending. A good airplane book.
5	1403136000	I enjoyed this story, I wanted the end to be better but there really was no easy answer on who gots the girl.
5	1403136000	The book transported you to another place an time. I love that! And, the characters were well developed and likable. The moral conundrum was interesting and there was great suspense for the final outcome.
4	1403136000	This book is wonderful. I had a bit of a time getting into it but once I decided to give it a go, it drew me into the Shelbourne family characters and wouldn't let go. I found myself shaking my head at times and nodding in agreement with them. I have experienced the loss of more than one pregnancy so this story hit close to home. This is a wonderful story about love, loss, joy, revenge, forgiveness. Read it! You won't be disappointed.
4	1403136000	Heart wrenching and some of the most achingly accurate descriptions of grief I have come across. Beautifully written, compelling story, memorable characters.
5	1403136000	It is both heartbreaking and yet, full of hope.  I was deeply moved by the story.  Will make a great movie!
5	1403136000	I truly loved this book, loved the characters,and was sorry to see them leave my life.  Lots of twists and turns, but it did end a little too abruptly for me. I felt badly for both the women, and could honestly feel their pain. I also realized that Tom couldn't  live with himself any longer.Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive!
5	1403049600	A beautiful, emotional story. Very skillfully and artistically told. I hope we can expect many more stories from this author.
5	1403049600	Our book club read this and everyone liked it very much.  We discussed the choices made by the characters and how those choices affected their lives.
5	1403049600	Our book club read this for our June selection. Although we haven't yet met and discussed the book, I have to say it was a wonderful story. Made me think about making decisions, about letting your heart over ride your brain.  I highly recommend this book, it's one you'll think about long after you finish it.
5	1403049600	As TS Eliot explained a classic:  TimelyTimeless. Wonderful read!Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a solid, sou,
5	1403049600	I am so sorry there are no more books yet by this author.  I couldn't put it down.  Fast read.
3	1402963200	This bookd starts off very well and is very nicely written - but then I find it getting boreing and feels a little repetative.  I just want to skip some pages and get it over with! sorry!
4	1402963200	Very thought provoking.  Good book club book.  I could sympathize with Isabel but I also felt sorry for Hannah.  Can't say what I would have done if I were in the same spot.  Also, I don't thinkk I could live so isolated in a lighthouse.
5	1402963200	A beautiful love story told with a picturesque background of Australia. Story has a lot of twists and different outcomes, not all of them happy.
5	1402963200	This was a great book. I couldn't put it down! I would definitely recommend it. Great summer read. I have recommended to others.
4	1402963200	I enjoyed the book. The omniscient point of view and characterization are compelling. The story explores the difficulty of determining what is right versus what is wrong.
3	1402876800	This was a book included on our local Book Club list.  I enjoyed and learned from it about lighthouses, the loneliness, the work involved and  the actual workings of the lighthouse.  The story line itself was very good with husband and wife, finding the baby in a boat that washed onshore and the drama that developed from the decisions that were made.  I felt it was a good read.
3	1402876800	this was an amazing book. it was a 5 Star I hated to see the end.  I just wanted to go on & On.  Great!! Well written, great story
5	1402876800	Awesome book where while reading you feel all the emotions of love, warmth, anger and sadness. . Could not put it down.  Hope this new author is working on a second book.
4	1402876800	This book was a recommendation and I usually do not read &#34;book club&#34; books but I am so happy that I did!  This is a great read.  There is enough suspense to keep you interested with the story line that is beneath the story of how being on an island all alone changes two people.  Although they both encounter the same hardships the military training instilled along with the strong desire to always do right may turn this couples greatest joy into their worst night mare.  Great read!
5	1402876800	It was hard to put down. the kind of book where you look for opportunities to read it. i highly recommend it.
3	1402790400	Beautiful descriptive passages of sea and environs.Slow start, rapid contrived ending - good reading in  between.Moral dilemmas, emotional heartbreaks, conscience-cleansing
5	1402790400	Great book. Read it for our book club and all the members really enjoyed it. We were able to have a nice discussion about it.
5	1402790400	How can I say that this is one of the most amazing books that I have read when the premise is about one man and a woman all alone on an island surrounding their days with the tedious task of taking care of a lighthouse? However, the characters are so interesting and amazing in and of themselves that when tragedy strikes, you dont know who to root for. Is it Tom? Steady Tom who has seen enough heartache in life to make sure that one last heart doesnt break into pieces. Or is it Isabel who just wants to love? How about Hannah? A love is ripped from her and years pass and all that is left of her is a shell however, she still cant let go of the feeling that maybe just maybe hope lies within the next day. This book will suck you in and have you turn each page saying to yourself, just one more chapter and I will go to bed, just one more. And in the end, you might agree with what happened and maybe you wont. But one thing is certain, you will love this book.
5	1402790400	This is a deeply moving story of love and loss. It is definitely a sad story from beginning to end but a fantastic read.
4	1402790400	Kept me reading for the outcome. A good plot! Is Janus island a real place in Australia? Intriguing and thought provoking.
5	1402704000	In a world so full of broken families here is a book that opens your heart.  A family torn but in spite of it finds healing.  Many choices and paths in this life we travel, to error is human but to forgive is Devine.  For if we seek it, there is a light to show is the right path!
5	1402704000	A fantastic and imaginative story.  This book really brought me into a new world of possibilties. The point of view was so strong and made the tale truly rich. Great read!
5	1402704000	What a great story! Absolutely loved it and as with any great book I was said when I finished it.
5	1402704000	Author made the story seem real. Kept me reading voraciously till the end and left me wanting more. Believable characters; lovable in all their imperfection.
5	1402704000	Excellent book.  Couldn't put it down. A real page turner!  Recommend it to anyone who who has 48 hours to do nothing but read and sleep...you won't be able to stop reading until you reach the final page.
5	1402704000	Nice book ..... a good , clean read ... will recommend to friends....for gifts, kindle...looking for more by the m l Stedman author
3	1402704000	ENJOYED THIS VERY MUCH. IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY SISTER AND I NORMALLY LIKE THE BOOKS SHE SUGGESTS TO ME.
5	1402617600	Before purchasing a book, I always read the reviews on Amazon, so that I have an idea what to expect, and this really didn't sound like my cup of tea.  However, I bought it, began to read it, and was hooked.  My criteria for a really enjoyable read is, do I think about it and the characters when I'm not reading, and I certainly did, with this one.  The author takes you skillfully from cheering on the characters, Tom and Isabel, hoping they won't be found out, to realizing that there is a bereaved mother involved, as well.  When the truth came out and the child was taken away, you can't help but think how differently it would all be handled today, with batteries of child psychologists involved in the transfer of the child.While the ending might have been just a bit &#34;deus ex machina,&#34; I really can't think of any other way to put this tale to bed with the bitter-sweetness it needed.
4	1402617600	This book had me wanting to read more.  Loved story, ending could have been better, Lucy-Grace returning sooner.Floriana Hall
3	1402617600	this book was very soap operish to me.  You knew it was going to end some kind of badly.  I also don't think it was especially well written.
3	1402617600	Love story set after WWI in Australia.  Many twist and turns throughout the story.  The ending very unexpected.A worthy read.
5	1402617600	Loved the character development. Felt so real to me - nobody intending to hurt another, and yet flawed human nature made a mess of many lives.
5	1402617600	It is a poignant; bittersweet novel about the depth the human capacity to love. Glad I read it. Actually couldn't put it down after I started. highly recommend
4	1402617600	This would be a good book for a book club discussion. It touches on everyone's reaction to the event, be it accepting or rejecting. It makes you make a decision as to what you would do. Good character development too.
5	1402531200	What a wonderful story. It is so very realistic and holds much truth for all who read it. The author made you feel the ocean spray and the very inner turmoil of the characters.
5	1402531200	Highly recommend this book.  I was drawn in from the first page.  I started reading once I boarded the plane and never put it down.
4	1402531200	This is a good read.  Nothing totally out of the ordinary, but kept me turning pages!  The characters inspire understanding.
4	1402531200	Enjoyed this book very much.  Wasn't exactly a page turner, but I did find myself thinking about what could happen next.
5	1402531200	Rarely have I read a book that touched me so deeply.  This is a  beautifully written story of love, loss and redemption.  The central characters, Tom and Isabel, are reflections of human beings at their best and worst when presented with choices that have both gratifying and tragic consequences.  Having recently visited Australia,  I was captivated by the author's description of the land and sea.  I highly recommend this book, and would give more stars if possible.
4	1402444800	A very well written book but extremely sad. There were no real happy moments throughout the book. If you are looking for a cry, it's a good book. If you need a lift, forget it.
5	1402444800	Not my normal genre but the volume of reviews and stars made me give it a try.  I'm so thankful I did. This book will have you taking sides and brings forth emotion only a skilled author can. A must read!!!
3	1402444800	Enjoyable book and easy to read- compelling story but  a bit too predictable...definitely  Still worth it to read though -
5	1402444800	This is normally a book that I wouldn't have thought I'd enjoy but I finished it so fast.  It had me hooked in the first few sentences.  I'd love recommendations of other books like this.
5	1402444800	This is one of the best books I've read in some time. There is a bit of mystery but mostly, it's a timeless story of people and love and terribly difficult decisions. Definitely worth the price!
3	1402358400	I went outside my comfort zone and get this book.  Again, my wife thought it was a good read.  it was a sad read.  it was a complex read.  I am not sure it was a good read.
4	1402358400	Thought the story was interesting and engrossing.  So sad to learn of 3 lost pregnancies and understand why the wife would want to keep the newborn baby with her,  Glad at the end that she should meet the lighthouse keeper!
5	1402358400	I just got back from a trip and I wrote the title and author of this book down for a lot of people. I usually don't read this type of book but I'm really glad I did.
5	1402358400	Ms Stedman has written a wonderful first novel; so wonderful, it's hard to believe its her first. She has honed her character development till it sparkles. The plot is beautifully planned and evolved. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy the time spent between the covers of this book. Good reading!Dr. Linda Lawrence
5	1402358400	A story with an ethical dilemma that draws on the readers empathy for all those concerned.  The characters are well-drawn, beautiful writing, and set in an unusual location.  The last half of the book is especially well-done and I had to keep reading until I finished!
5	1402358400	The story harkens back to an earlier time when values were the generators of our actions. The storyline is amazing and the technique of jumping ahead in the story and then explaining what had taken place to get to this point is amazingly executed over and over. A must read.
3	1402358400	This is such a far-fetched novel.  What woman would like to live that kind of existence--not many!  The idea that the baby was kept had disaster written all over it.  It was difficult to read after that.
5	1402358400	Thru the tears ...truly true...characters and story woven together richly...this one is in my top ten books I have read.
4	1402358400	What would you do? Heartbreaking story of a choice made by a grieving woman affects generations and multiple families.  A very good read.
5	1402272000	Realistic fiction at its finest.  The love that is shown in each of the characters could not be deeper nor understood by those who have not loved.  The descriptive words make for a true picture in the readers minds.Perhaps we need a field trip to each lighthouse as it now stands!
5	1402272000	The book is slow to begin with. I almost threw the towel in after a few chapters glad I kept on.  This book makes you think about - what would you do? Made me cry like a baby at the end. I'm glad I kept reading it.
5	1402272000	A wonderfully crafted novel of two people and their wide reaching effect of their decision on other people.I could not put the book down. This novel is thought provoking in many ways, i.e., do we make decisions on moral basis, or on emotional needs?I highly recommend this book.
5	1402272000	Warning: This book is incredibly  hard to put down! It is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Written in a beautifully poetic language. If you want to be transported to another time and place I recommend reading The Light Between Oceans.
5	1402185600	Our experiences teach us much but the lessons we learn don't always feed our wisdom. This was the basis of this story. Such a basis filled this story with heartfelt suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5	1402185600	It is  beautifully written.  A book that I can't put down,  Sexy without too much.  Romantic.  Would like to recommend.
4	1402185600	very interesting - twist at end..learned about lighthouses and people that inhabited Early Australia - in current news due to lost plane in same area.  Never found yet - and learned in book how dangerous the waters of that part of ocean are.
4	1402185600	Though heart-wrenching, I loved this book. The characters were well-developed and I really connected with them and understood their motives and decision making.
3	1402185600	On interesting story and a great discussion book.  There are descriptions that are wonderful  A sad story of love and loss.
4	1402185600	it was a really great book and i highly recommend itbrought tears to my eyes in the final pages.
5	1402099200	What a delightful read. I never wanted it to end!this is definitely the best book I have read in a very long Time.
4	1402099200	I liked it but it was slow and cliche. I got into the book only after about 70 percent read.
4	1402099200	Gripping story with heartbreaking characters. It made me think about the consequences of the choices we make along the way.
4	1402099200	A well told story about love and the long-term impact of your good and bad decisions. Will make you feel something inside.
5	1402099200	Absolutely riveting from start to finish! Never knowing how all would turn out! Fought back many a tear! A must read!
4	1402099200	Kept me reading from one suspense to next...the story line was good, sometimes seemingly on a bit of a tangent in character description info, but captivating nonetheless.  I kept wanting certain things to transpire... silly me. To do over?  I'd buy book again.  :)
5	1402099200	What a beautiful story.  I gave this book five stars because it was able to bring out all of my emotions as only few books can.  The author has managed to put on paper a story filled with love and pain, and make you feel it to your very core.  So very well written, I can't wait until we discuss it at our next book club meeting.  I feel this should be placed on all book club reading lists.  What was the light?  What were the oceans?  It will be so interesting to hear the different possibilities.  I recommend that everyone read this book, men and women.  This LIGHT will stay with me a long, long time.  I challenge Stedman to write another book as wonderful as this.  I doubt if anyone could.
5	1402012800	I thought it was a very sad book. Filled with so much emotion for all of the characters.  It was also very depressing  so many characters were hurt emotionally. It was well written but I wouldn't read it again
5	1402012800	Very interesting background for that historical period. Good life lessons also. Would highly recommend it for a book club discussion
4	1402012800	Good character and setting development that unravels a story of love, loss, betrayal, forgiveness -- all wrapped up in the intricate workings of a light house in the early 1900s. Nice portrayal of the history and people of the time. Gave me pause for thought well after the final page. I liked the title -- very clever and appropriate.
5	1401926400	It kept my interest all the way through.  Makes you think what you might be capable of given trying circumstances.
5	1401926400	This novel was beautiful and heart wrenching. My heart ached for all of the main characters, and I had a difficult time deciding who should win.
5	1401926400	I love lighthouses - and I really enjoyed this book - it took me to fantastic places and turned sad and grim for awhile - I would highly recommend this book to everyone.
5	1401926400	I was not sure that a story of someone living on a small island with a lighthouse could develop such an interesting story.  The characters involved were very real and the story unfolding had enough twists to keep you turning pages until the end.  Enjoyable read!
5	1401926400	Fantastic story. She's a great writer. If this is her first novel she's destined to be great. I look forward to her future writings.
2	1401926400	i read this book about a week ago and enjoyed the story.  today i could not tell you what it is about--it left me  withno lasting thoughts.
5	1401840000	This a very good book!  I will recommend this book to my newly formed book club.  I can't wait to read more by this author.
5	1401840000	The story is set in the early 1900s after WWI in Australia. It is a vibrant and touching story about a young couple posted to an isolated island where the husband is in charge of the lighthouse. While the particular lighthouse in the book is ficitonal, the author takes great care in recreating the place and time of the book with great authenticity. I read the Kindle edition. With Kindle's upgraded support for Wikipedia I was able to tap on the many unfamiliar references to fauna, flora, and places in Australia and was immediately able to bring up background information to fill out my understanding. A really nice and engaging first book! I highly recommend it.
5	1401753600	Perhaps the best novel I've ever read.  Excellent story and excellent writing from first word to the last.  Sorry to see it end.
4	1401753600	It took a little while to get into it. But I enjoyed it once I did. Definately well written. I was torn as to what was right.
4	1401753600	We'll written & thought provoking. I felt as if I were right there in Janus Island and felt the heartbreak experience by all the characters.
5	1401753600	Very engrossing story in which the character could have chosen different paths. Very well written. I couldn't put it down.
4	1401753600	family. i thought it was a wonderful book a compassionate story orphan children and how some of them feel about their birthmothers.
5	1401753600	I enjoyed this book very much. It was heart-wrenching and well written. My favorite character was Tom because he displayed such strong character in the story. I would recommend this book to my friends.
4	1401753600	Well written, but I walked away not feeling very good about the human condition.  I guess I enjoy my novels more sunshine and roses in the end.
5	1401753600	Wow, again difficult decisions to make and to ask &#34;How would I decide&#34;?  Loved the understanding of a different nation and culture long gone but historical for sure.
5	1401753600	A friend recommended this book to me.  The first I had read by this author, but I found it very well written...it gripped me from the start.  I highly recommend it
5	1401753600	Very interesting story although at times disturbing. Characters were likable despite their faults, well written and an easily read. Interesting.
4	1401667200	Slow in parts but overall enjoyable and wonderful love story. Makes you think about the atrocities of the wars we engage in and the prejudices of those who are not involved.
5	1401667200	Great read.....wonderful insights into Izzy's deep maternal love, Tom's emotional turmoil vis-a-vis his past experiences, his love for Lucy as well as for Izzy and his grasp of needing to do &#34;the right thing&#34;.  Kept me glued through the final pages.
4	1401667200	We had a good discussion with the book group. The rights and wrongs of decisions made by the characters, the losses and how they may have been avoided or resolved in a less harmful way, the needs of the characters and how these influenced their decisions, and many other aspects of this book which fueled a lengthy and interesting dialogue.
5	1401667200	Reminded me of the Biblical story of Solomon saying he would split the baby in two to find the &#34;real&#34; mother. I got completely wrapped up in the story. Amazing first novel!
2	1401667200	The situation is quite interesting, but what the characters end up doing does not really seem believable.  I did not like the ending.  Too predictable
4	1401667200	So much time was spent on the development of the story, which was great! The ending seemed to be rushed. Too many things in too few pages.
5	1401580800	Each character in this book has to live the life they have been dealt.  From all the tragedy comes true love and strength.  A story of choices  May we all make the correct ones in our lives
5	1401580800	Very easy read, well written. Enjoyed every page. I felt each characters excitement, pain and confusion. Will definitely read more from this author in the future.
5	1401580800	Excellent book!  Well thought out plot.  Enjoyable reading!!!  I would definitely recommend this book to friends....  Keep up the good work!
4	1401580800	A remote location and the importance of an ocean lighthouse keeper are essence of this book.  the effects of ones'  childhood, personal challenges  moral obligations are all entwined in this beautifully written story.
5	1401580800	From the first chapter you know there will be consequences from a desperate decision. The fallout when it comes is as bad or worse than you've imagined. Characters are tested. This is everything you could possibly want in a novel exploring what it means to be human. An tremendous accomplishment.
4	1401580800	This book was quite a story. It captured the essence of the Australian frontier life and the isolation of the coastal lighthouses within a gripping human story of love and loss.
5	1401580800	this is a heartbreaking story, very well written, very suspenseful, you will not be able to put it down until you find out what happens with those very loveable people ...
3	1401580800	A lovely story but tedious reading. Too much description. Almost made me lose interest. I kept waiting for something to be happy about
5	1401580800	The lighthouse engrossed my afternoons, Izzy and Tom's lives reminded me of the friends who bore children and lost them. It was a complicated tale and the same time simple, all for the love of a child. Lovely book indeed
5	1401580800	Our book club chose this book and for many different reasons loved it. Characters well developed and very well written!
4	1401494400	This is the second time I read this book.  I am not sure I finished it the first time and almost stopped reading it this time.  I found it a little hard to get into.  But this time I pushed through and was rewarded for doing so.  I completely enjoyed the tension unraveling between the main characters and their own inner lives.  It was beautifully done and, I thought, perfectly balanced for the time and place and the human heart.  Although written for another time and place, it doesn't matter, we haven't changed that much.  Deep inside we always know right from wrong, if we would only listen.
4	1401494400	M.L.S. spins a great tale of life on an isolated island where a light house keeper and his wife have to deal with a daring situation. It's a choice that would be hard for anyone in their shoes. Very well written and extremely solid characters. It held me tight all the way through.
4	1401494400	wow....this was a really heavy book..at first I thought, why did the author write this? But in the end I realized it is a story of morality, personal conscience, and the consequences of our choices.  The story stays with you a long time after finishing the book.
4	1401494400	Enjoyed reading the book and it's characters were very well described.  Ending was good too!Recommend it to those who enjoy reading during the 1900
5	1401494400	Not only is this story a work of art, the story line itself will keep the reader hooked the whole way through.  It was a joy to read this book.
4	1401494400	Good characters. Believable. Hard to put down. Easy read which is good. But it was predictable. I liked it a lot.
4	1401494400	I always finish a book, even if I'm not crazy about it. The writing was beautiful, the descriptive phrases, the love of this family on the lighthouse , was fun to read. It was just too sad for me.
5	1401408000	I liked the lessons of living through a lifetime of trials and tribulations and accepting them with strength and accepting that this is what has made you the person you are. A wonderful story with depth and I felt emotionally attached to the characters in this book. I recommend it highly.
4	1401408000	The novel is most appreciated after reading it. The threads of multiple subjects, characters, history, and universal issues are tightly woven and timeless. In our club some chose to read it twice.
3	1401408000	This is a well written book but it didn't live up to its hype in my opinion. The subject -- biological parents vs adoptive parents -- has just been done so many times.
2	1401408000	Expected a different ending. It was a little disjointed. Character development greatly lacked. Writing was boring. Ended abruptly. Not impressed.
4	1401408000	I wasn't sure I would enjoy reading this book because of the plot line but I did enjoy it immensely.  The author is a wonderful writer who makes you care about the characters in this story.  And make you understand their decisions even if you think they are totally wrong!!  The characters are extremely well developed, the description of the environment on a remote island and all the details about lighthouse keeping were informative and interesting yet not in too much detail to make it boring. I really enjoyed this book.  Easy read and is a great discussion book for book clubs.
5	1401408000	This novel succeeded in creating a believable world which drew you in.  You cared about the characters and followed their stories, watching them change and grow with every action and chapter.
2	1401321600	This was a well rated book so I read it and was very disappointed.  I didn't like the story or the writing.  I will not read anything else by this author because of that.
5	1401321600	Great story line. Moving and touching story about the struggles of a young couple as they face all that life throws at them.
4	1401321600	I would not have believed that this was the first novel for the author.  She gets one involved immediately and one wants to know the next chapter in the lives of the families she presents.  Though I would sometimes criticize a book that reads so easily as not pushing the reader to delve more into the subject this book includes history and geography as well as family relationships that made it particularly interesting to me.
4	1401321600	Enjoyed the book although it took some persistence to get involved.  I stayed with it because a friend had recommended it to me.  Liked the author's literary style and certainly enjoyed the Aussie colloquialisms!
4	1401321600	It was a very thoughtful novel and my book club will be discussing it next week. I have read Jodi Picoult and Chris Bojalian (sp?) novels which are much more detailed in the conflicts. I appreciated that this one touched my heart in a more personal way. I think it would be a very good young adult read. And I hope that it will become an indie movie to touch all of the characters without Hollywood changes and glitz. The setting for  this novel was perfect.
5	1401321600	Couldn't put this book down!!! Loved every second of it. Really makes you feel for every character in the story. Beautifully written!!
5	1401321600	This book presents moral problems that will engage your emotions and make you think.  This was a book club favorite this year!
4	1401321600	Well written book that picks up the pace as it goes. Characters are interesting and complicated enough to be engaging. Author has a little trouble wrapping up the ending, but not so much that the book is ruined. Good descriptions without being overdone - all in all, a good read
5	1401321600	A thought provoking novel. Very well written. I could not put this book down. And it had a complete ending.
4	1401321600	I found this to be a mesmerizing story&#8230;.a story of love and doing what is right.  I could not put the book down.  There was no real happy ending. Someone was bound to be hurt.  This would make a great book club read.
4	1401321600	Kept you reading and wanting to see how it would finally end. The author used very descriptive language and many colloquialisms of the area to get a better feel of the characters.
5	1401321600	What a story...lots to ponder over.  It is a book that stays with you for a long time.  I highly recommend it.
4	1401235200	I rated this a 4 (more like a 4-1/2 as I found it started out on the slow side.  However, was glad I stuck with it as itpicked up momentum in the last half.  Then I found it was difficult to put it down as there was a great deal ofsuspence and I really enjoyed it.
5	1401235200	Surprised to find such an intricately written, morality challenging and wise first novel.  So lovingly wrought so that I can see this remote lighthouse on this island between two oceans in great detail.
5	1401235200	What a tragic, gut wrenching story! All the ways love presents itself, morphs, grows, shrinks, and grows again. Let me dry my eyes and find a happier story
5	1401235200	Wonderful book by a new author.  Cannot wait for more!  Loved the characters in this Novel, brought to life with detailed imaginative description.  I felt like I was there, feeling all the deep emotions.  Feeling and smelling the sea as  I read, could not stop reading, even to eat!  Highly recommend this page turner!
2	1401148800	My review is not intended to give a synopsis of what this book is about, that&#8217;s spelled out int the &#8220;Book Description&#8221;. I&#8217;m interested in whether or not to recommend this book to other readers. That being stated, I will impart my review:&#8220;A cluster of old graves remembered a shipwreck. . .&#8221; and &#8220;The baby turned to him with wide eyes, drinking in his glance.&#8221; are typical metaphors used in this book; and &#8220;. . .there&#8217;s some canvas up in the shed should do.&#8221; is typical dialogue. Perhaps I&#8217;m depriving myself of a good story, but reading this became too painful to continue. I credit the author for trying to incorporate her unique sense of style and use of words, but given this writing style, the premise was just not enough to overcome my dislike for the writer&#8217;s use of description. The title of the book is what caught my attention&#8212;a brilliant title. I just wish it was more than that for me.
5	1401148800	I am reading this book, instead of listening to it.  I prefer that format for some books, while listening fits better with others.  One reason I chose to read this one, instead of listening to it on my Kindle, is that there are multiple times throughout the book when I want to savor a description or phrase vby rereading it. Also,  I felt, as I read,  the emotional dilemmas of the plot; and as each character was drawn and enlarged, I took in their feelings, adding them to the ultimate puzzle the author has set out for the reader.  I could stop and examine those questions easily with the book in word form.  What would you do?  She is asking us, not only to grasp the story, but to put ourselves in the place of each character.  She does that by letting us in on what each one is thinking...not just the main characters, but those who love or despise them.  I think, if asked hypothetically,  most people would have a clear answer as to how they would react  in the situations the characters encounter.  Yes, I would do it that way, No, I would be more honorable, Yes I see the heartache in either choice, the reader might think.  But, as we hear reasons behind actions those clear cut choices dim. The author has included the reader in her story by asking us to follow the heart of the characters as they try to live with their choices or circumstances.  That is the charm of this first novel, and also why I am hoping there will be another to read soon.
4	1401148800	This is a period piece that takes place off of the coast of Australia. The mail characters are a light house keeper and his family. I learned a lot about what a lighthouse keeper does and what a lonely job it can be. He lets a woman into his life and everything changes for a while. I don't want to spoil it by giving away what transpires but, it is sadand says a lot about the human condition. I recommend it.
4	1401062400	lots.of twists and turns. and only a mom can understand the decisions that were made and feel pain for everyone.
5	1401062400	The Light Between Oceans was beautifully written.  I felt as though I too lived on Janus island and was part of Izzy and Tom's world.  The book grabs you on the first page and doesn't let go until the last.
4	1401062400	The story is a good one with enough melodrama to keep it interesting. i enjoyed the Australian setting of the early 20th century. For me, some of the descriptions were a bit too fluffed and wordy. I could see this being turned into a movie for television. It is a really good book for summer reading.
5	1401062400	The author, Stedman, is an amazing writer. I can't believe that this was her first book. There were so many paragraphs that were fantastic outlooks on life! I wanted to remember all them.
5	1400976000	At first, I thought it was going to be a little too &#34;sweet&#34; for my tastes.  Really glad I hung in there, tho.  There's enough suspense that it kept me coming back.
5	1400976000	Talk about love, but no a simple one, about parent's love, it doesn't matter if its a natural child oran adopted one, love, who is capable to overcome everything.Talk about second chance in life, too.Overall, I recommend this book.
5	1400976000	The duality that ran throughout the book was wonderful.  One lie, or shall I say omission, created a cascade of ethical dilemmas.I enjoyed reading about the location and period in Australia.  Lighthouses have always fascinated me.
4	1400976000	I loved this book!! I was a terrific story and caused a moral dilemma that makes you think," what would I do?"
5	1400976000	The story summary sold this book to me- sounded like a tantalizing story and it did not disappoint.  Wonderful wonderful read and a fascinating bit of factual information about lighthouses and the technicality of running the lights.  Add to that the poignant sharing of the experience of living in such isolation and Stedman brings a great read to life.
5	1400976000	M.L. Stedman is a talented author who is able to really capture the true meaningful feelings of people.  She has a natural way of writing as well as able to research the setting very well especially around lighthouses and history of Australia and the result of the ending of world war II.  Too bad she does not have any other books at the moment but hoping a new one will be forthcoming.
4	1400976000	Speedy read and entertaining.  Author etches perfect pictures of this world down under.  Story line is somewhat predictable--that is except for the surprise at the end.
4	1400889600	A story that will pull you in and pull you in so many ways. Well written and enjoyable. I look forward to another.
5	1400889600	Loved the book star to finish....characters, setting.  Interesting story which reminded me of real life drama of baby Jessica in the early 90's
5	1400889600	The book was so good that I am having a hard job adjusting to no longer having it to read.
5	1400889600	I enjoyed reading this book.  You can live your live by principle and doing the right, but one wrong choice can lead to disaster in so many ways.
5	1400889600	One of those books you want to linger over...savoring each word. A beautiful story of a life well lived in spite of the suffering we all encounter.
4	1400889600	I think as a mother, I have been faced with a lot of the same similar situations.  You know the right thing to do, but then your desire to protect and instinct to nurture your inner desires along with your compassion for someone else, makes you do crazy things.  You start little white lies to yourself, saying your will correct the situation later.  Then you ignore the need to correct by busying yourself.  Then you have to live with the lie until you can't any more.  You find yourself wanting different results for the main character and later feeling sorry for those they have harmed.  In the end, wrong actions are righted, right action are based on love, and life moves forward a little more serene and somewhat hollow.
4	1400889600	Thought provoking--what would you do in same situation?? Torn between doing the right thing and doing what you feel is right for you.
4	1400889600	An original story, not one that we've all read before that's simply recycled using new names and locations.  The characters are real, and it's hard to determine from moment to moment who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist - each character has moments when they're the hero and those when they're the bad guy.
5	1400803200	I loved this book. It has excellent character development, and a believable plot. It is unpredictable in the way that real life is.
5	1400803200	This was a beautiful story of love. Hannah also learned to forgive from her late husband Frank which gave Tom & Isabel a second chance of life even though it was without Lucy-Grace. I recommend this book & author. His choice of words gave the book a realistic feel.
4	1400803200	This was a very interesting story relating to teen and twenties of 1900. While reading it makes you realize how times have changed and ask, 'would anyone in your family, at present time, live as this questionable family did'. It really has you thinking about the whole incident and just what road you might have taken. It is a book you do want to finish.
5	1400803200	Sad part at the end they were alone.I  likedthe story and the writer. I will read more  books byher.
5	1400803200	Sometimes you get lost in the names and the places but the story itself is satisfying. The suspense isn't drawn out too much and the story is just engrossing. Definitely recommend it!
5	1400716800	In this modern age, it is difficult to imagine the events happening here. The story could have taken any number of turns. Very thought provoking. Good read.
5	1400716800	One of the best I've read recently.  Story well weaved, suspenseful.  Story facilitated an emotional attachment to all the characters.  Very well written.  Highly recommend.
5	1400716800	Not much to say but it was a very different type of story.  I would recommend it to my friends and family.
5	1400716800	Loved every minute of this book, it was gripping right from the first page. love the way  Stedman mAales his characters come alive.
5	1400716800	I can&#8217;t remember how, why or when The Light Between Oceans hit my &#8220;must-read&#8221; radar. What I do know is that I waited too long to read this book. I picked it up to read immediately after Me Before You for something different. Historical rather than contemporary &#8211; the setting was a remote island off the coast of Australia during the 1920&#8242;s. Family oriented rather than romance, with some mystery and tragedy for good measure. Then there were similarities, the emotional state I was left in at the turn of the last page as well as the lengths that someone will go to for the person they love.I often read on my lunch break at work, and recently (I don&#8217;t remember what I was reading) a coworker noticed that I was almost finished and said, &#8220;Do you know what you should read next? The Light Between Oceans.&#8221; I told her that I had it on my kindle but just hadn&#8217;t gotten around to it yet. She said I should read it as soon as I can. Long story short, she read it on a plane and cried. The passenger next to her immediately asked what she was reading because she loved a good book that could make you cry. Familiar? I do too! As soon as I heard that I knew I had to fit it in and just a week or so later I did. And I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.The Light Between Oceans spans decades. Tom as a young adult on his way back from war. To his life on Janus with Isabel and the child they thought they would never have. Right the way through to their &#8220;retirement years&#8221;. ML Stedman crafted a beautifully enchanting  novel with The Light Between Oceans, and it was hard to believe that it was a debut. She is one to watch!
3	1400716800	The setting was interesting. The developing relationship between the two characters was well described. It was an easy read, perhaps too easy.
3	1400716800	This story was beautifully (technically) written. It had exquisite descriptions that drew detailed depictions in my mind. The plot was different and thought-provoking, however, was slow moving. I sometimes wanted to press a fast forward button. I also found it difficult to completely immerse myself into the story because of my dislike of the characters. Yes, Tom was a quiet person but I needed more as a reader and I was constantly annoyed with Izzy. 3/5 stars.
5	1400630400	I think the author truly captured what forgiveness is about. Don't let the past destroy the hope for the future
4	1400630400	I liked this book, but it was a little depressing. It shows the struggles of a couple who live on an uninhibited island and how they try to grow their family. Good book.
5	1400630400	Twists and turns; mystery, suspense, secrets and surprises. Felt empathy for all characters in struggle to survive life dramas - emotional turmoil, maddening thoughts, feelings of flight, fear of unknown and future ramifications. Trust and betrayal; love and hate. Carried along on waves of wondering about conclusion - very different than surmised.
5	1400630400	A thought provoking story! A twisted tale of fates. I could relate to the depth of love a parent has for her/ her child.
5	1400630400	I love lighthouses so this was a thrilling novel about life at a light house station.  This book kept me wanting to read to the very end which was emotional.
5	1400630400	Life lessons taught for those who wish to hear them.  Wonderful well written book with honest human feelings pouring in and through every page.
5	1400544000	This is one of the best stories I have ever read. Heartbreaking, beautiful, and wonderfully written. I recommend this story to all of my friends!
5	1400544000	The story of a light house keeper and his young wife living on a remote island off the coast of Australia, and their life of solitude.  She has lost several babies, and is desperate for a child when a boat washes up with a dead man and a live baby.  She begs to keep the baby, and her husband, though knowing he is breaking the law to not report, feels such sympathy and love for his wife, he lets her keep the baby.  They raise the little girl as their own, but one day they suffer the consequences of their deception.  This book has no foul language or explicit sex, and is a great book for all to read.  I am so tired of having to worry about the bad language and sex in the books I recommend for my book club, that this was a refreshing find.  I would like to read more by this author.
5	1400544000	I won't summarize what the story is as you can get that from the description of the book. I thought the story was outstanding. The characters are real and believable as well as the reactions and decisions they make as the story progresses. This is a must read.
5	1400544000	This book is worth the read just for the beauty of the writing, even though the story is quite difficult.
5	1400544000	I could not  put the book down yet did not want to finish it. I can't wait for another book buY this wonderful author.
4	1400544000	The book grabs you and won't let go.  It was impossible for me to not feel the pain for every character, especially Lucy..
4	1400544000	I loved this book because of the characters and how they handled the problems they faced.  It's a good one for your Book Club because the moral dilemma is so poignant and facilitates  a lot of discussion.  Each character loses something because of decisions made by another person.  And you can't judge them for coping as best they know how.  My bet is that you'll think about the book long after you have finished it...
5	1400544000	Well written.  Characters well developed. Story is suspenseful and heart wrenching.It is a memorable book with a story that I will long remember.
4	1400457600	A book that started some good conversations during book club. Made you think about personal choices and how the effects ripple to touch so many others
5	1400457600	Excellent readCould not wait to go to bed to continue to read.  Learned more about the sea and those who love that life.
5	1400457600	I was thinking one way, then in the next chapter I had completely changed my mind.  What an emotional roller coaster.  It will certainly keep you reading into the night
3	1400457600	it was ok... not what,I was expecting...pretty deep book, and sad. Will make you think. Very drawn out. Great points and thoughts to take from the read but I would pick another book before this one.
5	1400371200	This story caught me from the very first page. I felt all sorts of emotions while reading - wondering how I would have reacted in similar situations.
5	1400371200	This book captured your attention right from the beginning.  It is a lesson incompassion and devoted love.  Great read!
4	1400371200	This is a great book about the choices we make and the consequences that may follow. It is about loss, grief, secrets, and the ultimate act of forgiveness. The story tugged at my heartstrings so deeply when Lucy-Grace suffers the fallout of others  decisions. Read it, you will not be disappointed, but be sure to have tissues handy....
3	1400371200	It was predictable, but mildly engaging. The ending is unsatisfying, and the characters end up going flat. I do not particularly recommend.
3	1400284800	Chosen for book club.  Sometimes it got slow, but you had to hang in there to find out how the characters finally came to terms with their situation.  It is a morality story, and you have to wonder what you would have done in the same situation, and the outcome may not please some, but it is probably what would have occurred in real life.  Not a happy ending, but real.
5	1400284800	Excellent story,  and beautifully told. Quiet emotions run high in this heartfelt story. Great characters and a very good read.
5	1400284800	The book was well written and kept my interest throughout.  Our book club also had a lively discussion of it with a variety of opinions on many aspects.
4	1400284800	Very good book. Holds your interest.  Love the ending. Characters are believable. Would read another book by this author. Loved it.
2	1400198400	Book was to long, and after realizing where story was headed, it was predictable in some respects. Descriptions of locations were wonderful. I could picture myself in those spots.
4	1400112000	Very good story and plot. It drags a bit and is a bit more descriptive then I like, worth the read.
5	1400112000	Like nothing I have read before. A war hero comes back to town and meets a woman and they fall in love. He accepts  a job as a lighthouse keeper on a small island  off Australia. The woman encourages him to marry her so she can come with him. They have a lovely life on the island. But have had a couple of miscarriages which was very sad. One day a boat washed ashore with a dead man on it and a baby as well. The woman falls in love with the baby and doesn't want to report it. She cares so much for it. She tells her husband that the mother probably fell overboard earlier. The husband loves the baby but is tormented by not reporting it. The true story eventually comes out and things flip upside down.
4	1400112000	This book is quite engaging and I was drawn in by the interesting plot line. I read this book in two days as I felt compelled to see how the all too believable characters would resolve an ethical dilemma as presented from the viewpoints of each character.
5	1400112000	I could almost feel and see the lighthouse and sense the isolation the characters felt.  This is a story that has many facets and provokes much discussion.  It is so well written that I wanted to meet the characters and hear their story first-hand.  I kept thinking of what I would or would not do when faced with the decisions and problems that the characters faced.  This is a real page turner and a book that leaves you asking for more.  We read the book for Book Club and the comments were so interesting and so diverse.
3	1400112000	To many unbelivable parts.How do your parents never come to visit when you have lost so many children?How do you loose children and not seek a doctors constant help?But, it did keep me reading to find out what happens...
3	1400112000	I like well-written novels with characters who face problems and dilemmas that I can relate to and ponder as I read.  Tom, Isabel and Hannah face choices that will determine their futures and the futures of those they love with all their hearts.  Sometimes it is hard to see the way that is &#34;right.&#34;  I enjoyed joining them on their journey and the choices that unfolded.
5	1400112000	The author fleshed out the locations and characters so we'll that this felt like a true story.  I started reading and could not put it down until I finished this compelling story.  Beautiful writing and complex situation made for a great read.
4	1400112000	This is a quick and enjoyable read, interesting characters and moral dilemma.  The writing is glorious, almost poetic at times, the plot has a slight soap opera flavor and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
5	1400025600	My book club was almost evenly split with Love it/Hate it opinions!  Those who hated it thought the husband should have reported finding the boat immediately. Those who loved it sympathized warmly with a woman suffering the loss of her babies!
4	1400025600	Liked it. Book good make me happy. Some sad things that made my eyes rain in my head movies. Cheers!
3	1400025600	I found it a bit far-fetched and hard to believe, although the princlples of the book are good  Here are two more words - this should be easier..
3	1400025600	I loved the first 3/4 of this book, but the writing style seemed to make a melodramatic turn at that point and lost my interest. I finished it, but couldn't feel the emotions the writer was trying to present.
4	1400025600	I enjoyed the description of the area and the thought of living in such a remote area. I also enjoyed the delight of the two who chose to live there. However, because of the choices made, I worried through the entire book about the consequences of those choices!Very well written, Very descriptive.
5	1399939200	The Light Between Oceans is a fantastic read.  It is touching and so full of life's lessons.  Well worth reading.
5	1399939200	I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not out it down.  So well written and such a great story of forgiveness and consequences.  A must read!
5	1399939200	Excellent for discussion. Great moral dilemmas and character development. Could be a great high school requirement. It's a fast read.
4	1399939200	I enjoyed the character development and the overall story line.  Gave good insight into an area that I was unfamiliar with and quite frankly, had not given much thought to.  The book was well researched and took me back to the horrors of the world wars.
4	1399939200	It was a difficult book to lay down and walk away, I kept thinking about all the characters involved and how their decision affected me in reading this book. Isabella, Tom, Hannah, the parents and especially Lucy Grace. It's a sad book but it does show so much human character. I loved the description of the lighthouse and wonder how Isabella could go there and feel so much at home in such a lonely place. But she did not find it lonely, she found it peaceful. Her own special paraside. At first I was angry at Tom for writing the note to Hannah and then you realize that it was something he had to do.Great book.M. Stanfield, Houston, Tx
5	1399939200	I was captivated by the characters and the moral dilemmas that developed.  I have already recommended it to many friends, and I'm hopeful that our book club will choose it so I can hear the discussion this novel will provoke.
3	1399939200	I found this story interesting in characters and plot, yet irritating as to how the characters reject the obvious best choices and err in ways that mess up their lives.  I was willing to follow the plot since it involved lighthouse lifestyle and the isolation that could affect a relationship--an interesting subject for a book.  I was glad when the secret was unveiled, glad that things never worked out perfectly, and okay with the ending.
5	1399939200	One of the best books I've read lately.  The author has a real economy of words......says a lot in just a few words, but completely getting the thought together.
4	1399939200	Improbable?  Of course.  Enjoyable?  Yes.This novel has an interesting concept and was very readable and fun.  It's worth it!
5	1399852800	I liked this book for it's strong and interesting characters.  I like how she laid out her story and then later went back and gave further details of each character that made the story richer and more intense.  Her writing style was lovely and the way she wove moments together with eloquent thoughts and phrases was beautiful to read.  The central theme in the book made me rethink my own ethics The book made me angry and it made me cry. I loved it!  She has a remarkable career ahead of her.  It is stunning to know this was the author's first novel.
5	1399852800	It was near impossible to find a true hero or villain in this story.  What we are left with is a story full of characters with motivations and flaws that ring authentic.  It is an impossible situation that can only be faced with the love of another.  Love that requires true sacrifice and forgiveness.
5	1399852800	I loved this book!  I read it twice . It was sad but with some joyous moments.very well written. Touching.
5	1399852800	This is a page-turner.  While book reviews are most assuredly opinion-based, I find it hard to imagine a reader whom wouldn't be drawn into the surprise, the anxiety, the love, and the anguish that leaps from the pages of this novel.  Not to be missed!
5	1399852800	Absolutely beautifully written. I was fascinated by the history and functions of lighthouses, and the isolation of the lives of their caretakers. Each character was well-developed, the story heartbreaking.
5	1399852800	I liked the lonely light house setting, it symbolizes the loneliness of various characters throughout the story.  The author has a gift, a way with words, frequently charming the reader with portrayals of sensitivity and caring. Plot takes somewhat improbable twists and turns, neither brutal nor cloyingly sweet.  Great read!
5	1399766400	Just finished this beautiful story. The characters are well drawn and all of them are interesting.  The light house itself becomes a strong character in the book.  It's very difficult to put this book down.  It's the first non-mystery  I've ever read where I can't wait to get to the next page.  Stayed up late to read the last several chapters in one setting.  It is that good.
5	1399766400	There are books that you never want to end.  This is one of them!!! I could not put it down.
4	1399766400	What would you do? Life and love is precious. Light and darkness, love and loss. A Mother's Day read for sure.
5	1399766400	This book is one that will really stick with me.  Don't expect it to be 'fun'.  Expect to cry through most of it.  I was pretty much a mess through the last 1/3 of the book.  I know some people have been disappointed with the ending, but I thought it ended as it only could for the most part.  I haven't read something that really makes you think about right/wrong, forgiveness and putting yourself in someone else's shoes as much as this book does.  Amazing book.  My only critizism is that I think some of the character's background information dragged a bit, but most of it was necessary.  Must read.  MUST read!
2	1399766400	I completed it but found it slow. Perhaps it just wasn't my kind of book.  Just seemed to be a book for a very young person
5	1399766400	I chose this book to read during a flight and it was quick and enjoyable.  The author hooks you from the book jacket and never lets you go.  I found myself emphathizing with all characters.
5	1399766400	I think it showed passion, joy, betrayal ,love, loss, desperation and other parts of human nature.  I loved the ending other than Isabelle dyeing before Lucy came to the house.  Five star
5	1399766400	Author writes well and keeps the reader guessing as to final outcome.  Transitions are smooth and I could visualize Janus rock  and the difficulty of life there from the excellent descriptions in the book.  Great story line.
5	1399680000	Breathtaking, beautiful, brilliant, haunting. This book has really left an impression with me. Stunning location and beautifully written. I can't give this book enough praise. I was moved to both laughter and tears
5	1399680000	One of those stories that takes you to a place so believably, then takes you to a situation that forces you to imagine what you would have in that situation.
2	1399680000	This story was good enough to continue reading but the events in the book don't remotely make sense.  Yes, it is fiction but the story should still be somewhat believable.  The characters in this story do unbelievably stupid things. Makes me wonder if the characters act in unrealistic ways does it still make a good story?
3	1399680000	I read this book as part of my reading group.  It was interesting to learn about the life style of the lighthouse keepers in the early 20th century.  I found the story line a little difficult to accept - had to keep reminding myself that it was just a story. It did present a very accurate account of what it is like to bond with a baby and the difficulties faced by those who lose babies.
4	1399680000	Beautiful writing about a lightouse keeper in a remote area in the Indian Ocean. Much to leam about  sea and people.  Takes place. After WW I, giving unique perspective on time, place and and character.  Excellent book.
5	1399680000	Describing the life of the light house keeper was fascinating to me.  The in depth love story that followed showed realism and depth.  The complications surrounding the appearance of a baby girl were heart warming, and, later, heart breaking.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a well rounded story.
4	1399680000	I enjoyed the book very much.  The setting of the story was very interesting and different.A love story that went beyond the ordinary and of the way two people's thoughts of rightand wrong were so important to each ot them.  The ending was hard to read but it had tobe handled in this way.  Neither one of them could have lived with that deceit.  A lifetimeof never having what they needed.
5	1399680000	Wonderful, heartbreaking book....beautifully written with much to think about as you read.....the many choices life gives to us and how our decisions impact not just us but those around us
5	1399593600	Couldn't put it down!!  So full of human emotion, love, hate, greed, and forgiveness.  Every character comes alive as if you truly know them.
5	1399593600	I started reading and didn't want to stop.  The characters were so real and I empathized with them when they had to make some hard decisions.
5	1399593600	Loved the main character and his selflessness .  Shows how difficult and solitary life can be and yet full with family and commitment
4	1399593600	I liked the book even though I needed tissues near the end.  Doing the right thing is always the best.  There is no room for secrets.
5	1399507200	This novel draws you in from the beginning.  I lean toward historical fiction, but lovers of fiction in general will find this a more than satisfying read.
4	1399507200	I really enjoy books that make you question how you might act in a similar moral dilemma. From the beginning, it is clear that this story isn't going to be all peaches and cream. All the characters have suffered their share of loss, some of them have endured way more than any person should have to...Isabel and Tom are looking for a sliver of happiness, despite the fact that she's lost two brothers and he's seen too many lives lost and killed too many in the war. Accepting a remote post on an Janus island, Tom and his new bride try to start a family, but three miscarriages later, are left heartbroken. When a boat with a dead man and a live baby washes up on the beach, the temptation to adopt the child as their own is too great. The ramifications of their decision reverberates throughout the rest of the narrative. This is a story of loss, of love, of anger, hate, and forgiveness and of making the best of living in a horribly imperfect world where most of the time, fair is a word that has no meaning. The writing was beautiful, although at times I felt the writer tried to hard to stretch for an unusual metaphor. But as a devoted mother and a wife, this story tugged at all my heartstrings and I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a thought-provoking, deeply emotional read.
3	1399420800	well written, but boring and predictable. it really reminds me of a cheesy lifetime network movie. our a hallmark special.ok for a mindless beach read
4	1399420800	This story was very well written and very enjoyable.  It gave me a whole new way of looking at lighthouses for one. Ms. Stedman's descriptions of the island, the imagination she gave her characters, and the beauty she gave to the surroundings were impressive.  The story, without giving away too much, was heartbreaking and happy at the same time.  Lucy was a joy and Isabelle was both loved and hated at the same time.  It's hard to say too much without giving away the ending but it is definitely worth reading.
5	1399420800	This book kept me focused. It was the second of two book I was reading when I started. I couldn't finish the other book!  The Light still has me. I find myself thinking about it throughout the day. I'm having a rough time getting into the other book again. Well written, captivating, and all around good story. Thanks for it!
5	1399420800	Wow!!!!!  A really great read! It was definitely a page  turner. Im not one to cry when I read but this one came close!
5	1399420800	Enjoyed this book very much. So many levels of emotions to wade through. Great character development  give it a read.
3	1399420800	The Light Between Oceans is a good, fast read.  The story is plausible but predictable.  The most interested parts of the novel deal with the workings of a lighthouse and the setting in Australia.  The characters were interesting, but not especially well drawn or deep.  I enjoyed the book, but it is not one that I would pick up and read again.
5	1399420800	This engaging, well-written book explores the conflicting demands of head and heart. Couldn't put it down. did not want it to end.
5	1399334400	I very much liked reading this novel, and am in aw of the author that can come up with such an unusual plot line. Although I felt the ending was a little rushed, it was satisfying.
5	1399334400	This is a very moving story. The character development is wonderful. The story is very human. It is realistic but hopeful. I like that. Read it. You won't regret a minute.
3	1399334400	I'm not sure this is the most believable story but it raises some good questions and it is beautifully written. Certainly entertaining.
5	1399334400	Suggested by a friend-riveting story,deeply emotional-will definitely pass along this suggestion-would seriously think about reading other work by this author
5	1399334400	Kept up interest through entire book.  Story touches on many emotions and conditions.  I don't want to give anything away.  Really good summer read.
5	1399334400	An excellent read for your book club. The author is so descriptive in her wrings that you almost feel you are on the islamd, in the lighthouse and see the stars. Very interesting story line but keep the tissue box handy.
5	1399334400	For a new writer she developed her characters well. The reader feels like they know them. The dilemma of what to do when they find the baby can be understood both ways. But the consequences of their ultimate decision was heartbreaking both to them and the birth mother. It was an enjoyable first novel and I would like to see what she writes next.
5	1399248000	The Great war, a decorated soldier yearning for healing solitude, a passionate young woman ready for adventure all mixes together to lay the foundation for this Australian story.  I found myself engrossed in the back and forth between loving need and the rule of honesty. There are no perfect answers after the choice is made.  It's a very good read with &#34;Aussie-isms&#34; here and there along with language of the times.
4	1399248000	I felt it was captivating and kept my interest through out.  Since I've been to Australia it was easy to visualize the scenes.  A great easy read and easy to follow the characters without getting lost who was who.  I can see he good and the bad of the decisions made by the characters more gray areas than black and white sometimes.
5	1399248000	This was a great read!  It somehow keep me engrossed even though at times it was just about the lives of the people in the story.  I lead a women's reading group and everyone that read it in the designated month really liked it.  There was lots of interesting discussion.  My husband also read and enjoyed it.  It is one of those books that stays with you for a while.
2	1399248000	It was very upsetting and sad.  I wanted to cry throughout the book.  I think it was well written, just not my choice.
4	1399248000	Very enjoyable .  Beautiful descriptions of the landscape and surroundings, sad heartwarming story,  connected with the characters,  a page turner.
5	1399161600	A friend of mine said that very often an authors first book is their best. That remains to be seen, but this was an amazing story.  If you enjoyed The Kitchen House you'll love this book.  Have your Kleenex handy, but it's so worth it.
5	1399161600	This book was very enjoyable.  Set in a time early on deals with a mother's love and a couple's life journey. I recommend with 5 stars.
5	1399161600	Stedman has considerable insight of the human condition, and describes emotions very effectively.  An excellent  book that most anyone will enjoy and perhaps be emotionally affected by this story.
5	1399161600	This was a very enjoyable book and  a page turner to find the outcome.  It was a great book for discussion at our bookclub.
5	1399161600	Interesting twist on family relationships and true love.  Hard to put down!  The setting is in Perth, Australia which made the story even more unique.
5	1399161600	Reading one or two books a week, I don't often come across one that is well written and has good character development as well.I highly recommend this one.
4	1399161600	Besides the major theme, of each person living their journey, making choices, searching for truth and peace, every parent who has lost a child or raised a child, can relate to this novel.  Having lost a very late term pregnancy, and yet still having two living children , nevertheles, my heart was not full enough. So I took foster children to fill the gap,loved them as my own, then returned them to their true parents when the time was right. Not an easy thing to do, and yet the right moral thing to do without question.  Of course in the novel, no psychology was used to gradually make the transition for Lucy bearable, and no talk of adopting children which would have been a realistic option.  This made the book very sad, and because it was so well written, we could empathize with each of the characters.  Would recommend this as an easy read, with deep emotion, reminding us that choices have consequences , but truth must prevail..  Loved the ending..
5	1399075200	The characters are very real and have such an impact on the storyline. I was educated about lights, how they work and how they are maintained and this light between two oceans is great. I recommend it highly.
5	1399075200	One of the best books I have read in years! A must read for everyone at some point in life.
5	1398988800	I couldn't put this book down!  A beautifully written first novel. I can't wait for Stedman's next one! This one was great!
4	1398988800	This is a beautifully written book!  Definitely a tearjerker!  I needed lots of Kleenex by the end of the book.
4	1398902400	It was a heartbreaking story of a woman's obsessive need for a child, but it was also a beautiful love story in a magical setting.  Emotional tension was built into the story.
5	1398902400	This was a book club pick. I absolutely loved it. The story and all its twists and turns was engaging and kept me thinking and reflecting about what my actions would be in the character's varying situations.  It was a great discussion book as well.
4	1398902400	Slow start but a thought provoking end. I am glad I kept reading to see how the plot played out.
5	1398902400	Excellent - just finished reading for my book club. Looking forward to a lively discussion. The question, would you give up the baby you rescued?
5	1398902400	The Light Between Oceans is very well written, you don't wont to put it down. The trials and decisions made because of circumstances and the consequences of those decisions is gut wrenching. You need to read this book.
3	1398902400	It's a good story but it takes a while to get going. Overall I enjoyed it but I don't think it will have been a memorable read.
5	1398816000	This is a good example of how the choices we make in life can be extremely good or extremely bad, and can affect us for the rest of our lives. For a first novel, M.L. Stedman has captured the essence of the characters, and portrayed them to be unforgettable. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5	1398816000	The writing in this novel is exceptional - well crafted and thought provoking.  The story and character development are compelling.  Well worth the time.  Perfect discussion book.
2	1398816000	Not sure what people liked about this.  Just didn't buy into story that much.  Romantic nonsense about having children.  Liked the lighthouse part of it the best.
4	1398816000	A great story in a very different environment and time. The charcters were colorful, deep and well thought out and endearing.
5	1398816000	The Light Between Oceans: A Novel is the book that you will remember long after you've read the last page.  It was different from any book I've read in a long time.  It provided a great platform for discussion in my book club.  A great book!!!
4	1398816000	The story & characters were solid.  I found myself looking forward to getting back to the book to see what would happened next.
4	1398729600	Great book but you spend the lion's share of the time worrying about what is going to happen next. It's a really thoughtful description of how bad choices get made and how you can convince yourself to stick with them.
5	1398729600	Twists and turns keep you interested to the very end. Characters interesting, well developed. Easy to imagine them as real
5	1398729600	How do you live your life? What choices would you make? The characters deal with moral dilemmas and life changing choices in this profoundly poignant novel. Definitely worth the read!
5	1398729600	Really loved this book from the first chapter. Didn't want to put it down. Definitely thought provoking. I would definitely recommend this book to family and friends.
4	1398729600	Life is never all easy, hopefully never all hard. A love story of many dimensions.  How actions and relations always affect more than just ourselves.  Good book!
5	1398729600	Anyone who knows me is aware that I am not a good reader due to poor comprehension skills. This was a beautifully written BOOK and easy to follow the story line.  Each sentence flows and the mood is felt throughout. It was a heart wrenching love affair between characters.  Learning about lighthouses was poetic not technical which was so lovely. I fell in love with Tom.
5	1398729600	Loved it--the last half was truly a page turner!It seems as though I could identify with all of the characters at some point in my life.
5	1398643200	A tale of human frailties, human errors and human strengths. The characters are a bit thin but the sum of the book is a moving portrait of how life moves on. The ending is a bit pat, but full of genuine wisdom
5	1398643200	I liked the author's style of writing and how she used wisdom in her characters throughout the book.  The story was compelling, emotionally charged and flowed well.  I am looking forward to this author's next book.  An excellent first book!
4	1398643200	I loved how the author was able to describe the surroundings, the water, the sky, the weather, the loneliness it all came to life.
4	1398643200	great book! I enjoyed the writing and the story line. I liked that it really made me think about what i would do in the same situation. Of course the first thought is to do the right thing but at the same time i can also understand their reasoning for doing what they did .Especially considering her grief and mourning at that time.  Some times the wrong thing might seem so right in the moment but then one little lie just blossoms into to more.
5	1398643200	I really enjoyed this book. Well worth the read. It was well written and believable.I have to add more words but above is enough :)
4	1398556800	It was halfway through the book that I realized that Lucy-Grace was the light between oceans between distinctly separate worlds. It was most interesting the way the main characters Hannah, Isabel, and Tom were so conflicted and yet so compassionate and eventually forgiving towards one another. The child Lucy-Grace indeed was the light that came between these characters, a constant reminder of the impact children have in molding us and our relationships and a constant reminder of the necessity for forgiveness for growth and relationship renewal.
5	1398556800	I liked everything about this book. I just wish there was a better way to resolve the issue.  My heart. Went out to Izzie.
4	1398556800	wanted to finish it.  It was a great story with conflict and resolution.  I wanted a different ending or more to the ending...the story seemed to die before I was ready.  A great summer read.
4	1398556800	While I enjoyed this book, it was truly about loss on many levels.  Loss of lives, living with loss and surviving loss.  Well written indeed and makes one think about decisions we make.  Good people sometimes make bad decisions.  Living with the regret is difficult even when we have love.
5	1398556800	A childless couple desperately wants a child. A child appears to them alone in a boat and the wife believes it was God sent. The husband does not believe that the arrival of this child was sent to them by God. He desperately wants his wife to be happy and also wants this baby, but when his doubt is realized he is plagued by his conscience. This innocent child that arrives to the lighthouse between two oceans causes much conflict between a childless woman and a man who believes in being honest and at the same time he wants his wife happy and loving again.
5	1398470400	Loved the book. Couldn't put it down. Such a sweet story, but filed with so much love and pain.  Love is complicated at times, tomorrow is a new day. Learn to forgive and move on!
5	1398470400	This book will make you want to read the history on lighthouses.  Make you think about your own feelings about this type of situation.
5	1398470400	I just couldn't figure out how this should end. I loved this book and could not put it down. Bittersweet
5	1398470400	I loved it! I learned a lot about lighthouse keeping and the isolation.  It was a very well thought book!
5	1398470400	All The characters in the book have so much love between them and so many moral issues are at stake that I couldn't stop reading...it made me cry.. The natura descriptions are beautiful, I could feel myself surrounded by cicadas and all kids of birds.. Read it and enjoy it
3	1398470400	I loved the first three quarters, but to me it became less compelling, more soap opera-ish, less believable. I skimmed through the ending chapters.  But the writing was wonderful, the characters full and interesting, very well drawn. Would certainly recommend it, because my own quirks got in the way
4	1398384000	My book club selected and read this book. It was a good story and prompted a very good discussion. Character development was spotty but most of us could relate to one or more of the characters.
4	1398384000	The subject of the book caught my attention and once I started reading it, I never looked back.  I found the outcome sad, but the premise was right on.....there are consequences, both good and bad, for all the decisions we make in our lives.
3	1398384000	Had a lively discussion about this book with several friends. Leaves you with a feeling of, &#34;What would I/you do&#34; in this situation. Although Tom was a rule abiding military man, he let his heart and emotions rule his head when it came to dealing with his wife. For me personally, for Tom to let his wife manipulate him like she did was disgusting and immoral. I was disappointed in the author to have let the story play out like it did. Lucy was taken away from her &#34;adoptive&#34; parents and thrown into her crazy bio mom's family when she was 4 and we didn't hear anything about her for the next 25+ years. What happened in that time? Why did she not try to contact Tom and Isabel? In those 25+ years, what happened to Isabel? Did she ever recover from the loss of Lucy? Why did she die of cancer a week before Lucy finally showed up because she heard Isabel was ill? Too many holes and questions left me wondering what happened in the &#34;missing&#34; years.
4	1398384000	the way the author conveys the emotions of all the characters makes one really empathize.Every time I thought the little girl should stay with one family I'd change my mind as the stroy evolved.extremely well written. Didn't want to put it down.
2	1398384000	I thought this would have been so much better, it was so tedious reading it and really there was not much of a story at all.  At the end up I didn't care what happened to the characters.
5	1398384000	I have not read a book this moving in years.  These characters are caught in a moral dilemna.  Circumstances have put them in a heart wrenching situation.  This is the only book that has ever brought me to tears.  It will be in my thoughts for some time.
4	1398384000	this book kept me interested all the way through.  it was haunting and sad and brought up so many questions and feelings. difficult read for anyone with fertility issues depending on where you are at in your journey.
5	1398384000	Very thought provoking.  Enjoyed the book but clearly addresses some moral dilemmas.  Once I got into the story I could not put it down.
5	1398297600	It was a true test of morality.  Torn between what's right and what you would want for a mother who has lost 3 babies.  It was a real tear jerker.  Would have liked it if Lucy Grace's baby was named Tom.
4	1398297600	I loved the way the book traveled from highs to lows just as the stormy ocean surrounding the lighthouse. When I thought all was lost it picked me up to another high. I enjoyed the writer's ability to paint such vivid pictures of the dark, cold and sparse living conditions of the island and the warmth and beauty of the cottage the couple shared there. This is a good read. I reccommend it.
4	1398297600	The story was quite interesting to me partially because the setting--both time and place.  The main character comes alive with his love of the lighthouse and the light.  It is well-written for the most part, and all of the characters are appropriately complex--no flat stereotypes here.  For me the plot was of lesser importance than setting and characterizations, but I'm glad that I read it.
5	1398297600	very easy reading, not too many characters to keep up with, had me crying at the very end...very touching story, could not put it down.
5	1398297600	I had a hard time getting into this book, but once the story got going, I could not put it down. Be ready to shed a few tears; it's certainly a story that tugged at my heart. Such a great read!
3	1398297600	Sort of like a Thomas Hardy  novel if written by Jodi Picault. Some interesting slices of Western Australian culture,environment, and history.
5	1398297600	The main character in this novel is a man who has a life view dictated both by conscience and experience.  His ideas are expressed extremely well and he sees himself in the cosmic world picture instead of the self world picture.  It is a well written book and thought provoking.
4	1398297600	This is a beautiful story with enough pain and mistakes to be thoroughly human.Filled with tensions as the flawed characters depend on one another for justice and forgiveness you expect the worst  and hope for the best. The conviction of righteousness does not disappoint.
5	1398211200	Heart-wrenching story. Solomon couldn't have decided this one. Couldn't put it down. Should make for an interesting discussion for my book club.
5	1398211200	I am so impressed at the images conjured up by the words of this book. Truly stellar writing! Though I prefer not to cry as much as I did, sometimes a good cry is necessary.
2	1398211200	Not surprising, given the price, but these are super flimsy.  Ok for cereal or yogurt, but don't plan to use for anything heavier.  Also, the spoon head is pretty small.
1	1398211200	Really dumb, awful book.  Plot was basic.  If you like Danielle Steele books, maybe this would be up your alley. Do not waste your money.
4	1398211200	Enjoyed the novel and learned a lot about lighthouses in our early days.  The one in the novel was so truly isolated that not every human could maintain their equilibrium being away from society, friends and family for such long stretches of time.Every human would react differently to this isolation and the characters in the novel certainly did.
4	1398124800	Stedman effectively captured the intensely emotional bond that can form between a parent and child which creates a light so bright that it blinds you to what is right and what is wrong.
4	1398124800	I was a bit bored in the beginning, but really enjoyed the second half of the book.  Would recommend, easy read
5	1398124800	A great story.  Very well written.  Very emotional.  The characters were so easy to imagine.  It will make a great movie.
4	1398124800	A heart wrenching, well written story of the choices made and severe consequences that follow. Definitely a book to read and remember.
4	1398124800	I thought the story was different and yet for our time in how one choice can affect our lives forever I was hoping for a happy ending for all but it was fair for sure even though it brought sorrow to many.
5	1398038400	i absolutely loved this book.  at first i had a hard time getting into because of the geography and lighthouse logistics in the beginning but i am so glad i hung in throught he first few chapters because it was well worth it!!  loved the characters and the story as a whole.  great book!
2	1398038400	Disappointing book.  Over- sentimental, poorly paced, repetitious in descriptions of landscape and characters, writing is not gracefully done. moral issues are strained.
5	1398038400	A sad but compelling story of broken lives due to hatred, lies, and deceit. The story begins at a time when much of the world is caught up in lingering hatred and bigotry...the time following World War I. This hatred and bigotry sets in motion events that will nearly consume two families due to grief, lies, deceit, sense of duty, and guilt. This will not be an easy read for tenderhearted individuals. The question of right and wrong is not always so easy to discern.
4	1398038400	I really enjoyed reading this book.  There were many twists and turns in the plot.  The characters were well developed.  I read this for my book club and the moral and ethical issues were great topics for discussion.  I would recommend this book.
4	1397952000	Sad story though a good one. However, it dragged on in the first few chapters. I almost lost interest but glad I read it to the end.
5	1397952000	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters came to life  right off the pages and I was able to feel their joy and sorrow. The many moral situations are excellent fission for book clubs
4	1397952000	I enjoyed it and it got to a point where I could not put it down.  I did not like the choices the two main characters made and therefore the unfortunate spot they put themselves in....  I really liked the end too.
5	1397952000	First novel for this author is a wonderful effort.  Hope there will be more.  Wonderful characters, each one was well developed and added much to the story.  Gave insight into age old struggle between right and wrong.  Will read again for sure.
4	1397952000	I enjoyed this book very much. The moral dilemma that forms the center of the plot was well presented through the characters and the post-WW1 setting (and the effect of the war on all involved I the story) added a lot to that story. While there were one or two places where I thought the course of the narrative slightly skipped a beat, events ,moved quickly over all and I was glued to the book at the end.
5	1397952000	What a delight.  It is one of those book that you are always looking for and just as often disappointed.  This wil not disappoint.
4	1397952000	This was a good read for a rainy day in London.  Read it through in one sitting.  A moralist tale without being preachy.
3	1397952000	This was  a good read.  It didn't knock my socks off but I was able to read straight through and not have to force my self to finish, like so many books these days.
5	1397952000	Excellent...lots of twists ... Great book club book. I recommend to others. Both men and women... Easy read.. Lots of intrigue
5	1397865600	I really enjoyed this book. I found it hear to put down. The author really let you connect with the different characters. So glad my friend recommended this book to me.
4	1397865600	Excellent reading. Takes one back to a much simpler time where a deep religious belief can affect the lives of all.  Damaged minds from the great world war of 1914-18 horrors and the class society make us remember how far we have come.  Are we fortunate or not?  We shall see.
5	1397865600	Very well written.  Must read...Could not put it down!  Set in Australia at a time where making decisions could change a life forever...
5	1397865600	WOW!  What a story and what dilemmas to have to face.  I could empathize with every character and couldn't rest until the book was finished.  Ms. Stedman has written a brilliant first novel and am hoping her next one is on the way.  This tale will stay with me forever!  It will be difficult to find another read as compelling as this one.
4	1397865600	Can tell it is a first novel, but raises some interesting ethical questions! A good what-would-you-do discussion at book club.
5	1397779200	I loved the sense of place about this novel, and the moral issues presented by the story.I did feel that Isabel's character was not as well-developed as Tom, but that didn't bother me too much.An engrossing read that left me thinking about it for days afterwards.
5	1397779200	When I was first given this book I thought the cover gave away to much. Found it was slow a couple chapters in so I set it down. Once I started to read I really started to enjoy it, but was so busy didn't have time to read. I found myself up late every night just to get a few chapters in. By the end of the book I was in tears. This was a great debut novel; I recommend it to anyone.
5	1397779200	Such a beautiful novel, and each time I read it, I discover more details about the characters. It's unbelievably heart-wrenching and poignant.
4	1397779200	engaging - just when you thought it was predictable it wasn't - gave you a good feel for being alone in the Indian Ocean and what it would be like for light keepers
5	1397779200	I just loved this book.  It pulls at your moral heartstrings and is such a beautiful, easy read.  Would highly recommend :o)
5	1397692800	Couldn't put it down.  Fascinating  storyline. I think this is one of my favorites this year!  I was hooked in the first few pages.
3	1397692800	It steadily lost grip along the way.  The beginning was provoking and although it remained  compelling enough to keep reading, it became needlessly drawn out and repetitive.
5	1397692800	Beautifully written. Sweet, yet heartbreaking. If only everyone loved so deeply & selfishly the world would be a happier place. Loved it!
5	1397692800	It was a great book. So reminds you of the twists and turns in your own life! Don't dwell in the past.
5	1397606400	This book really made the reader think.  My book club had a stimulating discussion about the &#34;rights and wrongs&#34; and decision-making of the characters.
5	1397606400	If you're in the mood for a good book that you just can't put down you have got to read this!
5	1397606400	A wonderful story which is thought provoking & intriguing.  I could hardly wait to continue reading it each evening.  The moral dilemma is not clear cut.
4	1397606400	Heart wrenching story!  I was torn between characters.  The book was a little slow at times, but a true representation of the things we do for love.
4	1397606400	Choosen by someone in our bookclub; but really enjoyed; too much time spend on writing &#34;fluff&#34; while he was in jail.
5	1397606400	So descriptive without being burdensome.  I don't understand Isabel's mindset, but I truly appreciate the insights we have into her character.  Tom and his suffering, I understand.  A little gem of a story from the early 1900s on; the pleasure is in the story of loss, gain, loss, and more loss.  However, the viewpoint is never hopeless, but instead, despite everything, there is a sense of wonder at the capriciousness of life, marriage, and more life.  I approached this book as the dreaded &#34;chick book&#34;, as my wife purchased it for her book club, but I am not too proud to say that I am a better man for having read this book, nor am I ashamed to say that I am sorry for my initial reaction as to what I thought the book was.  This is often a difficult read for the emotions it brings forth, especially with regard to a child who cannot understand what has happened to her.  excellent book, I recommend for anyone who cares about what makes us maddeningly human.
3	1397606400	This was a good book in terms of human dynamics and exposure to a different part of the world.  I suppose it was interesting to find out something about early lighthouse technology, too.  However, the drama just kept unfolding and I found myself wondering, &#34;Will this ever end?&#34;  It's one thing when an unfolding story keeps you spellbound.  This was more a an old record with a scratch, and the needle just kept repeating the same part of the song.
4	1397606400	The beginning did not actually draw me in which is why I gave it 4 stars. However, I stuck with it because it was on my book club's read for the month to discuss. How happy I am that I stayed with it. Stedman, the author truly reveals the struggles within of all characters their strengths and weaknesses. A wonderful story of love, loss, forgiveness,  and commitment.
4	1397606400	you never know what is going to happen. loved it!!!I would have changed t ending a little, but nothing is perfect.
5	1397606400	One of the best books I have EVER read!!The characters are wonderfully developed! The plot is intense! Not everyone wins in the end, but who can fix this is the prevailing question!
5	1397520000	A very touching story.  A reminder that there is no black and white in real life - only gray and how dealing with that gray shapes your life.
5	1397520000	It held you from the beginning until the end.  It was a lovely love story.  I had tears in my eyes when it ended!
5	1397520000	Great insight into human decisions and moral issues.  Helped me to think in terms of personal choices and their consequences.
5	1397520000	I really enjoyed this heart-tugger...just what if??? What if you were Isabel, or Tom...Hannah or Lucy??? How would you feel? What would you have done? I loved the story and how all of the lives entertained. The storms on sea or land and how to navigate life's choices...
5	1397520000	Well written with prose, vivid imagery and thoughtful storyline.  Love that the ending wasn't neatly tied with a bow.  Enjoyed every page...
3	1397433600	2 Chapters could've been eliminated...too descriptive...and boring.Though lengthy this was a good read.Would not recommend this book to friends.
5	1397433600	It was fabulous.  I'd say it was a sad book but very moving and I had a hard time putting it down.  It gets five stars for sure.
4	1397433600	An excellent read explores the havoc brought into everyone's life after one couple chooses to relieve their own pain by any means necessary.Well written; deeply developed characters;interesting story line.  As importantly, the book asks readers to answer the question....how would I behave in this situation?
5	1397433600	The twists and turns in this book kept me guessing the whole way and the ending was very touching.  I really enjoyed it. The characters were well drawn, and the metaphors captivating.  The philosophical questions raised make it a great story for book club discussions.
5	1397433600	Unique story line and beautifully written. One that will remain in your memory. Excellent. Would have never know of this book had it not been for my book club. One that you want to never put down. M.L. Stedman is truly a gifted author.
5	1397433600	I loved this book.  It was a very unique story line and the book was very engaging.  I would highly recommend this book.
3	1397433600	This is not the type of book a typically ready (book club selection) but it turned out to be a good story.  Nothing fancy - just solid story telling.
5	1397347200	enjoyed the book. great descriptions of characters and places. Would recommend the book and definitely read another by this author.
5	1397347200	This book forces its readers to reflect deeply on their own values of family and faith and what betrayal means as we are faced with choices that impact those we love as well as what is considered 'right and/or wrong.  I was pulled in to the characters struggles to discern their own understanding of human emotion, frailty, truth and consequence on its rawest and deepest level. I sobbed at the books end. Sobbed.
5	1397347200	At first I wasn't sure where this novel was going than got into it and couldn't and couldn't read fast enough.  Having a Kindle is different than a book in your hands and you can flip to the end and get an idea how it will end.Don't know when I have been so emotionally involved with the characters I felt their hurt right to my toes.A truly beautiful story.  Recommended to many others.
4	1397347200	Well written and enjoyable. I dropped the rating to four stars because I kept thinking that Lucy was a tad bit unbelievable, as a child. But the story is worth it. I may be the only one who had a hard time connecting with Lucy. Also, the tense switched from past to present and I didn't like that. I don't understand why the author did that.
5	1397347200	The best book I've read in a long time. Couldn't up it down. Well written and an easy read. I give it 5 stars....
4	1397347200	Loved the setting of this story and the technical details of working a lighthouse but did not like Isabel for putting her husband in such a no win position....just wanted to scream at her to return the child and adopt a child....I am sure there were many available at that time after a war.
4	1397347200	We'll realized descriptions of the light and it's environs. These tie the emotional lines of this story together making it all very real and moving for the reader.
2	1397347200	Fascinating depiction of the stark and isolating culture that surrounds the job of &#34;manning&#34; a lighthouse. However, once the romantic relationship is introduced, the story is short on details around the couples relationship until they face a dilemma regarding how to add to their family. The central conflict becomes the only focus of the story and waxes melodramatic and long at times. I did think the conclusion was a realistic one and somewhat satisfying because it wasn't too convenientally wrapped up.
5	1397347200	This is an amazing and captivating story. The love, loss and circle of relationships throughout keep you reading and wanting more.
4	1397347200	A moral dilemma I would not ever want to be in.This is a beautiful but very sad story told about good people that make a very bad choice.A lot to discuss in way of what is right, or best for whom.Our club enjoyed it very much. While we didn't all agree on many points.
4	1397260800	Compelling story. It was sad at times and uplifting at other times. Interesting ending. I liked learning about lighthouse operation.
3	1397260800	I read it in one day, parts were unrealistic at times but had a good ending. It is a very soft read.
4	1397260800	It was a very entertaining book.  Made you really think and wonder what would I do?  Great setting for the story.
5	1397260800	Beautifully written with a rhythm that pulled me through it.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Highly recommend it.
4	1397260800	It was a pulling read.  The desperatness of it all was sad and yet expressed love.  I'd recommend it... Stick with it.
5	1397174400	This is a very well written story. You felt the emotions and heartache of the characters. I hate that I waited so long to read it!
5	1397174400	This is a wonderfully written, heart wrenching story of love and values.  It really makes one think about what you think you might do in the situation.  Just be sure to have your Kleenex handy.
5	1397174400	This book was chosen by a member of our book club.  I read it and really enjoyed it.  Love the characters!  It's a good book for discussion.  What would you do?
4	1397174400	It was an easy read for me, but not for all the members of the book group.  We hire a facilitator and she wanted to know if we thought it was a man or a woman who wrote the book since there was no picture of the author.  The main characters are developed well and the outcome of the story is not what I expected.  There are many different solutions to the situation so it held my interest.
3	1397174400	This book was a little slow in the beginning, got better in the middle, and suffered in the end.  It was a good story, but i didn't't care enough about the characters to feel the emotional payoff in the end.  I will say, i really like the author's writing style.  Beautifully descriptive without going overboard.  I would definitely read another book by this author.
4	1397174400	I really loved this book.  The author knows how to tell a wonderful story, and I had a hard time putting it down.
5	1397174400	My mother told me about this book.  She is my adopted mother, and the only mother I've ever known.  My parents adopted me when I was six months old.  This book really pulled at my heart strings!  It made me think about what would have happened if my natural mother ever came back into my life and how it would affect me and others.  I love the only parents I've ever known so I had a really hard time with how this story ended up...
5	1397174400	My Book group just finished and reviewed this novel and consistently rated it a 4.5 out of five stars.  M.L. Stedman has written a very moving novel and the characters come to life on the page.  A story of love and loss that you won't soon forget.
5	1397174400	This book held my interest until the very end.  At times it was emotionally draining.  I'm looking for more by this author.
5	1397088000	This book was fantastic. It was chosen for our book club this month and we all agree- best book we have read in a long time.
5	1397088000	I had a hard time to get into the book, but after a few chapters I couldn't stop reading. Great first novel. I'd recommend it.
4	1397088000	This was an easy read, read it on vacation, nice story with some interesting twists and turns.  I suggest you put this on your summer reading list.
5	1397088000	A heartbreaking yet uplifting  story of love between a lost little girl and the couple who unlawfully adopted her, before being forced to return her to her birth mother. Central to the story is a lighthouse set on a small island south of Perth, manned by a WW1 veteran, at the confines of the Indian Ocean and the Southern Seas. This book had been recommended by my sister. I had to give it five stars for the beauty of not only the story but that of the writing. I have not yet dried my tears.
4	1397001600	Beautifully writtten...a real page turner.  Very reaalistic......would be a very difficult decision for any couple who had faced the tragedies they had
5	1397001600	EnJoyed the book, for it kept you interested the whole way through. A good read and interesting about the area and time.
5	1397001600	I fell in love with the charachters.  The author allows you to know and understand them individually .  Moms should read and share.
3	1397001600	So many glowing 5-star reviews swayed me to read. I wish I hadn't. It's a interesting turn of events, that ultimately leads to a heart-breaking story. A frustrating situation with no clear answer and none that can possibly lead to a happy resolution. The pace in the middle section was extremely slow and could have used some trimming.
5	1397001600	This book had so many turns, twists and surprises.  I loved this book and would highly recommend it.  We read it in our book club and had a lively conversation !
5	1397001600	Ghosts of the past, the miracle of new life, the pain of lives lost, betrayal, forgiveness and redemption come together to make an epic, yet quick-to-read tale in this impressive first novel of Ms. Steadman's. The characters are deep and complicated. She takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves us with the exhilarating sensation that we've just been on a journey through time and to Western Australia. More please, Ms. Steadman.
5	1397001600	Both sides of a situation are presented with understanding and compassion.  The writing is beautiful with descriptions that enhance the visual images and tormenting decisions. The reader gets inside the head of each main character to learn the needs that make up his or her essence.  It becomes clear as to how one can become embroiled in a situation that  begins out of kindness but spirals out of control.  This is probably one of those books I could read again and again.
5	1397001600	Kept my interest from the first paragraph.  No boring parts.Lots of twist and turns.....and the ending.....WOW.  Be prepared.  Enjoy.
5	1396915200	What an incredible book. I never expected to feel what I felt with this book. It is so good, I laughed and I did cry. Sometimes you just never know what will happen in life.  And whatever it is you want, remember, you have to live with that desire should it be granted. Sometimes, there is no turning back.
5	1396915200	On all sorts of levels this book works!  From the beginning I connected with the main character and cared about him throughout the book.  I loved his passion for the lighthouse, for his wife, for the child and for others.  The conflict between his passions made me stop reading because I cared too much and then return because I couldn't leave the book unfinished.  In some of the descriptions of the plot it sounds like a single moral conflict is the center of the story but for me the heart of this book is a good man with a hard road to follow through life and how he makes his life meaningful and moral in the only way he can.  This is a book that I keep hoping to find and only rarely comes along.
5	1396915200	One of the best books I have ever read. I learned so much about my own life sharing in Tom and Izzy's struggles.
5	1396915200	Great Australian atmosphere, interesting stuff about period lighthouses, and lots to think about in the moral dilemma presented. Five stars.
4	1396915200	Enjoyed the story very much. I would recommend this book to all readers.It is fascinating and an easy read also.
3	1396915200	The only thing good about this book was the description of the area. The story itself was too depressing and frustrating to enjoy.
5	1396915200	First time I read something on a Kindle and I wasn't sure I'd like it but this book made it a real joy.  Hard to put down and full of moral dilemmas that really make the reader think.
4	1396915200	When Tom became the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock he was meticulous in its upkeep and record keeping.  After all her survived the Great War a whole person.  His new bride lost both of her brothers in that same war--she is alive with the idea of having lots of children.  So after four miscarriages, the last at 7 months, she feels God has given her a gift when a live baby arrives in a beached boat--A baby only a few weeks old.  How can she give it up!  How can Tom report this find to the authorities--along with the fact that the baby was accompanied by a grown man--already dead in the boat!It was hard to put the book down as it becomes obvious that not far away another woman is grieving the loss of her husband and child.  How will all this be resolved?  At times a bit contrived, it is a compelling story of love, honesty, and compassion.
5	1396915200	Very well written and thought provoking. It presents quite a moral dilemma, should they confess to finding and keeping the baby, who should parent this child, how will justice be served, and how to forgive. The author writes wonderful descriptive passages.
3	1396915200	The storytelling is good; the plot is interesting and yet it seems to unfold too slowly and to a predictable end.  The life lesson from this story is that lying never brings the happiness and joy expected.  It is an old tale because human beings have continued to learn this lesson for the eons.  Women will like this book for the emotional dimension of the characters; men might like it for the technical aspects of lighthouses that are woven into the plot.  It is aptly named and also refers to the light of truth between the land of the living and the land of the dead.
4	1396828800	I felt the beginning and end were a little smaltzy, but the middle really delivered.  Enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
5	1396828800	I read this book in preparation for discussing it at a book group.  Wow...what a find.  So well written and easy to get caught up in the characters and the plot.
3	1396828800	There just couldn't be a happy ending with this one. Nice writing.  Nice imagery, the lighthouse. Light, but not constant after their lives with Lucy ended
4	1396828800	This book stArted slow but the heart wrenching story got better and at the end I needed to k ow what happened.
5	1396828800	This book is special. I start reading,thinking it as an overly descriptive piece with out any substance. As the characters emerged I became fascinated by the way the author put them out there in a way that the reader would find difficulty with judgement of any of them. I did find subtstance . This is a brilliant novel.
5	1396742400	I loved this story. It was one that I found myself thinking about for several days after I completed reading it.
5	1396742400	Can't remember reading such a moving tale of love and forgiveness. Janis will stay with me to quite some time.
4	1396742400	The question is &#34;what would you do?&#34; In a similar situation.  Torn between motherhood and doing what's right creates a relationship of stress and decreasing communication between husband and wife.  Stedman's descriptions create a page-turner .
4	1396742400	Great story. Captivating.  It is a compelling read.  I couldn't put it down.  As one who has lived on the coast for years, I found the sea descriptions familiar and could imagine living on the lighthouse.  The story of Lucy is life of many small children.
4	1396742400	I read this for my book club. It was well written with good characters. Certainly thought provoking. One of the best books we've read so far.
4	1396742400	Good story of a different life from a different time. First half somewhat slow and repetitive.  Can't imagine the turmoil with all the decision making.
5	1396742400	A romantic opening belies a tragic story. A surprising twist in this story creates tension that keeps you turning the pages. Couldn't put it down! It ends on a high note.
3	1396742400	The Light Between Oceans is a commendable attempt to capture the toll of WWI on a small coastal community in Australia through the character of a surviving soldier and his struggle to start life again as a lighthouse keeper.
5	1396742400	As a mother, I can't remember when a book last moved me this much. Beautifully written and filled with exquisite torment. It made me hold my daughter tight and pine for the sea. Gorgeous read.
5	1396656000	I haven't cried like this in a very long while. I'm not sure who to cheer for. I see no winners. Well written, wonderfully written but sad as heck. One of the best I've read. I don't like long reviews and don't write them.The story is told from the perspective of each character. This gives it depth, and allows the reader to understand the emotions of each person. In the end it's hard not to feel sad for everyone. 5 stars all the way, you'll cry too.
5	1396656000	The writer does a great job of developing the characters. The book starts off slow but picks up speed, giving the reader unexpected twists and turns right up to the very end.  Highly recommend it!
5	1396656000	This was the best book I have read in a long time. The story has many possible endings and yet the right one was chosen. Can't say more than that without giving away the ending. But I cried and I never do that reading a book!
5	1396656000	This book was the choice this month for our book club. It was a fast read, but one with many nuances.  Lively discussion among our group 're the various decisions the characters made. Loved learning about so many trees and birds indigenous to AUSTRALIA.  Perhaps a new edition should include a glossary of meanings.Our group gave the book high marks.
5	1396656000	M. L. Stedman beautifully draws his very real characters.  The charactors in this story are all of us.  The mistakes, tragedies, hope, bitterness, but most of all, the love.  I recommend this book to all who wish to read about real people.
5	1396656000	Very thought provoking.  The line between right and wrong is not always clear.  I had great sympathy for all of the characters.
5	1396569600	I really enjoyed this book!  Easy and entertaining read- I couldn't put it down.  Intriguing topic and happy to suggest to others.
5	1396569600	It was a book I couldn't put down but the ending was very sad, sort of reminded me of the fatalism of a Hemingway novel.
5	1396569600	This is one of the best novels I've read in 2013--FINALLY! What a heartfelt story. The way M.L. weaved the characters' lives to intersect in a way you never saw coming. It's refreshing to have a critically acclaimed book that delivered.When Tom Sherborne meets Isabelle, he couldn't possibly have known all of what their lives would entail. This couple lived through it all, and that's not a joke. An outstanding read and fast paced--it will keep you turning the pages and hating to put it down.I went through so many emotions reading this. I hated a certain person in the book, but she eventually warmed herself into my heart. What this novel teaches is that we are human, no matter how perfect we try to be. Everyone has a past, and the decisions we make, we have to own up to it and live our lives. Great read! If I could have given this more stars, I most certainly would have!
5	1396569600	This is one of the best books I have read in a long time!  Beginning , middle, end ... Simply a great book. Wonderful character development. Beautiful descriptions of sea and sky. Both joyful and sad.
5	1396569600	Entertaining tale on love and loss and the power in between. Absolutely loved these characters of a different time and place. I also love the ocean and that is what drew me to the tale. Ebb and flow of the stars and tides, leads some to make incorrect decisions based on their desire. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a interesting read about people, their motives and choices, and how what can appear innocent and good for some is not always best for everyone.
5	1396569600	This book will haunt you! This page turning story is beautifully well written. I cannot stop thinking about the characters, the decisions they made, and the consequences. This is an amazing book that I would recommend to go at the top of the to be read list.
2	1396483200	Sappy, predictable, emotionally manipulative schmaltz. Did enjoy the descriptive writing about the island and learning about the light house. Tom's indecisiveness and second guessing was the biggest cause of everyone's heart ache. If I was Isabel, I'd be mad at him, too.
5	1396483200	A wonderful story full of history, dispair, and love.  I wish it coupled have gone on longer, but I'm glad I had a chance to read this lovely novel!
4	1396483200	This is a very well written book in which each character is fully developed.  I understood and sympathized with their conflicted actions and the pain their decisions inflicted upon them.  The book was hard to put down.  It was also beautifully descriptive of a desolate life on this tiny lighthouse island and how it could be transformed into a loving environment.  My only problem was the ending.  I thought it was trite and overly sentimental.
4	1396483200	Set in a time and place that is interesting in itself, the writing of this novel is fairly straightforward .  She gives us a solid sense of place both in the tiny town and on the island.  The characters are credible and interesting and I was held by the drama.  Others will give chapter and verse in their reviews so I will skip that.  Is it worth reading?  Yes.  Was it compelling?  Yes.  Slightly irritated by the early voice of the child but it set up the contrast to the later voice.
4	1396483200	A heart-wrenching story.  So much love yet selfishness too.  At times I felt the story was a little far flung, but I couldn't put it down.
5	1396396800	If faced with a similar situation ..what would I do?  That is a question I asked myself throughout the book. Aside from that ever present thought, I got some insight into the life of a lamp keeper.  It takes a very special person to choose that way of life.  Loved the book and would recommend it.
5	1396396800	I  loved this story, because it presented an ethical delema. I could sympathize with the Mother, being a mother, myself, and thinking she could get away with raising this child, and no one would find out, but at the same time, the husband, who knew right from wrong, was being tormented. The ending was so sad, but gratifying to see the little girl didn't forget where she came from, as a grown woman.This would be a great read for any Book Group!!
5	1396396800	This was a real page-turner for me! It was set in a magical time (early 20th century) and place (off the coast of Australia). The characters were complex and I found myself agonizing over the decisions regarding the proper disposition of the baby (Lucy Grace), as did the characters. The ending was very satisfying and allowed me finally to see what was &#34;the right thing to do&#34;.
4	1396396800	Very well written, had a hard time putting it down once I got started. Lots of twists and turns. Very good read.
5	1396310400	Oh my, this book is really good - you won't want to put it down.  The characters are unforgettable - you'll be thinking about them long after the book is finished.  The book focuses on a complicated dilemma - do you take something that doesn't belong to you if you think no one will be harmed?  And when you find out that you have harmed someone else, do you give it back regardless of the consequences?  Those questions are more complicated by the fact that the item in question is a child.  The author does a wonderful job weaving the tangled webs of longing and inward and outward deceit that drives the actions of the main characters and forever changes the lives of everyone they love.  There is no happy ending here.
2	1396310400	Depressing from start to finish! I kept waiting for some &#34;light&#34; to shine and it never did! I kept reading only because it came highly rated from a friend...I never did see what was redeeming about the book. Sad and depressing cover to cover.
5	1396310400	This book contains characters who seem real. The reader knows them and understands their difficulties and their pains. There is such deep love and forgiveness which only becomes more pure as the characters age. We try our best in this life!
5	1396310400	If you are not ready to have your heartstrings pulled tightly and to be mesmerized by a story, then do not read The Light Between Oceans. Steadman explores the highs of life and its despair; the pain of loss, of treachery and forgiveness. It is true that light can be illuminating, but It can also blind us.
5	1396310400	This is a beautifully written novel that presents the thoughts and emotions of all primary characters. Too often a book's ending will leave you hanging but this one did not. While there could be no &#34;happy-ever-after&#34; for everyone, it was all tied together neatly. Would highly recommend, especially for anyone who ever had or wanted a child.
3	1396310400	We've recently read &#34;Frankenstein&#34; for our book club.  Does isolation cause one to turn into a monster.  This book would make a good follow-up to such a discussion.
5	1396224000	A bittersweet story of decisions made by the main characters in this book and the impact of those decisions on their lives.
5	1396224000	This was a great book!  I enjoyed all of it, but when I got past the 50% mark I had a hard time putting it down.  For me it showed the consequences of not following rules - in this case the rules of the job of a lighthouse operator and the requirement of reporting everything that happens there.  There was no malice in the lack of reporting, but it had long term ramifications on the lives of many people.
4	1396224000	Good read... well written... good pace... predictable story and ending. Interesting view of Australia and lighthouse life.  Ladies bring your kleenex.
4	1396224000	It was heart-wrenching, but a wonderful read. The writer had a wonderful way of expressing emotion and making you identify with all the characters, despite their flaws and mid-guided motivations.
5	1396224000	The book was well written moving the reader along and steadily gripping one's heart. The characters were so alive they became people I knew as if I lived in Partageuse. It was a sea of turmoil as to whom I rooted for at the end of each chapter. The loneliness of Janus forever brightened in the night by the tower light which steered boats to safety became their way of life and the pictures in my mind. An emotionally gripping story with a lovely quiet ending.
5	1396224000	The author was very skilled at bringing in the reader to understand how all parties involved in the story are feeling.  I felt sympathy for all involved in this incredible story....and was on edge until the very end to see how the problem would be resolved.  Each character was developed to the point you felt you knew them.  Great book!
4	1396224000	Not as historical as I was looking for but very interesting tale.  Lighthouse keepers had a difficult and lonely life.
5	1396224000	Delightful story, articulate writer. I could not put the book down and when I had to, I constantly thought of the characters. M.L. Stedman takes you on a wonderful journey with this book!
4	1396137600	It is a tender story of love and concern for a baby but the story jumps and leaves the reader wondering about the loss time.
5	1396137600	I kept wanting to see what would happen, it was beautifully written and the characters were delightful.  I would recommend this to my friends.
4	1396137600	I enjoyed this book. It was picked for our book club.The story line about what is right or wrong had us discussingMany issues. I recommend this book to all my friends!
5	1396137600	This author gave us exquisite character development.  It was thought provoking. How do you make your moral decisions? I could feel their pain.
5	1396051200	This book will be in my top 5 ever until someone knocks it off the list.  I literally COULD NOT stop reading, and yet the story line for me was so painful.  Can't say too much -- don't want to ruin the book.  Just read it!
4	1396051200	This was a story well worth reading. I did not feel that way at first. I almost put it down. But it is my way to always make it to the end . So I persevered and I am glad I did. The beginning of the book did not allow me to become. Immediately involved with the characters. It seemed to jump in time too quickly for me to become vested in the people I was reading about. However, when the real action began, I quickly started to care and by the final pages read with tears in my eyes and a caring for all involved in my heart. Read it....it will capture your heart too.
3	1396051200	I read this book because it was a pick for my book club. The book was a little slow moving at the beginning, but picked up early enough to stick with it. I would describe it as good read, but nothing special. I felt frustrated with a lot of the choices the characters made and some seemed very unrealistic. There were a couple surprise twists towards the end that helped, but the ending was very short and cut off. All in all, this book brought is a great one for discussion at a book club group and worked very well in that venue, but I would say don't go out of your way to read it on your own.
5	1396051200	Really enjoyed this book. Could not put it down! Recommend it for any book club. We will be reviewing it on a boat ride. So fitting!
2	1395964800	Took forever to get to the point.  Can not believe I read the whole thing. Learned something about old lighthouses.
5	1395964800	Gripped me from the first sentence....the decisions made could have cost much more than was paid.  Yet no one paid for theirbigotry against the Austrian.
4	1395964800	Left me wondering about Tom's complete devotion to Izzy, yet her need to have a child foremost over her love for Tom. Great read however.
5	1395964800	Great book. But I cried more in this book than any other I have ever read:( would recommend this book
5	1395964800	Enjoyed the characters that were brought to life so vividly by the author.  It was hard to put this book down!  A story of love & forgiveness told beautifully.
5	1395964800	I loved this book. It was well written. It kept me reading;although it was very sad at times and I cried!I will read it again and other books written by this author.
1	1395964800	I despised this book. Finished it like medicine. Verbose and self-serving. Is that we enough to make you think twice before shelling out dollars spent on far greater stories? Hope so
5	1395964800	It has been a long time since a book has drawn me in like this one.  Be prepared!  You cannot put it down!  The characters jump off the pages in this beautifully written book.  Think you cannot relate to a lighthouse keeper in a remote part of the world?  Oh, yes you can because the description of the surroundings and the depiction of the people involved is just perfect.  This is a wonderful book.
4	1395964800	I really enjoyed this book as it covered all the human emotions.  And leaves you wondering, what would you do?
5	1395964800	A WONDERFUL BOOK READ BY BOTH MYSELF, MY HUSBAND  AND MY DAUGHTER.  IT WAS HARD TO HAVE OUR HEART STRINGS TUGGED ON THIS MUCH.  MR. STEDMAN  IS A MASTER AT THE PSYCHOLOGY  OF HIS PROTAGONISTS!
5	1395964800	I first thought I kind of knew how it would end. I was wrong. I kept thinking what I would have done were I in such a situation.  I kept changing my mind and balancing the right and wrong.  Still war with the decisions.Loved the characters.  Don't want to give away the story.Read it because my daughter said I would like it.  She's a mystery lover but she enjoyed this book.
5	1395964800	This book was page-turning almost from the first chapter. A mixture of sadness and happiness was sprinkled throughout the plot. The Australian terminology, setting, and dialect added an interesting aspect. The characters' pain and suffering were heart-breaking. Our book club loved it.
5	1395964800	Excellent book by a new author. It is a very moving story about a young couple who move to an island off the coast of Australia and find a baby in a boat. What transpires next is about  the power of love, doing what is right, and forgiveness. For some it will bring you to tears.
5	1395964800	I found this book to be so moving. What is a husband-and-wife to do when they lost the only child that they can ever had and suddenly find a baby  true mother on land small-town finds out the baby is alive. Ensues fight for a baby's life between two parents and my mind i the baby becomes the light between the two options because both of them love her so much and have to decide what to do about her future is truly a wonderful book
5	1395878400	Held my interest all the way. It was different from the usual run of the mill. Would like to have known more about the cause of the father's death, unless it was starvation. But then, why was the baby alive?
4	1395878400	This story was well written and engaging. Looked forward to my reading time each night to continue seeing how Izzy and Tom would or could right the wrong that was so lovingly committed. The ending was perfect.
3	1395878400	No one in this novel came out with a happy outcome. It was truly a tragic story  and hard to imagine the main couple involved actually could have  consciously  behaved the way they did. Of course it is a novel and not a true story, however, life does give us instances where the unconscionable  does occur.
5	1395878400	This was an amazing read all the way through! I loved every minute and could not put it down! Very well written!
5	1395878400	This novel took me through every emotion towards all the main characters. The storyline had me immediately hooked and I have not read a story in a very long time with such effective use of imagery. I will definitely read it again and highly recommend it!
5	1395878400	It was most interesting to read this book about a lighthouse off the SW Weatern australian coast at the time the search is underway for the missing Malaysian airliner. What an isolated, but fascinating life for the lighthouse keeper.We think that the effects of war are a new thing, but many soldiers returned from WW1 and WW11 damaged too, and they had no help available. An easy read, but most enjoyable.
4	1395878400	Very we'll written. Great story and compelling characters. Felt like I was in Tom's shoes while I was reading. Beautifully descriptive and emotional.
5	1395878400	Beautiful writing. Got completely caught up in the story and was reluctant to finish. Characters are clearly drawn and the suspense builds. Enjoyed every moment
5	1395878400	Fabulous book! I couldn't put it down....especially the last 100 pages! I also enjoyed learning about that coastal region too!
5	1395878400	I just loved this book. It started of very slow but it progress constant. I loved all the characters. Toms seems with time a little cold hearted but he was high in morals. Isabelle is like most women a bit emotional. The real victim here is Lucy.I can't fathom you mom abandon youse that age and you need to get used to another women being your mom, but she seemed to handled it well after while. I just wish there was more of a story in the adjustment period.
5	1395878400	This was a compelling story.  I loved the wisdom that the author imparts with her readers.  It was hard to put this book down!
3	1395792000	As I thought it would be. It seemed like such a long story about one thing that got a bit boring. The ending picked it up a bit though. I also didn't like how Tom and Isabel`s relationship turned out.
4	1395792000	Glad I read this....characters were involving and the writing is good.  Interesting to see how early choices play out over time.
5	1395705600	M. L. Stedman was born to be a writer.  Her story touched my heart.  Her writing was like poetry. Her characters were brought to life as each page turned.  My hope is to read another novel by her.
5	1395705600	This is a very well written book with a lot of emotion. You can really feel the emotion in each of the characters and relate to them. That's about all I can say without spoiling the ending.
5	1395705600	A colleague recommended the book to me as a favorite of hers. I really enjoyed learning about the history of the lighthouses of Australia. Could not figure out how it would end.
3	1395705600	It was interesting because of the location and time frame. Even the basic idea had potential but I found the characters to be one dimensional. The possibility that living such an isolated existence could lead to mental issues should've been explored further. Otherwise izzy's behavior is not believeable and the long-suffering Tom was equally incredible.
5	1395705600	Beautifully written prose by a first time novelist that will tear at your heart and give you a glimpse of Australian life.
3	1395705600	Characters lose their focus and act irrationally and out of character. Also change of life in Isabel's mid-twenties? Ridiculous!! An interesting book but needed to be developed more fully.
5	1395705600	I couldn't put it down. Very emotional. We must live with our decisions. What is right? One baby, two mothers.
5	1395705600	I loved that it challenged me.  It was a wonderful warm, scary, exciting story.  My Book club is reading for the month of July.  I can Hardly wait to talk about it with the girls.
4	1395705600	Very well written.good insight into human nature. I strongly suggest I am planning to read other books. By this author
5	1395705600	Heart wrenching. Left me wanting to know more about a lot of the people in this wonderful story. Life has many tools in her bag of teachings!!
3	1395705600	Perhaps it's my gender, my age, my slow pace of reading, the fact that I don't read much fiction these days, or all of those things, but I felt a little too disconnected throughout the novel. I enjoyed the story, and it dutifully employed many of the techniques of good classic literature to establish mood, create symbols, and flesh out the issues from every possible perspective, but I was never so caught up in the story that I just couldn't put the book down. In fact, I put it down for long periods before taking it up again. Maybe that also contributed to my disengagement. Or maybe I just didn't find the topic itself very compelling. Maybe this is a &#34;girl's&#34; novel.The novel is a good effort and it's well constructed, and for those reasons and the fact that the characters are developed so well, I give it three stars.
3	1395705600	The book is somewhat heavy and deals with the human family.  The setting is Australia and the dialogue is really interesting.There is a fair degree of conflict as the book deals with a lost child and the family who raises it.  I would recommend the bookwhich reads well and sustains a level of mystery which kept my attention,
5	1395705600	I enjoyed the book very much and found it a page turner.  The characters felt real.  The situation was possible.
5	1395705600	The writing alone makes this a worthy read. The author has a command of metaphor and description that delights. Factual knowledge complements and enhances the story so that characters are realistic. The story itself is heartfelt without being sappy. It makes you wonder how you might feel and react as each character.
4	1395705600	Enjoyed reading this for my book club and it was a tear jerker in a couple of places. It was a page-turner during some parts but could be very slow as well, especially in the beginning. Keep going and it'll get better. I like how it was not an easy, perfect ending.
5	1395705600	The author weaves a detailed and well written account of life in a remote light station with a young couple who by circumstance becomes embroiled in the death of a man washed ashore in his small boat and the discovery of his surviving infant daughter whom the couple quietly takes on as their own.
4	1395619200	A very well written tale of ethical dilemmas, love and family.  Depressing at times...very well written.  Thought provoking at the very least.
4	1395532800	Sorry. Why are more words required when I don,t want to say anything?  This is an imposition.  Very nice story but I,m not sure what it all means..
5	1395532800	This book is an amazing ride for your heart. Soaring joy that stretches to the horizon transforms to complex heartbreak that can't be untangled and then changes again to transcendant existential peace. A spectacular journey -- take it
2	1395532800	Perhaps because I experienced a stillbirth, this book made me cry. It also made me angry. Tom's decision to clear his conscience was a enormous stroke of selfishness and stupidity. As a result, five people were made utterly miserable. If I didn't have to read this book for Reading Club, I wouldn't have chosen it. I like my reading a bit on the sunny side.
5	1395532800	Wow - what happens when you're out away from civilization and things happen that you can, if you want, make not fit into black and white, but are very much shades of gray?  I found this a fascinating novel - the characters were enjoyable and relatable, and this novel really makes one think about moral relativism.  You can enjoy it simply as a fascinating story, or you can dissect it and try to wonder what you might do in such a circumstance.  I read this as part of a reading group and it provided a wonderful discussion after reading it.  Highly recommended!!!
5	1395532800	Felt like I was on the island.  Felt my own memories of almost motherhood and motherhood swirl around in my head.  Highly recommend.
5	1395446400	This was such a good book!  The story was so touching.  It really speaks to your heart about how great a love you develop for your children.  So touching.  Lots of highs and lows.Love it Love it Love it!!!
5	1395446400	I loved how the story devolved and the conflict the main character struggled with. His devotion to his job wife and daughter made you believe in his character. Great character development!
5	1395446400	This book has a marvelous plot in which right seems wrong and wrong seems right. Stedman puts it together in a way that is beautifully crafted with descriptions that are worth the read even if the plot wasn't so intriguing. This book is not in any way predictable. I just finished it and am already preparing to read it again.
5	1395446400	I loved this book, which was a kindle gift from a friend.  At first I thought, how interesting could the life of a lighthouse keeper be? But by the end of the first chapter I was hooked.  I tore through it in 2-1/2 days because I couldn't put it down.  The story will pull at your heart and make you question what you would do if a dead man and a crying baby washed up on shore in a boat and you were in a remote part of the world. Don't answer so fast -- this book will make you question what you think is right.  Highly recommend.
4	1395446400	Unusual story of an unusual people in an harsh but captivating location.  Australia is always old and new me fascinating read sad story but very easy to fall under its spell!
5	1395446400	We read this book for our book club. I thoroughly enjoyed the telling of these characters lives and the life of a lighthouse keeper.
5	1395446400	Having had much loss in my life including a child, this novel rang so true of the emotions we share as we make our way through the losses we have in life. The simple wisdom and message of forgiveness of others in our life is so vital in the journey through grief of the losses we can have. This book speaks to that in a poignant way. A definite must read.
5	1395360000	This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The story is told with such clarity that you can imagine yourself being in the role of each character.  I couldn't put the book down, but when I had to, it was on my mind constantly until I could find out what was going to happen next.  This would be a great book for discussion in a book club. I'm sure there would be many diverse opinions about the ending.
5	1395360000	Loved this book. You know it's a good book when you continue to think about the characters long after you have finished the book. I whish the author had more books.
4	1395360000	This book starts off good, gets slow in the middle, then gets crazy!!  I am not sure how I feel about the ending yet but I know it made me not want to put the book down. If you get any sort of anxiety from books this may not be the one for you but I enjoyed it.
4	1395360000	provided insights into a different kind of life in a different age with inevitable outcomes -- characters were well developed and poignant
5	1395360000	I could really get into this book, and loved reading into it every night, going to bed.I took it with me on a 2-week vacation in Paris, staying in a condo in the Marais with a long-time college friend . . . and, such a treat it was to have it along with me.The setting, the characters, their relationships, the baby . . . ALL of it I found very moving . . . sigh.Am not a pro at reviews, but want you to know this was my FAVORITE book our book group has ever selected.  Thanks!
3	1395273600	I enjoyed reading this story but felt like I had read it before.  I like a bit of the unusual, which I did not find here, and could have predicted the outcome almost at the beginning.  It followed a predictable pattern.  I would use the term &#34;Beach Read,&#34; for this book.
4	1395273600	Very good learned a lot about love and lossCharacters were very realIt had a bittersweet endingI recommend it
5	1395273600	This was picked for a book group I am in and it was great.  The writing was so inviting--descriptions and character development. It made for a great discussion.  Everyone thought it was well written and interesting.
5	1395273600	A Gripping tale of how love of a child is sometimes as painful as it is joyful. A love dichotomy, if you will. A beautifully told story.
5	1395273600	This was an interesting tale of how our lives are influenced by the many decisions we make along the way.
5	1395273600	Very intriguing story.  Wonderful with the emotions of life.Liked it that my thoughts about the possible ending were not predictable.
5	1395273600	Frequently novels can be one-dimensional and predictable.  By setting this novel in western Australia, on a light house, in the early 1900s we see the play out of a tightly-woven history and war its effects played out in a skillful manner that entertains and arouses thought about the characters and ourselves when we are at the most vulnerable.  An excellent read which doesn't play with emotions and isn't predictable.
4	1395273600	Believable characters and moral dilemma, but very depressing.  I would've like to see more happen in last portion of the story.
5	1395273600	I really enjoyed reading this book. She really brought the characters to life. I felt like I knew them.The story was excellent and very easy to read. I will read it again!
4	1395273600	Great read!  Loved the period piece and the locale.Very interesting and complex characters  really felt like you were getting to know them
5	1395273600	This book grabs you from the very first page.It will also question your own morales. This is a fast read.
4	1395273600	Excellent character development with a plot that consistently gives surprises. Interesting setting that I am less familiar with so it was fresh for me.
5	1395273600	For me, absolutely the best ever.  I did not want it to end so, when my Kindle showed me at 75%, I started reading VERY slowly.  Cannot believe this is M.L. Stedman's first novel - what a talent he is! His character development and their back-stories are handled flawlessly, suspense so well-delivered.  The challenge of listening to your heart amid religious and moral considerations, the consequences of every decision we make realized, the kaleidoscope that is life - all come together in this delicious story to which each and every one of us can relate.
5	1395273600	I read this book because it was chosen by my book club.  I actually wasn't going to finish it initially.  The beginning of the book seemed to move slowly .  But the last 3/4 of the book was captivating!  I couldn't put it down.  The descriptions of the emotions that the characters were experiencing came alive.  The turmoil and indecision of the main character were heart wrenching. I found myself finishing the book at 5:00 in the morning!  I am so glad I persevered past the first few chapters.
3	1395187200	I found the first half very interesting, but it went slowly downhill.  I felt the end to be quite predictable.
5	1395187200	I couldn't put it down. Great visualization of an island in an expanse of water and how it would be to live there, as well as being a powerful symbol of what was going on in the lives of the main characters at the time. I will read it again and again.
4	1395187200	Unusual plot; unexpected twists; good development of characters. The reader asks itself  if it would act the same way as the wife or the husband
5	1395187200	Wonderful story!  Didn't want it to end!  Descriptions were so real felt like living in their world.  Hope authors books are just as good
3	1395187200	I enjoyed this book very much. It presented an ethical dilemma that had me flip flopping throughout the entire story.
3	1395187200	Interesting premise but the characters seemed unbelievable.  Did not feel their emotions that would lead to the actions they took.  But the idea was unique and kept me reading to see how or resolved.
4	1395187200	This is a love story that spans over thirty years and will keep you engaged until it's bittersweet ending.  The theme is that there are consequences to the choices one makes-choices that affect many people.
5	1395187200	It is beautifully written... Transporting you to Australia the unexpected life changing  events and decisions will remain with you well after you close the book. I highly recommend this book!
1	1395187200	I did not like the subject matter of the book and only read it because it was required for book club.
5	1395187200	This is a very thought provoking book. A great read and a page turner.  It made me cry in the end and have continued to think about it. A great book club book.
5	1395187200	This is a story that takes an act of kindness and turns it inside out until every possible consequence is wrung from it. At the end of this expertly drawn tale of human frailty and attachment we are left with a deep sense of understanding and pity for the human condition.
3	1395187200	Well written, good story that will tug at your heart. I could see this as a movie. A family/relationships tested to the brink.
5	1395187200	I loved this book.  It was a little slow at the beginning and hard to get into, but stick with it, because it is worth it.  I couldn't put it down and did nothing until I finished it.  A heart wrenching story that would stir a lot of discussion for book clubs.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.
4	1395187200	King Solomon had an easier decision than the reader has as each character is revealed to be an honorable, loving person deserving to be a parent.
4	1395187200	Good read but predictable plot. It is what I call &#34;an airplane&#34; book. Easy to read but not to exciting.
5	1395187200	Stedman is a very good story teller. This book transported me to another world.  The facts about being a lighthouse keeper were an addedbonus.
4	1395187200	I enjoyed this book very much.  It was well written and interesting the way lives intertwined. I would recommend it.
4	1395187200	Have recommended this book to our Book Club since there is so much to discuss.  You have to get into the heart and soul of themain characters to better understand their decisions.
5	1395100800	M L Stedman wrote a captivating story involving four unforgettable characters whose lives became irrevocably intertwined when a dinghy appeared on the shores of an Australian lighthouse island carrying a dead man and a crying, very alive infant. The consequences of an ill- fated decision affect not only the lives of the main characters but cause the reader to question their own moral compass.  I found I was unable to take sides as I experienced heartfelt sympathy for them all.
4	1395100800	It's a really sad book. One that leaves you feeling kind of empty inside, but it is a really good book. I highly recommend it.
5	1395100800	I did like the truth of life, the good, the bad, the wrong, the right. Emotion, people's frailty. I did like what life's circle of life is lessons to be learned, I would recomend this book.
5	1395100800	The book was very well written and told in a very engaging manner. The story line was good and made the book easy to follow and understand. The intrigue of what washed ashore and the aftermath of events that followed will keep you in suspense.The language that the author ued was challenging but provided an opportunity for my vocabulary to expand.
5	1395100800	Beautiful and lyrical ...  views of island life in a very small town. Fine writing and an intriguing plot. Highly recommend this very literary novel.
5	1395100800	this was a great book filled with people's choices and the dilemmas they end up facing. i highly recommend this book!
4	1395100800	An interesting perspective on living in a very unique position in life.  A great study on how one small decision can irrevocably change your life and the lives of others as well.  It is a poignant story of loss and love and the complexities of life.  AS well as underscoring how love shows its face in many different ways.  Definitely worth the reading!
5	1395014400	Outstanding writing and capture of the human condition including ethical dilemma. My most recommended book to colleagues this year. Next book?
5	1395014400	This book is an all time favourite of mine. Beautifully written, this is a story that is heart breaking and engages the reader in a personal bit of ethical questioning. Right and wrong become so intertwined who knows the answer to this moral dilemma. We read it in my book club and it sparked a very heated discussion.Only negative for me was the ending, it doesn't need the last chapter.
2	1395014400	This could have been a good read if it didn't go on and on and on before getting anywhere. Pretty boring.
4	1395014400	My book club chose to read this novel and I was a little skeptical--the genre isn't my favorite. It was predictable and similar to what I thought it would be. It will test your morals--see who you side with!
4	1395014400	A great book! Really creative and emotionally intense plot line, excellent character development of Tom, wonderful descriptions of life on the tiny island off the coast of Western Australia, and of the details regarding tending a lighthouse. What kept me from ranking this book five-stars? The last third of the book had some very slow-moving and repetitive sections where I felt the author was narrating the plot from 20,000 feet instead of letting us get inside the intense emotions and conflicts of the characters. Unlike Tom, I don't feel like I really understood Isabel's character in many ways -- was that because I am personally more like Tom, or because the book was missing parts of Isabel's back-story that would help paint her character better? I honestly had no idea how Isabel was going to resolve the main crisis in the story, and even after it was revealed, I'm not sure I understood all the reasons behind her decision. Finally, I thought the epilogue was unnecessary, and I would have been happier not knowing how it all turned out 30 years later. But really, these negatives were minor and it was an EXCELLENT book.
5	1395014400	wonderful novel of love, betrayal and redemption.  the need and love of a mother for her child.depending upon the circumstances, some people deserve a second chance.  it's knowingwhen, is the hard part.
5	1395014400	Just finished this sad but beautifully told story. I'm sobbing. My Boston Terrier is bewildered and looks to comfort me. It is a beautiful tale of good people, choices, consequences, forgiveness, appreciation, love. I was completely immersed.
5	1395014400	I loved this book. It drew me in from the first page. The setting of the lighthouse keeper was soothing and peaceful. This is  a story of a strong and good man who strives to do what is right. The female characters will surprise you. I didn't know where they were going to go and alternatively loved and hated them. In many ways, this book reminded me of The Memory keeper' s Daughter.  A good read.
5	1394928000	This is the most intriguing book I've read in a long time.It kept me reading late into the night.It doesn't sugar coat the complicated relationships.I hope you love it as much as I did.I'm definitely putting this on my reread shelf.
4	1394928000	I haven't quite finished reading it yet, but it is an interesting story and certainly tears at your heartstrings.  Can't wait to read the ending!
4	1394928000	Good story about how one decision affects so many peoples's lives.  Am waiting for the book club discussion about how this plot parallels life stories in the book club.
4	1394928000	I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I was sad at the ending, because I wish Izz had been able to see and hold her the baby. This book was also a great read for me because I love the ocean, lighthouses, and I've always wanted to visit Australia.  I actually recommended this book for our library book club. This book was wonderfully written.
5	1394928000	I red this novel back-to-back with Snow Child.  Both were stories that had childless couples are central figures.  The Light Between Oceans is a sad tale with a 100% hero that faces a number of real challenges in this life.  The setting is so real that you can feel the sea mist, hear the wind, ride the seas, climb the Light.  All so very real.  The character are equally real and compelling.
1	1394928000	This is a book an eigth grade girl would enjoy.  It was immature, predictable .  I couldn't wait for it to end.
5	1394841600	This story line was a heart grabber, and one I could identify with, having lost children myself. I can't say I would have done the same things as the characters in this book, but they were very human and understandable. Thought I'd use more tissues.
4	1394841600	I am reading this now. It is an interesting novel. It raises interesting issues and discusses various points of view on them. I also learned more about lighthouses.
5	1394841600	A novel filled with so much love: for spouses, strangers, and children. The conflict in the story cannot compare to the overwhelming sense of love between characters.
5	1394841600	Easy reading.  Hard to put down.  The characters struggle between right and wrong. Great discussion book  for a book club.
3	1394841600	A good book once you get into it and it keeps you interested in finding out what happens next but  not the best ending
4	1394841600	I read the e-book on my Kindle Fire.  This was such a sad, sad story. Circumstances led the characters to make often disastrous choices, leading to an unfortunate turn of events. This love story is about sacrifice, unfulfilled hopes, revenge, compassion and ultimately, survival of the human spirit.
5	1394841600	Beautiful read about life and love. M.L. Stedman does an incredible job of pointing out our emotional weaknesses and the choices we make when driven by it.  This is a must read!
5	1394841600	Wonderful story.  Imaginative, unique and well-written.  This story is fascinating, compelling and truly human. I would read it again.  My mom just finished the audio version and she loved it as well.
1	1394841600	This is the worst book I have read in long time.  If I wanted to read about sorrow and pain this is the book.  Who would want to look at life from Tom's view.  Most people are honest but this book takes it to the extreme.
5	1394755200	This book was interesting and very well written.  The first half of the book I felt like I was retreading The Pearl by John Steinbeck.  I enjoyed this book and would read another book by this author.
5	1394668800	Best book I've read in years.  Looking forward to many more. You have a marvelous talent keeping the reader in suspense.
4	1394582400	I was all water works in the end. Just couldn't stop the tears. You feel so deeply for the main characters and each of their plight. I sympathized with Isabel but also felt so strongly that she was wrong in what she did. I am not a mother so I think that is where my disconnect was but I thought of my mother's love for me and was able to better understand it through Izzy's point of view. You just never know how you will really act when you are put to the greatest tests in your life and more importantly what you do after.
4	1394582400	This book really got you thinking about how you would react.  It is a beautifully toldstory about people's moral compasses and how they can be clouded by life experience.
5	1394582400	A couple living an isolate life in a lighthouse discover a baby in a boat with a dead man and this mystery grabs your interest.  The decisions this couple make about the baby start a chain of events that lead to happiness and then the rest of the world intrudes upon their dream. This story of loss and redemption is well written and provokes interesting discussions in book clubs.
4	1394582400	I really enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is one of those books where you are rooting for those not always making the right choices.  You can't wait to see how it all ends and you hope that somehow it works out for everyone, but you know it can't and shouldn't.  It is tied up nicely at the end.  Maybe not how you wanted it to end, but it was the right way. It's a heartbreaker for sure.
5	1394582400	Beautifully written. One can actually visulize the ocean churning and powerful.The storyline takes the reader to a range of emotions. A great read!
5	1394582400	Started out a bit slow for me but once the plot thickened I literally couldn't put the book down until I finished it! Thank goodness it fell on a weekend so I had the time to do some power reading. LOVED THIS BOOK!
5	1394582400	Very well written expressing the emotions of the two main characters.  A strong moral dilemma that I think many could relate to.
3	1394582400	This book was a good read but a sad story.  Not that there is anything wrong with a sad tale, as it can make one ponder some meanings of life even more.  I liked the story but it is a sad one.
5	1394582400	All of the characters have intense individual and believable story lines.  I felt as though I could relate on all their levels.  This book was gripping and hard to put down.  I really enjoyed it.
5	1394582400	You can't put it down a great novel.  Keeps you interested throughout the whole book.  I would recommend it highly.
3	1394496000	Not one of my fave's although I learned something about Australia and the history and terrain. Too much emphasis on the little girl and at times forgot and had to go back to check some of the inferences. Not a great read for me but was glad about the ending. Ending dragged on too long for me.
3	1394496000	It doesn't seem right to let a book close your throat with tears held back and then dismiss both the book and the feelings with the label&#34;tearjerker.&#34;  The first hundred pages were tedious with moments of lovely descriptions of wind, water and the lighthouse.  Even finding the baby with her dead father was presented without much fanfare.  I almost put the book down for good but meeting Hannah hooked me.  Tom and Isabel were characters Stedman plopped down on the page to move the story.  They simply never interested me.  Hannah's grief counters Isabel's grief and Tom deals with the dilemma.  I felt like I was watching a soap opera that would go on and on and on with character's changing their minds every few episodes.  Soap operas can hook you and get you so involved you want to rewrite the lines.  They can even keep me in bed all morning reading instead of getting on with my day.The book, like Tom's solution, both fails and succeeds, just like life.  There are no easy solutions and deeds done can't be undone.  Okay.  Not only did I hold back the tears by the end of the book my face got wet.  I was moved by the heartbreak of the mess these people made and all the people who were affected by it.  This was a book group choice and it might make for good conversation.  I might even change my mind but oh dear, I've already written this rewiew.
5	1394496000	I enjoyed this book so much. Yes, it was intense and not tied up in a nice neat little bow, but it was amazing. First of all, M.L. Stedman's descriptions of the landscape and characters and locations were so beautiful. I felt the breeze, saw the ocean, smelled the air. Just incredible. The story lets you into the grief of losing a child and how strong that pull of motherhood is. It is also a story of isolation and how you can convince yourself you are doing the right thing. I actually believed in what happened in this novel. Losing a child, is the worst feeling in the world. I can't even begin to imagine what Isabel felt after losing hers. For me, this was a painful, intense, powerful, and beautiful novel. I recommend it to all my friends.
4	1394496000	Many layers of human experience reflecting the pain of life, death, loss, coming of age in a time of war, and exposing the inward struggle of living with integrity. Engaging, challenging,and highly evocative of personal engagement with life divided by truth and deceit.
5	1394496000	This is the most useful and easily read references that is available for archery equipment. All these books are worth while.
5	1394409600	amazing storyline that just broke my heart... it's really emotional and it allows you to really feel what each character is feeling. its like you have an emotional connection with them.
2	1394409600	Did not enjoy it, it was chosen by my book club.  Did not care for the style.  Had a hard time getting into it and could never finish it.
4	1394409600	This was a well written book and a very interesting story. Found that once I reached a certain point I couldn't stop reading. Highly recommend it.
2	1394409600	Interesting from a historical standpoint, but the premise of the storyline was a bit dull . The ability to empathize with the main characters were lost toward the end.
5	1394409600	Amazing on so many levels.  Vivid look at an earlier time and unfamiliar place. Moral dilemmas upon moral dilemma.  Life i
5	1394323200	This was a well-written book and the subject matter was thought-provoking. It actually brought me to tears at the end!
4	1394323200	I enjoyed the language and imagery of the book.  It did seem to slow at different points but is still worth the time to read it.
4	1394323200	The book started out just okay, then got really good toward the middle. I thought the ending was perfect. Would definitely recommend.
5	1394323200	I can't begin to explain the many ways this boos is excellent. From the wonderful, symbolic allegories of the book's setting to the pitch-perfect verbiage that is not only honest and authentic to its time and place, but is also, quite simply, great, poetic prose without overburdening the reader with too lavish detail in its descriptions.
5	1394323200	This book was so interesting that I literally could not put it down.  So I read it in one day and then recommended it to my friends.
4	1394323200	The character development was well done. I empathize with all the main characters. It was a very engaging read. It was better than a lot of books I read lately. Thank you.
4	1394323200	This book, like the lighthouse that is at the center of it, refracts the many lights of many lives and many loves. It takes place in an area of the world I've never even thought about, which, therefore, drew my interest right off the bat. The keeping of the light was a task I'd never considered. The true to life portrayal of the after effects of war on each individual it touched was, to me, such a deep part of the narrative. The loves of all it's characters are so different:  the love between husband and wife, between parent and child, between siblings, between friends. Each type of love is particularly well drawn in each of the character's lives. It is a very different read, one which totally engrosses the reader, and places each deep inside the story. I believe it is a book which I think most readers would find lingers in their minds after the last page has been turned. It is definitely better than your average fiction, is not formulaic, and raises many ideas which truly are part of each individual's life story, just played out in a unique way in each life. Anyone looking for a good piece of fiction should read this imaginative tale.
3	1394323200	I didn't like the mushie story line of this book.  I enjoyed the research that the Author did on the light houses in the late 19th and early 20th century.  I felt that her descriptions of the characters and the scenery were very good.  I probably would not recommend this book to someone else because I didn't enjoy it that much.
4	1394236800	Good character development and an interesting story about an area of the world most haven't seen.  Wrapped up well at the end.
5	1394236800	I selected this book because of its intriguing description but otherwise without expectation.  It turned out to be one of the most moving and beautifully written books I have read in some time.  The characters, setting and circumstances are so skillfully crafted that you find yourself a part of this story, even at time when you wish you weren't.  It touches the soul at it most mournful and exhilarating places.
5	1394236800	I really loved this book!  In fact, it was my choice for book club and ended up being one of the top-three books we read in 2013.
5	1394236800	This is a wonderful read and so much to ponder and discuss that any book club would certainly enjoy it! I, as a woman say to myself, &#34;what would I do in a similar situation&#34;? Every character is so believable and my heart sometimes ached for the predicaments that each one found themselves in.
5	1394236800	This book was very well written and hard to put down.  The characters were well defined and easy to care about.  I liked it because there were no loose ends at the end of the story.
4	1394150400	The Light Between Oceans is a gripping story filled with fallible yet decent characters. Even though I felt driven to continue reading I was filled with a sense of dread - knowing there were going to be repercussions for the decisions that were made. Not knowing how high a price Tom, especially, was going to pay for wanting happiness for his grieving wife, Isabel. Ultimately, I am pleased I was able to finish (within one day) and quite relieved by the post script style ending. I'm quite impressed by this debut novel and look forward to reading more of her work.Read: 08//22/2012
5	1394150400	A great read!! I will be looking forward to this author's next novel. The characters and the circumstances they find themselves in, are very believe able.
5	1394150400	A book that slowly leads you into the core story and you find yourself asking &#34;what would you have done&#34;  Great read!
5	1394150400	The author draws you in and you feel the pain of the choices Tom makes. He demonstrates what true love and marriage may require of spouses.
4	1394150400	A good book to read for anyone looking for a good story -- my only problem with it was the beginning.  I didn't think the reader needed to know so much definition and history about lighthouses.
5	1394150400	Great character development, loved the setting and the theme.  Emotions very clear and easy to relate to.  Well written.  I didn't have the ending figured out before hand!!
5	1394150400	this book grabbed me at chapter one, and I could not put it down.  it made me laugh, and it made me cry, and so much emotion in between.  Tom and Isabelle share a unique love story that was so deep it took them years to fully understand, and perhaps they never did.  The important thing is that they kept trying .
5	1394064000	Easy reading, great setting, different story. It was easy to understand the characters motivations and reactions to their circumstances. Liked the wrap up at the end.
5	1394064000	A riveting book from start to finish- it would also make a great movie.highly recommended for an engaging read
3	1394064000	This was a wonderful story but it was also very sad. So many people with so much loss. Difficult to swallow.
4	1394064000	Excellent book. Deep and thought provoking. Difficult to get through as I am a parent too and couldn't imagine the choices made.
5	1394064000	Story filled with moral dilemmas and choices. Every action has a reaction - sometimes good, sometimes bad. I enjoyed it.
5	1394064000	A moving story with characters you almost know and always have sympathy for.  One of the best novels I've read in a long time.  Surely hope there will others from this author.
3	1394064000	It was slow in parts, but the ending was good . We had an interesting discussion in my book club.
5	1394064000	Not only was the story engaging the style of writing kept me reading. Finished it in 2 days. Loved it's unique story and unpredictable end.
5	1393977600	I'd recommend this to any mother, especially mothers with a daughter.  It tugged my heart strings quite often.  Fathers may be spellbound as well.
1	1393977600	a dreadful predictable read. give it a skip. the main characters were not interesting, they were uni-dimensional. finally, I just didn't care what happened to them.
5	1393977600	I enjoyed the book but wish I could ask a few questions about life on a lighthouse island.I would recommend this book to my friends.
5	1393977600	One of the best three books I have ever read.  Couldn't put it down!!!  Just loved it.  Am recommending it to all my friends.
5	1393977600	I really enjoyed this book all the trials & tribulations of life. Really makes you reflect on your own life
5	1393977600	We read this for our book club.  Everyone loved it.  One of the best we've read so far.  We recommend it to others in book clubs.
5	1393891200	I lloved it! Curl up with a soft throw,stoke the fire,glass of wine and enjoy this wonderful story.(Kleenex required). Share this book.
4	1393891200	Every human emotion is revealed in this book: love fulfilled,, love unfulfilled, duty, honor.  But mostly it showed how selfishness can destroy everything
4	1393891200	this is a book about the choices we make in life and how they affect our futures.  Good character development and effective plot.  This is a good read!
4	1393891200	This book began on a slow note but picked up midway through when Lucy entered. The book was relatable for those wduring ho have suffered the loss of a baby during childbirth. The character's were well developed. Wonderful love story.Wish it had a happier ending.
4	1393891200	It was difficult to get into the book at first but after awhile I couldn't put it down. I couldn't decide what I would have done in the same situation.
3	1393891200	I enjoyed this  book. I felt for Isabel when she had her miscarriages. I can't imagine having to make a decision like they did.
5	1393804800	Read this for my book club.  A little slow in the beginning but I really enjoyed this book.  While some of my friends did not love the ending, I did.
4	1393804800	I read this book for my monthly book club and it took me awhile to get through. I did enjoy the book , but felt it was too long. It was so hard to decide what the right choice was in the end. It has been awhile since I cried reading a book, but the ending brought me to tears. It is amazing to see the love of a mother and her child.
4	1393804800	I thoroughly enjoyed the authors detailed way of writing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a thought provoking book. I would not recommend this story to people who are looking for a more lighthearted read. I found the story to have a thread of sadness that continued to its end.
5	1393804800	I enjoyed this book very much.  The view and life in a lighthouse - and theunfolding of how people's lives changed who lived there was enthralling.
3	1393804800	I thought the plot was very convoluted and designed to maximize the tension, stress and anxiety on the part of the reader.Yes, yes, I know that is the role - to some extent - of the writer but this was over the top to the extent I thought it unbelievable, unlikely and unreal.That said, it does provoke thought on &#34;what if&#34; situations and created a lot of dialog in my book club on who was right, and what the conclusion should have been (if this situation were in any way plausible).
5	1393804800	Moral dilemmas, people scarred by loss and guilt, family relationships, and painful choices in characters you feel empathy towards. A compelling read which engendered a rich book group discussion.
5	1393718400	Loved this book- well developed characters and interesting plot. Would be a great book to discuss the moral implications in a book club.
5	1393718400	It touched me to my very core and moved every emotion in me. Brought forth the very essence of humanity.
4	1393718400	It was a little sad  for me but I liked the characters in it,the story kept my interest to finish to the end
5	1393718400	Great character development.  Loved the analogy of the book title and the actual development of the story.  This is the stuff you can live your life by.
5	1393718400	This was a really enjoyable book.  Loved the story line and the mystery surrounding it.  I could easily imagine myself living on that island and living that life.
4	1393718400	The story lends itself to discussion because the situations of the characters are so emotionally felt by the reader and the moral issues are less black and white and more shades of gray.
3	1393718400	I wanted to care about the characters but was at a loss towards the middle of the book. I wished some of the &#34;secrets of the past&#34; were defined.
4	1393718400	this was an interesting view of life in a part of the world that I knew nothing about, as well as the trials and situations of Light house keepers.  It kept my attention all the way through.  Like so much fiction, there were some moments that seemed to be only creatable in fiction, but that did not lessen my enjoyment of the book.
4	1393718400	Very well written. Makes you think about how any of us would handle something like that. Wonderful story and very thought provoking.
5	1393718400	Different and very engrossing read.  I was hooked from the beginning.  Emotions and intelligence collide.  Do the wrong thing and and be happy emotionally...do the right thing and suffer...
5	1393718400	Loved this book. It poses a moral question with which both the characters and the reader struggle. The lonely island gives the story a memorable  feel.  I have thought about this story so many times in the weeks since I have finished it.
5	1393718400	I'm recommending this book to everyone. The writing is beautiful, the story is compelling, and the characters are complex and well-drawn.
5	1393718400	I loved reading about the lighthouse, stars, life on a remote island and in a small Australian town. Very poignant story about love, loss, and trauma.
5	1393718400	We choose this book for one of our book club reads this month and I thoroughly enjoyed it!!  Great discussion!!
4	1393718400	Definitely several levels of emotion to sort through. Characters are well built. I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow to get going but once it took off, good book.
5	1393632000	This is such a good book, one of those that is hard to put down.  And the author keeps you guessing right up to the end as to the outcome.
5	1393632000	I enjoyed reading this book because of the language and voice used by the author enhanced a great story of love and loss.
5	1393632000	This book caught me at the beginning. I couldn't help wonder where it was going, and it's always going somewhere!  You build up a relationship with the characters and I must admit, I was bawling like a baby at the end.  The light always wins out in the end!
4	1393632000	I thought this book was wonderfully written. I couldn't put it down. The part that didn't ring true for me was the ending. I won't give away what happens at the end, but the adoptive mother has a difficult choice to make and I thought was she finally decided was not believable. Nothing that had described her relationship to her child would have logically led to the conclusion the author wrote. M.L. Stedman, please try again and re-write that ending!
5	1393632000	I saw several reviewers say how sad the depressing the story was but my reaction was quite different.  True the story is very poignant and at times heartbreaking but presented with such compassion and honesty.  Life is not always fair and sometimes trying to cope with comes our way leads us to make very poor decisions.  I've tried to come up with a way to describe the writing and the only word I can come up with is delicious.  A strange word I know but Stedman's use of language is intoxicating and the way she develops her characters was so refreshing.  Just when you think you know all you are going to know about the character Stedman gives you more and I found myself rethinking how I felt about them.  I am eagerly looking forward to Stedman's next book.
5	1393545600	I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, and the characters came to life. It held my attention, and I couldn't put it down.
4	1393459200	The story makes the reader think about the choices they've made and the consequences. I enjoyed this story a great deal.
5	1393459200	I read a sample on my kindle and thought it was interesting but delayed purchasing it.  Once I bought it and began reading I could not put it down.  A wonderful read.
5	1393459200	The book was well-researched, and the tensions between the characters were sharply drawn. I started to know the characters a bit by the end of the story and wanted to argue with them to change their behaviour. The book took a relatively unusual situation, added a twist, and presented a moral dilemma that has no clear-cut answer.
3	1393459200	This first novel is filed with human emotion, heartache and resolution in accepting life's struggles and often unfair trials.  The characters are often two-dimensional and predictable, but still engaging and complex within their own storyline.  As a mother who has lost 3 children to miscarriage, it was at times very difficult to read but also cathartic to know that the devastation of lost children is real, no matter how long you have them. Stedman does an excellent drawing you into the story, even though it jumps forward at crucial turning points. I would recommend this book.
5	1393459200	Very good book and I would recommend it.The storyline really makes you think about what you would do in that situation.
5	1393372800	Sherman's work is captivating, a tale heartwrenchingly exquisite and unique. I could see the island, I could smell it, and I could almost feel the wind in my hair. Not only is the story unforgettable, Stedman's phrases are so skillfully written the words can practically be tasted. This book goes on my list of favorites to enjoy again and again. If I could give it more than five stars, I would.
4	1393372800	If you like books with well developed characters then this is a good one for you.  Detailed with plenty to keep you interested.  Lots of layers.
4	1393372800	Enjoyed this book. My book club chose it. Kept my interest. Good ending, which I always like. I would recommend.
3	1393286400	I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting and quite heart-wrenching. I definitely recommend this book to others.
5	1393286400	I so enjoyed this wonderful story of how lovely and yet how cruel life can be. Life can change in the blink of an eye, or the turn of a light. Ordinary events can become life altering. Love can hurt or heal, families can grow together or apart.
5	1393200000	Everyone that I have told about this book, has loved it! Highly recommend it as a GOOD Read. Keeps you guessing as to how the story will progress.
5	1393200000	Loved this book. Great story. Keeps you wanting to read to see what's going to end up happening to this child
4	1393200000	Beautiful descriptions of the landscape and surroundings. Interesting and thought-provoking premise. The author seemed to rush to finish the story after such in-depth character development in rest of story.
5	1393200000	This was a fantastic book. The book told of so much sadness but also so much happiness. How your life goes on and you adapt. It shows how you can overcome your grief.
5	1393200000	Loved the writing style and the feelings conveyed so eloquently.  I felt i was living the life of Izzy and Tom.
2	1393113600	I prefer stories that are uplifting.  This is a story about a couple that sticks together through thick and thin.  Their life is very much like the location, depressingly desolate.  Faced with a choice, it is a split decision between good and bad.  Their life is spent trying to recover from one fateful decision.
4	1393113600	Fascinating tale and well told, but it just did not hold up. After the decision to give the child back to its birth mother, we have no idea how the young couple coped with life afterwards.
4	1393113600	I learned about a place and occupation totally new to me and also felt the familiar storylines of romance, mystery, loss and survival.  A mix of emotions throughout the book kept it interesting and the moral dilemmas made it a good book to discuss with others.  I would recommend this book to others.
5	1393113600	Loved the book!!  The story shows how life is short and what you think is right at the time, may hurt others in the long run.  Love can be so deep and selfish, but in the long run the best lesson is to forgive and move on.
4	1393027200	I read the Lighthouse story as it was one of our Bookclub choices, I found myself both sympathetic and upset by the characters in the book: both the main two characters and some of the townspeople. The reader knew exactly what was eventually going to happen and felt very sorry for the outcome. But it seems impossible to believe anything else could happen.Reading about the lighthouse was wonderful reading. I enjoyed that immensely for it is something I do not know anything about. . I learned a lot.The ending seemed to be a bit stretched. However, we had to know what happened both with the baby, family, and with the other characters.
5	1393027200	beautifully haunting.the author was able to capture the beauty of Australia and the reader was able to root for all of the characters.
5	1393027200	From the moment you start this book, you will feel the emotions of the characters.  I simply could not put it down.  Many twists and turns will keep you guessing
5	1392940800	Love overcomes all obstacles. Tom is one of the most genuine people I have ever read about, he shows what it means to have a conscience and complete and unselfish love. When I was done reading my heart was filled with sadness. I felt like I was witnessing the torture of the child, the writer has done a marvelous job of illustrating this episode.
4	1392940800	It's a heart wrenching story about life and some  tough decisions have to be made about what's right and wrong. Beautiful.
5	1392940800	Couldn't put the book down. Wonderful story about love and compassion and family. Love lighthouses and their history so this was a great book for that.
4	1392940800	this was an easy read, and a good story.  I wish there was a happy ending...I love light house stories.
4	1392940800	I read this book because it was chosen for a book club, I wouldn't have thought to read on my own.  It really pulls you in making you feel the ocean, loneliness, hope and despair before finding peace.  Very good read.
5	1392940800	Engrossing story and character development. It was an emotional roller-coaster. I could not put the book down. Love and loss are brillantly protrayed.
3	1392854400	Too much filler about parent / child love and relations. It stalls the flow of the story. Sorry about that.
4	1392854400	I enjoyed reading this book. The story is heartbreaking,but helped me to understand a little of what my kids feel coming to our home through foster care.
5	1392854400	Was hard to put down. I downloaded a sample and it grabbed me immediately. A very real story with real characters. I connected and understood all of them. Ms. Stedman created a sad, but hopeful story.
5	1392854400	How this book can make you smile and cry, question yourself and others, what an interesting story, it grabs you and you can't let go... Beautiful characters.  Could not put it down, could not stop the tears... Loved it.
4	1392854400	It's a good read. Story is somewhat unbelievable and a little too wrapped up in the end. Still an interesting book.
4	1392768000	The descriptions of the lighthouse as well as the lives of those taking care of it was informative.  I enjoyed reading about clothing and life styles then.  Anyone might feel sympathy for Izzy and the choices she made but most readers will agree she finally did the right thing and how hard that was for her.  Good read. Perfect title.
4	1392768000	It was a good story overall. I was not crazy about the ending, but I enjoyed the book. Interesting idea.
5	1392768000	Very good book.  Well written.  I have cried after reading books before but never like this one.  Truly a must read.
4	1392768000	An enjoyable read.  The controversy between the 2 main characters may make it an interesting book club choice.  I would recommend it to others.
4	1392768000	Fascinating account of the day to day life of a married couple in isolation. Shows the anguish of a childless woman and a man torn between duty and his deep love for his wife. Well written, absorbing drama in an unusual setting.
5	1392768000	One of the most gripping and troubling stories I have read in years. I LOVED this book. A great discussion for our book club. The characters were complex and fascinating. The dilemmas they faced were compelling, so realistic and heart-wrenching. The ending was so satisfying as well. I highly recommend this book. I can only hope this new author can repeat her accomplishment in future books.
5	1392681600	This was an intricately woven, emotionally intense story. The characters come alive, their pain almost tangible. Guaranteed to tug on the heartstrings of anyone who has a heart!
5	1392681600	We read this book for book club and it provoked interesting and lively discussion about the decisions that not only the characters made in the book, but the choices that the author made in writing the book as she did.  Along the way, I found myself wishing the characters into different situations - when someone is in a lose-lose situation, you just want to root for them to find a magical solution... No magic solution in this book, but life is often like that.  Sometimes I'm sad to see a book end - this was one of those books.
5	1392681600	Very moving story...Great depiction of the world of the lighthouse & the ocean & the mindset of PTSD victims & their coping mechanisms & post-partum depression/grief & the tug between right & wrong & it's relativity!  So simply put, with simply beautiful phrasing.  Even when you might think you know who & what might happen next, there was one of LIfe's usual turns that surprised you.
5	1392681600	Perhaps not a lot of men will read this but as a married father of two, this book really stuck with me and even weeks after finishing, I'm still thinking about it.
5	1392681600	Brilliant interweaving of story line I also really liked the fact that the reader cannot guess how things will end!  Very well executed.  Thank you.
5	1392595200	This book was so well written and could not have been more of a human comedy. It is a story that is as old as life itself about love and sacrifice. As heart wrenching as it is, the loving  is worth it because it is the only thing in this life that truly matters. It takes a wonderful story like this to remind us to give ourselves to love.
5	1392595200	If we think our decisions don't affect others...we are sorely mistaken I really appreciate this story.Great job, M.L.Steadman.Thank you.
5	1392595200	we always want to question our choices but must live in the moment. this novel has set forth to teach us we must look forward. very well written!
4	1392595200	That's the only way I could describe it. My book club will discuss it on a few days. I'll come back with their thoughts.
5	1392595200	This was a great book that kept me thinking about it for days after I finished.  The author is descriptive allowing you to imagine yourself living on an island and you find yourself wondering what you would do...I enjoyed it
5	1392595200	Love can cause us to do a lot of things we would not normally do. This book is a lesson on love, forgiveness and how we do things under certain circumstances in life . It also shows that how we can only take so much grief and pain without it affecting our behavior !
4	1392595200	The book group to which I belong rated The Light Between Oceans between four and four and one-half stars.  I thought the book a wonderful vacation read.  While I was waiting to board a plane and reading the last chapter or two, my eyes were so noticeably tearing that the woman sitting across from me came over and asked what I was reading.
5	1392508800	Interestingly I was uncertain as to whether or not I would like the book in the early chapters, but wow what a surprise! What a powerful and meaningful story....and thought provoking messages. This one will be remembered.
4	1392508800	This book is complex and deeply moving.  It was hard to put it down because of the suspense woven throughout.  The details are wrapped up in the end in a satisfying, though not a fairy tale way.
5	1392508800	I enjoyed this book because the author made the characters so real,  It is a good read for bookclubs. Enjoy the journey.
5	1392508800	I could not put this book down. I would recommend it to any friend or book club because it stirs intense discussion. It covers love of child, loss of child,self love, guilt, prejudice, loyality and irrational authority,I wonder what my feelings would have been if Hannah's story was told first?The ending left me in tears. Life is not fair.Alyce Allegretto
5	1392508800	A book about real life, the choices we make, and the affects of those choices....written so beautifully and descriptively it was like being a part of the book! Hard to put down! A must read!!!!!
4	1392508800	I cried as I finished this story which was well told. The imagery of the lighthouse and life on Janus was moving.
5	1392508800	This is not a typical book that I would have chosen for myself; however, recommended by a few friends including my sister, enjoyed every minute of it -- excellent ending; not what I expected -- that's what I liked about it as well!
5	1392508800	This book grabbed me from the first page and I could hardly put it down.  Very good book I highly recommend
5	1392422400	Loved this book. Kept me reading, and I couldn't put it down! As a woman this book really makes your heart ache for both women characters.
4	1392422400	The story is rather a sad one and cannot be true, as kidnapping a child is a crime,and these people were really not punished for the crime
5	1392422400	Beautifully written, captured my imagination for days. This book is particularly poignant for anyone who has been touched by adoption.
4	1392422400	I enjoyed how the author developed the characters, and how their lives were parallel to each other in MANY ways.  It was definitelya story about Tom, and how people & events influenced his life over the years.
5	1392422400	I would recommend this book to women. The emotions  this book encompasses appear to be those that the female gender could more passionately feel and understandCarol
5	1392422400	This book was wonderful... One that had a gripping story of love, expectations, grief and loss, and hope for the future.  I'll revisit it again one day.
5	1392422400	This book was thought provoking and intriguing.  I couldn't put it down.  I like that the title had a superficial meaning, but also meaning on a much deeper level.
4	1392422400	A plot that's been done before, but this is definitely a unique version of place and time. It works. Page turner.
4	1392422400	The plot of the story was well written and kept my interest to the very end.  The characters were almost real life and I could empathize with them.
5	1392422400	This was our selection for our monthly book club.  It was generally well liked by everyone and created a good discussion.  We felt all the characters were well developed and we could empathize with the dilemmas they faced.
4	1392422400	This book starts out a little on the slow start hut then it takes off and turns into a real page turner. It has romance, mystery and suspense all wrapped up in one book.  Ending is very surprising.
4	1392422400	Captivating story of desperation and love. The author is able to help the reader experience a range of feelings from all of the major characters point of view.
3	1392336000	A good story line and I found the fact that it was set in Australia quite interesting. The main characters were quite believable.
5	1392336000	This is an excellent choice for anyone that likes a good story.  I was pulled in from the start and the story doesn't let up or dissappoint. I found myself in tears at the end. This book is more than worth your time.
5	1392249600	I rated this book 5 stars because it was a wonderful read.  You will find yourself torn between two totally different loves.  Anyone who is a mother, and knows how deep that bond can be, will enjoy this read.  Anyone who is a husband, completely in love with his wife, and can see her beauty even through a bad situation, will like this book.  I think this an EXCELLENT novel and one that everyone should say they've read! Trust me!
5	1392249600	Great development of characters. Good thought provoking book. It was great for book club discussion. Moral issues was big discussion.
5	1392249600	It was a great book with a heart tugging story.  It was well written - you could feel the isolation of the lighthouse island.
4	1392249600	beautifully written...but the end just sort of happened. I would recommend this book. Got a bit of flavor of colonial life in Western Australia.
5	1392249600	I read this book slowly so as not to miss any of the great descriptive writing. Felt like I was there on the island.
5	1392249600	The post World War I time period and northeastern Australian coastal setting sets the climate for a very dynamic love story.
3	1392249600	This is a well written book. Very in expected second half!  This stirred many emotions in our book club! Great conversation!
5	1392249600	This was a total page turner. There were many passages that I had to re read and just sit there and reflect. And the ending left the reader satisfied without feeling that the author cheated the reader. It was fair
5	1392163200	Some books don't catch in the first chapter. This book captures you in the first page. Mysterious, thought provoking, heart wrenching.  It covers a life journey.  Young impetuous reaching old age living with,shame. A great book great story teller.
5	1392163200	One of the best books I've read in years. Excellent setting, plot, characrer, and character development. Difficult to believe this is a first novel. Reminiscent of To Kill A Mocking Bird and Snow Fallng On Cedars. Highly reccomended.
4	1392163200	Once I got into the book, I could not put it down.  It was an amazing story. It was intriguing and it was hard to know who to side with.
4	1392163200	An enjoyable book I couldn't put down and didn't want to end. I highly recommend this to anyone, a good book club read.
5	1392163200	Amazing story of how life, love and tragedy can bring people together.  Reads very quickly but the story is so intertwined that you won't soon forget
4	1392163200	I loved the story, heart-renching plot and fairly well-defined characters. I had a hard time getting into the writer's style, seemed a bit soft, if that's a style. She definitely made me care about the characters, though. The backstories of the characters were clear.
5	1392163200	The personal challenges and moral issues are riveting from beginning to end.  You will love all of the characters and be amazed that this is her first book.
4	1392076800	I thought this book was a good read.  It isn't difficult to imagine yourself in the main characters position, making the decisions that they made.  It is definitely a good book club read as there are several angles of discussion that can take place.
5	1392076800	Wonderfully written. Emotions change from chapter to chapter. The characters come alive with each introduction and the story line builds up until you cannot put it down.
4	1392076800	A good read. I would have liked for izzy to meet her grandson.  It was a bittersweet story of love, loss and commitment
5	1392076800	This book kept my interest all the way through.  So much emotion throughout.  My feelings for the different characters seemed to change with every new chapter.
5	1392076800	A very real look into a couples rather abnormal life.  The ending was nearly impossible to predict and kept me hooked, reading and hoping for everyone to come out okay in the end.  As you can see from the rating I gave, I was not disappointed.  Highly recommend.
5	1391990400	Great story.  I never could figure out what the ending would be.  Looking forward to the author's next book.  Sad and glad  throughout the book
4	1391990400	I liked this book because it dealt with a very difficult ethical dilemma between a husband and wife.  The emotions of each character were real,raw and true.  The book seemed very honest and believable, although quite sad.
1	1391990400	I did not like....could not get into it..  After several trys at it over several evenings I gave up and deleted it,.
3	1391990400	Good novel.  I enjoyed it, although I would say that I could take it or leave it.  I liked the post WWI time period.
4	1391904000	I chose this rating because I experience a gamut of emotions throughout the story. It was a little slow at the beginning but when  the story continued I found I couldn't put it down. I couldn't help but think what course of action I personally would have taken given theheartbreak, loneliness and difficult living conditions the characters endured on their island.It was truly a love story with a very sad, but true to life ending.
5	1391904000	I was hoping that the truth would come out before it did, however, that would have spoiled the story.  Very different story line.
5	1391904000	Others will write about the incredible story and incredibly beautiful and tragic persons..  This is a book about choices, and their consequences  About a third of the way into the book, I was compelled to research the author for some sense of how and why this book was written .The moving details about the lighthouse intrigued me, and I wondered how this author could write with such exactness and symbolism and authority about her subjects.  The deeper I got into the story,  the more I wanted to understand the whys behind all of what was written, such vivid descriptions about everything, fro the lighthouse and its care, the topography, the island and that part of Australia, the personalities and emotions of those around which the story centered. I was startled and amazed that the author is female, and a childless attorney.  I had no idea what to expect in the book. She is a fine storyteller.  Many of her observations of the various components and persons drew me and were compelling - one could almost feel the beauty of smell the many scents and even feel the ocean spray on the rocks., an almost three-dimentional view.  Her words about the human condition, and the reasons people made the choices they made were well-drawn.  Many paragraphs and ideas I wanted to recall because their symbolism and insights, I could see their reality in people whom I know or with whom I  associate, and  particularly appreciated the suggestion that angry judgmental persons had to work harder than regular folks, because they had to nurse their grievances continually, without finding a peace; it was hard work which exacted energy of the one holding a grudge.  Many times throughout the novel, I was moved to tears. (On my Kindle, I'm not finding the specific quote.) . I was very grateful for several of such observations, which spurred me to be slower and careful about choices I make.  This story engaged me completely.  I highly recommend this book, and look forward to reading more from this brilliant author.
5	1391904000	I loved this book! I purchased it because it related to the 100th anniversary of WWI.  I really related to the characters and the emotional problems they encountered. I wasn't ready for it to end when it did.
2	1391904000	I felt it was a bit disjointed, and some of the characters did not seem to be as necessary for the story.  It held my interest but not nearly as much as the Kite Runner which I found to be much more fascinating.
5	1391904000	What a wonderful book, it was filled with everything thing you could imagine. I could not put it down. I loved it.
4	1391904000	It's a beautifully written story--so full of wonderful characters and how they relate to life's challenges and the unexpected.  Very moving as the author describes the events which occur and the reactions of the people.  Top level literature!
5	1391904000	Excellent story.  It was well written and kept your attention the entire book.  I would certainly recommend it.  Good read
5	1391817600	I loved this book.  The time period, location and characters were perfect.  Author wove the story so well I felt like I was there.  What would I have done in their place?  I'll definitely watch for her next book.
5	1391817600	Stedman writes beautifully.  A passionate tale of deep love, great loss, forgiveness, and dealing with the twists life hands out.  Completely believable characters well drawn.  The ending made sense for the characters and was satisfying for the reader.  One of the best novels I've read in a while and I'm a tough critic.
5	1391817600	Great story telling, stories, characters, and settings come alive with the colorfully details. A page turner I couldn't put down, kept telling myself go toned, but the next chapter and the next flew through my hands and mind.
3	1391817600	I didn't expect to love the story and characters but I did, and it's beautifully written.  I'd definitely recommend it to a friend.
5	1391731200	The book was well written. Loved the characters especially Tom.  The book was so interesting that I didn't want to put it down.  Especially felt sorry for both of the main woman characters.  Each had their pain.  I also learned a lot about how lighthouses were maintained many years ago.I would recumbent the book to book clubs and anyone who enjoys a good book.
5	1391731200	Felt all the characters emotions and feelings.  Could relate to every one of them.  Could not put this book down!
5	1391731200	By far one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read. It is so complex and the characters are just wonderful, highly recommend reading this!
4	1391731200	Captivating all the way through. There was never a lull in the story where the reader was waiting for something to happen. I've read books with that problem!
5	1391731200	A very nice book, a nice story, interesting to learn how people lived in solitary.  The description of the tasks concerning the lighthouse very interesting.
5	1391731200	Very good book. Once I started reading I couldn't put this book down. Very well written. My book club loved it!
5	1391644800	This is Stedman's first book and very well done.  I will be looking forward to her next book in, hopefully, the near future.This story actually made me cry at the end. I will recommend it to others and my Book Club.
5	1391644800	I really enjoyed reading this and it brings to mind recent news stories of children being fostered for years and biological parents suddenly reappearing hoping for the storybook welcome by their children....disregarding they are strangers. I wish the ending had been different. But life is complicated.
4	1391644800	This is one of those books that causes you to inwardly rage at the bad decision making by the characters but love them so dearly that you forgive them. Stedman creates a stark and vivid world apart in which to meditate on duty, love and parenthood. This book poignantly explores loss in both a personal and universal way.
5	1391644800	The best book I've read in ages...so beautifully written I would often stop and reread portions of it.  I began recommending it when I was only a few chapters invested.
5	1391644800	Great book. Enjoyable from the start. Almost done with it. Will be great discussion at book group. I recommend it.
4	1391558400	I was attracted to this book by the cover. It was simple yet it somehow reached out to me. It took a while to get me really interested because it started so slowly. There were parts that were drawn out (the time when they came back to return Lucy Grace) and I found a little stretched. Especially when Tom was in prison. All in all it was a peaceful read that I really enjoyed. A little sad at the end but I guess that was to be expected.I look forward to the next book by M. L. Steadman...hoping the wait is a short one.
5	1391558400	This is a riveting story with well developed characters.  The story is fully enriched with outstanding writing full of visual pictures of time and place---emotion and motive.  I highly recommend this to discerning readers.
5	1391558400	This book is the best, most gripping story I've read in a long time. The range of human emotions, the descriptions of surroundings, the conflicting  decisions to be made, the character motivations---all led to a sad but satisfying conclusion. Don't start this book until you can give it your full attention-you won't want to put it down.
5	1391558400	An incredible work for a first novel. The multi-layered themes woven through this book are subjects that impact the lives of most of us. A powerfully moving story from start to finish.
4	1391558400	Wonderful character, good plot line and well written.  I was not sure about the ending.  That is why the four star rating.
5	1391558400	i thought this book was great. Could not put it down. What a love story. My book club all felt the same way.
5	1391472000	I really enjoyed this book, I like the way the characters interact and come together, also the good description of the island puts you in the story too.
5	1391472000	A loving couple deal with life's realities and hardships based on what they &#34; need&#34;. This novel is a 'devour', not a must read. There are only a few novels which have encouraged the tears to flow; this was one of them. Life isn't always as smooth as an ocean.  Thought-provoking and  real!!
5	1391472000	A wonderful story about morality. Just how much guilt can you live with, and still go on?  Ever choice we make has some sort of consequences.
5	1391472000	That was a Book i could not put down.It ended just like i thought it would  but still kept me going  I Ioved it.
5	1391472000	This story was beautifully written, interesting, and different. The reader can see how these characters could have ended up in this dilemma, but the grueling part is that there is no real happy ending. I cried and cried as I finished it. The author gives us a real life ending, not a fairy tale one. Truly a book that will stick with you.
5	1391472000	I enjoyed A Light between Oceans, often having trouble putting the book down.  It is a lovely tale especially meaningful to those of us who have children and can understand the endless, heartbreaking love a situation like this would create.  Written well and highly recommended.
5	1391472000	My last name is FriedlandBook was so so sad but well written and a page turner. I would highly recommend the book.
4	1391472000	I enjoyed it, but thought it was a rather sad book.  But there's plenty of discussion there on moral dilemmas.
4	1391385600	A tale of morality and love, both of which couldn't be solved in a manner that pleased everyone but kept you torn about your own decisions
5	1391385600	I selected this for our book club and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. Great characters with a writing style that kept you reading into the wee hours. I will absolutely look up other books by this author.
3	1391385600	I enjoyed the story line and the characters, but I found it mediocre . I knew that issues over the found child would hurt all parties concerned, so I was not surprised by the ending.I had read The Goldfinch before this, and was completely enthralled.
5	1391385600	I loved the way this author wrote. Wonderful life lessons woven throughout this excellent tale. The characters were put in a situation that raised a moral issue that could make every reader think about. A great read.
4	1391299200	For me the book started off a little slow but then I couldn't put it down.I really identified with Isabel. I have lost a baby in 2nd trimester and it was so incredibly hard for me, I can't say that if I was in the same exact position as her that I wouldn't have done the same. The baby really would have seemed like a gift from God.I can't help but wish the ending was a little different but I do like that it was realistic for the most part.
5	1391299200	I love it when I can become completely immersed in a book. As a parent, this book touched me on so many levels, and though I cried many times, every tear was worth it.
5	1391299200	An amazing story, beautifully told. M.l. Steadman has created indelible, fully realized characters whose heartbreaking decisions create an unforgettable novel.
2	1391299200	I really struggled with this book. The premise sounded really great, and it just didn't live up to the hype for me. I found the first part of the book plodding, I thought it rushed through certain events that deserved more time and attention, and overall I thought there was a lot of writing with little action actually occurring.The end of the book picked up somewhat, but overall I was really hoping for and expecting something much, much more interesting.
5	1391299200	I loved this book.  All of the characters were likable so when the moral dilemma presented itself you really couldn't take only one side.  Well written, character were well developed and the book stayed good right to the very end.  Everyone I know who has read it has loved it.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone.  The one and only disappointment is that it is her first book so there is not yet anything else of her's to read.
3	1391299200	Worth reading the book after all I must say just takes a while to finish the book and the review
3	1391212800	Thought this was just okay read.  I probably would not have selected; but it was on my book club list
5	1391212800	I couldn't put the book down. I found myself thinking about it when I did have too stop reading. I love a book like this!
5	1391212800	The story reaches out and touches you.  There were portions when I could't put it down.  The language is descriptive and draws you into the story.  The resolution is perhaps not what one would have anticipated but poses a question for the reader.
4	1391212800	It's definitely the type of story that stays with you after you read it. I actually was really torn as to how many stars to give it, and debated between 2-4, which may sound odd. To explain this, first of all, I was really annoyed with the fact that the summary given as the book description gives away about 50% of the book. When I got to about that amount, I thought the story hasn't progressed much, but it was really that I already knew from the description what was going to happen. Second of all, the ending left me dissatisfied, and even angry. Overall, however, I decided that the story really resonated with me, and I really felt for all of the characters equally, and that, to me, is a characteristic of a good book, hence my 4 stars.
4	1391126400	This is one of those books where it really takes you to that &#34;What Would You Do In This Situation&#34; points. It makes yourself and your morals and values. I still keep thinking about this book.
5	1391126400	You don't want to put it down. I felt. like I was in Australia with them, all the scenery and beauty that was described.
5	1391126400	This is a beautiful story of love and forgiveness. The things we do for those we love and forgiveness for the mistakes we make. Characters are well developed and believable. I highly recommend reading this novel.
5	1391040000	a great read...and lots of information about Australia, light houses and isolated lives.. well written and a good story to recommend
5	1391040000	I enjoyed the character study. I could identify with each of the characters and understand why they made the choices they made. There was never a dull moment!
4	1391040000	I thought this book was well written and very interesting. The setting was breathtakingly beautiful even though you aren't there. It contains great historical facts scattered around the book. I thought everything about the book was amazing except for the ending. It just didn't seem right. Other than that I thought the book was extremely well written and it's a miracle that it is the author's first book.
4	1391040000	This book is both enlightening and also weighs heavy on your heart.  It reads very quickly and is well thought out. The story reminds us of the simple things in life that are important and to count our many blessings!
5	1391040000	This is perhaps one of the best books I have ever read.  Perhaps I just read it at a time when it affected me more.  I don't know, but everyone who grapples with forgiveness should read this book.
4	1391040000	Unique story of love, loss, deceit, betrayal. Well written with quite a twist. A remote setting for two devoted people and their incredible adventure.
5	1391040000	When I first started reading I thought what could they possibly tell about with one man living alone on an island?  The story is believable and may touch the heart of anyone who has ever had children or lost a child.
4	1391040000	It kept your attention, always wanting to know, &#34;what's next&#34;? It was a heatbreaking story.  it was our Book Club selection.
5	1391040000	Beautifully written story that takes place in Western Australiaafter WWI .  Many book groups would enjoy this poignant read.
3	1390953600	This book came recommended to me by a co-worker and I really wanted to love it, but came away just thinking that it was &#34;ok&#34;.  However, I think it's a thought-provoking book that would suit a book club very well since there are many topics that would spark good discussions.
5	1390953600	I liked the way it was written, it was suspenseful, good story line. I've already recommended this book to other people.
4	1390953600	This book was very informative about the isolated lives lighthouse keepers led in thetime when lighthouses were so important.Have recommended this book to several friends
5	1390953600	I rarely rate a book with five stars but this story earned it. A story of the toll war takes and its many victims. A tale of true love with all its tears and laughter. A story of hope and the difference the love of a child makes in the human heart.  Nothing is left to the imagination as you share the grief when a child is lost and the ripple effect on so many lives.  It is hard to believe this is the authors first book!
5	1390953600	Beautifully written love story, appealing and tragic. Keep the tissues handy, and don't try to guess the ending.Ed Sutton
3	1390953600	Slow moving. Did not enjoy as much as I thought I would. I enjoyed reading about the lighthouse but not so much the characters.
3	1390867200	I did not like the narrator.  He was too slow and did not have enough emotion in his voice.  The book was so sad and depressing.  I did not like the subject matter but I read it for a book club.  Some of the others in the group did like the writing style of the author.
3	1390867200	This was a lovely book, but it plodded along somewhat. The story is touching, of love and loss, and the sacrifices people make. I definitely feel it could have moved along a bit faster, but it was good.
5	1390867200	One of the best books I have ever read.  I believe this will also be a classic.  Characters are so real.  The story is mesmerizing.
5	1390867200	I finished the book 2 weeks ago but I'm still thinking about it. The moral questions that are the basis of the story weigh heavy in my mind and heart. The story is well-written and compelling..
3	1390867200	This is a fascinating tale where characters are faced with a dilemma. Their choices will impact their futures. The reader really must ask herself the question: What would I do in a situation such as this? This is a good read. I recommend it.
5	1390867200	This is a story of love and redemption. You learn a lot about the damage done to people by war and how they cope. There's also a lot to learn about Australia's historical light house service.
5	1390867200	An excellent read!  The character development was very well achieved.  The book took me into a world I never knew & I loved the historical things about Australia.  Very different from my life in Florida.  I would highly recommend this book!
5	1390867200	I so enjoyed this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I read it in a day and a half - which is so unlike me.
5	1390780800	I liked the characters and reading about life at a light house. The story was interesting but very sad and left me very lonely
4	1390780800	This book spun an amazing tale.  It looked at life and the complex ethical dilemmas that it presents each of us with.  I loved it!  The characters were we'll developed and honest.  I would recommend this book freely.  It is a great book with a profound message.
5	1390780800	What a powerful, moving book! I finished this book in one weekend. One of the best books I've ever read! A must read.
4	1390780800	It's a great book. Had me in tears a few times. The ending left me wanting something else for Tom and for Lucy-Grace.
3	1390780800	I read this book for a book club; it was not a book I would've otherwise read. The book was a bit long-winded, but it was a good story about the consequences of the choices we make.  I gave it 3 stars bc it left me feeling sad on more than one occasion.  However, it will make for great discussion amongst the book club.
5	1390780800	A wonderful first novel, cannot wait for a second.  So full of life, love, regret and forgiveness.  Very hard to put down as the characters took on a life all their own.
4	1390780800	I liked this story ... a little different because you get some history and facts about light houses. The storyline was plausible and an enjoyable read, although there is some sadness with this story. I would rate this a B+. P.S. I just saw a movie that took place in a lighthouse and loved that I knew some of the facts they would be dealing with in the movie.
5	1390694400	Wonderful book that will resonant with all mothers. The story grabs you at the start, then the suspense builds. You won't want to put it down until the end. I read a great many books, but seldom one with a plot as gripping.
5	1390694400	A couple in the 1920s live on an isolated island and run a lighthouse.  One day, a boat comes to the island with a dead body and a baby.  They elr t not to report it and raise the baby as their own.  The domino effect of this decision makes this a page turner and one you will not forget soon.
5	1390694400	Loved the book and the setting!! Character development was realistic. I couldn't put it down .it didn't have a fairy tale ending and could have gone so many other ways !! Keep the Kleenex handy!
5	1390694400	This is the best book to come along in years. The characters are strong and unforgettable. Read this with a box of tissues.
5	1390694400	life is a series of decisions and relationships whether they're good or not depends on how we accept the outcome. This book tells a realistic story of those decisions  among relationships and their outcomes.
5	1390694400	I read most of this book on a cross country flight and found it absorbing. The story line is different and very believable. It is well written and it causes one to think about what they might do with the same experiences.
5	1390694400	I thought Light Between Oceans and Taking Flight were both wonderful books.  Loved them both and have recommended them to friends and also used them as our selections for our Book Club.
5	1390694400	I could not put this book down!!  I rate this among my all time favorites.  Can't wait for my fiends to read it.
5	1390608000	Having read her bio, it's hard to fathom that this is the first novel written by M.L. Steadman.  Her writing is poetic and beautiful. I was captured by her first to her last sentence. She poses a very complicated situation, drawing you in with her imagery and characters, asking: What would you do if you were faced with these same circumstances? There is no judgment,only very human characters. I loved this book and look forward to reading her next novel.
3	1390608000	An interesting story to show ones circumstances at a specific time will determine the choices they make. This in turn, will be the result of the person they become.
5	1390521600	This is writing that is beautiful if it stood alone - but along with poetic prose is a story unafraid of evoking meaning and goodness. Its characters are imperfect but heroic, and life is lived between each line. I loved it.At the end of this novel, I found that I had discovered something great. It is a pleasure to recommend it.Thank you to M.L. Stedman and anyone who supported to publishing of her book, The Light Between Oceans.
1	1390521600	If you need a good sob, and are longing for just an awful, sad, concoction filled with flat characters, peppered with random platitudes, and completely lacking a denouement, this read is for you! In seriousness, I do not usually take the time to review books (usually just products!), and with all due respect to the author's artistic endeavor, I could not be more disappointed with this read. It's just too much - infertility, stillbirth, dead sons/spouses/siblings, prison, and even cancer. I do not take issue with sad stories - but this was just not well done. I do not ever remember being this passionately disappointed in a novel. I wish I could unread it!
4	1390521600	This is not an exciting story but rather a bittersweet tale that should be read at night when the wind blows outside your window. It's about love and betrayal, forgiveness and acceptance and the implications of the choices we make, big and small.
5	1390521600	This is a good book for discussion  of moral implications and how lives are affected by abuse and war. I hope this is just one book of many to follow.  we discusssed in our Church book group
5	1390521600	I couldn't put this book down.  Held my attention from the minute it picked it up.  I have already recommended it to all my reader friends.
5	1390521600	A beautiful book!  Written with grace  and compassion for all the characters.  I had to put it down at times because it was so intense and emotional for me. There is much to discus at our book club.  Thanks you to M.L. Steadman for writing this novel.
5	1390521600	Good storyline.  Gripping enough to make one want to keep reading to find out what happens next.  I thoroughly enjoyed this  book.
4	1390435200	The story was interesting.  It is an unusual story and not without a great deal of emotions.  I enjoyed experiencing my own emotions fluctuating back and forth between the characters. I would recommend this book, but with a little trepidation regarding the topic and the outcome.  For some, it just may too difficult to read.
5	1390435200	Someone at work had recommended this book, and I'm so glad they did. It was a treasure for the heart. It was especially enjoyable to read in bed at night with ocean sounds playing off my CD. I felt like I was right there. A poignant tale, for sure.
5	1390435200	A book about a mother and fathers love, The Light Between Oceans is both tender &  heartbreaking. Beautifully told, unputdownable and incredibly moving.
4	1390435200	such a poised & profoundly touching book.  M.L. Steadman does a good job of weaving the characters into your heart.
4	1390435200	enjoyed the book easy to read but a little corny, wanted to get into life as a light house resident more would have rounded out the story and made it a more interesting read.But would recommend for a pleasure read.
5	1390435200	Loved this book!  Very intriguing story that keeps you interested start to finish.  Highly recommend for book clubs - great discussion!
5	1390435200	This is an excellent book to read.  There are many twists and turns until the very end.Each character is well portrayed.
5	1390348800	I loved every page.  It moved along quickly but not too quickly.  Style of writing made me feel that I was there in the book with the characters.  When I was reading the last chapter, I suddenly realized that tears were running down my cheeks.  I was so vested with the story.  Loved the characters...all of them.  I can hardly wait for M. L. Stedman's next book!!  Our book club read this and we were all very moved and loved the book.  We are rarely moved to this extent over our books. Thank you!  M.K. Morse
3	1390348800	Good book I really enjoyed the various character conflicts. Would highly recommend. Easy read. Wish I would have heard about it sooner.
4	1390348800	Light between oceans is a poignant story about choices we make, even for what seem like good seasons, and the consequences that follow. How good choices are often the most difficult and sometimes painful.
5	1390348800	Very sad but very good.  My sister in law recommended it and I would highly recommend to everyone.  I like the author's style of writing.
5	1390348800	Spell binding story from the very beginning to the last page.  What would you have done if you were Isabel and Tom?
5	1390348800	I loved this book - terrific story! It made you think what you would do given that same situation. Great!
4	1390262400	Loved the lighthouse lore and imagery. Unremitting grief. An unspeakable crime. My heart was torn by each character.  Kept me reading to the end knowing it could never end happily for everyone.
5	1390262400	I kept hearing people saying this was a good book, but somehow our book club never chose it.  I decided to read it anyway, and I am glad I dud.  I found myself torn between both the birth mother and the mom who chose to keep the little one as her own for those years.  It is a difficult thing to give up a little one but it did get resolved in the end.  I have to warn you, it will bring tears to your eyes and you will remember the book for a long time.
5	1390262400	i love that this book looks at adoption from viewpoint and emotions of both mothers and the struggle between right and wrong.
2	1390176000	This book was suggested by many of my friends. It was difficult for me to really get involved with any of the characters.I found myself more frustrated  than empathetic.
5	1390176000	A friend gave this book to me for my birthday claiming that her book club in Atlanta had voted it their best book of the year!  Coming from a group of professionals, I thought that was a great recommendation!It turned out to be &#34;right on the money&#34;!  The book had drama from the very beginning and kept me reading eagerly up until the very end.  The dilemma posed in the book was one that is not a common occurrence in most people's lives but is one to which we can all relate.  Many beautiful images were there with life on a lighthouse and also in Australia.  And.....well, all I can say is that there will be tears at the end and a good recommendation will go out from each reader!!
5	1390176000	A poignant illustration of how every decision has the potential for unforeseen consequences.  When a boat washes up on the beach of an island whose only inhabitants are the lighthouse keeper, Tom Sherbourne, a decorated WWI veteran, and his young wife, Isabel, they soon discover aboard it a dead man and a live infant.  Isabel is convinced that the baby was sent by God, relying on the fact that the island was a half-day's journey by boat through treacherous waters from the western coast of Australia, and that it was surely a miracle that the child survived to arrive just when it did.  She had suffered two miscarriages and just 4 weeks before had delivered a stillborn son. When she and Tom decided not to report the incident and to raise the child as their own, they convinced themselves that they were acting only in the best interests of the child (whom they named Lucy); to keep her out of the orphanage.  It is very easy for the reader to join them in that decision, but there is an echo of foreboding.The couple soon learneded that the child's mother was Hannah Roennfeldt, the daughter of the richest man in the same small town where Isabel was born and raised. But by this time, the distraught woman thought of the child as her own and could not stand to give her up.  Tom, feeling the pangs of a guilty conscience, attempted to talk Isabel into returning Lucy to Hannah, but Isabel wouldn't hear of it.  Tom eventually left clues that led to the discovery that Lucy was actually Hannah's baby, and mother and child were reunited when the child was four months old.Of course, Lucy's only parents were Tom and Isabel and she was understandably distraught in being separate from them, as was Isabel.  In the end this is a powerful love story of two people who have to deal with enormous loss, and how their decisions wreak havoc on themselves, on each other, on the child they love, and on others whose losses cannot be fully comprehended or compensated.
5	1390176000	A richly described emotional journey, for a couple who face tragedy in isolated circumstances.  The difficulties they face become a sounding board to those around them.  Do you think you know what it means to have compassion?  You may find those notions are challenged as you read!

2	1390176000	An engaging story with a happy ending, albeit predictable. All depends upon our accepting the improbable first deception by Tom and Isabel.
5	1390176000	Good book.  I did not want to put it down and every chance I had I picked it up and read it.  Made me wonder about mercury poisoning.
4	1390176000	M.L. Stedman weaves a fascinating and heartbreaking story that you can't help becoming part of -- and, for me, it was placed in a location I know little of, making it even more enticing.
4	1390176000	It was a very intriguing story.  I liked the writing style of this author and the slow way the writer revealed the &#34;secrets&#34;.
5	1390176000	with insightful details of nature and human nature, of shame, forgiveness and finally, of the resilient human spirit. It made me pine for the days when my own children were brand new to this life.
4	1390176000	Nibor liked this book now please return to kindle so I can download something else please please go away please
5	1390089600	The author described the settings with wondrous words to share sights and sounds and scents. The story was truly heart-wrenching.
5	1390089600	Wonderful. Beautifully written. The characters are brought to life and they flowed beautifully in this book. Was sad to see the end come.
5	1390089600	It's a beautiful story, begins in the 1920's, about a Lighthouse keeper and his wife. Through the years she becomes pregnant 3 times and loses all 3 babies. One night on the waters they hear a baby crying. It's is story of Love and loss.Don't forget the tissues.
4	1390003200	This is a very well-written book, but as I continued to read it, the sadder and more depressed I became.  I could relate to the main characters and their thoughts:  are they doing the wrong thing for the right reason, or doing the right thing for the wrong reason?  It went back and forth.  As one other reviewer said, the ending was sort of a let-down, after all the drama.  But I suppose the main characters were all exhausted after all the emotional and torturous events.  And maybe so was the author.
5	1390003200	This book has a wonderful story and is beautifully written.  It tells a story about human failings and successes in a descriptive unusual setting.  Set in an earlier time but not too early so that we can't relate.  Just an interesting, lovely story.
5	1390003200	It was such a tear jerker.  The subject matter was so troubling.  How can you give up a child, when you are raising it as your own, and  you know it is not yours and that someone else, the real mother, is really hurting.  It was written so beautifully.  I did like how it ended.
5	1390003200	I read this book quickly. I tend to do that with books that catch me. When I was finished I immediately started at the beginning and reread it all the way through.
5	1390003200	This was my first novel read post graduate school (read: nothing but academic and research for 2 years) and was such a delightful re-entry into fiction.  The author built the characters and situations with such skill that when the pivotal incident occurred and the subsequent decisions and cover-ups...the ethical underscored the pragmatic and made it difficult to put down.  My only criticism is the rapidity with which the &#34;incident&#34; resolved and the next 30+ years of the main character's lives were addressed, after the intense detail that the reader became accustomed to.
4	1390003200	This was a great story, but a bit of a tearjerker at the end. It really makes one think how they would have handled the situation the characters were in.
5	1390003200	I found this book much better than I had anticipated. The characters were like able, the settings were interesting, and the conclusion was satisfying. You can understand both sides of the conflict, and you make a true emotional connection with the characters. It's about life's hard choices. I think it would be great for a book club discussion because there are so many sides to what is right/wrong in this novel.
4	1390003200	This was a pretty quick read, I am glad I read it. I did think it was slow in spots and a little redundant. But I definitely cared about the characters and shed a tear.  Sometimes there is no perfect ending, sometimes I find myself wanting a certain thing to happen, then wondering why did I want that if it is &#34;wrong&#34;.
5	1390003200	Very interesting and complex book.  A look at ethics, mother love, interests of the child, all rolled into an interesting plot.
5	1390003200	I loved the characters in this novel.  Good people who got caught up in circumstances that had no solution but heartbreak.
4	1390003200	Couldn't put it down. I laughed 7& cried. The story crabs you. I didn't want it to end.Beautifully written.
5	1389916800	I loved this book. It was beautifully written and although it was sad in some portions, it was an uplifting story of love and human compassion.
5	1389916800	Easy to use. Doesn't take but seconds to receive the book you want to read.  Like to preview the book before I buy.
4	1389916800	Good story. Felt rushed at times, especially the end, but kept me engrossed page by page. Will read more from the author.
5	1389916800	The characters in this story are all flawed in their own way, but they are each trying to do their best to live life the way they feel they should.  In protecting their families, each character ends up hurting someone else.  Fascinating story of the interrelationships between people of different backgrounds.  Also, I learned a lot if interesting facts about lighthouse keepers.  I always wanted to live in a lighthouse when I was a child.
3	1389916800	I truly enjoyed the first half of the novel, but it got a bit less believable in the second half.  And, certainly, a sad story.
5	1389916800	I couldn't stop reading. The author 's use of language is like reading a painting. The story is gripping. I highly recommend it.
5	1389830400	The story and characters were very well thought out.  Both the Lucy-Grace's mothers and her father captured my heart.  The author also gave us a real insight into the life of a lighthouse keeper.
5	1389830400	good  read  kept u going  to see what they were going to do!!!!!! difff book then what i usually read!!!!!!
4	1389830400	I enjoyed this book , not as predictable as I thought it would be , beautifully written . I shed a few tears . It's definitely worth reading .
5	1389830400	Heart-wrenching, yet shows how love prevails in the darkest of times.  Gives real meaning to the word &#34;marriage&#34; and all that it entails.
5	1389830400	I loved the book so much I didn't want the story to end.  The characters were believable, and the action moved along at a fast pace.
4	1389830400	I really liked the book. I got angry with the characters at times. I wasn't crazy about the way the book ended but understand it. I would recommend the book to anyone.
4	1389744000	The book took a little bit to get into but it definitely pulled at he heart strings. I did enjoy it.
5	1389744000	I would recommend this book to anyone.  A great story about how a single decision can change so many peoples lives. I love the writers style as well. Couldn't put it down!
5	1389744000	This was different and so tender.  Loved the fact that the right thing was done even though it hurt.  Want to read more of M.L. Stedman.
5	1389744000	Both of my book groups read this and everyone loved it. We cried over the choices that the characters made and debated the right and wrong of their actions, understanding what they did and why, but seeing the effects of those actions on others. Beautifully written, lovely and rugged landscapes and seascapes to imagine, harsh stories of war and prejudice, love stories. Exhilarating read.
4	1389744000	Each character has to deal with right and wrong from their own viewpoint.  Their struggles made me consider my own ethical foundations, and wonder what I would have done differently.
5	1389744000	This is a book that will take you on a journey between two families in a very small town that will find themselves put into a situation by fate but then blinded by love and grief.  This was her first novel can't wait for the next one.
5	1389744000	I am reading this title for book club.  I enjoyed the story, the character development, the setting and the psychological element.  It will provide food for discussion to go along with our wine.
3	1389657600	I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book.  But the last 1/4 left me less than excited to read it.  I felt like the author rushed to the end. I feel like there was a whole other story left to tell.
4	1389657600	This book is a  compelling page turner and makes a great book club selection. The ending may be a bit contrived, but still a good read.
4	1389657600	It took a bit to get into the story but once I was pulled in I was mesmerized by the gradual buildup toward the incredibly tragic ending. Two thirds of the way through, I began to dread reading on. although a beautifully written story, I cannot say, as a parent of two young children, that I necessarily enjoyed it. I would be very careful about recommending it. Certainly very painful for anyone who has been bereaved of a child. But all in all, a fantastic piece of writing.
5	1389657600	M.L. Steadman has written a book with so much emotion in her characters that we feel as though we are intruders on their personal decision-making journey.  The moral implications of their actions determine the course of the book the way a captain determines the course of a ship.  The reader is tossed about feeling empathy for all who have lost so much or who have so much to loose.  A well written novel I would recommend over and over.  There is ultimately light for some of the characters but darkness for others.
5	1389657600	This book had everything in it.  Love, hate, abandonment, intrigue, trials, deals, sacrifice, betrayal, redemption and forgiveness.  The book will be one of the best books for discussion in our book club.  I salute the author.  I look forward to the next book but.. How can this book be topped?
2	1389657600	I had to force myself to continue. The ending is unrealistic compared to rest of the book & character development. Skip it.
5	1389571200	Great writing, great story, great book.This book is one of the reasons I belong to a book club.My book club is but a loose collection of ordinary individuals, and I say that with the greatest of affection, who love to read books.I'd never have pulled this book down from the shelf , not ever, not at the age I am now.Oh I've read plenty of fiction in my life but sometime in my fifties I'd decided I had enough, that practicality demands I spend my little time available for reading on non-fiction.Fiction, I decided, was a waste of time.This wonderful book by M.L. Stedman taught me otherwise.Product Details&#8226; File Size: 1299 KB&#8226; Print Length: 354 pages&#8226; Page Numbers Source ISBN: 1451681739&#8226; Publisher: Scribner; Reprint edition (July 31, 2012)&#8226; Sold by:Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc&#8226; Language: English&#8226; ASIN: B0064CL1T2I was brought into this story right from the start even though I was skeptical about a fiction book I could not stop reading.The writing is excellent.  This is a book that brings back to me an old-fashioned notion.  The movie is never quite as good as the book.Which is no longer really true in that the movie is taken from narrative and adjectives to rock 'em sock 'em action that was never in the book.This book is a story about decent men and women living in a small village on the coast of Australia.  It is as spectacular a love story as one could be with two rather ordinary people at the center.It's about the enormous love between a parent and child.  It's about good people having to sometimes do bad things and it's a story about life as millions of us live it every day without such a wonderful author to document it.It would really make a lousy motion picture.But let me not discourage producers who see this wonderful love story as perfect for the big screen.  I'd think they'd have to change the Sherbournes to jet skiers who murdered Lucy-Grace's father.  Hannah would be a real mother looking more for money than her natural child.Okay, I'm done.Get a hot chocolate, some Kleenex, a comfy chair and read this book.This book is definitely one of my top ten fiction books I've ever read in my life though it's been so long with the fiction and me &#34;The Cat and the Hat&#34; might be right up there.PS- This book has a happy AND a sad ending, somehow the author pulled this off.
5	1389571200	The story is hard to get into but, once the groundwork is layed it's hard to put it down. It makes you relive all of the hard choices you've ever had to make in your life.
5	1389571200	THIS BOOK HELD MY ATTENTION RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. SO FAR IT IS ONE OF  MY FAVORITES.ALL THE CHARACTERS HAD A VALID REASON FOR THEIR DECISIONS.  THEY ALL WERE GOOD PEOPLE INSPITE OF THE OUTCOME.THIS WAS DEFINITELY A STUDY OF MORALS AND HOW LIVES CAN BE CHANGED BY THE DECISIONS WE MAKE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK
5	1389484800	One of the best books I've read in a while.  Will definitely recommend this book to my fellow readers. Every character was so real that you felt you were "in their shoes"
5	1389484800	Life as a lighthouse keeper is lonely and isolated but was so important in the days when ships required the lights to help with navigation.  The keeper needed to be diligent in his duties as was the one in the story.  He is isolated and takes a wife that he loves dearly.  She has a series of miscarriages and wants a child desperately.  The story becomes one of morality when a small boat containing a live infant child and dead man are washed up on the shore near the lighthouse.  The husband discovers that the child is that of a woman from a far away town from which both the husband and his wife have come.  The moral dilemma is that the wife refuses to give up the child even when she is made aware of the source.  The light keeper is stricken with the choice between his wife and the right thing to do.  It is a tantalizing, and most interesting story.
5	1389484800	Excellent, thought provoking book, well written... Research good. Discriptions good Looking forward to her next book.Enjoyed it very much, great book for a book group discussion ...
5	1389484800	Beautiful writing.Lovely story.Very different from the usual ..The family was real and true.A must read.I have told my friemds about the book.
3	1389484800	I thought the characters were wooden and unoriginal.  The plot was equally uninspired -- kind of Harlequin romance on steroids.  I wouldn't recommend it.
1	1389484800	THIS BOOK WAS BORING.  THE DESCRIPTIONS WERE WAY TOO LONG, ABOUT A PAGE TO DESCRIBE ONE THING.  I GOT HALF WAY THROUGH BOOK AND STILL HADN'T PICKED UP MOMENTUM.
4	1389484800	Author M. L. Stedman compassionately explores the limitless actions parents will take to protect and love their children. This book is fiction but every parent will recognize as true the searing, totally accurate thoughts and emotions depicted here. The Light Between Oceans is a morality tale of parents caught between two equally devastating choices. It is a brilliant story idea with fascinating background details about life at an Australian lighthouse. I rated it four stars instead of five only because, though it is well written, the writing falls short of the very highest standards set by guiding literary lights such as Haruki Murakami. If you are a parent you must read this book.
5	1389484800	M.L. Stedman conveyed a wonderful visualization of an isolated island off the coast of Austrailia. More importantly, she conveyed the human experience on that island. How the mind strives to make decisions, not only against the elements of weather, survival, and love...but moral decisions. The characters are not typical or predictable, yet it is not a struggle to know them. I believe you may find yourself asking what you would do in the same situations they find themselves in? Did they make the right decisions? Had they changed anytihing, what would the outcome have been? You will ponder this book long after the last page is read....and likely think about the characters for some time.
5	1389484800	The Light Between the Oceans is a great book about love, life, disappointment  and so much more. I felt the pain of the characters and couldn't imagine an ending that would be believable. Above all it is a beautiful story!!!
4	1389398400	This is the first book that I have read by this author.  I  was torn in two by the pain that was so deep in each of the lives of these two women and am emotionally drained.
5	1389398400	this book was a truly wonderful read. i loved the story line and how dedicated two people were to making a life work. the main characters are amazing, thoughtful and interesting. learned a bit about western austrailia and lighthouses as well!
4	1389398400	the intensity of the kind of love one has for a child.  The author also does a nice job with the themes of forgiveness and the idea of our lives being small in comparison to the world and it's history.  In the end it was well worth the read.
5	1389398400	Stedman creates a heart-tearing, just possible, story of a child torn by the love of two mothers by surrounding it with the history of Australian lighthouse keepers. Light was not easy to read, but I applaud the writer's skill. I also totally appreciated the viewpoint of each of her characters.
5	1389398400	This is one of my favorites. A story of dedication, heartbreak, and the love of family.  An emotional and well-told story.
4	1389312000	I loved the way he built the characters. A great book club read as the choices the characters made were very thought provoking.
4	1389312000	A leisurely pace, but written a bit poetically.  This book really is about love, loss, and forgiveness.  As the mother of two adopted girls, the story really touched me profoundly.  I recommend this book highly.
5	1389312000	I loved this book!  It was beautifully written and was about honesty, integrity and love.  Characters were well drawn. We can only pray we are never called upon to make such difficult decisions.
5	1389312000	I found a red fancy Christmas frame and really liked the contrast with the subdued green of the message.  I put it by my Nativity.
4	1389312000	Very well written. Great descriptive powers. Built a great narrative which resulted in a page turner. Really stirred the heart.
4	1389312000	This was a beautifully told story displaying the rawness of true love in it's many forms, it is well-done and happy and sad and tragic and in the end, forgiveness in truest form, love wins.
5	1389312000	I loved this book!  It is beautifully written and a book I could not put down.  It is full of heart wrenching, moral dilemmas that keep you captivated!  I did not want the book to end!
5	1389312000	This was a beautiful tale of a man who becomes a lightkeeper, his life scarred by the regularity of life at the lighthouse in every way possible. He and his wife adopt a baby that is washed up on their lonely island and this event will define their lives in a variety of ways. The real treasure in this book lies, in my opinion, in the ruminations of the light keeper, as he contemplates the mysteries of life through his personal experiences at the light house. A beautiful book, well written and captivatingly recounted
4	1389225600	It is  moving story about what happens when good people make bad decisions.  What I found captivating was &#8230;. and maybe I am stretching the intentions of the author a bit here &#8230;  that the book is filled with people having made bad decisions and living with the consequences, not just our two main characters.Maile Meloy (author) says:It is a beautiful novel about isolation and courage in the face of enormous loss.  &#8230;. You stop hoping the characters will make different choices, and find you can only watch, transfixed, as every conceivable choice becomes an impossible one.I always say that when people claim they have no other options, that what they are really saying is that they have no other options that they like.  This is a story of no other options that we like.
3	1389225600	I was totally engrossed in the writing as well as the story until the end. Without giving away the ending, I was disappointed in how it ended. Didn't seem like the outcome was true to the psychology of the characters as the author had drawn them throughout the novel
5	1389225600	Boy home from war, applies to be lighthouse keeper (for post-war ruminations). Goes inland only once a year. A young woman on land flirts w/ him. They end up married and honeymooning on island. Babies come and go. One day a boat washes ashore w/ a baby in it. Because they have lost all their babies, they decide to keep this one, who grows up to be an island sprite. Then they go ashore and all he'll breaks loose. You cannot imagine the twists and turns and the ultimate outcome of this couple, this child, and this community.
4	1389225600	Really enjoyed reading this book.  The characters were well drawn & the writing was smooth.  I recommend this book.  The descriptive language was enjoyable.  I could picture the settings even though I had never been to the places in the book.
4	1389225600	I had been using another brands forehead thermometer for 3 years. When Influenster offered to send me one of the Braun ForeHead Thermometers to try, I was excited to compare. I had liked my other thermometer but was not in love with it. I am in love with the Braun.It has two buttons, one for power and the other for scanning. It's so easy to use. Turn it on. Press the scan button. Move the thermometer across the forehead, from center to temple. The thermometer will do a long beep when it is done scanning. If the temperature readout has a green light, things are A-OK. If Yellow, keep an eye on it. If red, someone has a fever.My favorite aspect of this forehead thermometer is the part that connects with your forehead. It's shaped to fit the curve of that spot. The rubberized cover is smooth and doesn't grab. It makes it very easy to make and maintain the contact with the skin to get a good temp.The one con that I have is that it can give out a different temperature if you take it a few times. The last time my daughter had a fever, I double checked it with an oral thermometer just to make sure. Sometimes it reads that she has a fever when she doesn't. If I am concerned then I take it a few times.Overall, I'd recommend this if you are in the market for a forehead thermometer. It is better than the other ones out there.
2	1389225600	I was super bored the whole way through this book. Depressing. Slow. Predictable. Was very disappointed after reading the rave reviews.
5	1389225600	Beautiful, poignant story.  It has the qualities of a classic.  The author is a gifted story teller, weaving lives, characters and circumstances together in an interesting way.
4	1389225600	Great book, had me in tears. I would recommend it, but would caution readers that it may make them feel uncomfortable.
4	1389225600	Interesting from the start. Emotional at the end. Had me crying and hoping for the best for all,which almost happened.
5	1389139200	The story held my interest from beginning to end.  My emotions ran deep and I found myself sympathetic to each character.  A must read for all ages...
5	1389139200	Couldn't put it down.  Never knew what was coming next, but be ready for a real cry session. Beautiful, complex, and heartbreaking all at the same time
4	1389139200	Beautifully written, emotionally engaging.  I found the characters to be complex, and the story had enough twists to have me (figuratively) holding my breath to see what comes next.
4	1389139200	This was a great lst book for the author.  I enjoyed the storyline and the characters.  I would recommend to others.
5	1389139200	Stedman is wonderful writer.  With emotion and clarity the story of the lighthouse keeper and his wife unfolds a heart rendering tale of life and all its sorrows and joys.  This story is a very good read.
5	1389139200	A heartwarming love story, an unexpected ending. Easy to read.  I read this in one day.  Made you real think about a real possible situation.
4	1389052800	Very engaging! I enjoyed the story line and loved a relatively happy ending. For someone who loves lighthouses or water it is a great read.
3	1389052800	This was a good story, but too gut wrenching for me as an adoptive parent.  I did not like the ending, but could not see how it could have ended differently.
5	1389052800	Great book. I loved the characters and couldn't put it down.  Although there were many sad parts, I was left with a feeling of hope.
5	1389052800	What a great job of writing!  It is difficult to believe that this was the author&#8217;s first book.  This author described places and situations so well that she made the reader feel like an eye-witness.  Character development was also excellent.  It seemed to me that the author covered all the bases.  If the reader wondered why a character behaved in a certain way, the answer could probably be found by looking back and reading an earlier passage again.
4	1389052800	book club selected it.  I like it but not finished reading.Author does good job of developing characters. Takes place in waters near Australia.
5	1389052800	Took me a little at first to  figure out why it was a Book Club choice, and then, I couldn't stop reading!  Loved it.
3	1388966400	Literary accounts abound of the enrichment bestowed by love.  This novel shows, however, how a fevered distortion of love can accomplish the very opposite.  The path to hell is paved with good intentions, a premise eloquently demonstrated by M. L. Stedman, author of &#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34;.The principal characters are skillfully brought to life and they inhabit the pages with an immediacy that draws in the reader.  The plight of a lonely and war-scarred lighthouse-keeper who unexpectedly finds love is compelling.  As is the portrayal of his love for the headstrong young woman who becomes his wife and sympathy for her after several miscarriages and the news that the couple can never become parents.  With similar assurance Stedman breathes life into the character of a distraught young widow who is told that that the sea has taken her husband and baby.  The foreshadowing of the collision between these characters and its outcome drive the book forward.Stedman's writing about the wilds of Western Australia and the lives and experiences of its inhabitants in the early 20th century is also memorable.  Its clarity and insight are exceptional.  Descriptive passages of the whims and moods of the ocean are especially strong.But having set things up beautifully, the writing loses steam after the inevitable collision between the main characters.  The story chugs towards its predictable conclusion with scene after scene of misunderstandings, recriminations, misguided sacrifice, emotional trauma and other over-cooked dramatic devices which tend to exhaust, rather than energize, the reader.  Towards the latter part of the book my interest began to flag.  What started as a sure-handed account was losing its way.  Given the subject matter and the plot it would be hard to imagine another ending, but less indulgence and greater acceleration to the conclusion would have helped.Having said that, Stedman shows enormous promise and I will be keeping an eye out for her next novel.
4	1388966400	Interesting story line, worth a read if you enjoy literature and fiction. Characters are well developed. I would definitely recommend this story.
4	1388880000	This book was very interesting and sad, but it made me think. The main characters had to decide between what was the right thing to do and what was the most appealing thing to do. It was a heartrending decision for them. I would recommend the book but also I would want to discuss it with someone to talk about the decision they made and understand it better.
5	1388880000	A beautiful story from beginning to end!  This book is amazing and so very well written. The characters are beautifully written. I hate to be through.
5	1388880000	This book was so beautifully written and takes you through a journey of extreme love and loss and how delicate life is. I highly recommend reading it.
4	1388880000	This story was a book club read so I read it but it is a bit depressing although I was compelled to read to the finish to find out what happened.
5	1388793600	M.L. Stedman writes with a transcendent voice that mesmerizes the reader with her characters and story. The Light Between Oceans transports the reader away from their ordinary work-a-day world and makes them believe Izzy, Tom and Lucy Lighthouse really do exist. Bravo!
2	1388793600	Unfortunately, I know what I would do with a baby I might found-I'd give it back! End of story.The book never really grabbed my interest.
5	1388793600	Beautiful story! I could not put the book down. Very educational about life, lighthouses, choices, sin and forgiveness. Living a lie will haunt you and destroy you.
4	1388793600	The moral choices in this book made for great discussion. Our book club choice for January 2014. I always enjoy reading about other parts of the world.
4	1388793600	Learned a lot about the culture of Australia post WWII.  Moral dilemma definitely discussion-worthy.I really hate that I have to write at least 20 words.
3	1388793600	Not the greatest book of the 21st century but worth a read if you have nothing better to do.  Or read.
5	1388793600	This book was very good. It took awhile to get into. But when you did you couldn't wait to turn the pages.
2	1388707200	It was well wriitten, but I did not like the subject matter.  It was a book club selection, not something I would have choosen.I would read another book by this author.
5	1388707200	I randomly selected this book and hit the jackpot.  It's well written, insightful and provocative.  It brought up many intriguing life  questions without being preachy. Well worth the read.
5	1388707200	Really enjoyed reading this account of a family's life. The joy along with crisis that occurred and liked the book's ending.
5	1388707200	This is the January book club book, I loved it.  Read it in two days.  Would have read it in one day, if I had started earlier.  I could not put it down.  Really enjoyed it.  Had to find out what happened to them.
4	1388707200	the book kept my attention throughout. It was a believable plot and was full of emotion. I enjoyed it and recommend it as a recreational read.
5	1388620800	I enjoyed reading this.  Author writes so as the reader understands the heartbreak the characters feel.  I adopted 2 children, so I could identify in a small way how the characters felt.
5	1388620800	A book club choice. Loved the story and enjoyed the extensive conversation it created. Highly recommend.I wished for a different ending but.....
5	1388620800	Excellent book.  Tears and smiles.  Hard to put down.  Easy to pick up.  Look forward to more books by Stedman.
5	1388620800	Wonderful story. Kept my interest the whole time  great style of writing. Can't wait for the next book to come out
4	1388620800	My friend recommended this book and at first in the beginning, the pace was a bit slow and boring.  However, as the story and characters developed, I got really into the story and each of the characters - you could relate to each of them and how they were feeling.  Couldn't put the book down and had to keep reading!  Overall a very good book with a feel-good ending.
5	1388620800	I loved the book. Well written.  I didn't want to put it down. Great imagery. Stirred the emotions. A simple story that doesn't need a lot of embellishment.
4	1388620800	Enjoyed learning about lighthouses, and thought book was well-written, and well plotted,  Characters well drawn.Here are the required five more words.
5	1388620800	I truly enjoyed this book. The characters were very believable and Stedman did a great job depicting the characters' internal conflict. Without spoiling the end, I loved the way the story wraps up and the overriding message. I highly recommend!
4	1388534400	The details about a lighthouse, living in remote Australia are interesting.  The story is kind of sad, actually, and somewhat contrived.  It is a toss up between three and four stars.
4	1388534400	One woman marries an unpopular man and loses him and their child.  On a light house a hundred miles out to sea another woman with a popular husband, the light house keeper, loses children before they are born.When a row boat comes to the island where the light house sends forth its beacon, many decisions confront the couple and it seems there are no answers fully right or fully wrong.  In time, other decisions are made and actions taken and consequences are confronted and faced.My favorite takeaway from this novel is the sentence that is something like this:  when you forgive you only have to do it once, when you resent you have to do it over and over and over.
4	1388534400	I really enjoyed this book; the narrative of the details of the surroundings and of our human nature are so vivid that you feel immersed in the story.The permanent conflict between right and wrong is just a  reflect of our complex human nature, where most of the times it's gray rather than plain black and white, and  this book certainly shows that uncertainty  that is in all of us.
5	1388534400	Awesome story. Gripping writing. Definitely read it. Life covers ALL emotions. Why limit yourself to only warm fuzzy ones? To grow as people we need to embrace it all because we will each face some of it all.
4	1388534400	I enjoyed the book - well written and a lesson on the consequences of making choices .... whether intended or not.
5	1388534400	This is probably one of my favorite books of all time. It caught my attention at the very beginning and held it the whole way through. Fantastic story line and I loved the characters involved. I would recommend this book with a high rating!
4	1388448000	Interesting story, good descriptions.  The ending was better than I anticipated.  I recommend this for anyone age 15 and up.
5	1388448000	I purchased this book to read for the bookclub we have at work.  I wasn't sure of it to begin with, but within 20 pages, I couldn't put it down.  My heart went out to all of the characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  It was great!
2	1388448000	I could not get into the book. I could not relate to the character's dilemma. I will say that most of my book club members did like it.
4	1388448000	This book was very enjoyable and held my interest, it has a very different twist to it and was good, I would recommend as a good read
5	1388448000	Once I got started didn't want to put it down. Wasn't sure about the ending, but it ended up good.
5	1388448000	It was hard to put this novel down. Stedman's characters are beautifully developed and authentic, living in settings that create and define them with decisions that both scar and strengthen them.  I'm already eager for Stedman's next novel.
4	1388448000	Good story. I kept wanting to know what would happen. I was pleased with the ending of the book. Enjoy.
5	1388275200	This book held my interest from the beginning to the end. It tells of life living in a an isolated light house which was very interesting. The main story is the desire of a woman to be a mother and the lengths she will go to do this. The father's torment of loving the child and also what is the right thing to do keeps the suspense of the story moving. It is a touchingbeautiful story of a mother's love for a child.
5	1388275200	I truly enjoyed this book because of the content and the learning that was an added factor.  I would recommend this one to anyone who likes a steady hand and a sound mind.
5	1388275200	Beautifully written. Great storyline. Couldn't put it down. You fall in love with the main characters and the wonderful descriptions. It is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.
4	1388275200	The Light Between Oceans is a worthy read.  A buxom tale with simple characters fleshing out the complexity of the human heart makes The Light Between Oceans an easy yet captivating story for the reader who wants to invest himself in a novel without being burdened by numerous plot lines or countless characters.  Stedman's first novel suggests a promising writer bursting forth on the horizon.
5	1388188800	Tom Sherbourne is a medaled veteran of The Great War, a man of principle and character who dragged men to safety and always followed the rules. He&#8217;s grateful for a job manning the lighthouse on Janus Rock, a remote peninsula off Australia&#8217;s coast, where he can methodically work and live his days in order and sameness.On a trip to the mainland, he meets the lovely, spirited Isabel, and returns to Janus Rock with her to carve a life. There she loves and cares for him, explores the small island, and longs for children. She miscarries twice and Tom would do anything to see her happy again. One day, mere weeks after delivering a stillborn child, a small boat washes onto shore. Inside is a dead man&#8212;and a live baby. Isabel views this as a sign from God.Despite Tom&#8217;s insistence that they report the man and baby, Isabel protests. The mother is surely dead, the baby has no one but them. Tom loves her beyond measure and agrees to wait. The gravity of their decision weighs on him, but the problem is, he falls in love with the little Lucy, too. Two years later, when visiting the mainland, they learn someone has never stopped looking for the little one, whose name is not Lucy at all.Rarely does a novel come along that is so perfectly crafted, so packed with flawed, believable characters. Every word, every scene, has a purpose. The plot twists and bends to unexpected places, thrusting the characters into situations as rough as the raging ocean. Ms. Stedman is a masterful storyteller, has a keen eye and knows how to portray raw emotion on the page.I listened to the book on audio, read by the wonderful Noah Taylor, who truly brought the characters to life.What a stunning debut. Highly recommend!
5	1388102400	A story that ties  lighthouse operation and human interaction. A study of love, loss, and forgiveness. Also, interesting take on human dealings and feelings.
4	1388102400	Loved the setting in Australia, a part of the world of which I have minimal knowledge. Add to that the setting in he mid twenties and the life of a lighthouse keeper, all putting me in a life I could not have imagined.  The writing was excellent and especially descriptive of nature and human emotions. Tie that together with a suspensfull story line and it makes for a great read. I highly recommend it. O loo
4	1388102400	A tender story of longing for things we are unable to have. And, that longing develops into a decision that brings grief, but ultimate understanding to people touched by the decision. A tender and uplifting novel.
5	1388102400	Excellent author. Great education of lighthouse workings and procedures.  Also felt as if I were on the island, supply boat, serving in the war.  Experienced the anguish and happiness of the characters.  Tough subject handled beautifully.
5	1388102400	Beautiful book! Your heart is torn for both of them. I sometimes wonder what life is like for abducted children who are later returned. Life goes on for the child and those left behind.
5	1388102400	Page turner although it starts out slowly.  Well worth reading.  Just when you think you know what the characters should do you change your mind.  Couldn't put it down.
4	1388016000	The book was well written, and held my interest to the very end. I like an easy read and this book was that..
4	1388016000	Don't let the my subject title dissuade you. The Light Between Oceans is a malvelous story about true love and how World War I changed the  lives of families around the world. When young brothers were cut down in their youth.  When boys return from war as men with horror stories that couldn't be retold. M.L. Stedman tells about gentle people, livimg in a remote section of Australia who worked hard to survive in a tough environment. Immigrants who came to Australia to make a better life but could not escape their past. Told about the loss of babies during birth. How one young mother spiraled into dispair after marrying her sweetheart of choice by making a choice to save a life and destorying many other lives at the same time.
5	1387929600	A wonderful story about love and loss. It makes you love your children even more and makes you question what you'd be willing to give up to make them happy. What is right and what is wrong?A wonderful story!
3	1387929600	Well written. A page turner. But good lord, I just don't need this kind of sadness in my reading life. It was all too much, especially for a parent. I guess I would say that it was a good book with an interesting plot, and that it was well crafted... But I sorta wish I hadn't read it.
4	1387929600	It crabbed my interest right away.  Good story,easy reading.  Kept you interested until the end. Good discussion at book club.
4	1387929600	it's really good and super duper awesome and I love it so much yeah woo woo swag so read it
4	1387843200	The story is very unique and different, very descriptive and well-written, a heartbreaking story! Well developed characters in a unique setting.
5	1387843200	Very good book.Couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen!An unusual and interesting plot.  Highly recommended!
5	1387843200	The book kept you moving and wanting to read on.  Portions of the story were sad but made the whole very believable.  I read it as part of a book club.  Everyone in the group thoroughly enjoyed the story as well as the details about the characters' surroundings.
4	1387843200	And when it picks up, you can't put it down!  And you find yourself thinking about the characters the next day, wondering what they're up to!
4	1387756800	I really liked this story. She gave you a wonderful feel for the location and interesting characters. The story could have tended toward melodrama, but it was so well written that you really feel for all the characters
5	1387756800	This was a very intricate book in regard to the characters, their personalities, their feelings and motivations. I picked this book out randomly and really enjoyed it. This is a book that gets right to the quick of the characters and you get to know them very well. The story was poignant and I would recommend this book.
4	1387756800	Great character building.Dealt with moral issues very well. Couldn't put it down. You really feel the isolation of light house living.
5	1387756800	The story line was especially interesting to me because of family in Australia.  It certainly isn't a book that will make you feel &#34;happy&#34; but it certainly is a book you don't want to put down.
5	1387670400	This was a great read, and it is an excellent choice for a book club as there is much to discuss.
5	1387670400	This story was complex yet the presentation was simplistic.  I will definitely recommend  this book and choose this author again.
4	1387670400	Read it for Book Club...unanimous thumbs up form everyone.  A winding story line and interesting life from that period and that part of the world.
5	1387584000	I never know where to put valuables when I am staying in a place w/o a safe. This is the perfect camouflage. I have been looking for this item for a year now, after QVC no longer carried the product. I will also use it at home to stash good jewelry when I'm not wearing it or when I am leaving the house for a day or two. Someone would have to ransack through an entire closet full of clothes to find this.
4	1387584000	A lovely story. Really enjoyed the detail and energy of the writer. Tale of unknown islands make you want to go go & find them on the map to add them to your bucket list!
4	1387497600	What makes a good mother? Does living in isolation alter your perception of right and wrong? We had a very thoughtful discussion about these issues at our bookclub. The writer keeps the book moving and the reader doesn't really know what will happen until the very end.
5	1387497600	Tom and Isabel live on an island where Tom is a lighthouse keeper. They have plans to start a family but Isabel is having a hard time carrying a baby to full term. She just lost another baby when a boat washes ashore carrying a dead man and a living baby. Tom wants to report the baby but Isabel has other plans. When they head to the mainland a couple of years later, they find out what happened the night their baby, Lucy, washed ashore. Tom is riddled with guilt but Isabel is determined to stick with their original story, no matter what the cost.It didn't take long to discover that this book wasn't going to have a happy ending for everyone. I have had my own fertility issues in the past so I felt some sympathy towards Isabel for what she had gone through, but was also upset with her for the decision she made. Tom went along with her decision but he was wracked with guilt the entire time. The choices they made had very real and devastating consequences.I got to the end and was literally sobbing, which then gave me a huge headache. I felt invested in all of the main characters and my heart broke for them and all they went through.We read this in my book club and it is a great discussion book! The characters are faced with a huge moral dilemma which makes you question what you would do in a similar circumstance. There doesn't seem to be any easy answers but we all did agree that the situation could have been handled better by all parties and would have had a happier outcome. I guess, though, this is ultimately true to life, after all.Content: There is some swearing and one random "f" word.
5	1387497600	So much to think and ponder about in this book; excellent.  Cannot believe this is her first. Everyone should read this.
5	1387497600	Light between the oceans was one book I had difficulty putting down.  I hated to share my time with other things.  I had to finish the book and keep it between my realm.  I cried many tears at the end.  Would have changed the ending if I could, but the ending was as it should be.  the right thing was done.  Freda
4	1387411200	This book stsrted off somewhat slowly, butoverll it was a great read.  I felt a lot of compassion for all the characters.
5	1387411200	Gripping from the start.  Very well written.  Characters' good and bad points are what lead to the moral conundrums, and the readers know, judge and are involved with the dilemma as the story unfolds.
5	1387411200	This book was recommended by a friend and I thank her for it.  The characters will pull you in and keep you until the last page.
5	1387324800	Not since Cold Mountain have I found such an atmospheric story! Janus Rock is a more than a location, it is a character that compels behavior from its inhabitants. First as isolation it builds a wall and then as sanctuary it fends off consequences. Stedman's writing style is elegant and renders a beautiful book. I could not put it down. I'm going a step beyond recommendation - I'm buying a copy for my best friend for Christmas.  Can't wait for Stedman's next book!
5	1387324800	The subject matter of this book provoked a great deal of discussion in our book club (of older persons). It would be interesting to hear how younger women feel about the subject. We researched other books with different choices and outcomes. My choice would be to &#34;keep my mouth shut.&#34;
5	1387324800	Great Book! Enjoyed it from beginning to end. I enjoyed our book club talk about it. Thanks for fast shipping.
5	1387324800	This is a thought providing book. Thoughts about forgiveness, love and morals. I enjoyed the authors simplicity , yet still giving a description of the events and places. A wonderful first book.
4	1387324800	I enjoyed the twists and turns and theemotional complexity.  It was well writtenand held my interest. There were times when I had to put the kindle down to brace myself for the next surprise.
5	1387324800	Lyrical. I love the quietness of this book.  Stedman's writing transport the reader to the isolated but livable island of this lighthouse. The protagonist and his wife's quest for children wrenches any heart making you accept their desicion, even though you know it is wrong and will have great consequences.
5	1387238400	Great don't miss this one, its a page turner.  If this is her first book I look forward to her second.
5	1387238400	Heartfelt sad and beautiful all the way the ending made me cry so hard it was really exceptional I will recommend this book!
5	1387238400	Although it starts out slow, give it a chance. It is a wonderfully written story, thoroughly enjoyable, and I was so sad when it ended. I wish I could find more books like this!
4	1387238400	This book kept my interest from beginning to end. It had well developed, and of course, flawed characters. The story itself was different, fresh and believable. I felt the end needed more written about the later years of the husband and wife. Well done! I would recommend.
5	1387065600	Any book that brings tears to my eyes and stays with me for days later is worth 5 stars.  I would very highly recommend this to anyone.  We will be discussing it at our book club next month and can't wait to hear from others.
4	1387065600	Great book. Everyone inbook club loved it.Look forward to reading more books from this author. Loved the diversity.
3	1387065600	This is an interesting story from different angels but it tends to be not so compelling after the first half of the book.
3	1387065600	it's an interesting setting,which is what drew me to the book.  The story is slow paced, but well told.  The characters and their difficult choices and dilemmas are believable, but I didn't find the story compelling or gripping.  The one thing I felt difficult to buy into was the initial decisions that led to the whole drama.  Based on the characters and who they were set up to be, I found it hard to believe they wouldn't have reported the incident in hopes of having the opportunity to adopt Lucy from the beginning, and if not, just adopt another child, period.  It seems a more believable choice for them.
5	1386979200	This book was a page turner, I could not put it down. the plot, the characters were so real. I have heard stories of these things happening for real in remote places and I know its not hard that something like this could happen. I could feel the love between the characters explained in the book . Very good
3	1386979200	The writing was really good.  I enjoyed the book.  The story kept my interest but it was a bit trite.
5	1386979200	The ending of this novel really breaks the heart. It makes you ache for the grievances of the characters. The brilliant style of the writer makes you live and feel the pain of the characters. This is true especially for the sad end of the novel. I cannot think of any other novel recently that made me live such mood and state of mind.To make a fair judgement of this novel, it is important to mention that in some places I felt bored with the author's indulgence in too much irrelevant details. There is also wrong information stated in the story of Ibrahim and his son Isaac. The correct name is his other son Ismail who was about to sacrifice his life through the order of God to Ibrahim.Anyways, I have to say that this is a very well written story. Description of the characters' feelings and motivations was very well communicated in way that makes you feel and think of it long time after you finish it. It even makes you think of the moralities associated with the story to figure out which approach would be ethically correct. In general, it is a good dramatic novel that can capture the hearts in the nowadays-thriller-dominated fiction world.
4	1386979200	The characters had difficult decisions to make and I could relate to their conflicts. The story made me realize how far our society has come in dealing with child custody issues. The factual information about lighthouses was very interesting too.
5	1386979200	First 40% of book I didn't have any interest in, almost stopped reading it.  It spent most of that in descriptions of area and working at the lighthouse.  But then it takes off and it was hard to put down.  The book became sad then heartbreaking.  Had a lot of life lessons in it though.  I'd say it was the saddest book I'd ever read.  Very emotional.
5	1386892800	It is so well written that I could clearly picture every place and person in my mind.  The author leads us back and forth to the past of the characters so their actions and emotions are understandable. An emotional read.  I would highly recommend this book.
3	1386892800	Recommended to me and read it for pleasure.  The story was okay, but not my favorite.  Kind of unrealistic plot.
4	1386806400	This is a very thoughtfully written book with a well crafted story that reads more like a Historical tale rather than fiction. The concept is fairly high but the author really makes it believable as she delves into the thinking and motives of each character.I found the first third of it to be pretty boring and I jokingly referred to it as my 'woman book' as it reads more like a sappy romance novel without the sex and a more interesting setting. But it really picks up in part 2 and gets even better as it goes. I don;t want to give away any details, but it does not feel particularly sad by the end so much as realistic. Certainly not depressingly tragic, at least not to me. So, if you're a guy reading this, I'd urge you to push on throguht he first 100 pages ago because it really is worth it by the end.
5	1386806400	This is one of the best books our Book Club has read in quite a while, in my opinion. For a first effort, Steadman hits a high point with the tattered characters and their unusual dilemma presented when a rowboat comes ashore on the lonely island where they operate the lighthouse.  I am glad I read it on my Kindle, because many of the words were of Australian origin and the Oxford Dictionary on Kindle included the definitions in reference.  In our discussions we had many differing opinions of how we would have handled the outcome, so it made for a lively reading group discussion.
5	1386806400	I loved M. L. Stedman's writing which pulls you in like a vortex, sucking you and your emotions into the story.  She brought out such intensity to the land, the light and each character.  And she eloquently demonstrates the special power each of us possesses, if only we choose to recognize and use it. Brava Ms. Stedman!
5	1386720000	I really enjoyed this book and the moral and emotional dilemmas presented. Each character was struggling with right or wrong, hope or despair, forgiveness or hate. I plowed through the book in just a couple sittings and could wait to see how it ended or what choices the characters made. The end was very moving, I was crying so hard I could barely see the pages!
5	1386720000	This was a very authentic, gentle story where no one was all right and no one was a &#34;bad guy&#34;.  It was like life and very believable.
5	1386720000	This book is excellent.  The story is both sad and happy and the characters are very well-developed.  I could not put it down!
5	1386633600	The Light Between Oceans is a gripping, complex tale. M. L. Stedman's writing is beautiful and descriptive; I felt like I knew the characters personally. Even though the plot develops slowly, I could not put this book down--especially once I got to part 3! Every chapter left me wondering, "What's going to happen next?". The story is a moral conundrum that lingers with readers long after they've read the final page. I loved it and look forward to hearing more from M. L. Stedman.
3	1386633600	I bought this book based on the many positive reviews  but I wish that I had taken the time to read some of the less positive reviews.  While the story here is well written, the premise is somewhat unbelievable and quite sad.  It was not an enjoyable read because you were just waiting for the truth to b exposed and ultimately it is and it gets harder to enjoy after that.
5	1386633600	I am so emotional upon reading the last page I cannot even try to give an adequate review.  I will miss the characters like crazy.  All that happened in this story was opposite of what contrary to what I wished for.  Heartbreaking and difficult to accept at times.
5	1386633600	only read this as it was a book club selection, but I am so glad I did. This is an excellent novel.  I can't believe this is a first novel for this author. Well written and gripping story.  I could barely put it down.
5	1386633600	This is the best book I have read in a very long time.In the post World War I era, an infertile couple, isolated in a lighthouse in Western Australia, find a baby and a dead man on a boat that has washed up against the shore. The woman, who has just given birth to a still born, finds her body and soul equipped to the task and joys of motherhood. She pleads with her husband to allow her to keep the infant. He knows better, but finally accedes and does not report the matter to his superiors, as he is tasked to do.But as the baby grows, the man, a veteran of the horrific war, cannot live with the lie. His guilt intensifies when he discovers the identity of the biological mother whose loss has driven her to the brink of madness. Dare he defy his wife by telling this poor woman that her child is alive? What punishments will the authorities mete out if he does?The story, rightly called &#34;tragic&#34; by other reviewers, is told against the backdrop of the couple's environment. The author does take us on a number of excursions into their world. Some readers found these digressions boring, but to me the information was value added. I was amazed at the author's skill in blending them into the story and making the reader actually feel what life was like for her characters.I found all the characters interesting and sympathetic, especially the two &#34;mothers.&#34; Who has the stronger claim on the child?It did bother me though that the husband would bring the issue to the fore without first consulting his wife. Towards the end of the book, I really did want him to fry.I also loved the writing itself, which is descriptive and vivid. As another has pointed out, this book would make an excellent movie.
4	1386633600	The story line is a great one: engaging and written well enough to keep my attention throughout the book. Certain sentences were worth 2 or 3 readings. The plot gets a bit sluggish about 2/3 of the way through. I wanted to say &#34;Okay, I get it. Can we get on with things?&#34; But it recovers nicely and ties up all plot lines in an ending that seemed believable and good.
5	1386547200	Beautiful story!  Beautiful writing!  I only read before I go to sleep.  Could not wait until bedtime to get back to the book.
5	1386547200	Great story. Kept me reading until I was done. I love historical fiction and especially ones with a message in it.
4	1386547200	It captures your interest immediately and has twists and turns that make your heart ache, but you feel like you know the characters.  It's hard to really like the characters though.
5	1386547200	Great book, wonderful insight into human nature. Read for book club.  Would highly recommend this book for clubs or just to have a good read for yourself.
5	1386547200	One of the best books I have read in a long time. The struggle  of right and wrong couldn't be ignored. I was right there feeling their pain.
5	1386547200	I picked this book up because I liked the title, then the excellent writing captured and held me. It is a good story that moves slowly, easily, and unpredictably. Once you become involved with the characters, and their dilemma seems headed for tragedy, it is hard to put the book ( oops, meant Kindle) down. But much like real life, the better nature of people emerges in the nick of time, leading to a very touching and satisfying ending to the book.
5	1386460800	Really well written, engaging, a great story, learned about lighthouses, loved it! I was sorry it ended, I wanted more!
3	1386460800	strong characters with simple plot makes for a fast and enjoyable read.M.L. Stedman's writing is excellent and does a great job of progressing the story while providing colorful details on the settings and events.
4	1386460800	Heart warming book that had me guessing where the story line was going to end up.  I like books that develop characters and this author did that for me.  A couple of things the lead character did, did not hold true for me but all in all, I enjoyed this read.
5	1386460800	&#34;Semi-spoiler alert&#34;  I was shocked to realize this the first book for this author.  It was engaging, moving, thought-provoking  with beautiful passages that moved my soul.  We are all on the journey of life and choices are made along the way, ML brings this to light and lets us know that no matter what, we choose how we go forth.  The characters came alive for me and I could not put the book down.  Some say this book is sad, but go we all have sadness in our life.  We all have a choice to go forth in love and promise or wallow in sorrow.  Thank you ML for a beautiful, emotional ride!  You thoughts and lessons will stay with me for a long time.
5	1386374400	In this story an absorbing situation is revealed slowly. A loving decision reveals true character of the ones caught up in this drama.
5	1386374400	I would give this book ten stars if I could!  One of the best books I have read in a long time. I hope a movie is made from this book.
5	1386374400	This novel explores the difference between the &#34;right&#34; thing to do as opposed to what your heart tells you to do. Never read many woman writers, guess I've been missing out. The heartache ending leaves you with hope and sadness at the same time.
5	1386374400	It's a rare set of characters that pull you into their story and makes you care about them, Ms. Stedman has done exactly that, and more.  Tom and Isabel have a timeless love, beset by unimaginable loss and make a decision based on love, but for all the wrong reasons.  This story cost me a few tears, and some careful consideration of what my actions would be in similar circumstances.  Great story.
4	1386374400	A world war I veteran faces a moral dilemma as light house keeper on a remote island of Australia.  Beautiful language, interesting, well-developed characters.  Fascinating symbolism.
5	1386374400	I haven't finished this book yet, and I can't wait to get back to it.  I'm going to recommend it to my book club.
1	1386288000	Part of my problem is I'm neither a romance reader nor a historical fiction reader.  So why did I read it?  I had to read this book for a professional conference.  It was painful to read.  If it wasn't a "MUST" read for the conference, I would have deleted the book after the first few chapters, and I'm not one who gives up easily on books.Most of the members of our professional group had the same feelings about it as I did: Males were the noble ones (the main character...the lighthouse keeper...the true father of the child, and the lighthouse keeper's father-in-law).  The women were all flawed (the mother-in-law, the wife, the true mother of the child).  They all required some kind of "saving" by men, either legally, emotionally, or physically. In this book, it's not good to be a woman.
5	1386288000	What an excellent story. It was an emotional roller coaster ride written in such an exquisite manner as to completely immerse me into the very setting of the story. Excellent, excellent, excellent.
4	1386288000	Beautifully written, thoughtful with unexpected twists and turns.  Takes you back in time to the difficulties facing those who returned from the Great War and those who live in isolated communities.  This well crafted novel will have you sympathizing with all parties first as victims then as villains.
4	1386288000	I enjoyed this book so much. It drew me into the dilemma and I questioned what I would do. It made for a wonderful conversation with friends who also read the book.
5	1386288000	This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It was very well written, a good story, with in depth characters.  I really enjoyed it.
4	1386201600	One of the best love stories I've read in a long time. Tom and Isabel truly come to life in this story.
5	1386201600	It's been a long time since I have read a story the  touched me the way this one did.  A story of love and loss.  Wonderfully written. I didn't even want it to end.
5	1386201600	be prepared for a modestly slow start then up all night to finish. wow. There is nothing so magical as a lyrically rendered story.
5	1386201600	I could not put it down! I wanted more of this very touching book, The Light Between Oceans By: M. L. Steadman!!!!!!!!
5	1386201600	Stedman crafts a gorgeous narrative of a lighthouse keeper and the stories of the choices we make and the paths our lives follow. Well recommended to anyone who appreciates the beauty of rich, finely crafted storytelling.
5	1386201600	Well written book - very well developed characters.  It was sad but poignant and I am glad I read it.
4	1386201600	Starts off a little slow but an overall good book.  Lots of situations that make you wonder, &#34;what would I do in that position.&#34;
5	1386201600	Great story that I got lost in - just the way I love to read! I couldn't put it down.
5	1386115200	A very good read, with a great deal of tension and emotion as the story unfolds. The moral and emotional dilemmas were very gripping.
5	1386115200	This is one of the best written books I have read. Each word was chosen precisely and not one word written was unimportant.The author's art made palpable the isolation and pain/joy of each of the characters as they traveled through this adventure......life.This is obviously the writing of not only a very gifted writer but of a very special person. I wish her well and highly recommend this book.
5	1386115200	This book did a great job developing characters that had dimension and made mistakes.  The love between Tom and Isabel was well written.  The choices they made were plausible with devastating consequences.  ML Stedman's writing style was a pleasure to read.
5	1386115200	I LOVED The Light Between Oceans.  The characters were well developed but not overly so.  I felt a connection to each character, especially the father-son relationship of the main character.  I truly enjoyed the story.  The book was quite a change from the type of books that I usually read (legal thrillers and mysteries) and it was such a good read.  The end of the book was so very touching that I had to stop on several occasions to put the book down and wipe the tears from my eyes so I could continue reading.  This was a very unique story and one that I do believe everyone will enjoy.
5	1386115200	I loved it. I'm a book snob and I LOVED it. it still  haunts me, but in a good way.
5	1386115200	With every page you switch sides in this beautifully written sad yet full of life book. So happy it was recommended to me
4	1386115200	A novel full of allegory, selfishness and selflessness. Although it takes place in Western Australia, the themes are universal, and it was a very satisfying read.
5	1386028800	Fabulous, inventive story and phenomenally written! Great sense of place and time. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
5	1386028800	Awesome book, I only can wish the author writes more like it. Keeps you interested the whole way through with a great story and ends perfectly.
5	1386028800	Both loved and hated this book.  Loved it because it is really well written and completely engrossing.  Could not put it down.  Hated it because it is just so tragic!  I cried... A LOT.  There was a point where I really thought I couldn't bear anymore heartache, and desperately needed to know how things worked out.  That being said, it's been six months since I read this book, and the story still sticks with me.  In my mind, that is a sign of a really great book!
4	1385942400	The author got in too deep to find any other ending.  That part was not satisfying.  I did keep reading straight through. Let's hear more from her....
5	1385942400	After I got used to the Aussie talk, the story grabbed and didn't let go.  I laughed, cried, disliked characters, loved others, but didn't want to stop reading.  It ended as it should have, there was no other possible ending that would have made sense.
4	1385856000	The book is well written...the author uses language beautifully. It is also a very emotional book about loss which made me react personally to the losses in my own life.
5	1385856000	I was asked to read this book as a reading for a newly joined book club. I was diagnosed with breast cancer during the reading and was advised not to read anything depressing or glum during treatment. I kept reading because the book taught me how to forgive and reminded me that life isn't about avoiding real trials and tribulations that simply happen. Thank you M.L. Steadman. Absolutely amazing read!
4	1385856000	Could identify with the moral dilemma of the characters but book seemed very slow and laborious in the first half as it set up the premise.  The second half of the book kept my interest and read right through.
4	1385856000	Long, detailed & filled with &#34;Brit&#34; phrases & words that are distracting.The story-line is excellent: How one decision can impact many lives.
4	1385769600	There was a sense of sadness, no of resignation throughout the book. One has to forgive to move on.  Even though it was a slow read and at moments I wished it had more... More of what I could not describe it now. I enjoyed reading about the lighthouse and the way living there made time suspended.  I cried at the end of the story feeling the power of the contradictions, it was wrong and right to keep her.
5	1385769600	Very well written by 1st time author, a difficult storyline, but the author's character development made it difficult to choose a villian here.  All the characters well developed.  The descriptive language made the reader feel they were almost there.  Didn't realize a lightkeepers job was so demanding!Great book, highly recommend, anxious to see what the author comes up with next.
4	1385769600	It was well written and seemed believable.  The ending was fitting for the story for a gripping tale. I loved it.
4	1385769600	Touching, moving, real life characters , the plot tends to be predictable but you may go wrong, so have a go and read it!
5	1385769600	Great characterization and conflict between forces where there is no easy answer. Blah, blah, blah, blah because Amazon says I need more words.
4	1385769600	I enjoyed reading this book. I thought the story line was Interesting and very well written. I would recommend it for a quick read.
5	1385769600	This book kept me engaged from the first page through the last.  A great story with memorable and engaging characters. The characters are all very real, and therefor each have redeeming qualities as well as flaws. I highly recommend this book.
4	1385769600	Book club reviewed this for a selection of the month.  It was rated B+ overall by the group collectively.  Sad and the telling of a story that&#8217;s burns in your heart and your memory.
4	1385769600	It was a great plot, and I enjoyed reading it. However I was disappointed in the ending,  I had the feeling that the author worked up to a great climax and then didn't know how to solve the dilemna, and rushed the ending.
5	1385683200	Happy, sad, suspenseful, tugged at your heart story. Gave an insight into a lighthouse keepers lonely life. Brought up morality questions and what would you do.
5	1385683200	Read this for our book club.  Couldn't put the book down.  Found myself talking to the characters with anger, disbelief
4	1385683200	Great story about how things change from black to white in a slow fade.  Slow in parts but it makes you wonder how you could do something you thought you never would.
1	1385596800	I enjoyed the bit of history it started with, but about 2 chapters in I got bored.  I kept reading and am now on part 3. Just not invested in the characters.
5	1385596800	It was just  a very interesting book. The characters were believable, I read the whole book in one weekend because it just had lots of turns and twists, was a very well written book.
5	1385596800	This book held my attention throughout....toward the end I couldn't put it down to see what happens!  I felt like I knew the characters intimately.
5	1385510400	A truly moving story.  I often do in  myself questioning what I would do during many moments in the book.
5	1385510400	This book is very well written, engaging, heart tugging story with believable characters who struggle with lossand compromise on a secret that grows until it can't be contained.
3	1385510400	Good beach book.... nothing too deep or thought provoking. It is pretty predictable with weak character development. All characters seemed to shift from their personalities to accommodate the plot.
5	1385510400	One of the most poignant books I've ever read.  Spellbinding, captivating, could not put it down.  Highly recommend to anyone who loves a well written story
5	1385510400	This is a story of love and forgiveness , so beautiful captured by the author. It's as if you are living these individuals lives. Perhaps the best book I've read In very long time . There is much to think about and to discuss and to meditate upon.  You will enjoy this for sure . Treat yourself to this novel of real life . Jan
5	1385510400	The story was complex and very well developed. The characters were interesting and the dilemma they faced was compelling and understandable.
4	1385424000	I thought this was a really good book. The characters were interesting, and the story lines were detailed. I really like to read historical fiction and have learned that I like period books, so I was happy to read this. I look forward to reading another book by this author.
5	1385424000	A young childless couple living on an island with a lighthouse find a baby in a small boat washed up by a storm.  The baby is alive and healthy.  They decide to keep the child and raise it as their own.  What love eventually does to the three of them is curious, serious and haunting.
5	1385424000	It kept me interested in what would happen. I would recommend it to anyone. Kept my interest until the end
4	1385424000	The book is well written and has great character studies. It has an very interesting story line. I would recommend it.
5	1385424000	Lyrically told story of love, loss, mistakes, happiness, pain, forgiveness, choices, and regret. This is one that will stay with you!
4	1385424000	I really enjoyed this book!  Great character development.  It kind of jerks your heart around from one character and scene to the other.  Amazing descriptive writing!
5	1385424000	Beautifully written -such a moving story. Brought tears. Made me appreciate all my family members so very much. Couldn't put it down.
4	1385337600	A Beautiful story with great character development.... Great, fast read. I loved every second of this book. Worth the 1.99 I paid!
4	1385337600	I liked reading this book and the development of the characters.  There were many layers to the characters and you had to peel them back one layer at a time.
4	1385337600	What an interesting book!  I really liked how the book was like a Venn Diagram.  The light was the lighthouse and one of the characters.  The oceans were Tom and Izzy or Frank and Hannah or the two sets of families, or....It just seems like there was a lot on interconnectedness.I really liked this book, despite the sadness of it.  Loved the writing!  Yes, it's slow in some spots, but that's not bad.I actually listened to the CD/audio version, and my biggest complaint is not the accent, which I found to be delightful, but the reader sounds like he had marbles in his mouth.  Ends of sentences would often be muffled.  I couldn't understand them, even with the volume in the car turned up to the max.  :-(  Dispite that, I still really like the book.
5	1385337600	I read this book for my book club, and loved it!  The book was well written, & the characters were compelling.  The main characters face an unusual dilemma that is only understandable considering their unique situation living isolated on a lighthouse post.  Our discussion next month should be interesting since our club members offer many varying points of view when discussing the motivation of the characters in our selections.
4	1385337600	I was a tad leery of this book after running into several similes within the first chapter. I do not think good writing calls for similes. And, if I read another book with a simile comparing such and such to &#34;a row of teeth&#34; I think I will scream. Please authors, this is so over-used.Now, after getting that off my chest, I enjoyed the book very much. When the author started to explain the workings of the lights, I thought I would probably end up skimming past it all, but in fact, it was quite interesting. I specifically recall reading of &#34;the character&#34; and how light flashes alert ships so they know they are in certain ports, such as Janue.  Ships are able to read the character as they have a list of the lights on each of their courses.The story is about Tom, who was active in WW11 and needs and seeks a solitary life. He needed order and was compulsive about his entries in the light house log, constantly polishing brass, straightening papers and files in his little office. I enjoyed how the author compared the discipline of being a soldier to the demands of maintaining a light house to insure ship's safety. Tom married Isabel and they lived a very cloistered life on the little island with the only company being the two men who brought supplies in every three months or so.  The crux of the novel centers around a baby that arrived on the shore, the wife's immediate love for the infant and the conflict of keeping this child and not notifying authorities. Tom seemed to be a man of conscience whereas Isabel operated on maternal love and what made her feel good with little regard for finding the biological mother of the infant. It is a gripping, heart rendering story and I spent several evenings reading until wee hours of the morning. It is a excellent novel and once the author ran out of similes, it was very well written. The characters were well defined and I found myself liking Isabel and then again not liking Isabel.  I identified more with Tom who knew from the get-go that keeping this infant and not attempting to find the real parents was flat out wrong. However, I loved him for his willingness to set his conscience aside and going along with Isabel's reasoning and plans because of his profound love for her. I would highly recommend this book to my family and friends.
2	1385251200	Hard as I try, I cannot get into this book!  Maybe it's my mood.  Maybe I'm just not crazy about period pieces.  The book is well written and, based on the majority of other reviews, people love it, but I found it boring.  Perhaps I'll try again another day...
3	1385251200	Although the story had great potential, it had too much was contrived and unbelievable.  The novel could have used a strict editor for grammar and continuity.
5	1385251200	&#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34; was the type of book that is hard to put down.  Our book club spent almost the full hour of our meeting discussing the moral and ethical dilemmas of the primary characters.  While not always in agreement about what was the right thing to do, or what was best for the child who was loved by the biological mother as well as the mother who found her and raised her for almost four years, we all agreed that this was a book we will remember for a long time.
5	1385251200	Excellent book. Storyline develops in a timely manner and moves along quickly. Tension and suspense build to a page turning climax and conclusion.
5	1385251200	A lovely, beautifully written and told story. Unbelievable that this is a first novel. She writes like a seasoned pro.
2	1385164800	A very light book, something that I would read at the beach. The ending was quite contrived. The characters were all too good to be believed.
5	1385164800	It holds you in suspense to the very end.  Will they do the right thing?  Will the right actions be disastrous?  Would it be better to continue a lie?  Can anything good come of the well-intentioned but wrong choices?  Lots of symbolism too which makes it delightful.
5	1385164800	This is a very well written book, but so sad.  I could not put it down once I had started it, but it was so moving and sad at the same time.  I was truly glad to finish this book, but, really, I remain impressed by the talent of the writer.
4	1385164800	I liked this book.  It kept my interest and was easy to follow.  It left me feeling sorry for those involved though, since there really wasn't a perfect solution to the situation.
5	1385164800	What a lovely but sad story. I would recommend to anyone looking for an enteral long read. More than just a lighthouse.
5	1385164800	Wonderful story with many insights into a mother and father's love for their child.....with it be biological or not.  A good read !!!
5	1385078400	I can't believe this is her first book. The writing is so wonderful you can picture ever part of the island. The character's feelings are so well described that you can see and feel all the different view points. This made a great book for book club because it bring ups many different discussion points. I couldn't put the book down.. And a great ending.
4	1385078400	It tells of a way of life that takes a special type of personality to choose.  It also makes one grapple with moral life choices.
5	1385078400	This is definitely the best book I have read in 2013.  I have recommended it for discussion in two of my book clubs.  It is a wonderful story -- sad, thoughtful and lovely.  I recommend it to everyone who loves a good story.  This is a debut book.  I hope the next one is as great as this one.
4	1385078400	Very good book.  I did feel that it was very up and down, it would grab me and then lose me and then just as quickly it would grip my attention again.  The characters were great, I always love novels where I'm not really sure how I feel about the characters.  Do I love this woman or hate her?  I felt that this book really played on my emotions and really made me think.  What would I do?  Would I have done the same?  It is well-written and the plot is excellent.  Very good book.
4	1385078400	Prose style fits the story; characters are well-rounded and well developed; setting is fascinating. But for my taste, there was more detail about the job of a lighthouse keeper than I needed. The pathos and caring of both, characters and author, were meaningful and definitely essential to the plot. Ending, however, felt a bit too predictable.
4	1385078400	Well written book.  Once I started reading this book I found it hard to put down.  The author does a good job of developing each character.
3	1384992000	This was a difficult read. I almost quit several times. Not sure what I will take away from this sad and depressing story.
4	1384992000	I really enjoyed the way the book started. I really could imagine these characters and this time and place. Then it was an uphill battle to keep reading until I was just over half way through the start where finally things started happening and my attention was captured through to the end.
5	1384992000	LOVED. THIS. BOOK. I've realized that I'm very picky when it comes to the novels I read. I require a very strong, interesting, bold, and original plot. I need to connect with the characters. I'm OCD with typos and incorrect grammar. I am annoyed with stories that use the same dull adjectives to describe its scenes and/or characters.With that said, M. L. Stedman is a genius. This storyline is unlike any that I've read before. It is so original. Truth be told, there were parts at the beginning of the book that were tediously and unnecessarily long, but I'm glad I stuck it out, because it was worth it. I will read everything that M. L. Stedman publishes.
4	1384992000	A wonderful book, full of emotion with twists and turns.  A simpler time, but full of characters that seem to come alive.
5	1384992000	I loved  this read. It had romance, mystery and a big tug on the heartstrings. I just tell and want everyone to read it.
4	1384905600	Easy read, uncomplicated characters and plot.  Made reader think about how one's actions and decisions impact loved one's and others.
5	1384905600	After reading the final chapter of Light Between Oceans (with tears streaming down my face), I lamented all of the wasted hours perusing books of lesser quality.  M.L. Stedman has presented a treasure for the ages with all of the integrity and truth of a great classic.  The lighthouse's relentless, revolving illuminating beam becomes a metaphor for the Divine Eye as  the countless complexities of this tale finally come together to illicit a satisfying and resounding WOW!
5	1384905600	Touching, heart-wrenching, and poignant.  I connected with the characters early on and couldn't put it down. It's not often you find a book that truly touches your soul...that tugs at your heart strings while keeping you enthralled with the storyline. I can't wait for Stedman's second novel!
5	1384905600	This novel has a compelling plot and memorable characters.  Couldn't stop thinking about it.  It is a truly unique book
5	1384905600	complicated multi-level story-thought provoking, characters very real and flawed yet likable, a look at how right and wrong are more complicated than they seem
5	1384905600	It reminded me how much has changed since that time. I like reading a bout  different areas in the world. I read with my  atlas nearby.
4	1384905600	I have never seen Australia till now. this writer gave me a beautiful picture of this place. the story held me, to the point where I looked forward to picking up this book each night.
4	1384905600	I enjoyed the plot.The Characters were well developed.The author presented a moral dilemma which showed the consequences of choice.You could place yourself in the position of Izzy and Hannah,ask yourself,what would I do and why?
4	1384819200	I usually shy away from much-hyped books, but decided to take a chance on this one because of the availability of a sample chapter download.  I'm glad I did.The publisher's description and plenty of other reviews provide a synopsis of the story, so I'll skip that redundancy.  I thought the book got off to a slow start, but the character of Tom intrigued me.  Sometimes you have to stay with a story for a few chapters to see what the author is doing with the setting and conflict.  Stedman writes beautifully.  Her characters are flawed, complicated, and realistic.  Her descriptions are just right, neither lacking in detail nor drowning in it.  I've no clue what an Australian small town was like in the early 20th century, but Stedman's writing is such that now I think I do.Call me a brute, but I couldn't drum up much compassion for Isabel after she emotionally blackmailed Tom into going along with her wishes.  That whole &#34;gift from God&#34; nonsense is something desperate people pull out of their pocket to try to justify what they want to happen.  In this case, that's fine.  I didn't have to like or agree with her to comprehend her (lack of) logic.  All my empathy was spent on Tom and Hannah.The ending felt a little rushed, as if something had been edited out and the gap not quite smoothed over, but it was still a satisfying ending.  Altogether, a good read.  I easily can see this as a movie.  (And if it becomes one, I hope they don't muck it up.)
5	1384819200	Okay ....um...I am speechless ( type-less ? )! Don't know if it is because my mind is still caught up with all the thoughts this book provokes , or if I simply know that anything I say here will be far below what this book is worthy of .It isn't enough that the characters are well developed , the stage is perfectly set and the writing style is superb . No , the story also deals with so many deep , thought provoking subjects and events from so many different perspectives that I found myself turning off the Kindle and sitting there trapped in my thoughts . My &#34; what would I do 's ?&#34; , my &#34; how could anyone do that's ?&#34; , my &#34; OMG- NO ! 's &#34; .I literally could not put this book down and when I absolutely had to , I could not mentally escape it . I had to see what happened , yet dreaded to see it end .I frequently find myself telling others &#34; I just need to find a great book ... I need another The Help &#34; or &#34; Man I wish I would luck onto another Water For Elephants &#34;. Not that both of those books won't forever live in my &#34;favorites &#34; shelf , but now I can hear myself saying , &#34; It sure would be great to read another The Light Between Oceans &#34; ;-)
5	1384819200	So well written. Such an engaging story. I've relished every minute of it. Didn't want it to end! I'll be missing the characters.
5	1384819200	Really interesting characters, all are flawed but also compelling. Great book club book - lots of conversation given that there is nothing black and white about this one.
4	1384732800	Story of young hope but one that does not always give us what we wish for. Beautiful detail of the setting, felt I was there. Really felt the pain both woman went through and could never decided which I favored. Really enjoyed the read.
4	1384732800	This was a very poignant book. I wasn't entirely sure what it would be about when I bought it for my book club, but I really enjoyed it. I feel like ML Stedman really captured the feelings and emotions of the characters. Well worth reading!
4	1384732800	Excellent! The tale begins slowly, but every action the author describes comes around later on as the action reaches a certain point. Then the story takes off. The emotions of each character are well developed and very believable. A heart wrenching tale, with a tug-at-your-heartstrings ending. Bravo!
4	1384732800	From the first page to the last sentence, I was captivated. Stedman&#8217;s beautifully written story and unforgettable characters have you on a emotional roller coaster from beginning to end. His description of the Lighthouse on Janus Rock were just wonderful it made we want to run away to a isolated Island. Tom and Isabel are a happy couple that make a very heartfelt decision which will haunt them till the end. Was it right or wrong, we always hope we make the best decisions, sometimes they could be selfish ones, or painful, but in the end we always hope there for the best. Compelling, powerful, definitely a must read.
5	1384646400	this book was recommended to me, I love the story, written beautifully. I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. Go ahead, read it, you too won't be disappointed.
4	1384646400	I liked the.human interaction and the insights into people living in a small town.  The experiences of living in near isolation and living at a lighthouse were also fascinating.  Being a male, I sometimes felt female characteristics were overdone, but once I got through that, I appreciated the insights into female emotions.
4	1384646400	Something that's right for one person may be very wrong for another. This book examines a heart wrenching moral question. A great book for book club discussion.
5	1384646400	A fascinating story about a couple who love each other and care for a light house, thus being isolated from other people. After several sad hardships on the tiny island, the couple do an unthinkable thing to create their family, only to discover that keeping their secret causes great strain on their marriage and causing a great ethical dilemma.  Recommend this book for book clubs and possibly for an Ethics class.
5	1384646400	This novel was hard to put down.  It was a great read. A different story line that brought out many human emotions.
4	1384560000	Lighthouses have always intrigued me and this book gave me a great understanding of their importance and the courageous keepers who kept them steadfast. ML Steadman took me right to the island and into the life of all the characters. This one will stay with me
4	1384560000	I thought it was a bit predictable but I found myself swept away into the story. Loved the setting of Australia and the island.
5	1384560000	You will fall in love with Tom and Isabel, just as they fell in love with Lucy. The descriptions of Janis Island and the lighthouse will take your breath away.
5	1384473600	Great story.  Kept me involved, and I had trouble putting it down.  The ending deserves some thought to determine one's opinion of the end of the story.
4	1384473600	The characters in this story all hold a special place in the end.  My heart broke so many times during this story, and it made you think about our place in this world.
5	1384473600	I enjoyed this book and the way people involved made choices that eventually came home to roost. I kept thinking what would be best for the child and whether a Solomon type solution would be the way to solve the dilemma of two mothers and one child.  Good read. Look forward to Stedman's next book.
4	1384387200	In this heartwrenching novel about love and family, one is asked the question, &#34;What would you do for love?&#34;. Well written and suspenseful.
5	1384387200	Well written, good story, well developed characters.  No need to add more words to describe book to satisfy minimum review.  Good read.
5	1384387200	&#34;Exquisite and unforgettable&#34; ...I can not use a better description than that offered by the publisher.  Stedman develops a heartbreaking story about choices and their consequences.  Tom and Isabel are well-developed characters than draw the reader quickly into the drama and make the story unforgettable.  Couldn't set it aside once I started reading.
3	1384387200	It was a little predictable.  The charactars were all likeable felt like I knew how it was going to end from the first chapter.
5	1384387200	This was such a sweet story.  I loved how the author gave the little family their own special place that would be remembered for years to come.
4	1384387200	A touching story of an unusual event.What happens when a child is found, raised and loved for 5 yrsand then forced to return to her biological mother.You'll sympathize with all of the characters.
5	1384387200	What a sad yet beautiful love story.  I cried several times for each character and what they were experiencing. I would definitely recommend this book
5	1384387200	Heartbreaking.  What would we do in that situation??  I don't think I could agree with their choice, although very tempting.
4	1384300800	I found this to be very engrossing, and well written.  I cared about the characters, however just when it began to be the most interesting, the story stopped, then picked up again, years later and I felt very cheated, especially since I had endured a lot of tedium in the beginning of the characters lives together. Ultimately I would say I enjoyed the journey, but I wish the destination had been better.
4	1384300800	This was a good read. It had an unusual story line.  Characters were developed and it was some what of a page turner.
5	1384300800	A true to life novel fully enlightening the mysterious shrod of the lighthouse.  The story most captivating!  I could not put it down!
4	1384214400	An engaging story of heartbreak which portrays a good and decent man wrestling with his conscience, torn between the woman he loves (and the life he loves) and a lie that could destroy everything.  Well-written with vivid imagery and raw emotion, it keeps the reader on edge until the end.  I also liked the setting (Australia) with the depiction of life (with all its gossip) in a small town and in a lonely isolated lighthouse. I thought it seemed realistic in most respects and was glad that the author ended the story in a satisfying way.
5	1384214400	An incredible feat of storytelling at its finest. I was overwhelmed by the author's ability to elicit such raw emotions. Each character was so intricately drawn.  A brilliant first novel - an absolute tour de force.  I cannot say enough about this book - just read it!!!
4	1384214400	This book is well-written. You find yourself mapping out the lighthouse island in your head. You know the routine like you are living it. The moral dilemma that arises has you questioning your own sense of right and wrong. The author writes the heartbreak so convincingly. Excellent read!
2	1384214400	The book plays capriciously with the most intense and basic of human emotions. I gave up on the book 100 times. The characters are implausible making atrocious choices. When I finally finished I no longer had any investment or care for the characters, I was weary of being manipulated. I would not recommend this book.
5	1384214400	Really interesting story...well written and grabs you right from the start.  I read a lot of novels, this one was one of our book club favorites.
5	1384128000	Fantastic and tragic at the same time. Great Story, very well written, engaging and heartwrenching.Couldn't put it down! Felt like I was there
5	1384041600	The light between the oceans, which in fact,  is Lucy Grace, is a treasure chest of metaphoric jewels.  Page after page the author inserts a metaphoric description of nature on the heals of a scene in the story. What beautiful writing. Characters are real life people with intense feelings.  The ending is not  artificial.  So many gems of wisdom in this book.  I would hardily recommend it to readers who want a good story and a thoughtful read.
4	1384041600	A good book club book because it poses a moral dilemma.  I really liked how it ended.  It's the author's first book, I'll be interested in what comes next.
5	1383955200	This story is as beautiful and profound as the oceans it's set on. Love, in its deepest forms, and the complexity of living with and for that love.
5	1383955200	It brought me right back to a different time in Australia. I couldn't put the book down.  It was a great story.
4	1383955200	I enjoyed the character development as it was affected by the setting.  I would read another by this author, anytime
4	1383955200	The story was very good and kept me wanting to read more. Well written. The middle was a surprise and the ending was tearful but perfect. I gave it 4 stars as I felt it dragged for awhile in the middle. I would recommend to anyone, just a good heartwarming intriguing book.
5	1383955200	Compelling plot, beautifully written with great artistry.  It paints a graphic picture of the south Australian coast and the culture of the land.  The characters are real and memorable and the  choices they are forced to make are both believable and heart-wrenching.  I highly recommend.  Not many novels bring me to tears anymore, but this one certainly did.
2	1383868800	Wow, I didn't see what everyone likes about this book. It's a very simplistic story with only one main thread, and a pretty predictable ending.
5	1383868800	Can't wait to see how Derek Cianfrance re tells this wonderfully rich and heartbreaking story.Can't wait.Great book too.
4	1383782400	For anyone who has had a child or lost one the story was heat wrenching.  So well written to where you could feel the pain of all.  I tried to put myself in each character's place as I cried through the chapters. Heartbreaking especially  for Lucy!!  Even though it was so well written, I didn't want my adult children with kids of their own to read it. Just to sad of a story.
4	1383782400	Was a good novel. There were areas of this book that I did struggle to get through, and other portions of the story had me completely drawn in. Overall I think this book caused a love/hate situation for me.
5	1383782400	The Light Between Oceans was an incredible moving novel about what happens when good people make bad decisions. The story takes place in the town of Point Partageuse, Australia during the 1920s. The story begins when a light house keeper (Tom) and his wife (Isabel) find a life boat with a dead man and live baby in it on the beach and have to make tough decisions regarding the baby's future. I don't want to spoil anything but I will say it was an incredibly good read.
2	1383696000	I was bored stiff. Had to stop reading. Maybe another page and I would have been hooked? Guess we will never know.
5	1383696000	This was the type of novel that I simply could not put down.  A story of deep love, devotion, and heartbreak, as well.
4	1383696000	Very interesting. Intriguing characters and the relationships between each is filled with past and present emotions that keep their connections alive and rich. The author continues to introduce background on characters throughout the book adding dimension and depth to the characters and the book. This book really tore at my heartstrings. ..caught between doing the right thing and loving a precious &#34;gift.&#34; A very fulfilling read.
4	1383696000	Took a while to get into it but once I did it was really good!  Great for book club discussion.
3	1383696000	Written well and easy to follow. A lot of different emotions battling while reading this story. A great discussion book!
5	1383696000	Well written when a book can make your whole group cry because you understood the situations of the people involved you have a good read.
5	1383696000	Unusual theme with well-developed characters who are engaging and complex. Very well written with beautiful use of language and metaphore.
2	1383609600	It was just okay.  I was disappointed; I had read the synopsis and thought that it sounded great.  So, was quite disappointed.
3	1383609600	Bought this book as it was one of the top sellers at the time. A fast read but very soap operish.  Summer reading.
5	1383523200	A story that reads like its real . Loved it all. Sorry it finished so soon, I could have kept reading more..
5	1383523200	Beautifully written and an amazing plot line. It had me hooked from the beginning.  I would definitely recommend this story.
4	1383523200	thought provoking and well presented.  You'll weep for these characters.It's a beautiful story and a tragic story. You'll remember these characters long after the book is finished.
5	1383436800	Grabbed me at the first chapter and held me until the end. Leaves the reader questioning how they would react if presented with the same scenerio.
4	1383436800	This book is a story about how one wrong decision can alter your life forever.  It's easy to read and is engaging from the start.  Great first novel!
4	1383436800	Love the wonderful descriptive flow of the narrative.  The scenes painted by the words are totally &#34;seen in you minds eye&#34;.
4	1383436800	Beautifully written, the author challenges us to switch places with its main characters. How would we have behaved, given the circumstances? How would we have convinced ourselves we were justified in our decisions?  How could we live with ourselves after making them?  Each of us may come up with a different answer. Read this book and look into your soul.
4	1383350400	The book is a good one, heart wrenching and happy at once. You will fall for the characters easily. My only reason not to give it five stars was that it was a bit slow at times. Yet still a great book.
5	1383350400	I love this book and must get the real copy instead of the digital one. It is worthy of sitting at my bedside forever.
4	1383350400	I enjoyed his book, many twists and a great plot. A great story that keeps you wondering what will happen next.
5	1383350400	Beautifully written and very touching.  Quite embarrassing when I read this book anywhere but my home as I couldn't hold back the tears.
4	1383264000	Good, moving, thought provoking story. You 're not quite ready for it to end.  A confirmation that life is an endless twist of fate.
5	1383264000	I just finished reading this book and I loved it. It made smile and cry. Stedman does a great job telling this story. A must read.
5	1383264000	Wonderful book.  I FOUND IT difficult to put down and lived the lives of the characters.  I highly recommend this book.
3	1383264000	Being Australian I loved all the Aussie slang & turns of phrase, however it was mostly a sappy soap opera. things were either super perfect or super awful but not very realistic. Never did find out enough about the guy's past history.
4	1383264000	A book that certainly pulls out all of the emotions of the husband and wife.  Although I fretted about where it was going to go, the author did the right thing in the end!  Enjoyed by all in our book club.
4	1383264000	This was an engaging story with lots of interesting twists and plenty of moral conflict...kept you wondering if you would make the same choices if you were in that situation. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live in a lighthouse? I've spent enough time in coastal New England to have wondered that myself. This gave me a small window into what that might be like.Definitely recommending in to my friends.
5	1383177600	Terrific novel.  Characters are very well developed.  Good sense of suspense.  Wonderful moral dilemma.  With twists and turns the characters make the right choices along the way.  They suffer consequences-- but good prevails in the end.  One of the best novels our book club has read.
5	1383177600	The inner drive to be a mother has never before revealed itself to me as this work did.  The characters were believable, and their situations heartfelt.  This is definitely a good read.
5	1383177600	page turner, thought provoking, great unique story. It is amazing this is a first novel for the author. I understand a movie is being made and I'll look forward to seeing it (though hard to imagine it doing justice to the book)
4	1383177600	I enjoyed this book. It made you feel for all of the characters that you encounter through the story. It has been a must read through our family.
5	1383177600	It is seldom that a novel is offered to us which is so beautifully written.  Although the basic premise is not a happy one, I was able to overlook the sadness of the mid-section of the book and go on to appreciate the latter portion of the book and it's not so predictable ending.  I really loved this one and look forward to another Stedman offering.
5	1383177600	Wonderful. The ethical dilemmas were challenging. The characters so vivid. Amazing first novel. Hope to read more of her works.
5	1383177600	This made my heart break even though it ends as well as can be expected. I cried so hard...it is true to life...it is a cruel world.
3	1383091200	Wonderful writing, great moody settings, but SO contrived. I wanted to slap some sense into Isabel from the beginning. What a ninny.
3	1383091200	This review, as well as many more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca).My Review:  This is one of those books that I've been hearing so many good things about but haven't gotten the chance to pick it up until just recently.  Ever since the book came out I've heard all kinds of kudos from some friends as well as the very glowing reviews on popular book sites.  Unfortunately, for me, usually a highly acclaimed book tends to mean the kiss of death for a good review from yours truly.  Sadly, this book falls into the category.It wasn't a bad book but I can't honestly say that I have really strong feelings about this book or its characters either.  It's going to fall somewhere in the accumulation of vague memories in my bookworm brain where I'll remember little bits of the story but overall the book will soon be lost to me.My opinion is not in the vast majority though (nor am I alone either).  Many people were utterly captivated by the book and, from the book description, I was intrigued.  It's a very interesting premise.  What would you do, after the devastation of a few miscarriages, if you find an infant and no one will be the wiser if you took the child as your own?It's that premise is what grabbed my attention.  This is a case where you know someone did something wrong and yet you can totally understand, due to their circumstances, why they did what they did.  And you can't 100% fault them for it.  But when the other person involved in the situation is brought into the picture those feelings are shaken as you now see the two sides of the story and the poor, innocent child stuck in the middle.  I found myself empathizing with Isabel as well as with Hannah but my heart really went out to little Lucy who was in the middle of it all.This book did make me think and gave me a good moral dilemma to ponder but I don't think the energy and interest of the premise was used to its full potential.  It lacked a strong pace and it had a hard time keeping my interest.  I think that something that could have helped the pace and interest in the book is if subplots were used to spice things up.  We're really on a single track with this book.  With no other smaller storylines to bring other characters into the fray more it seemed a little bleak and dull.There were in-depth descriptions of the island which gave the island a very desolate and lonely feel to it.  I did find that Stedman went a little heavy with the descriptions of the lighthouse and all that working on one entails.  The dialogue seemed a little heavy and clunky at times too but I'll chalk that up to this being Stedman's first novel.That's not to say that this book is devoid of emotion.  Stedman tugs at people's heart strings and gets them to question a moral dilemma but I felt that the characters, those people who the reader is supposed to get behind, were too thinly created.  I just never felt connected to any of them.  Sure, it was emotional to read about miscarriages and lost babies but I the only time I got close to feeling emotional was when I was reading about Isabel's grief and seeing how she could view this new baby as very serendipitous and 'meant to be' as well as seeing how Lucy deals with the aftermath.This is not a 'bad book' but I did struggle to finish it or to even feel immersed in the storyline and found it to be fairly predictable so even when all the secrets are revealed it wasn't a big shocker.  What this book does have going for it is the descriptions of Australia's history and culture.  It also showcases the power of a mother's love as well as the utter heartbreak when that love is questioned.My Rating: 3/5 stars
4	1383091200	this was a book club pick and i read it cover to cover. the story was interesting, taking place in Australia, and very riveting.
2	1383091200	Truly, the novel read like a Hallmark Made-For-TV movie. Overly sappy and overtly dramatic. If nothing else, I would have liked simpler, clearer explanations of how the lighthouses actually worked.
5	1383091200	A well written first novel . A story of love and hope despite guilt and heart break .I would reccomend this to  anyone who likes a good read. I plan to do this for my next book club .
5	1383091200	Wonderful description of post traumatic stress disorder in 1920s for soldiers in first world war, then called shell shock.  Vivid descriptions of Western Australia and ocean and mechanics of lighthouse.  Great example of tragic outcome from not telling and acting on the truth.  Interesting vocabulary of local region.
5	1383091200	The book was a marvelous read.  The characters were realistic - the story was compelling.It is the type of book that you ccannot guess what the ending will be.
4	1383004800	Kept me interested the entire book. Easy to read, set down and come back to. Although you think it is predictable, keep reading.
5	1383004800	A great read! Character development is done so well it becomes impossible to not love Tom and dizzy. The more you read the more difficult it becomes to put the book down.
5	1383004800	Emotional story about choosing right from wrong even through the power of love. I loved the moral values that are portrayed and how easy it is for those to be tested. Very good read.
3	1383004800	The story was good and the characters were well developed. There were some flaws, but overall, enjoyable. It gives a clear description of what it's like to live on an island where there is little or no interaction with mankind.
4	1382918400	This story was so well written that the descriptive language she uses was an incentive to keep reading.  I guessed at the end result because he was a military man and followed the rules.  Highly recommended.
4	1382918400	This book is great for a book club discussion. The emotional struggle exists over love for a child and doing the right thing.  The author was able to make the reader understand how each character felt and why they did the things they did.
3	1382918400	Like the story and imagery and poignancy. Thought it was a bit tedious but happy I read until the end.
4	1382918400	I enjoyed the story.  Could picture the people and scenery.  Also made you feel like you could see the lighthouse and hear the ocean.  That is important to me when reading a book.
5	1382918400	This novel was chosed byour YC for the book of the month - and from page one I was hooked.  Loved the story, the twists and the ending.  It's a great read if you want to become involved with characters.
2	1382918400	I did not read the entire book once I figured out where it was going.  I was just too contrived and the author seemed to have drawn an outline and then fit her characters into it.This was a book club reading and many members really enjoyed the book.Her descriptive ability is quite good.
5	1382832000	The writer easily got you entwined in the main characters' lives...and I worried about what they were about to do. Once the deed was done, I was involved until the very end to see how their lives would turn out. A very good story!
5	1382832000	This book was a book club pick.  I was not looking forward to reading it because all the reviews said ..tragic...but it was our pick so I dove in and I am so glad!  Yes, the story is tragic for lack of a better word.  But the characters are so well done.  You can understand why each feels the way they do about what is happening.  My opinion kept changing based on reading each characters side.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is a really good read.
5	1382832000	I chose a 5 rating because I feel it's a very good book.  Loved the story line. It was well written and a good read. It was enjoyable.
4	1382832000	I really liked this book and was torn as to what the individuals would handle their problem.  I knew how it had to end but it was very sad.
5	1382832000	Excellent! A beautifully written, tragic story about love for a child and loss that runs deep into lives affecting others.
5	1382832000	While it can be a little slow at times, I enjoyed this story and the writing was descriptive and beautiful.
4	1382745600	Our book club liked this book and the discussion it generated. Great characters and wonderful writing. Gave a real sense of place
5	1382745600	Super story kept my interest. I liked the story line. The characters were excellent. I would like to see this as a movie.
4	1382745600	I liked the book up until the police arrived on the island. I understood why he couldn't live with the secret but hated that he destroyed his wife's life. On the other hand, I felt sorry for the mother who lost her child. Hard one to choose. No easy decision. I guess in the long run he did what he could live with, no win win choices. In the end the girl turns out alright but who is to say which life was the best for her.
4	1382745600	Ms. Stedman is a good story teller as she wove many stories into one novel.  I enjoyed the discriptions of the Australian countryside.On the downside:  Every family in the story had great losses.  It was a TEAR JERKER!  It leaves you feeling sad all over.  I mourned for each character and  what they went through.
4	1382745600	A good read about a terrible moral dilemma.  No clear line between right and wrong, making it difficult to read but hard to put down.
4	1382745600	Loved the writer and the story. It was a hard story to read and think what would you do in this situation.  But in the end...the truth sets them free.
4	1382745600	Heartfelt and well written. The characters pull you into their world. You can't help not feeling sad.A really good book !
5	1382745600	This book was terrific.  The anguish of a mothers love and loss pitted against the moral of right and wrong made this book unforgettable.
4	1382745600	Hard to get into , but very interesting story .  Deep .. Well written.  Interesting characters who tell interesting story of very deep love.
3	1382745600	I thought it was an okay story.  The writing was mature, though after a while I found myself skimming pages to get through what seemed like repetitive filler.  Or rather, that this new author simply needs to hone their skill in creating a story with more depth.  I found some of the history and information around lighthouse keeping to be interesting, but the majority of pages were centered on emotional turmoil that was overkill in my opinion.An okay read but not worth the price I feel.  I read about a book per week, and have for quite some time, so my expectations may just be increasing.  I prefer a very full story, and this was lacking for me.
5	1382745600	This was a tour de force. M.L. Stedman's debut novel is rich with plot twists, well developed characters, and sympathy for the terrible losses and achingly difficult decisions with which humanity seems endlessly to struggle. Despite much sadness, The Light Between Oceans inspired me (and others in our book club) in a profound way.
5	1382745600	Enjoyed this book immensely.  I did the audio read and loved the voice.  This author did a great job with character development.  Was a very easy read. I would recommend.
5	1382659200	This story was a great read and hard to put down once I started.  The characters are well developed and it was easy to feel the sometimes raw emotions that the characters were feeling and experiencing.  The setting was also described well and I could easily picture it in my head as I read.  As the plot developed, I kept anticipating each new development and the story line seemed to always keep me guessing and wondering what would happen next.  And the ending really got me!
5	1382659200	This was a fascinating story. I couldn't put it down. The reader learns a lot about the lighthouse service. The keepers are dedicated to their work at the sacrifice  of their own lives. But the story here is the real attraction. It is well written and thought out.
4	1382659200	This novel held so .such in depth of characters.  From Tom and Isabel to Lucy who connected two families.  Can you tell I loved the novel.
4	1382659200	This books transfers you into the thoughts, minds and hearts of its characters.  I recommend it.  You will laugh ad cry.
3	1382659200	I liked the story and found the moral delimma facing the characters very moving.  In such a remote location, what would I have done?
3	1382659200	The first third of the book is extremely interesting.  The rest of the book is disappointing.  Everthing falls apart despite best intentions.  While the enitre plot is unrealistic (but it is fiction after all), I thought the ending of the book was sad and disheartening.  The simple moral &#34;be truthful&#34; is important, it is driven home in an tortuous way.
4	1382572800	A Beautifully written tale that takes place in a time and place that I knew little about.  I Enjoyed it immensely.
5	1382572800	Best book I have read in a long time...our book group read it as well and loved it! Try it you'll like it!
5	1382572800	Wonderful, unique story that is well written. So glad I happened upon this gem. Cannot recommend it enough.Looking forward to more from this author.
5	1382572800	Found it very good, had everything.......how one can get themselves in a real mess when thinking they were doing the right thing.
5	1382572800	Beautifully written and constructed.  Held my interest till the very end.It was an unusual story with many twists and turns.
5	1382572800	Loved it! Very well written and a great story. Sad, made me cry and it has been a long time since I have cried with a book. A must read.
5	1382572800	The book was a page turner and great discussion for our book club. Out of 13 women we all enjoyed it.
5	1382572800	This book was a page turner until the end.  Beautifully written and kepts my interest throughout.  Some parts were difficult to not question.  For the most part it was an excellent book.
4	1382572800	I found this novel very well written--very moving and very sad at different times  I truly enjoyed the book and the characterswere very complex and very interesting.  It made you want to continue turning the page to see what happened next.  A goodread.
5	1382486400	This was a beautiful story.  We are often faced with moral dilemmas.  Tom wanted to do the right thing, but he also wanted to please his wife, Isabel.
4	1382400000	I enjoyed reading this book very much.  It was a fairly easy read with a different and interesting story line.
4	1382400000	A difficult book to read if you can relate to being separated from a parent when very young.  Author explores parent-child and husband-wife relationships thoroughly.  Characters are deeply wounded and deeply flawed.  Shines light on the aftermath of such life-altering, tragic experiences as war, miscarriage and stillbirth.  Characters are at war with themselves over selfish desires and the urge to do right.  Truth and forgiveness triumph in the end.
5	1382400000	The book took me on a fantastic journey, giving me insight to the life of the lighthouse keeper and his family in a remote area of Australia.  Holding my interest from the very first page, I was sorry to turn the last, wishing the story would go on.  Excellent book club read; the moral implications of decisions made by the main characters lead to lively discussion.  The book is a wonderful experience - I highly recommend.
4	1382400000	I loved it. However, the plot reminds me of one I am reading now, Daughters. Stolen baby because wife cannot bear a child.
4	1382400000	I liked the book because it held my interest and I wanted to keep reading late into the night. Hardened war hero meets a girl who softens him and he is willing to protect with his life. Can't beat that.
5	1382400000	Loved the plot and characters.  Beautifully written, this novel presents all sides of a very difficult and heart-breaking choice.  The novel looks at love from many angles: is love selfish? Sacrifice? Telling the truth? Withholding the truth? Living a lie?  Hard questions which make the reader think and make choices just like the characters do.
5	1382400000	Everyone in my club loved the book and we had so many talking points to discuss.  In fact, the discussion continued after the book club meeting over email.
5	1382400000	This is a great book. It will keep you thinking for days after you've finished it. Just like in real life, there is no right or wrong answer. And this book captures that very well!
5	1382400000	The story was wonderful & not predictable. Beautifully written compliments to Stedman on her first novel.I have already have highly recommended the book. Thanx u for the experience.
5	1382400000	This book was amazing! I could not put it down I read it from beginning to end excited to see what the next page brought -  you really feel for all the characters in this book
5	1382313600	This is a great story.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.  Although it takes place in a different time and place, it is a hard book to put down.  I read it all in under 3 days.
5	1382313600	I loved this book which takes place in Western Australia after WW 1.  Characters are interesting and the story has different turns.  A few moral questions come up and you wonder what you would do.  I think this is a debut novel and I look forward to more from author.
5	1382313600	It took a little while to get into this story, but when I did... I couldn't stop!  I was cheering for both sides of this story as it unfolds. I can understand wanting to keep the abandoned baby - but oh, the anguish for the mama left behind. A great book!
5	1382313600	The story is a sad one, and about heartache and despair.  It is also about how great a love can be for a child and between a husband and wife.
5	1382313600	I thought it was well written, it was moving, mostly realistic and fast reading.  I would recommend this although a bit of a tear jerker.
5	1382313600	I read the ad for this book and knew I would want to read it.  I recommended it for my book club so we are all reading it.  What a great first book...such power, such love in so many aspects.
5	1382227200	This author developed such empathetic characters that I felt I had always known them  I was delighted when they were contented, I agonized when they experienced loss and ,at times, I felt guilt by association.  Laying this book down was difficult; I did not want it to end; yet, although it does not have a fairy-tale ending, it does have a satisfying conclusion.  I would love to have a chat with the author about events and inspirations that shaped the plot.Thank you, ML Stedman
3	1382227200	At first glance it would appear that I was the onliy person not to have read this or heard of it based on the positive reviews, so I jumped into reading it head first.  It starts out intriguing based on the unique nature of the story itself, however this book peaks out about halfway through and never really seems to abort that plateau.  It's not a bad book, and I believe it's fairly well written, however it sure seems like you're forced to hang in there for a couple hundred pages to really not have anything overly significant materialize.
5	1382227200	The Light Between Oceans was a wonderful story about a couple's love and the power of a child in their lives.  Definitely bittersweet as most good books are. There's not much else to say that hasn't already been said well by other readers, although I will add the author has some marvelous thought-provoking passages and the characters were well written and believable.My only complaint is the shifting of tenses within the story and I couldn't seem to figure out the purpose for it. I'm definitely not a grammar wiz but I still found it distracting. Maybe it's just a different writing style as I'm from the U.S. and I believe the author is from Australia.Overall, I would recommend the novel and I look forward to seeing what else M.L. Stedman has to offer.
2	1382227200	Good summer beach book.  Disappointed in the writing style. Would not be on my suggested reading list for others. Thanks
4	1382227200	Great book for a book club, gripping emotional story and novel plot.  A bit slow at times, wasn't necessarily a page turner all the way through but I enjoyed the book overall.
5	1382227200	I loved not only the prose of the story, but the depth of the symbolism in the setting and the polemic of this novel. Very well written indeed!
5	1382227200	This book was an outstanding work of art. The author's words created characters that literally bounced off the pages. Her vivid use if words to describe the beauty of the environment were compelling. Even though this book displayed a very sad tale of a childless couple discovering an infant child and the choices that were made, it has a lesson to be learned within. This was an outstanding novel and I couldn't put it down!
5	1382227200	Wonderful story! Hard to put it down once I started reading. Definitely tugs at the heart strings. A great read!
5	1382140800	This story will catch your heart strings and pull them in many directions.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and look forward to more from the author.  Cozy up on a cool day and treat yourself by reading this novel.
5	1382140800	What a Wonderful story . Very hard to stop reading. I think of my own granddaughter and how all who love her. How wonderful and sad at the sane time.
5	1382054400	Sweet book. Good story. I want to visit a lighthouse in Australia now. A good journey for anyone. Highly recommend.
4	1382054400	I have no complaints about her writing; she's wonderful as a matter of fact. The beginning is spellbinding good, but the story is sad and ends on a down note, and it made me feel depressed through the whole read, which is not my preferred method of entertainment. I gave it 4stars because this girl can write really well. And many will enjoy the path her characters take. I understood the dilemma and consequences, but would have liked a different ending.
5	1382054400	This was an good book to read on a flight to Australia, f you are familiar w/Australia it is even better.  It flows well & it easy to read.The author uses some Aussie idioms to make it more realistic.  Knowing there meaning helps, I assume.  That was my thought, because having lived for awhile I was familiar w/them.
5	1382054400	I was touched by the words and passion of this story.  Don't miss the opportunity to experience this treasure.  Can't wait for another story from Mrs. Stedman.
2	1382054400	This novel was really hard to love. It was hard to get in to and it was hard to care about the characters. While Stedman pulls at all of the right heart strings to have a large fan following, ultimately the story doesn't stand up on it's own.The magnitude and multitude of the &#34;tragic&#34; events in the story almost negate any sort of empathy the reader may have. I stopped believing in the story after the 15th tragedy. And the worst part was, most of the unfortunate circumstances were brought on by the character's own bad decisions. By the end of the novel, I was completely disgusted with both protagonists. It's hard to desire a happy ending for people you don't like at all. And don't even get me started on the ending. It was like the one last punch on the author's part to move the reader to tears. Enough with the maudlin rhetoric already.The not so subtle foreshadowing was also a huge drawback in my opinion. From the minute Isabel finds the baby Tom has a &#34;bad feeling.&#34; We are warned over and over again that this won't turn out well. First of all, that's not a surprise, and second of all, let the reader be smart enough to watch it unfold without all of the unnecessary pre-commentary.This book came to me highly recommended and I must say I was thoroughly disappointed. The writing was not excellent (tense shifting all over the place) and the story was just not plausible. A decent emotional mindless read but certainly not a quality piece of work.
4	1382054400	This book was a compelling read which elicited much discussion at our book club.  The questions are moral and ethical ones, with emotions affecting a person's actions.
4	1382054400	aside from being a bit of a thriller that keeps your attention, the book has interesting characters and draws an interesting portrait of this part of the world post WWI.  Slightly meandering toward the end, it's worth the read.
4	1382054400	After extreme hesitation on my part to pick up this book, I was thoroughly surprised.  The writing was so descriptive that I could actually imagine myself examining the lighthouse and the surrounding terrain.  It was interesting to hear the differing view points in my reading group as to the ill-fated decision the main characters made and how it changed the remainder of their lives.  Great choice for book club members who enjoy detailed discussions.
5	1382054400	Characters very vivid. The details of operating mechanics of a lighthouse seemed so accurate. Surprise ending. Excellent for her 1st Book.  Loved it and have recommended to many of my friends.
5	1382054400	The novel did a good job of examining the complex nature of human decision making.  The characters, though not always likeable, were well drawn and believable.
5	1382054400	Love, emotions and the decisions we make in life.  A wonderful depiction of how love and grief make us make decisions that we must deal with our whole lives.
5	1382054400	I absolutely could not put this book down. I read it in 2 days! The words and story are so beautifully crafted to the point where you get lost in them. I look forward to reading more from this author.
5	1382054400	This book is very well written and entertaining.  The storyline will pull at your heart strings and challenge your moral compass.  You will want to finish it today!
4	1381968000	...not because of the prose, which was lovely. The story was heart wrenching. I don't know what drives us to want to have and raise children, but it must be very strong.
5	1381968000	This book was one of my favorite books. I am recommending it to all my friends. A tender moving novel, well written. Loved it!
5	1381968000	Our reading group read the book and loved every word. We highly recommend this touching tale of love and honor.
5	1381968000	I enjoyed this book because of its historical setting and the moral dilemmas the characters faced.  It gives the reader pause as to what is right and wrong.  I would highly recommend .
4	1381968000	The book was enjoyable to read. It touched on the devastation of men's souls by WW1 and the difficulty dealing with the first great war.Then the moral dilemmas start, concerning who has the right to raise a child, to love a child, the right thing to do even though it will hurt someone. It gets somewhat frustrating to the reader. I felt like telling the author to give these people a break , but in the end life is not fair.
5	1381968000	I won't reveal the twist and turns but this book will keep you interested. Sensitive topics of a childless couple, simple lifestyle, depression and how decisions can change irrevocably, not just your life but that of others.
1	1381968000	I recommend this book highly. Lovely tale and wonderful characters...sentimental and brutally honest.  Love is a most powerful force, and none more so than a mother's love
5	1381968000	I enjoyed it. I would recommend it. It was a good read. Reviews have to be a certain length before you can submit them. This is long enough. ;)
5	1381968000	A huge dilemma treated with terrific understanding by the author of both the characters involved and the mores of the times. A wonderful read in an unusual setting that highlights the importance of &#34;others&#34; in a lonely setting. Unforgettable!
5	1381968000	This book started out slow but certainly hooked me. The ending was not at all what I expected. Tom & Isabel had a rough time on Janus, even though they loved each other deeply. When baby Lucy arrived it was like God was giving them another chance. Even if the choices they made ending up hurting others, they did what they did for each other.
4	1381968000	An interesting plot, likeable  characters, several moral dilemmas.  Kept me engaged.I have to submit 9 more words to have my review accepted and I have now done so.
5	1381968000	I do not hand out five-star reviews easily, but this is a book that fulfilled all expectations. The plot was tight and compelling, the characters were believable and very "human," and the motives and actions (moral decisions) of the characters had me thinking long after I finished the book. Truly one if the best books I've read in a long, long time!
3	1381968000	Great writing and fascinating story of love in a very unusual place.The story plot quickly thickens and the reader is pulled into theexperience of the characters
5	1381968000	could not put it down.  The author can really make you feel like you are with the characters in the story.
4	1381968000	Great book  Story is very interesting and well written,keeps your attention and pulls on your heart for both mothers and sadness for the fathers  one alive and one not.  Not quite finished yet  will send another review when complete
5	1381881600	I loved this story. Believable and realistic, and I learned about life on an island maintaining a light house before everything became automated.
2	1381881600	If you don't like romance novels - do not read this book. If you do like maritime themes - do not read this book. The two characters with a history of surviving the most misery are Tom & Franz - and the author attempts to make a point about people like these men who choose to accept their past and live happily in the present. But the book dwells endlessly on their histories where they were strong and flawless. The women and old men in the story are daft at best - and in a time when death was more the norm than life for children these people go nuts over one child. The writing style is wordy, plot is predictable, slow, and pathetic - I almost had to stop when the war hero saved the poor damsel from a potential rape - he had arrived in the nick of time - wow, what a hero. Most of the plot unfolds with situations arriving just in time to support some choice or action made by a character. The characters suffer - endlessly - but the plot only moves through contrived situations rather than their choices. For example, this woman, who literally lives on a rock - completely isolated except for the occassional visit from the comic Bluey, or wise Ralph - has 3 failed attempts at childbirth before a perfect baby is essentially dropped in her lap. When the doctor tells her she'll never be able to conceive again it's hard to care - of course she can't - it would be to hard to have her make the choices she does if she didn't have absolutely everything going against her. You can guess the rest - no need to suffer through the long shallow life that unfolds for these poor bastards.
4	1381881600	For me, this was a depressing story. The writing of the book and the language flowed quite well. Sentence structure and spelling were good. I believe the book ended the only way it could have convincingly ended. If you are looking for a feel good book, read Cinderella.
5	1381795200	Wonderful book with lots of twists.  Loved it. Read it for our book club.  Created much discussion.  Loved the setting and period.
3	1381795200	Story is intriguing though incredulous. But I felt the book dragged on a bit too long. I did not feel compelled to any of the characters.
4	1381795200	It's an interesting look into how war effects everyone. How small town living has its pitfalls. How doing the right thing can come with a price.
5	1381795200	Seldom have I cried while reading a book, but this was so moving.  I hope the author has more on the way.
5	1381795200	I love this book. I learned about lighthouses, Australia, love and so much more .  The ending was not what I was expecting, I was however so happy it ended the way it did.  I cried because it hit me in my gut  . I hope she will be writing many more novels.  Thank you
1	1381795200	Author is a good writer, just a depressing book. I like to feel uplifted after reading a book. Just not my type of book.
4	1381795200	It was quite good, I enjoyed it.  Felt it dealt with an issue that was unsolvable.  It was similar to I book I read earlier called &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34;.  I liked both books, dealt with the same issue in different ways.
5	1381795200	I loved this book!  It was interesting from a historical standpoint and the family dynamics.  The secret that they keep for several years eats at the husband and it greatly affects their marriage.
3	1381708800	A quick and easy read that has you perplexed at one point, as to what is the right decision to be made, to a very complex, moral question.
5	1381708800	I enjoyed this book immensely.  The characters felt so real I felt I was there, living the story with them.Rarely do I give five stars,  but this book deserves it 100%I am going to recommend it to everyone I know who is an avid reader.  I'm sure they will love it too!
2	1381708800	If you are looking for a book that will make you think, you may have found it with The Light Between Oceans. It is based solely around an enormous moral dilemma. At first, I was really into it, sharing the dilemma with friends and I love to be mentally challenged, but eventually it got old. No new plot was introduced and I just became exhausted with the whole situation. I felt badly for many of the characters and felt hopeless in the fact that there were no real satisfying solutions to pose to the problems they faced. Definitely not a feel-good book.
5	1381708800	I loved this book.  The characters were incredibly realistic.You could step into their lives, feel their pain and understand their hearts.
5	1381708800	I  was swept in with the first chapter.  Ms. Stedman takes her time in building the character development with each of the characters. You get to know each of them, and care about them, and struggle along with them as they make their difficult and life changing decisions.  She writes so well that I will never forget the light house and  windswept island.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading for hours at a time,  can't wait to get back to it, and hates to have a great story end.  I really look forward to this author's next book!
5	1381708800	What a story! We'll written and so engaging. I can't believe this is the author's first book. Couldn't  put it down.
2	1381708800	Does not hold my attention. drags on with descriptions, Keep waiting for it to get to the point. Would not recomend.
5	1381708800	This book brought extreme emotions just as extreme as the world and the war that the lives in the book were entertwined with.
5	1381622400	I couldn't put the book down.  The rich characters and story about lighthouses was captivating!  I'll read more of this author.
5	1381622400	Great read.  I couldn't put it down. Keeps you wondering until the end.  She is a great writer and easy to read.
3	1381622400	Nice story but not great literature . I  was fascinated with the setting. I was disappointed with the ending. JM
3	1381622400	Just wasn't the book I needed to read right now, however, I thought it was well written, insightful, a good author...
3	1381622400	Very Good story line. A little bit boring with too much uneccessary detail. It took me 3 weeks to finish the book.
5	1381622400	I just finished this book with tears streaming down my face. This book was unbelievably moving with a story that took hold of me and absolutely would not let go til the very end. I cannot recommend this book enough. This story is going to stay with me for a long, long time.
4	1381622400	Enjoyable, well written, at times very sad....a good airplane read!  A first time author..I expect we will see more and even better in the future
5	1381536000	Every once in a while along comes a book that captures you, one that you can not put down and if you must, you can't wait for another quiet moment to pick it up again and be immersed again in this timeless tale of life's mysterious ways. I look forward to the next book. Don't stop writing!
5	1381536000	A really great story; beautifully written. The characters are so well developed and the descriptions of the area makes you feel as though you are there. This is a tragedy, but like so many great tragedies,it leaves you thinking of the people you have read about long after the story ends. I have read a few other reviews that said it was too sad,even one who said they wished they hadn't read it because it was so depressing.those reviewers really are missing the point of great literature, which this is, the point is to weave a tale that is vivid and feels true.I loved this book and wished it wouldn't have ended. Bravo M.L. Stedman!
1	1381536000	Dull and a real downer.  Don't waste your time on this drawn out story that is rather pointless.  Everyone is pretty miserable the entire book.
5	1381449600	Characters were real.  Lost track of the times I asked myself "What would I have done?"  Made the world of a lighthouse keeper come alive. Heartache, loss, love and redemption.  Highly recommend it.
5	1381449600	Loved this book!  What a great story.  It has everything!  Beautiful story, makes you look into your own soul, ask hard questions.  From start to end....wonderful story!
5	1381449600	Our book club will be discussing this book soon. It should be a positive discussion with regard to all the characters and their inner conflicts. Great writing.
4	1381449600	Very well written.  You understood both his pain and hers.  His very deep need to do what was right and his understanding of the other woman's pain and loss, as well as, his part of wrong doing.  The fact that their marriage survived until her death in the end of the book was very amazing.
4	1381449600	The book began slowly for me, but steadily picked up the pace as I continued to read.  The author takes you through many peaks and valleys during the telling of this story.  The characters and their roles are beautifully developed and their pain, heartache and joy are immediately felt.  The book ended the only way it possibly could.  The right way.
5	1381449600	the characters in this book kept me reading it straight through. the story is sad and beautiful and it got right to my heart
5	1381449600	The complex moral situations make for a great discussion. Very well written...concise, but still good character development. I would highly recommend this book.
4	1381449600	Good story. Great writing style.  No offensive language.  Christian overtones.  Refreshingly new subject matter. I would recommend this for a quick read.
5	1381449600	Our book club thinks this is the best novel we've read this year!Very well written, characters clearly drawn, emotionally nuanced.She described a way of life few can experience with poetic vividness
5	1381449600	This was a beautifully written story and one of the best books I have read in years. I highly recommend.
5	1381363200	The book touched me deeply. I couldn't put it down. A must read! I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.
5	1381363200	This is an beautifully written book. It would be a great novel for a book club because there are so many rich events in the story worthy of conversation.
4	1381363200	Very good and held my interest. A light read. Enjoyed information on what it takes to operate a lighthouse. A sad twist.
4	1381363200	I didn't know what to expect because this was a book I had to read for book club. I enjoyed it and the fact that it's a period piece set in Australia kept my brain engaged paying attention to the language of the time and the local slang. The story itself was lovely and torturous at the same time.
5	1381363200	Easy and fast read. Heart-wrenching at times, but definitely a good read. Especially enjoyed the descriptions about the lighthouse on the sea.
5	1381363200	It was a very emotional tale. I loved Lucy so much!! The story line was so compelling that I didn't know what was going to happen next.
4	1381276800	I read this as one of my book club selections.  I really liked the first part of the book, then found the mid-section to drag a bit as so much detail went into describing the characters.  However, as the story progressed, I realized why the author decided to delve into  the characters so completely in order to set up the story.  My group had much to say about this story line as some were sympathetic to the characters and others more easily distinguished between clear right and wrong.  I liked it very  much and found it to be one of those books that made me think about some of the issues for days and days, although I questioned some of the author's reasoning behind various actions by characters.  It was somewhat like: why didn't he do this or why did she do that???  It was interesting to see how, as in life, choices we make, when we try to please others or get our needs met without thought to how others will be impacted, can have devastating effects.
2	1381276800	I read for bookclub and it just wasn't that engaging. I mean, it was one of those plots that you pretty much can see coming. It was fine, but not my favorite book ever.
4	1381276800	As the knight of the Holy Grail once said&#34;They chose poorly&#34;. That said,this is a beautifully written book. Stedman's prose just glistens like a jewel the reader can hold in her hand and look at it from different angles. I hope this is not the last we hear from Stedman and I look forward to the next novel.
4	1381276800	This is a memorable story and was emotionally engaging.  I also liked that it was set in Western Australia, I feel like the uniqueness of the setting and the unusual occupation made it overall very enjoyable.  A nice light read, but something you can think about as well.
4	1381276800	In this book you really won't like all the characters but you will love the story line.  It really makes you think how far you would go to make someone you love happy.  It deals with issues of honesty and integrity and doing what is really the right thing to do.  Awesome job.
5	1381276800	I really enjoyed this book. It kept my attention from the first page I also though it was very well written. I loved the descriptions of the lighthouse, oceans, land etc. I recommended it for my book club this month and I am looking forward to hearing if they enjoyed it as much as me. I read it awhile ago and wanted to refresh my memory for book club. I enjoyed it as much if not more the second time.
3	1381276800	This was a truly heart-wrenching story. It started slow, but did pick up toward the middle. Then it seemed as though the ending was rushed. I'm not sure how to feel about it. I give it a 5/10.
3	1381190400	I liked the book and didn't want to put it down but it was too sad for me.  I like to get away from stress and sadness in my readings and this just made me sad.
4	1381190400	When I began reading this book I found myself distracted by the author's minor fumbles--an awkward turn of phrase here and there, a couple of repetitive verbal tics.  Since this was a book club selection I persevered, and was rewarded with a compelling, heart-wrenching story whose memorable characters I came to know and love.  I  recommend this book without hesitation.
5	1381190400	This was a very good read! It kept me wanting to read more. I'm looking forward to her next book.
3	1381190400	Although I initially found the plot intriguing, I didn't feel like the story held up. I am not sure I would have finished the book if we had not picked it for book club. It may prove interesting for discussion.
5	1381190400	OUTSTANDING!!! Loved the plot, kept me intrigued the ENTIRE time!! Couldn't put it down!! Very clean writing!!! Triggered all senses and emotions, good read!
4	1381190400	I enjoyed the book very much.  It would be a great book for book clubs.  It has moral issues that could be good to discuss with others.
5	1381104000	Characters were fully developed and the plot was excellent in that it easily followed cause and effect.  A tad disappointed in the ending, but not unexpected.
5	1381104000	This book had a little of everything.  To me, I found it difficult to imagine spending most of my life on a Light House.  Too much time to make bad decisions.  I was torn between the husband and wife's decision about keeping the baby. It certainly was the start of a book that had many twists and turns.  I am a romantic and the ending surprised meGailSz@comcast.net
5	1381104000	The Light Between Oceans taught me all about living around and working for the soul purpose of keeping the Light House going above all else. It is very isolated on the beautiful, wild Island and very lonely for the young newly married couple.  Good read!
3	1381104000	An usual and often heart breaking story but I often lost patience with the pace. Certainly portrayed well the life of a lighthouse keeper but parts seemed contrived.
5	1381104000	Moving story, makes you wonder where you stand on the decisions made by the characters.  Easy to read, wonderful use of the language.
5	1381104000	I found this book to be one of the best I have read this year.  The writing was excellent and the story was one that held my attention throughout.  I belong to a book group that read it and the entire group found it to be one of the best books we have read.The writing, characterizations, and theme were superb. I have been recommending it to all my friends.
4	1381104000	The book starts off good by presenting the major plot and moral dilemma.  Afterwards, the book goes back in time to provide some history on Tom's life and his relationship with Isabel.  This part of the book did not interest me as much.  However, by page 85 the story was back to the "present" time and things picked up fast.The writing style was a bit weird (and I'm not referring to the foreign setting and slang).  Frequently, the author would start describing what is happening in the present time with a particular character.  Then all of a sudden, the character would reminisce to the past.  Sometimes, this tactic proved beneficial and provided some meaningful insight.  While, other times it was unnecessary and annoying.Due to the multiple moral dilemmas, challenging decisions, and harsh consequences presented in this book, I found its content "heavy" to read.  At one point it got so depressing that I had to put it down for a few hours.I liked the ending.  The author tied up all the loose ends.  Although I really enjoyed this book, I'm very happy its over.  I need to read something light now to recover from that emotional roller coaster.
4	1381017600	A good summer or plane read. The characters are multi-dimensional enough to keep the reader guessing at times, but overall I found the plot to be a little predictable.. it may be by design, but - spoiler alert - when the baby washes ashore in front of a woman that just suffered through a bunch of detailed dramatic miscarriages, i feel like little room needs to be spent on describing her inner dilemma on keeping that baby.. she's keeping the baby, let's move on to the next point ASAP.Having said that, there was enough unpredictability and ethical dilemmas to give it a 4 star rating.
5	1381017600	I loved this book. It was the best book I've read I quite awhile.  Very enjoyable. I Highly recommend it.
5	1380931200	Having experienced many of the things this novel touches on, I was amazed at the accuracy of the characterizations of each player. Every character is flawlessly portrayed with deep feelings, struggling against what is right and wrong while attempting to live in harsh conditions and questionable ethics.Tom has lived with past decions going back to his childhood that resulted in life altering consequences. Trying to run away from himself, he requests an assignment to a desolate island as a lighthouse keeper.Tom marries a young girl who probably would have been diagnosed with ADD, full of fun, laughter and very personable.  Tom takes his job seriously, and keeps the books and his home in a meticulous manner while Isabel jaunts around the island carefree, enjoying married life to the fullest.  After 2 miscarriages and a stillborn baby, a baby washes up on the island.  Isabel feels its a miracle from God. Tom tries to call the authorities, but sucumbs to the emotional wims of his wife and decides not to report it.  They raise little Lucy for several years when a chance meeting reveals the truth, and they are suddenly in the presence of the child's biological mother, who has never stopped searching for her missing child.When the child is returned to her biological mother, she is literally ripped from the arms of the only mother she has known, and thrown into an unknown world without anyone explaining why.  (I went through this and the book is right-on with the feelings and actions of this child. The memories almost drowned me).Law enforcement is involved, planning to administer the harshest penalties possible.Tom must come to terms with how his actions have created a horrible set of circumstances for all families involved, including friends, co-workers, grandparents, and Isabel and the child.This book is one of the best ones I have read in a long time.  In addition to the to human story, the reader is given a history lesson on WWI plus how the old lighthouse stations were run, and why certain things were demanded of their keepers.This is one story that will stay on my shelf, and well worth the money.
4	1380931200	Well written  Thought provoking.  A good read.  This was a book club selection, and was unanimously approved by all members.
4	1380931200	One of the first reviews I read for this book before I bought it said that it was a story about "When good people make bad decisions". Well that was absolutely spot-on! What a GREAT book!! |Tom and Isabel, a young couple in the 20s, live on Janus Rock, a remote lighthouse station, hundreds of miles off the coast of Australia. Tom, a decorated war hero from World War I, believes he literally has "dodged a bullet" by surviving when many of his fellow soldiers died. Isabel, desperately wanting to start a family has been wracked with grief at having 2 miscarriages and most recently, a stillborn baby.  They are faced with a life changing and heart-wrenching dilemma when a small rowboat with a dead man and a live infant washes up on the shore of the island. Do they report the incident? Or can Isabel, having just had a stillborn baby two weeks prior, keep the baby "For just a little while longer", asking Tom to postpone his reporting of the incident.This sets the story up, and what follows casts nobody in anywhere near shades of black and white, but everyone in shades of grey.  Tom and Isabel justify their decisions in their own mind, yet they eventually come to find out that their choices have heartbreaking consequences for all involved.I couldn't put this book down, especially as it went on. I think I read for seven hours straight yesterday and I highly recommend it!
5	1380931200	I LOVED this book!  It has everything you would want in a read...an exotic setting, interesting characters, mysterious sub-plots, tragedy, redemption, and love stories of all kinds.  Extremely well written!  Bravo to Stedman!  Treat yourself to this one.--A non-fiction lover
4	1380931200	Beautiful story based in south Western Australia . A parents love has no time limits . I really enjoyed this book and my heart broke a thousand times :(
5	1380931200	The Light Between Oceans was a love story at many levels.  The characters become people you know and will never forget.I was interested to learn of Australia's involvement in WWI. I realized Australia has always been our ally.The way this lovely book was written made the reader better understand how war affects those who fight for our freedom.I loved this novel.
4	1380931200	A very sad story, but the ending had a win-win quality.  The author as a first-timer captured love and devotion clearly, which can be difficult to put into the written word without becoming maudlin.  He writes very well and I look forward to reading more of his work.
5	1380931200	This was probably my favorite book of the last year or more.  The history of the 'keeping the lights,' was intriguing; the love story between these two characters was tender and real; and the moral dilemma tore at my heart and mind.  The entire last chapter was read with a tissue in my hands, dabbing at my eyes, while quietly crying.  I highly recommend this book and can guarantee you won't be disappointed all the way through the book.
4	1380844800	The story was well done. I loved the characters and I liked how they took some unexpected turns, just like real people do. I enjoyed it!
4	1380844800	This book is about love and what love can do to a person.  It has a wonderful ending, and is inspirational to anyone who reads it.
5	1380844800	The Light Between Oceansl tugged at so many different emotions.  A novel you will find hard to put down!  I loved it!
5	1380844800	An outstanding book about life on an isolated island, working with a light tower that keeps ships safe.  The book moves along, sometimes at a slow pace, then more quickly, as the story describes a situation that is full of promise and full of deceit.
4	1380844800	What starts as a seemingly idyllic love story, takes a progressively more and more complicated journey into a painful set of choices. The characters are well drawn. Their actions are never less than believable. The author could have taken an easy way out at a number of points, but instead follows the descent into each character's personal hell.Worth reading.
5	1380844800	Fabulous... Thought provoking .... Who won? Who lost? Who did you root for? A great read! Outstanding storyline and page turner.
5	1380758400	This was a GREAT book! It was a quick and easy read but also thought provoking. I highly recommend it to others.
2	1380758400	To be fair, I am never the type to read romance or romance-type novels. As a male, I found it hard to connect with the male characters. The main male protagonist is sad and unfortunate to have met and married an "unstable" woman. She stole another woman's baby, coerced her husband to remain quiet, and got insanely mad when he did the right thing to contact the real mother. The whole scene is just too "maniac" and I almost wanted to give up reading halfway.I wish Ms Stedman well and good luck with her next novel.
4	1380758400	Presentation of a difficult moral decision set in a lonely, isolated setting of the unique glimpse into the life of a lighthouse keeper in a wild, remote area.
5	1380758400	I bought this book at a store while on a trip, and the clerk made an &#34;interesting&#34; comment after I paid that made me wonder if I'd wasted my money. I'm so glad I trusted my gut and formed my own opinion. There were a few slow parts in the beginning, but once I got into the story I didn't want to put the book down. I truly enjoyed this book, and I have recommended it to others.
5	1380758400	The characters &#34;lived&#34; with me for at least 2 weeks after finishing this book.That is the mark of wonderfully developed characters and story to me.The ethical lessons are accurate because they cost something of eachcharacter. The author did a wonderful job of bringing the 1920's to thepage with accuracy, transporting readers to a much kinder and gentlerperiod. &#34;To thine own self be true&#34; rings loud and clear. Wonderful read.
5	1380758400	I loved it.  I didn't want to read it at times, but it took me to depths that one does not go to often.
5	1380758400	Very good reading and a satisfying altho not necessarily happy ending. I want to read more stedman. Any good recommendations?
5	1380672000	From the first page, the story engulfed you with so much emotion and so many decisions, right or wrong by the characters. Loved the writing and the many images generated by the author. A truly enjoyable read. It created a wonderful discussion in our book club.
5	1380672000	It bogs down a little bit, but overall, I found this a very good read.  It is an almost voyeuristic view into the realities of the human nature that guides us all.  Thee are no good guys, no villains.  It's fascinating.
3	1380672000	Held my interest. Written well. Not anything I would recommend as a must read. Worth the money I guess. yeah.
5	1380672000	this book was a huge surprise.  wonderful writer, amazing story. a book you cannot stop reading, and one you hope won't end!
2	1380672000	I have only just started the book & am having trouble getting into the book, but am told that I will love it  to continue reading which I am doing.
5	1380672000	I truly enjoyed this book chosen by my bookclub.  It proved very interesting dealing with a lighthouse keeper back in the 1920's on an island 100 miles from mainland Australia. He finds a woman who is willing to marry him and lead the solitary life the job entails but he finds himself in a true dilemma. One that tears him up inside and then has to deal with  all the ramifications of his decisions. It has you on the edge of your seat as to what the outcome will be.  Best book I have read in a long while. Congratulations to this first time author.
5	1380672000	Filled with love, hopes, despair, moral dilemmas.., this novel will keep you riveted and deeply touch your heart before you close it for the first time
4	1380672000	A good reminder of the sadness of lies and the ugliness of prejudice and the sweetness of love and forgiveness.
5	1380672000	This novel went above and beyond my expectations. It tugged at my heart strings. I have recommended it to friends.
5	1380672000	Although I felt it started off slow, overall, it was a great story.  I think the author was very good at conveying the characters' personalities and their feelings throughout the book.  The story flowed very well and kept me interested.
1	1380585600	I have not even had the chance to read this book but I am P.O.ed. I have a long commute to work so I switch to text to speech on my drive back and forth to work. When I ordered my book it was from my Kindle device and I did not notice that text to speech was disabled on this book.  So I thought, "OH well I guess I will have to purchase the professional narration thinking maybe $4." OH NO really I am expected to pay an additional $12.99 at a cough, cough reduced price because I have already paid $8.99 for a digital book, really!!!!!!!!!!!! NO! not going to do it; I could return the book unread or wait to read it until when I get some time off from work. HUM what shall I do?  I have the same issue with Angelia's Ashes can't get it finished because I keep flip flopping with books that are text to speech enabled.I may change my rating after I have time to read this book.
5	1380585600	Very good.Recommend to those who like a teary book!Very sad story with a sorta good ending.A book club read!
5	1380585600	This new author is awesome.  It was a great read and held my interest.  Great characters that seem real and a fantastic story.
4	1380585600	The premise is intriguing and the characters well drawn.  The dark mood, with dark fate hanging over the characters for page after page, gets old, especially in the middle of the book.  However, the novel led to a very interesting book club discussion.
5	1380585600	I loved this story.  I thought it was well paced, as well as readable and believable.  Would recommend it to all readers.
5	1380585600	A book that will give cause for your own life examination.  This book will have you questioning your own life choices for long after you have finished it.  Great life lessons!
5	1380585600	The story has a lot to offer, love, betrayal, right and wrong, and what constitutes family. It's a difficult situation they deal with. It's well-told and worth the read.
4	1380585600	Tear jerker, and very good story.  Well written and easy to follow.  Have lost a child and know the pain.
3	1380499200	I liked the story.  It was interesting to try to understand what a couple in these circumstances would feel.  I could identify with her.
5	1380499200	This book was a very different, but no less excellent, break from books I normally read. The characters and their stories are beautifully woven together.I would recommend this book to anyone who liked &#34;the 13th tale&#34; or &#34;gone girl.&#34;
5	1380499200	It is a book about love, loyalty, betrayal and regret.  It's very heavy and sad and is not for those looking for an upbeat story. This story starts off a bit slow, but it gets better.  So well written that you feel like you are experiencing the character's struggles.
5	1380499200	A most interesting novel and one that I would love to see as a movie.  You will laugh AND cry while reading this.
5	1380499200	Couldn't put this down. Stayed up waaaay past my bedtime; This will hook you and keep you engaged to the end.
5	1380412800	Absolutely loved this book.  Enjoyed the characters and how their lives all intertwined.  Highly recommend reading it.  Could not put it down.
4	1380412800	A good story with a fair resolution.  It was a predictable stoory but still held my interest.  Try this book
5	1380412800	I am sixty- one year's old and this is the first book I have ever read that made me cry. The ending is not what I expected but it was very powerful. What a great book.
4	1380412800	It was an interesting read. I thought the writing was very well done and a very good reason to enjoy the book.  It was so like a Greek tragedy or moral play. I found myself asking what I would do. I love the setting . The war added an additional facet of interest.
5	1380412800	A heartbreaking story of loss and love.  One of the better books that I've read over the past few years.
5	1380412800	This tale has a lot to it.  Joy, sadness, desparation and love.  It is both intricate and compelling.  Difficult to write moire without giving away the plot but suffice to say, you will be involved in the characters that are so well portrayed.
3	1380412800	The book got off to a great start, but the end was underdeveloped, and upsetting.The author could have given more rationale and dialog for the characters' actions.
3	1380412800	This book had an interesting story line. However, most of the characters were not terribly likable. What would you do with a secret? Keep it or try to right a wrong...
5	1380412800	I enjoyed reading this novel.  Couldn't wait to finish it.  Very good novel for the first by this author, sad at times but real to life.
5	1380412800	Breathtaking. An aching story of love and loss. Deep and beautiful. An easy read that wi have you spell bound.
2	1380412800	Well written but it is sad story, though it describes the life of that period  very well.I can feel for both sides of this story. All the characters are well described.It is amazing that Lucy-Grace developed into a well adjusted adult.Many children would have been emotional affected , such as the ability to trust.
5	1380412800	I've read it for three different bookclubs.  It's a wonderful book with lovely times ,which switch to tense, hurtful times. lThe author puts us through many emotional switches .Larry
4	1380412800	I loved this book.  Ms. Stedman creates a gut-wrenching angst that will have you turning the page to see how the plot will resolve itself.  Some readers may not be satisfied with the ending, but I'm not sure an alternate ending could exist.
5	1380412800	The story captured my attention, and my heart from the first sentence. I stayed up late and got up early to read it. Well described character and setting, well thought out story line, surprises all along the way.
5	1380326400	Stedman's writing style is beautifully descriptive. Her use of words combined with a plot that would make any mother's heart ache kept me captive to my Kindle!
5	1380326400	There are so many reviews already written for this book that I don't know what more I can add but I just had to review it.This is one of the most beautifully written novels I've ever read. The author writes with such passion and detail. Her ability to describe each character's emotional state is uncanny. Parts of the book are difficult to read because of how heartbreaking and real the prose makes everything feel. It is an absolute page turner. Even though the plot isn't intense you're so invested in the characters that you just can't put the book down.Sometimes the "purpose" of a novel is just to be an incredible story and this book delivers. I loved every second. I would highly recommend it and I hope this author writes another book soon!
5	1380326400	I thought this would be just a pick up to read from time to time, but I could not put it down. After a while, you feel as though you know these people, and you want to find that all is well.  GREAT reading.
4	1380326400	Interesting and different.  I learned a lot about Light Houses. The ending is not what you would expect but very realistic..
5	1380326400	Loves the characters and the ending was much more satisfying than I expected. Beautifully written and descriptive. I couldn't put it down,
5	1380240000	New favorite book! Can't wait for another book from this author. Very good but sad read! Have your tissue box
5	1380240000	I highly recommend this book.  Could not wait to finish it and was sad when it was over.  It was like saying good bye to a good friend.  You will enjoy every page!
5	1380240000	This isn't the type of book I normally read, but I really enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down.
5	1380240000	I could not put this book down! This first time author does an incredible job of creating each character so that  the reader is pulled in to their struggle.  As the story unfolds, you can't help but feel the anguish, recognize the complexity of the problem and realize that there is no one right answer!
5	1380240000	One of the best books I 've read Ina long time.  My Book club all liked it also. Goodbye and amen.
5	1380240000	This is a story about love and doing the right thing, no matter how hard it is to do.  I even learned about the life of a Lighthouse keeper and Australia.  I thoroughly enjoyed this read and would recommend it to everyone.
4	1380240000	Good story.  Lots of twists and turns, some expected, many not.  Liked the ending, although it was sad.  It brought the tale full circle and made it more believable.
5	1380240000	Read this for a book club and can hardly wait until one of my friends finishes it so we can discuss the story.  I found some of the thoughts that struck so close to things gone by......loved this novel.
5	1380240000	This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time. There is much human interest emotion as the story unfolds.
5	1380240000	We all have struggles in life, and we get to see the kind of struggles in every character.  And yet, it also shows that we can get through life regardless of how tough it can be at times.
5	1380153600	This book is fun and complex at the time.  It's about finding, losing, and dealing with the aftermath.  Loved it
5	1380153600	Well written and unique plot.  I could really feel the life on Janus, lonely but rich in so many ways.
3	1380153600	I like books that offer me some knowledge of history or geography or provide insights on a subject matter. I was able to learn about what life was like for a lighthouse keeper. The rest of the book is very much a &#34;novel&#34; with a not so believable story.
3	1380153600	Interesting setting, characters are a little one-dimensional. credibility issues with how much they were in love and how quickly she blamed him. Not a book I'd re-read.
5	1380153600	My book club choose this book. My review is 5 stars because  from the beginning the book starts out good all the way to the end. The author' characters and scenery are vividly explain well.
5	1380153600	This book was engrossing, intelligent and beautifully written.  I highly recommend this book, I was transported to a different time.
5	1380067200	This book was so good!  Really pulled at my heart strings in so many ways for each character.  It really made me think about how 1 decision can change so many things...good and bad... and how it can affect you (and others) for a lifetime.
4	1380067200	A charming read. Lucy is the light for Tolm and Isabel. A smooth tale, although predictable, none the less a moving story of love.
5	1380067200	This book is achingly beautiful and absolutely spellbinding. On its barest surface, the story is the collision of "what ifs" that happens when a childless lighthouse keeper and his wife find an infant girl literally washed up on their desolate island shore by fate and decide to raise her as their own. When they briefly return to the mainland a couple of years later, they find that the choice that has brought them so much joy has unintentionally been the ruination of another. Deception, remorse, revenge, fate and the inescapable drive to "set things right" all get a remarkable airing here, where no decisions driven by the love for a child seem entirely beyond the pale.  The tale unfolds through multiple viewpoints, and the rich development of even the minor characters whose actions and words ring with echoes of their own hard, heartbreaking experiences makes this a story to be read slowly, savoring the ripples and tremors of every phrase.
5	1380067200	I loved this book. It started off a little slow for me but i felt it was going to get better. And it truly truly did. I am pregnant now with my first child after years of infertility issues so I know i am biased toward loving a book about babies.  The fact that I am preg is why I bought it.  I feel especially for mothers the intense desire to have a child and struggle can truly take over your life.  It is a common experience in today's world and always has been but today many women are able to connect about it more through the internet.  That said, it is a great topic for a book yet it is not an infertility book at all but a story about so much more. It is a story about love, between man and wife, between parents , grandparents and children, between friends.  It is so well written. The way she honors nature in this book is incredible.  Yes it is sad and I am ok with that because life can be very very sad and I found this book to be actually quite realistic. It could have happened I can see how it could have happened and I can see the various points of view from many different sides and angles. At times I felt and wanted one thing to happen and then it would change!  And I would want something else to happen,  like rooting for different sides... and that is a complex well written book. why would you pick out this book after reading the back if you did not want to feel sad?  DUH it is obviously going to be sad. But that is not all it is.  It has the power to make you think, wonder, change your mind over and over again and care about all the characters, every single one.LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK
5	1380067200	Well written and lovely book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to more from this author. Three more words.
5	1379980800	A thought-provoking read, albeit on the sad side.  And all about love, in its various forms. Highly recommend this book.
5	1379980800	Beautifully written, and heat wrenching....  I almost couldn't finish it because I knew where it was heading and I felt so sad.  So worth the journey.  "Forgiveness happens once, but resentment happens everyday".  My new mantra.
4	1379980800	It was a compelling story-line....I thought the ending of the tale was not solid as the rest of the book.
4	1379980800	I read this book on vacation and I couldn't put it down. It has it's ups and downs and keeps you turning the page to find out what's next. I enjoyed this story!
4	1379980800	I enjoyed this book because it was very easy to get into from the word go. The author does a good job of keeping you involved with the story line. It is one of those reads that has you torn between right and wrong and what would you do if this happened to you! You will have empathy for all of the characters as they struggle with the moral and legal ramifications of their actions......Highly reccomend.
4	1379894400	This was a book club read and I have to say it started out slow and difficult to get into.  However midway through the book it did pick up and my interest to the end was steady.  I would recommend this book but only if it were a free monthly read on your kindle for those with prime or you borrow it from the library.  If I am going to pay over six dollars for a book it better capture my interest from the start.  The ending is a true surprise.
5	1379894400	This book was awesome. A little slow in the beginning but could not put it down in the end.  I recommend it to male or female.  Great story and much reflection can be applied to everyday life.  We have all made mistakes in life but need to confess and move on!
4	1379894400	I was very glad that I read this book.  Having an adopted child, I am kind of drawn to these stories. Did they make the correct choice, at the beginning and will they be able to live with the end of the story.
5	1379894400	Excellent.  Moral dilemma at its best.  Heart wrenching.  Well written.  A great read.  It took to places I had no knowledge of; that's always a plus.
3	1379894400	OK read. I was not a big fan , but it was ok. Our book group read and certainly others enjoyed it more than I.
5	1379894400	We just finished in our book, and brought so many different opinions About 50% liked itand all thee rest had mixed opines about Izzy and Tom. A mst interesting discussion
4	1379894400	The conflicts were so real and how the characters made their decisions was a great read.  Set in Australia was a new scene for me.
5	1379894400	I just finished this book and cannot praise it enough.  It drew me in, kept me there, and made me sorry it was over.  The ending brought me to tears. I was stunned to read some negative reviews which were highly critical of the plot, character development, etc.  While I am no literary critic, I do know what I like to read, and this fit the bill perfectly.  Loved it and would highly recommend!
4	1379808000	Wow!!  Ask someone you love to read it too so you can not only talk about it, but ask, &#34;what would you do?&#34;  Wonderful!
4	1379808000	Beautiful descriptions of the environment at the lighthouse and an unusual compelling story with complex characters.  It is difficult to choose sides in this story.
5	1379808000	The book chronicles the life of a lighthouse keeper and his family as they find themselves in extraordinary circumstances. When I initially heard of this book, I thought "I don't care about lighthouses or nautical lore, I'm not going to like this."But the reviews were so positive, I decided to give it a try.As you will hear repeatedly regarding this book, it is sad and tense. It involves you in circumstances that will almost certainly go wrong, and takes you along for the ride. It manages to tell a story that is at once very personal to the characters and, at the same time, placed in a much broader context.The book has lingered with me and I highly recommend it. If you enjoy novels by Pat Barker, you might enjoy the post-WWI themes here.
2	1379808000	A predictable plot in a book that belongs on the shelf with other romance novels.  I don't like romance novels.
2	1379808000	SadWhile this was well written it gave me a sense of dread for the inevitable end. I felt like I was under a heavy fog during the whole book.
5	1379808000	M. L. Stedman has proven in this story how a mother's love in unending. I really enjoyed reading this book.
5	1379808000	What a tear I cried the whole book. It was such a touching story I really would of made the ending different
3	1379808000	At first I though this book would be a real treat.  However, as I progressed through the story with the various twists and turns I began to feel very manipulated and I resented it.  It really was an ok read.
4	1379808000	The theme and overall feel of this book is tragic and kind of doom feeling. But the book is so well written, especially the first 2/3 of the book that it is pleasurable to read. The last part of the book seems written more quickly. I would recommend this book for someone in that &#34;blue&#34; mood who wants a read in step with their mood.
5	1379808000	This book was a very enjoyable read.  It was interesting learning a little about a light keeper's life.  But most importantly, the moral dilemma these parents faced was very thought provoking.  A baby of unknown origins appears on the shore in a boat with a dead man.  They care for the baby as it were their own.  Once they discover who the baby's mother is and that she is still looking for it, what should they do?  Admit it all or keep this child they now love?  It had me wondering what I would do, and how this decision affected so many people.  It is interesting that I didn't really know what resolution to hope for.  You will not be disappointed!  Good book club book (our club had a very interesting discussion.)
5	1379808000	This novel was the first one in a long time that had me from the very first page to the last. The story is one that is believable and heart breaking. I won't give anything away, but there comes a point in the novel that such a major twist occurs and I couldn't help but wonder how it could be ended in a satisfying way. M.L. Stedman was able to wrap things up so that they felt like, if the characters were truly real and not just characters, their lives could actually play out in this manner.  I lived and breathed these characters and I can't wait for the next novel.
4	1379808000	I hated to put this book down as a read the love story of a young couple who lived and loved as care keepers of a Lighthouse in a country foreign to me.  I love reading stories based on the lives of those from another part of the world and a slightly earlier time period. Captivating!
4	1379808000	good concept but the conflict point was belabored. Skim some of that and it gets better and raises good book group discussion
3	1379808000	We just read this book for our book club. It came highly recommended and we all couldn't wait to read it. We as a group gave it mixed reviews. Some of the group loved it, some hated it and some thought it was just okay. I am in the just okay group. The beginning sparked my interest but then the book slowed down with a few chapters of Australian gibberish that I would have edited out of the book. I was ready not to even bother but then the book got remarkably better. We are having the discussion in a week and it will be interesting to discuss all the moral issues that are broached in this novel. I would recommend it to a book club to read as it is thought provoking and did hold my interest once I got into it. It as a bit too contrived and far fetched to my taste.
5	1379808000	What a wonderful book. Loved the whole thing! I usually don't get so pulled in but this book did it.
5	1379808000	This is a real winner, a first novel and so spellbinding.My book club reviewed it and everyone loved it.The early 20th century lifestlyle and morals were very notable andI loved her characters and clear descriptions of the life of a lighthousekeeper and his family.Definitely a book to read and I wlll look for her next book.
5	1379721600	Love this story-gives you lots of food for thought.  Don't know if there are other books by this author-but if so, I'll definitely look into them.
5	1379721600	From the first page to the end &#34;The Light Between the Oceans&#34; grabs your attention.  You will fall in love with the lightkeeper and his wife, understand completely how they do what they do and then, while your feelings for them stays, you meet new characters and you understand on the other side of the same coin.  How could there ever be a resolve to his heartwrenching situation.
5	1379721600	This is not only a great read but thought provoking as well - as in what would I have done?. Wonderful book for discussion, and not just for book clubs,  It's got everything in it from heartbreak and betrayal to a great love story.  Take a little bit of patience to get into it but well worth the read.
5	1379721600	A gripping example of &#34;no one wins.&#34;  Beautifully written and keeps you wanting the story to go on and on.
5	1379721600	A well-written novel that beautifully intertwines mysteries, love story, human behavior, and  conflict between a man's Oath of Duty and love for his wife. Highly recommend.
5	1379721600	A book club choice I may have passed by on and am so very happy I read it.  Loved it.
4	1379721600	This book is hard to define.  I loved the way the author put so much love between the characters and Lucy/Grace.  It was difficult reading how these families were going to deal with this situation.  The author made you feel sorry for everyone involved in this story.  I could not wait until the end to see how this was going to end.
5	1379721600	I expected a traditional and predictable read ... I was pleasantly surprised.  It was an unpredictable story, thought provoking story that drew you into the characters creating feelings of empathy and self retrospection.
5	1379721600	My book club read this and all liked it.  We used the discussion questions at the end and found a lot to discuss.  The title. for one,had several levels of meaning.
5	1379721600	A great book! Very well written.  The author did a good job developing each character as the story unfolds.  I plan to use the book  with my book club next month if we can get enough copies.
4	1379721600	A wonderfully woven story about the lonely life of a lighthouse keeper & his wife,a murder & a kidnapping. A good read!
5	1379721600	I loved the book. It kept me interested, it was hard to put down. I liked that it was an easy read
5	1379635200	This was a heart wrenching story of love, right verses wrong, responsibility and sense of duty.  The characters were portrayed as 'real' people facing very difficult decisions based on bad judgment.  The end of the story is very heartwarming and brought tears to my eyes.  I knew in my heart it had to end the way it did but I had a lot of sympathy for all characters in the story.  Beautifully  written.
5	1379635200	When I started this book, I didn't think I would like it because quite frankly, I didn't find the writing that good. I was definitely not immediately engaged. I've read other books about life in a remote lighthouse, or on a remote island, and thought, oh this again. Ho hum. I just finished the book, and the writing, the actual putting together of sentences, is certainly not what I loved about this book, although it improved by the end and I actually found some of the passages in the last chapter or so very good.  Overall, however, it's fair writing, easy to read, ordinary and for the most part not terribly original--nothing poetic or lyrical--at least about the sentences. I was not wowed by the vocabulary, but I did find some of the Australian phrases interesting. The setting is also interesting along with the descriptions of the flora and fauna. The narrative point of view was jarring at times. It seemed to switch suddenly. She only used this technique a couple of times, and I got used to it, but it was weird at first.So why did I give it five stars?She takes a tired old subject and breathes new life into it in a very original way. Her talent creeps up on you as you read. She captures love and heartache in in so many ways in this book. It was a great story with recognizable characters who find themselves in very human dilemmas. It's not a "happy" book as other reviewers have mentioned, so if you don't like a book that might make you cry, this might not be for you, but there are many wonderful happy moments in the story, too. It is a love story that portrays the truth of the human experience in a way that captivates the reader. She creates very human motives for each character as the moral dilemmas ensue--and not just the main characters, but some of the minor characters as well, which I particularly enjoyed. The images and symbolism weaved throughout make up for the tired sentences in the beginning of the book. There are some good unexpected twists and the plot moves briskly, especially towards the end. It wasn't until the end of the book that I learned this is her first novel. Bravo! I can't wait to read her next book. Yep, this one earned five stars.
4	1379635200	The characters were well developed and the story itself was interesting and provocative.  A page turner that wasn't a piece of fluff.  I really liked it.
5	1379635200	I was thoroughly enthralled from the first pages to the last.  Stedman  vividly captures the joys, sorrows, fears and love of each character and that is why this book was a great read for me.
5	1379635200	Really enjoyed this story, the characters, plot, and so easy to empathize with such turmoil and sadness, and love, finished so quick, couldn't put it down, loved it.
5	1379635200	My book club just read this book and really enjoyed it. It's beautifully written and both character driven and plot driven, so it draws you in and keeps you turning pages. It's quite tragic at times, with no happy ending in sight, but also heartwarming, and I was thinking about it days later.
5	1379635200	My Book Club thought the plot began a bit slowly...then found they couldn't put it down once the story started to unfold.  Many opinions as to how the couple should have handled their situation.
4	1379548800	Great read! Sad story.  at times i felt like the ocean was right behind me while i read. Thoroughly enjoyed the writing of this author.
4	1379548800	The characters are interesting and their story allows you to see the consequences of choices made.  One choice, good or bad can change the course of our lives, creating a chain of events affecting all those around us.
3	1379548800	I liked the book-especially the fact it was based in Australia, and had interesting characters.  The other thing was it got you thinking about &#34;what would I do&#34;?  In the same situation.  I'd recommend you keep reading and get through the slow start , because it does become interesting as time goes on.  If you have the time, slog through the &#34;too detailed&#34; start to the book, then enjoy the rest.
4	1379548800	I could not put  this book down towards the end. It is well written an  I would recommend it to anyone. It is a heart warming story.
4	1379548800	Lots of moral questions arise that are difficult to resolve. Good writing, good descriptions of the times, the people, and locale.
5	1379548800	This book reveals the strength a person has to love their child beyond what anyone can imagine even if the child is not theirs biologically.
5	1379548800	I enjoyed this book.  The author made the characters seem real and I was drawn into the story.  The writing was so descriptive,I thought I was in Australia.  I was very moved by the story.  In fact, I had to put the book down at one point because I was so annoyed with the direction the characters were taking.  Why couldn't they see they were heading for trouble.
5	1379548800	Loved this book.  Well written, great story, unexpected plot twists, and emotional at times.  The battle internally over ethics and morality and how that effects the family is really well done.  Was speaking to my 91 year-old grandmother the other day and she agreed with me that this has been one of the best books we've recently read.  More like this, please!
5	1379462400	I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend.  I wasn't very interestedin the subject matter so didn't read it for a while.  Then I picked it up again, and itwas really a good book.  Turned into a great mystery and interesting moral dilemmaVery much recommend.
5	1379462400	This was quite a story...a good one for a book club.  Excellent plot and writing skills.There were a few places where it was hard to read, but I kept going and was glad I did.
4	1379462400	This book is a sweet story that gives a great message. I would put this on an airplane novel list. It is a quick read.
5	1379462400	Loved the story. The characters were so real and their lives so interesting and exciting. I loved reading this book!
5	1379462400	This book was a great story of love, hope, loss, forgiveness, redemption, and grace. So many of life`s experiences captured in a consuming novel.
5	1379462400	The novel has a very strong sense of place.  You stay right along, page for page, as the moral dilemma surrounding Tom and Izzy unfold.
5	1379462400	Loved this book.  It was very hard to put down and the premise was intriguing.  The characters were very interesting.
4	1379462400	Set shortly after the end of WWI, Tom Sherbourne becomes a lighthouse keeper and falls in love with Isabel, a beautiful and spirited young woman he met while visiting the port town nearest the lighthouse during his first stay in town.Tom obviously has demons, and he keeps most of them to himself, all too often believing that after the things he's done he doesn't deserve to live, much less be happy, but Isabel is enamored, and she wants to spend her life with Tom, inner-demons and all. After they're married and living on the island they suffer miscarriage after miscarriage, which drives Isabel to point of madness that defies all reason. When a boat washes up on the shore of their private little island, carrying a wailing baby wrapped in a woman's sweater and the dead body of the baby's father, Isabel reasons that this child is a gift from God, a baby for her to love that her body can't reject.Against Tom's better judgment, Isabel convinces him to keep the baby, and he ignores protocol. The couple claim the mysterious baby as their own, and Isabel is blissfully happy for the first time since her body betrayed her desperate longing for a family of her own. Isolation and desperation are volatile cocktail, the isolation almost making a person feel like they are above the law and desperation pushes them just that much further over the edge of reason. As time unravels, so too does baby Lucy's mystery, and while Isabel seems perfectly content denying the cold truth, the guilt eats away at Tom until he can't keep silent anymore.The Light Between Oceans started off slow for me. About 35 pages in, I honestly didn't know if I was going to be able to keep reading. Stedman did a lot of tense-shifting and head-hopping, which she marked with clear page breaks, but sometimes it felt completely unnecessary.  There were also moments when I knew I should have felt more emotionally moved by certain events or characters, but those ah-ha revelations didn't come on as quickly as I would have liked them to.Overall, it was well written, and at times the language was breathtaking. The story was very good, and after a while it was hard to put down, with elements that almost force the reader to ask: What would I do if this were me?I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction centering around the aftermath of WWI.
5	1379462400	An not because of the story, but because sometimes I do not do well with books set in other countries b/c there is so much language and dialect to get through, BUT the story was so well told and was so enthralling, that I was able to get through the language without it slowing me down and taking away meaning from the tale. This was a book club book and with most of us being mothers it led to some great discussions.
4	1379376000	I really enjoyed the ups and downs of the book.  It was incredibly heart-felt.  It was worth reading for sure.
5	1379376000	Enjoyed the book, kept me engaged and wanting to know how everything would turn out for the characters. Characters well developed, places felt like I was there. Recommend
5	1379376000	The Light Between Oceans is very entertaining AND thought provoking.  It made me appreciate God's gift of family.  I also was made aware how any choice I make can have far reaching consequences.
5	1379289600	Really enjoyed this story so different from most books I read.it had me crying at the end. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
4	1379289600	...that there simply cannot be a happy ending to this book, if there's going to be a story at all.  I knew it when I read the synopsis.  The lighthouse and its isolated island are the perfect backdrop and symbols for a story  infused with loneliness and sorrow.  Life is about what we cannot control (miscarriages; a baby showing up in a boat with a dead man) and what we can (choosing to keep the baby).  If we choose to keep steering toward the rocks, knowing all along that the lighthouse is warning us away, tragedy will strike.  While the subject matter is heavy and dark with grief, the story is one of those that will draw you in, mix up your moral compass, and have you asking, &#34;what if...&#34;
5	1379289600	While the story is very sad, one should read it. It is very believable. The writing of this book is amazing. The descriptions are profound. Our book club is reading it right now and eveyone I speak with really liked the book.
4	1379289600	The fight between desire, and what is right caught my attention. The ending was too predictable. The knowledge of early lighthouses and the horrible life style of the keepers in remote areas was fascinating!
3	1379289600	Without spoiling the plot, I found the first half of the book to be simply and beautifully written, and the second half to be rather too drawn out. The author is clearly thoughtful (I can't imagine the emotional courage it took to craft this sad tale hour by hour), and the book made me think, in a way I am grateful for, about family and the importance of family. Not really "glad" I read it, as I tend to like a bit more humor and fun in my fiction, but it was a moving, wrenching tale, for sure. I'd give it 4 stars because the characters are profound and their situation was compelling, but I admit I found myself trying to race through several of the chapters about 3/4ths of the way through, just so I could move on from the story emotionally.
2	1379289600	Just could not get into it.  I did not even finish the book.  I restarted it so many times trying to excite myself with the story.  I just gave up.Tess.
5	1379289600	It was touching all the way through. The author helped you feel the loneliness, the heartbreak, the struggle with human weakness and selfishness. Good read for me!
3	1379289600	Even at The end I am not sure I like any of the characters. However the story of their decisions and the resulting misery is poignantly told.
5	1379289600	All the way through the book, I kept trying to think of a &#34;good&#34; way that this could end.  The ending was the only way it could happen, I suppose, but still heart wrentching.  Amazing how one little mistake in judgement could impact so many lives.  I wonder what I would have done?
5	1379203200	Ah, the consequences of our choices!  Having made that one pivotal choice, does one never look back?  Or is the option to come clean always there?  The cost of clearing one's conscience can be very dear--especially to those innocents involved.  Good story to use as a springboard for discussion for the moral and ethical issues therein.
5	1379203200	A childless couple gave a lost baby a home with no thoughts about the consequences which eventually destroyed everyone's lives.
5	1379203200	Truth, acceptance, peace, oceans, and history of light houses filled the story.  Looked forward to coming home and reading the story.
5	1379203200	Highly recommend this book to all readers. All ages can gain from its perspective. One of the best books we've readthis year.
5	1379203200	great story line until the very end...could not even guess how it might end.  Great character development.  And this is her first book??  Can't wait for #2!
5	1379203200	"The Light Between Oceans" is a well-written, masterful book which is one part narrative and one part reflective.Ms Stedman writes beautifully.  It is a great pleasure to read her descriptions of the environment in which her tale unfolds.  Her writing draws the reader into the story and provides a rich setting for her narrative.Ms Stedman's development of her characters and presentation of their inner struggles are remarkably true to life.  The description and resolution of these moral dilemmas are realistic but never maudlin."The Light Between Oceans" is a book to be savored as well as to be read.  This is a book which is so enjoyable that one regrets finishing it.  That having been said, this book is a gem as it stands.  More would have been too much.
5	1379203200	I almost don't know what to say that won't give away part of the story.  Suffice to say it is a love story between men and women, parent and child, and the environment.
5	1379203200	Loved this book! I couldn't put it down. I liked the fact that I had no idea how it was going to end
5	1379203200	Loved this story, what love means, love does not understand right from wrong and how it will do anything to protect your loved ones, I highly recommend it to everyone.
4	1379203200	It was a slow read but I was gripped by the characters from the start.  As surprise after surprise happened I was drawn in even more.  It was so beautifully written at one point I didn't know who to root for.  I especially love the beautiful ending.  It made me cry.
4	1379116800	In its simplicity and beauty, the story moves quickly.  Women will be drawn in.  And they will stay.  Why?  Because their heart tug will not turn them loose.
4	1379116800	I liked the historical part of the book and found it interesting to learn about the culture of lighthouse living--how lonely it can be.  I waivered between liking, disliking and feeling sorry for the people.  Was pleased the way it ended.
5	1379116800	Thought provoking, well written, and very readable. Extends across several genres. I recommend the book for anyone who wants a good read.
4	1379116800	This is a period piece that takes place in an Australian port town and an off shore island with a light house following World War I. It involves love, dishonesty and human weaknesses.
5	1379116800	This book was full of suspense and had great substance, as it posed some excellent questions to ponder about our choices and the consequences of those choices.
4	1379116800	good writers make you get inside the skin of their characters and Stedmen did that... was easy to side with both sides
4	1379116800	A story of a mother's true and never ending love even though extremely tough circumstances.  That is exactly how it is and should be.
3	1379116800	Based on previous reviews, I knew the ending wouldn't be happy.  With so many people reading it, however, I figured I'd give it a shot.  The book was well-written and the emotional upheaval deep felt.  But the ending was predictable.  I had hoped for something unexpected, but it was like a movie where you figure out the end halfway through the film.  It was entertaining in parts, but didn't reel me in the way I had hoped.
5	1379116800	I just loved this book.  What a great story.  My sister also read it and we are still talking about it.  I highly recommend this book.
5	1379116800	Having read this book twice, I can honestly say that it held my attention through both readings.  Learning about life as lighthouse keepers was very eye opening to say the least.  Throw in the washed up boat, dead man and crying baby and you have a great mix to build a story.  While the reader may get frustrated with the hopelessness and unfairness of events and characters, the descriptions will put him right there in Australia  where lighthouses are a way of life.
5	1379116800	I loved this book.  It made by heart beat faster and worry along with so many of the characters.  Then, at the end, I cried.
5	1379116800	Whether it is one's love for your spouse or a mother's love for her child, true love has no limits.  A great read and a thought provoking story.
5	1379116800	This book was just discussed the other day by my book group.  I knew it would be an excellent choice and very discussable, and it was.  We also found it so interesting learning about what a lighthouse keeper does and also the isolation.  For a first book it was well written....looking forward to more.
5	1379030400	wonderful story so well told.  throughout makes you think about your life and how you would make decisions at that crisis moment when there is no perfect decision.
3	1379030400	Good story, but too predictable. The ending was very contrived and just tied up in a bow!  It did keep me reading to the end
4	1379030400	I enjoy the historical aspects of keeping the light house. I liked the way the story incorporated the post war era and the emotional stress a survivor works through. This book touched my heart with a strong female character and the love stories of her life.
4	1379030400	I am surprised that I enjoyed this book. It was not my usual fare of horror fiction (Stephen King or Dean Koontz) or military historical fiction (Michael Shaara or Newt Gingrich), I picked it out while awaiting new selection from my favorite authors and was sucked in by the main character's moral dilemma to do the right thing despite knowing he would never get caught committing a crime to please the love of his life. It opened me up to a wider range of fiction.
4	1378944000	The characters were 3 dimensional and the dilemma was nuanced and finely spun. Choices often happen in small steps that have large implications.
4	1378944000	Engaging and emotional.  This is a love story in so many ways, the love of a husband and the love of a mother.
4	1378944000	I really enjoyedThe Light Between Oceans and found it was hard to  put down and that tells me it was riveting.  I stayed up past by bedtime reading until my eyes could not focus anymore.
4	1378944000	Truely a love story. Brought a few tears but loved the story.  Men can love just as deeply as women.
4	1378944000	It was a hard-to-put-down book. Characters believable for the most part, setting unusual and fascinating. Struggle between right and wrong very gripping.
5	1378944000	This book touched every emotion in my heart and mind.  It could have been true and I kept thinking what if this had been me---what would I have done.  It was beautifully written and even the description of scenes on the island were never boring.  I didn't want to miss a word of this book.  Near end I found myself in tears----tears of joy and sadness both at the same time.  This is one I'll read again---even though I know how it ends.  I'm looking forward to more books by this author.
5	1378857600	Awesome book,  I couldn't put it down!!!!!  It seemed a little wordy in the beginning but the information was necessary for the characters and situation.  It was a good read with plenty of interest, romance and suspense.  Very compelling! Buy the book, pour a cup of coffee and enjoy!!!!
2	1378857600	I can't say I was impressed by this book.  The characters frustrated me and their actions just made little sense. Reminded me of an American soap opera in the drama of the characters's actions. And the ending - just a little too pat.  I did, however, enjoy the Australian terms - I learned a whole new vocabulary!
4	1378857600	This has got to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. The storyline keeps your attention throughout the book. I could not put it down. The writing is explicit. Highly reccomend to anyone who enjoys a good historical fiction novel.
5	1378857600	I could not put this book down. I loved the ocean and light imagery throughout the book. Really makes you think about what right and wrong.
4	1378771200	This was a great summer read. It made for some interesting discussions about ethics in our book club. What would you do if you were in their situation?
3	1378771200	Well written, good story, although highly predictable. Characters not completely developed, but interesting enough to go along with the flow
4	1378771200	Very well written story. Nice local connection. Characters were well defined. I felt invested I them and part of the story.
5	1378771200	A beautiful tale of loss and forgiveness.  A book like this comes along once in a blue moon.  Simply stunning.
5	1378771200	This was a good book. The storyline will stay with me for a long time. Although the decisions made by the characters were wrong, they were so understandable. The book did a great job of balancing suspense and empathy and moving very quickly.
5	1378771200	A terrific book.....it will grab your heart, but don't try to finish it at bedtime if you are at all emotional!
4	1378684800	Almost a mythic tale.  I often wondered if the story was too predictable but I was consistently surprised by deep moral or philosophical perspectives.
4	1378684800	Truly enjoyed revisiting Australia through the beautiful writing of Stedman.  I could see the ocean, landscapes and wildlife.  The story of Tom, Isabel and Lucy tugs at the heart and keeps you reading. Luckily I knew some Aussie slang...
5	1378684800	Well written story, great characters that became friends.  Questions about how you would react in similar situations abound - how the characters demonstrate their love and sense of justice.  Highly recommend this book.
4	1378684800	Enjoyed the book very much.  First time I have read this author.  Would recommend this book.  It was a different type of story.
5	1378684800	I must admit that it took me a while to get through the first few pages...I even set it down and read something else before trying again...and so thankful that I did.  Push through the first few and then the world of Tom will open up to you.
4	1378598400	Excellent first novel from 'down under.'  Makes Australia come alive in the writing, vivid often haunting descriptions of lighthouse life, and the dialogue sounds very authentic.  Story is very poignant - easy to identify with protagonist Tom, not so much with his wife, altho she is a very complex character.  Inevitably sad&#8230;  Would make an excellent book club selection and would spark some interesting discussions.
5	1378598400	This is by far one of the best books I have ever read.  I couldn't believe that it was the first novel written by the author.  I couldn't put my kindle down.  I understand this will be made into a movie.  Can't wait to see it!
5	1378598400	wasn't sure at first but once I got started I was hooked.  Really makes you wonder how one would act in the same situation
5	1378598400	The writing was so exquisite and sucked me into the story so completely, I took not one breath as the plot unfolded before me, causing my tears to flow onto each painful word.
5	1378598400	This was our Book Club selection.  It provoked lots of discussion on the decisions one makes and the consequences of that decision.Very well written and engrossing
4	1378598400	I was so totally immersed in the story that I could actually feel their emotions.  Had a hard time putting the book down towards the end.  Life goes on and I can relate to it as I look back also.  It was a tear jerked for me.
4	1378598400	I've always wanted to visit Australia.Stedman took me there...not to the usual tourist places but to a beautiful seacoast place I never imagined but will treasure and revisit often.I like the way Stedman took me into the main characters'heads and hearts.My heart went out to all of the central characters who struggled to find a just solution to very difficult and complicated situation.I found myself urging Tom to do the right thing no matter how difficult that might be and scolding Isabel for being immature, self-centered/selfish yet at the same time feeling sympathy for her.The couple could have avoided heart-break from the get-go if they had put the child's needs ahead of their own butif they had there wouldn't have been this unique and yes, heart-wrenching story.As the story unfolded I wondered how Stedman would wrap it up.She probably chose the most logical conclusion.I was satisfied.Stedman's "The Light Between Oceans" was a wonderful reading experience. I hope she is already working on her second novel.TO REVIEWERS: I HATE IT THAT MANY OF Y'ALL OPT TO RE-WRITE THE BOOK IN YOUR REVIEWS. SO MUCH OF A BOOK'S GUTS ARE SPILLED IN SOME REVIEWS THAT OTHERS NEED NOT BUY/READ THE BOOK. JUST SAYIN'...
4	1378598400	I really liked the writing style and the depth of the character development. Very satisfying storytelling. The ending was too rushed for me and too many issues solved.I wished the author would have left some issues open or spent more time to go into more depth like she did in the beginning and middle of the book.
5	1378598400	Very complex, completely intriguing.  Wonderful reading while asking yourself the question, &#34;What would I do&#34;?  I would recommend this book.
4	1378512000	I would read this book again it was that good. It could be a lazy afternoon read very easly. So enjoy
5	1378512000	I was enthralled with this book.  Certainly the author has found the way to gain the interest of his/her readers by raising their consciousness of the heart wrenching decisions of the characters in this novel.
2	1378512000	I thought this story tedious, am befududdled why so many reviewers lauded it!  It must be me, as this boring read has been on the best seller list for weeks!  If you have insomnia this is better than a sleeping pill!
5	1378512000	My daughter suggested I might like this book and I bought it right away.  Today I finished it.  I sit here with an open heart and tears cascading down my cheeks.  Everyone could gain from reading this well written lovely story.  It is human struggle with passion and understanding for all the characters.  I will think of it often in the days ahead.
4	1378512000	I liked the discriptions and the characters.  I did not think it was an outstanding book but it was good.
4	1378512000	While the story was good, the ending was fairly evident early on.  There isn't any other way it could have ended except by doing the right thing for the child.  The characters were believable, the location was great, and the love of the child very evident.
5	1378512000	This book surprised me. It started a bit slow & took me quite a while to get into the good stuff but wow is it good! If you feel it is starting slowly, give it a chance. It is excellent.
5	1378512000	Beautifully written, almost poetic.  At the same time, a fast read with characters that draw you in emotionally.  Oh the moral dilemma!  A wonderful epic that spans 50 years, just loved it!  My husband reads history books and I love drama or thrillers.  He read it after listening to me raving and also loved it, cried even!  Recommend this to anyone.
5	1378512000	The book started off slowly, but boy did it pick up.  I am still disturbed by it.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.
3	1378425600	Worth reading - 3.5 stars is more like it.  Characters are well formed, but the story wraps up neat and abruptly.
4	1378425600	Kept me interested from the beginning...even though the Island was fictitious, I enjoyed reading about Australia. My heart went out to the couple and their challenges.
5	1378425600	I loved the story, the characters, the place.  it was very tender, thoughtful.  This one goes on my list of highly recommended!
5	1378425600	Heart breaking story. Book was recommended to me by a friend and I am very happy that I read it.
5	1378425600	Poor Lucy; the baby who was rescued.  This is a kind and sensitive story and a real page turner.  Lovely
5	1378425600	I chose the loved it ......  It was such a good story, it kept me into it the entire time i was reading.......
5	1378425600	The descriptions were so well written, I could see Janus. There were some twists and turns I didn't see coming that kept me reading well into the night.
4	1378425600	Great story of the implications of your decisions. How a baby can alter judgment and forever change life. Wonderfully written.
3	1378425600	M.L. Steadman knows human emotion, and writesWell. I was filled with her characters thoughts and quandries . It took me a long time to read this, as it starts out a page turner, then lulls until 3/4 the way through. Then my attention was grabbed again.
5	1378425600	This was a book club choice and I loved it. The author really made you feel like you were a part of the story. I hated for it to end. It's amazing how we all have desires that drive us to the things we do, but in the case of this couple, it was desperation as well as loneliness that drove them. What a sad outcome. I loved the descriptions of Australia, the lighthouse , and the time that it all took place. I hope to read more from ML. Stedman
5	1378425600	A great book.  Really makes you think about right and wrong and choices we all make along the way of life
3	1378339200	This book was ok, I kept reading because there are parts that kept me interested, then I would find a boring part, but over all I wanted to know how it ended so I stuck with it.
5	1378339200	This was a great story, well written and kept me wondering what would happen to Lucy/Grace.I think I wanted it to end differently, but won't say what that was to ruin it for someone else.
5	1378339200	This book held my interest from beginning to end.  I came to care for the people and what was happening to them.
5	1378339200	This book was a story of love and the trails of life. Great story of the lengths that love will take us. IWould recommend  this book, I fell in love with the story and the characters.
4	1378339200	The story was thought provoking and had an unexpected ending. The story explores human nature from all perspectives; allowing one to question, what would I have done?
5	1378339200	Reading a good book can be a bittersweet experience--You may want to slow down and savor every moment, but it's just so good that you can't resist munching away, knowing that it'll be over too soon--and that you'll be left wanting more.If you've read the plot summary and then decided to pass (thinking that the subject matter may not interest you,) that would be a mistake.  This book is written so beautifully that countless times I've read a descriptive analogy and thought "Wow, that was just so brilliant." The author has a wonderful ability to take something relatively mundane, and describe it in such a way that it becomes nearly a visceral experience.We make choices in our lives-- Sometimes we do the wrong thing, but for the right reason.  It's becomes fuzzier when it comes to love and what we will do to soothe a heart that is broken.  Our choices have their consequences, and as they play out in this book, your heart will sympathize with each and every single character..
5	1378339200	I recommend this book for those who want to learn about forgiveness and what an important part of life it is......forgiveness of others' and our own misdoings.
4	1378339200	The plot device is literally &#34;out there&#34;, but the moral dilemma presented by the book is engaging.  Imagining the isolated life of light house keepers made the book different and covered some new ground.
4	1378339200	I think this author is an excellent writer and conveyed her characters very well. It was hard to be sympathetic to the main female character, but that would differ based on the reader. I would recommend anyone who likes this type of heart pulling novels to purchase this novel.
4	1378339200	I was intrigued by the character development of the lighthouse keeper and his perspective of the circumstances and events.  I was a surprised at my own emotions and reactions to this book as the story unfolded!!  I'd like to rate it a 4 1/2, because I more than liked it!(My sister and I both had seen this title and were curious, but she is trying to curb her book purchases. I purchased the low-cost Kindle version, thinking we'd share, but 300 miles distance makes her reluctant to "borrow" my Kindle - she may be worried she'd like it!  This is a title I wouldn't mind having in book form, too!)
3	1378339200	A predictable story, and I did not find it very interesting or satisfying.  I not would not recommend this book.
5	1378252800	This story of a bygone era is wonderfully told and deeply touches your heart. The little details add so much depth to the characters - I loved it!
3	1378252800	... you'll love this read.  Some beautiful metaphors, some overwrought ones.  Hoped to learn more about Australia and less about the drama of fictional characters.  Uninspiring.
5	1378252800	When I first read the title, I wasn't sure what I could expect. Wow what a great book, I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to everyone you won't be disappointed.
4	1378252800	Compelling story.. Does doing something &#34;right&#34; sometimes mean you are doing something  &#34;wrong&#34;?The  power of the truth and love of a child.
4	1378252800	Spell binding...and heart wrenching.  Well done !  Well woven.  This is a great book for book club discussion.  A book about moral values.
3	1378252800	This was a choice by our book club.I never quite finished it because it just didn't hold my interest in the middle of the book. Those who did finish it said it was interesting, but most of the characters were unlikeable.
5	1378252800	This book will resonate with all who live by the ocean and those who wish they did.  Beautifully crafted, warm and wonderful, the story will touch your heart strings and above all show the power of love and forgiveness.  Truly a book that will stay with you for a long time.  It is best described as a winner and one to definitely read.
4	1378252800	It was fascinating and disturbing. I never realized all that was involved in being a lighthouse keeper.It has to be lonely for a young woman to live out there without friends and medical help!
5	1378252800	It has great character development. I loved the period when the story took place. It was very realistic with regard to grief, loss and depression.
5	1378252800	An enthralling tale of love, loss, hope, and forgiveness.  I couldn't put it down.  The author captures the flaws and strengths of each character splendidly, bringing them to life and pulling you in.
5	1378252800	A lovely read recommended by a friend whose whose taste in novels doesn't always jibe with mine. Enjoyed learning Australian flora & fauna.  Hard to believe it is Ms Stedman's first, it's crafted so well.
5	1378252800	This book will make you cry at the end.  Although slow at first it totally makes you care about the characters and one could see this made into a movie.
5	1378166400	A must read, fiction at its best.  This is a compelling story of a man, his wife, a lost child  and a terrible situation.
5	1378166400	This first novel of M. L. Stedman is an emotionally charged blend of intricate plot, well-developed characters, and a memorable setting. I haven't had such a good read in a long time! I hope it is destined to become a movie.
2	1378166400	The book was a fine read, but I found the range of emotions unrealistically narrow. It was not worth my time.
3	1378166400	I liked the descriptions of the light and Janus rock especially. Character development seemed to go awry when circumstances dictated. Not sure they were believable, but it filled my need for a &#34;good light read.&#34;
5	1378166400	The last thing I should've been doing today was reading, but I just couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the message of "forgiveness" toward the end of the book.  Definitely an emotional read...shed a few tears hear and there.  I actually rated it a 4.5.  I had a tough time with Isabelle's selfish, immature behavior.  I tried to sympathize with some of her battles, but it was difficult at times because of her unlikable character.  I loved the setting!  I felt as if I drifted away to the lighthouse on Janus Island.  And could hear the waves crashing against the rocks!  Overall, a great read and I would definitely recommend it!
5	1378166400	There are many layers to this story and how various people deal with handling the truth (or not).  Great read -- hard to put down.
4	1378080000	This was an excellent novel.  First time writer Stedman knows how to tell a story and keep the reader interested.
5	1378080000	I was surprised by how much a loved this story.  I don't usually enjoy sad stories but there was just enough kindness, hope and love to keep me hanging on.  It was a well written, beautiful story.
5	1378080000	tHE STORY ABOUT THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER AND HIS FAMILY WILL STAY WITH ME FOR A LONG TIME. i HAVE ALREADY RECOMMENDED IT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY
4	1378080000	What a great story!!  The character development was wonderfully done.  I almost felt like I was back in those small Aussie towns from long ago
5	1378080000	The desire to procreate is so basic and intense to all, or at least most, human beings that I couldn't help but be caught up in the very real dilemma faced by the light keeper and his wife. Sorrow, joy, contentment and drama all mixed in heart-wrenching ways as this story developed.  Doing the right thing is rarely easy and can be horrifically difficult at times as demonstrated in this deeply-moving story. Loved it!!
4	1378080000	This is very well written story about a lighthouse keeper.  I understand it is this author's first book. She is from Australia and the plot takes place there. I highly recommend it.
3	1378080000	Well written and moving, but sad, too sad.  Not that I needed a happy ending but i felt sad for everyone in the story.
4	1378080000	The Light Between Oceans was generally an easy read.  I liked it, but can't say that I loved it.  The characters seemed very real and I could sympathize with each one's different situation.  I really enjoyed the way the story ended.
5	1377993600	I'm in tears as I write my review soon after finishing  this story. Characters were so real to my mind and heart.  Thanks for sharing this with so rich a full-blown  set of feelings .  Carolyn from California.
5	1377993600	I really did not know how to feel during this book. I loved reading it because it always made me think about what I would have done. As angry as I got at Isabel or Tom. I still loved their characters and wanted the very best for them. Loved the ending. Even though it's sad it really brought closure to the book. Definitely recommend this one.
5	1377993600	This was a joyful and painful story to read. The author draws you into their life on the island completely. I felt the emotions of the Sherbournes and totally understood the choices they made. I look forward to reading the next novel by this author.
4	1377993600	Interesting story of how a person can be both well-meaning and selfish, both rational and foolish, all at the same time.  Lovely story well told, reminding us of the power of love, eve misguided love, and the resiliency of children.
5	1377993600	This novel had me gripped from the first page.  I enjoyed the historical context, and the moral dilemma that the couple find themselves in (through their own choices).  One of the best books I read this summer.
5	1377907200	Excellent read - hard to put book down to do chores.  Aothor keeps your interest - a different type of plot.
5	1377907200	This book is a great first book by this author.  It is very thought provoking and causes a lot of soul searching.  I have recommended it to our book club and it is the first book for this next seaon of reading.  I am looking forward to the discussion.
5	1377907200	This book is well written and very thought provoking. Stedman created a very interesting plot with lots of twists and turns and made the reader examine what they would do in a similar situation.  I found myself siding w/Isabel and then with Tom and then feeling badly for the family that lost the baby.  I am not usually one to read a book in a short period of time, but I found I just couldn't put it down!I highly recommend it and think it would provide a lively discussion at a book club!
5	1377907200	I really enjoyed this book!  I couldn't put it down!!  I had to find out what happened and the book kept me guessing.
5	1377907200	The book kept my attention, and I did not want to put it down.  The plot was very interesting in light of the recent battle over adoption.
4	1377907200	I enjoyed it. The story was easy to follow, but still interesting. a good choice for e-books. Liked the characters
5	1377907200	It Kept my interest the entire book.  Got emotional at the end - which means it was a good read.
5	1377907200	This novel was set in an unfamiliar land and time, but it captured my imagination. I enjoyed it, especially the satisfying ending.
5	1377820800	I've recommended this book twice and bought it as a gift once since I've finished reading it. It would be hard to not have empathy for all three of the main characters.
5	1377820800	Our bookclub really enjoyed this whirlwind story of love and commitment and passion. It truly is a must read. I put it on my books to read agin.
4	1377820800	I enjoyed reading about the lighthouse on Janus.  The book ended the right way.  We can't have every book end in a fairy tale world.  It captured the feelings of human nature at its worse and it's best.
5	1377820800	Very good story, Characterization, and hard to put down.  Definitely a good, different, and easy read! Would recommend to others.
5	1377820800	I never wanted this book to end. I was in mourning when I finished it. She'd quite a few tears.
4	1377820800	This book makes you feel so many different emotions onmany different levels. This story stayed with me for days. Highly recomend
5	1377820800	This was a lovely story. Moral dilemas solved with moral values. Solutions were not predictible, but painfully satisfying. The writing was often poetic.
5	1377820800	A beautifully told tale of the  human condition . It is about love war loss honor and guilt resulting in the loss of a rescued infant . And her excruciatingly painful return after 4 years to her widowed  and still grieving mother  who lost her baby and now has has to deal with  a distraught child ripped from the arms of the only parents she had known and with whom she had lived on an isolated island where her second father was the keeper of the light house between two oceans
5	1377820800	I have recommended this book to several of my friends.  It tugged at your heart at so many levels.  Every person in the story was seen in a vantage point that gave insight into their feelings and behaviors.  It was not just a one sided perspective to a very difficult situation.  Excellent.
5	1377734400	Really a good read.  Brings you into the story and makes you feel their frustrations and joy.  Really loved it.
5	1377734400	Couldn't put it down.  What a page turner.  Liked learning about old lighthouses and the hard life of the light keeper.
4	1377734400	A lovely, well written novel that kept my attention even as I traveled and had to set it down many times. The author did a splendid job. Hope we see much more from this author.
4	1377734400	&#34;You only have to forgive once. To resent, you have to do it all day, every day. You have  to keep remembering all the bad things&#34;
2	1377734400	The story arc starts out beautiful and lyrical.  I won't call it literary only because I can't keep turning the pages on most books that people call literary novels.  This book starts perfectly.  It builds beautifully.  It comes to an extraordinary denoument.  Then it fizzles.  The reader is left with half the pages yet to turn and a story that is plain out of gas.  By that time, one has too much invested in the characters not to find out what happens.  However, turning the last hundred pages is a real burden and I skimmed them at best.A very disappointing read.
5	1377734400	MAKES YOU QUESTION YOUR BELIEFS AND MORALS.  YOU STOOP READING AND SAY WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE IN THEIR PLACE.  I WOULD AND HAVE RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK TO SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS.
4	1377734400	Fascinating reading both for the time period and the personalities of the characters.. the change in the characters ways of thinking was interesting.. anyone who enjoys a time period novel should enjoy this book
4	1377734400	A good read with many twists and turns in the plot.  Our book club enjoyed lively discussions about this book.
4	1377734400	Can't say I loved it but it is well written.  A bit slow and repetitive at times but overall a worthwhile read. Enjoyed the setting  haven't read anything about rural Australia before.
2	1377734400	I found this novel unbelievably sad on so many levels!  Well written, however too sad.  We real it for our book club and there is much to discuss.
4	1377734400	I love lighthouses and this book tells the tale of a lighthouse keeper and his wife and the trials and tribulations of  living alone an island and the upkeep that is needed to keep the lighthouse burning.  There life takes a turn when a small boat washes ashore with a dead man and a crying baby.A wonderful, heart retching read.
5	1377734400	This was a great story with some surprises. It is kind of a tear jerker. Takes place off the coast of Australia.
4	1377734400	Many teachable, philosophical moments.  Wonderful symbolism. Would have preferred a more enriched vocabulary. Realistic ending. sometimes heart wrenching; sometimes joyful; always realistic.
2	1377734400	Too much like a &#34;beach book&#34;.  writing poor and story predictable. The characters were not very complex and were almost cartoonish as people.
5	1377734400	This book is wonderful.  It holds your attention so you don't want to put it down.  So many surprises and unpredictable.A GOOD read.
5	1377734400	I rarely get to read and I asked a friend to recommend a book for my vacation. This was the book she recommended and it was perfect. It reads easily and is such a great story with great personal struggles. You will need a tissue!!
5	1377648000	Simply delightful. The writing is so clear and poignant and powerful!  I would suggest this to anyone!  Read it now!
4	1377648000	I liked this book very much.  But it shows you that you have to make the right ethical decisions in life or may suffer the consequences.  It is so sad that a woman who cannot have children had so few alternatives.  Especially since she was such a good mother.
5	1377648000	I loved this book and cried at the end.  I am sure the writer will write many more. I couldn't, put it down!
5	1377648000	The delicate detailed way in which the book was written is beautiful. The story is profound-one of my favorite novels now of all time.
4	1377648000	Very good but sad story which you knew from about one-fourth into the book would not end well.  But that is why you want to devour this book quick-like.  Very descriptive writer, insightful descriptions of feelings of the characters, their lives and the things that happened to them before the story starts all blends well. Basically, this book has a good plot that is carried out well throughout the entire story.  Confirms the thought that the human spirit will prevail even when things go haywire.  I will recommend this book to avid readers like myself simply for the reason that YES it was sad but the end was pretty sufficient unlike when you sometimes don't get the end.  This story I totally got and could actually picture these things happening to the characters.
4	1377648000	Loved reading the moralstruggle set forth in this novel. Thought provoking read about infertility and loss of a child and the desire to love a child of your own.
5	1377648000	This was the most well written book I've read in a long time.  The storyline was incredibly thought-provoking regarding the concepts of right and wrong, love, and fate and choice. Loved it!
5	1377648000	This book pulls you in immediately as you meet each character.  There is romance, historical facts, information on life manning the lighthouse, heart wrenching emotion, ethical dilemmas that pull and tug, and complete engagement in the lives and fortunes of the main characters.  It is one of those stories that make you dread coming to an end yet eager to see the resolution.  The ending is not one of those hastily and neatly wrapped up with a sparkley bow kind of ending but one that is completely satisfying because of its honesty.
2	1377648000	Emotional ending - brought tears to my eyes.  But not a page turner in the traditional sense... A depressing, yet tender, character study.
4	1377561600	While I don't think this author is a particularly good writer, I did think he did an excellent job in getting the reader to feel the emotions of each character. It was a good storyline that will make you question what your own choices would be in these circumstances. Overall a good read.
5	1377561600	I almost never read a book quickly, and certainly not in 3 days.  I did with this one!  I stayed up late at night reading - not at all like me.  This book pulled my heart-strings.
4	1377561600	Marvelous tale of the agony and joy wrought by what life brings us as we wrap these events with our choices. Definitely a do not miss.
3	1377561600	This book was beautifully written, beautiful and gut wrenching all at once&#8230;the love of a parent is immense and endless.
5	1377561600	How do we keep reading a novel that we know will destroy the souls of so many of the characters?  How are we able to empathize with so many of the characters? My heart broke for both the women and the men in this novel. One of the best novels I have read in many years.
4	1377561600	a nice story of life on a very sparse land, but at times far fetched&#8230;&#8230;.the birth mother the same as the woman met years before on a ship ?
5	1377475200	Amazing book from start to finish. So well written you'd thinking you were standing next to the characters watching through their eyes the story unfold.
4	1377475200	I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this book. I ended up really getting hooked and not wanting the story to end.  The characters were well developed and the story is a total conundrum, in the end you don't know how it could possibly turn out well for anyone. It was a very good read.
3	1377475200	I feel like I keep getting tricked by the Amazon rating of these kinds of "Operah's Book Club" selected books (I realize that this isn't actually PART of her book club list, but you know what I mean).  It seems like there's a lot of Bandwagon bias on here...  I did think this book was good, but not 4.5 stars good.The story unraveled pretty slowly, and as much as I can intelligently appreciate the eloquent descriptions of the Janus Rock and the landscape that the author paints, I just didn't actually ENJOY reading so much of it.  I felt slightly bored through most of the book.  And the other parts were sweet, but pretty unrealistic.  No matter how much Tom, as such an upstanding moral man, loved his wife, there would have been a breaking point way before the climax where he caved and no longer just went along with the kidnapping.I was more excited to just have the book end, then to actually READ the ending.  I didn't really feel the pain that I should have felt for Isabel through her miscarriages, and I never really believed that their love for each other was genuine.I definitely enjoyed this book enough that I'm not upset I read it, but probably had I not seen the 4.5 star rating, I probably would have liked it more than the expectation that was set.
5	1377388800	I couldn't put it down! Well written and very enjoyable from beginning to end!!  This is a book I would recommend to all my friends!!
4	1377388800	I enjoyed this book - it's not so predictable and the story draws you in.  It was a little slow at first, but I was rewarded for sticking with it.
5	1377388800	This was a beautifully written, heart-wrenching story that captivates the reader throughout the book. I could not put it down!
4	1377388800	I was slow getting into this book but it was a great story with right and wrong tugging at you constantly.
5	1377388800	this was one of my favorite books this summer - in fact, i recommended it for our book club innaples, florida.very well written.
4	1377388800	A good read!! Hooked right away and read in a day. Love a quiet Sunday with a great book.  Would recommend!
4	1377388800	I enjoyed this book, learned about the lighthouse keepers way of life.  It had some surprise twists to the story.
5	1377388800	One of my favorite reads in a couple of years. Really enjoyed it.The story and the writing  were great.
3	1377388800	this was for a book club meeting in Incline Village (Lake Tahoe, Nevada)  it did provoke a discussion - especially with the recent Court ruling to return a four year old to the adoptive parents - we discussed the conflict Tom had but could not agree with his actions - for a first novel - we thought she was promising -
5	1377388800	I chose this rating because having lost a child I could totally relate to the characters in this novel. I have never shed so many tears with the feeling that others have experienced the same.  M.L. Steadman did a wonderful job of making the reader become involved with the decisions that were being made in their story. I would recommend this novel to anyone who has loved.  It renews those deep feelings again. I encourage M.L. Steadman to write more novels!
4	1377388800	I really enjoyed this book. It was one of those books that I slowed up reading towards the end because I did not want the book to end, although I really wanted to find out the ending. I truly good read!
5	1377388800	The book was well written and hooked me from the start.  If you have ever been in a car and played the game moral dilemma this book will hit home.  It really does make you think about what you would do if you were in each of their shoes. The writing really painted a picture of what it was like to live on a lone Island with only a lighthouse.  The end of the book left me in tears.....Definitely recommend this one.  I am in a book club and this book will bring lots of questions and discussions.
5	1377388800	Could not put book down.. fast read..excellent story line.. characters tug at your heart..tears at the end..highly recommend this book..
4	1377302400	This is a wonderful book by this new author.  I am always looking for a good clean read for book club an I've found my pick for next month.
5	1377302400	I give this both thumbs up because the story line is so real and carried through from start to finish that I forgot it was fiction and not real.  I grew up in lighthouse country but such isolated locations and I can just imagine how this situation would occur. This is truly a should read and then read again in the future
2	1377302400	While this book has interesting local color about Australia, light house maintenance, and post World War I angst, unless you are reading to ruin your day, I would seriously pass. There are passages of writing that I found memorable or intriguing and there is  a theme recurring throughout of the wreckage that lying inflicts on generations. But sinking deeper and deeper into the mess with characters that were first presented sympathetically is only for the one who enjoys watching people fail. The book and its multiple characters are not developed strongly enough to include all the bad events. The modest length can't support the &#34;one bad day after another&#34; story. A story like this is so painful, that only literary giants should try to bring a reader along.
3	1377302400	This was a decent read, but I found the ending left a lot to be desired. The author developed a good story then it seemed like she didn't know how finish it.
5	1377302400	Reads like poetry or an exquisite paintingBeautifully written in creating imagery & philosophy. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Amazing for a first novel!
5	1377302400	This Australian story,  a throwback to an early 20th century family style of novel, poses the question whether great loss and loneliness justifiy a knowing appropriation of someone else's young child. Life on the lighthouse island is wonderfully rendered. The author sustains the narrative tension with a surprising denouement.
4	1377216000	I really enjoyed this different book. The emotions can be felt in various situations. Kept my interest for the entire book.
5	1377216000	A story of love, of question, of moral dilemma. Much to think and talk about. A great book club find
5	1377216000	Such a beautiful story about life and love  and so interesting how each life has such an impact on others.
5	1377216000	As a first time author, Stedman display a masterful approach to plot design, character development, and tackling of moral dilemma.  In fact the moral dilemma aspect continues to build weaving a plot akin to a spider web of decisions and choices entangling more that merely the protagonist.  No one would guess this is Stedman's first novel.  I highly recommend it on many levels.  It is thought provoking, astute, superbly written and holds the reader's attention as well as challenging the reader's convictions.  My monthly reading group read then analyzed and discussed the implications.  Everyone agreed -- best read in a long while.
3	1377216000	In light of the fact that the outcome had become fairly obvious I found the last part of the book to be extremely tedious.
5	1377216000	I thought that this book had great characters and wonderful information about lighthouses.  I enjoyed the characters and the setting.
3	1377216000	We read the story for our book club and for that reason it was okay because it made for an interesting discussion but the story itself was sad and I would like to hope unrealistic.
5	1377216000	This was one of the best books I have read in years.  The plot held together throughout, I could empathize with all the characters, and there were interesting twists at the end.  read it!  You will love it!
5	1377216000	A wonderful book.  Really explores the bond created between a child and parents, be it biological or solely nurturing parents.
1	1377216000	I don't like leaving things unfinished so a book has to be pretty bad for me to stop before it ends but this one I just couldn't bear reading anymore. It's slow and tedious. And the characters are insincere. I strongly recommend against it.
5	1377216000	Evocative and moving. I have to look up the friend who recommended this book to me and thank her. Reading it was time well spent.
4	1377216000	I liked how the author made you feel empathy for both sides of the story, wondering what indeed would be best for the child.  I did like how the grown daughter found her father in the end, but you had to make up your own mind how close they would become.
5	1377216000	Great book! It is a little slow to start but this book had me in tears! Such a fantastic read.
4	1377216000	Quite original plot but very believable. The author did an excellent job for her first book. Great character buildup. Personally (and as a former editor) I was a bit disappointed in what I considered a somewhat abrupt ending. (Perhaps I am being too demanding.) However, it's a great read and I would highly recommend it.
1	1377216000	I know it's supposed to be about a touching, gut-wrenching situation but i couldn't get past the maudlin, overwrought writing and cardboard characters, impossible to care about.
5	1377129600	With 3,700 reviews posted it will be nearly impossible for me to add much (if anything) to the discussion but yet I feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus of people who loved this novel.  I won't go into the plot or storyline and would caution anyone looking at the reviews to be very careful about reading too much and having it spoil the reading experience.I had heard so much about this book and from such a wide spectrum of people that I added to my book group's reading list and we selected it for August.  While not everyone loved it as much as I did, it generated more in-depth discussion than many books we have previously read and that, to me, is the sign of a good book.I think it will appeal to the following audiences:  people who love historical fiction, a strong sense of place, great writing, and being able to follow how individual choices made along the way can add up to a huge choice that one may not have made if the conclusion were evident from the beginning.  I think the book will not appeal to people who like a lot of action and movement, who are looking purely for escapism reading with an uplifting story (and nothing wrong with that, it just isn't this book), or who have a difficult time visualizing walking in someone else's shoes and see the world very black and white.This isn't my favorite book of all time, but I enjoyed it quite a bit and think the writing is stellar.  As the storyline slowly unfolded, I could have been impatient to see what was coming next but the author did such a masterful job that I slowly walked the journey with the characters and felt their anguish and pain right along with them.
4	1377129600	A real page turner, it had me guessing what was coming next,and I was almost always surprised! I look forward  to discussing this with my book club!
5	1377129600	I loved this book!! I could not put this book down !!  I cannot wait for more novels from Ms. Stedman.
5	1377129600	I loved this book. One reads it with a sense of hope for all the characters, that they may see the bigger picture. They are human after all - but the story is still lovable. I was very happy with the ending.
4	1377129600	Intriguing issues presented by the author.  Book is well written and paced so that you are always asking yourself &#34;what would I do?&#34;
3	1377129600	way too long.  No empathy for the characters--well maybe the husband Hard to come up with nine words about it.
5	1377129600	What a refreshing break, reading a great book with very little profanity and no intimate sexual details.  I Highly recommend.
5	1377129600	A touching story involving a difficult situation, handled with compassion and understanding.  It kept my attention until the very end.
5	1377129600	Tragic and heartwarming!  What would I have done in their situation?  This book really makes you take a second look at how life can change in a heartbeat.  I can't help wanting that, which never should have been...
5	1377129600	This book reminded me of another favorite; Amagansett by Mark Mills. Wonderful well developed characters who experience the full gamut of human emotion. One couples trajedy becomes another's joy, then the tables turn again and again.
5	1377129600	It is a real page turner. The story is about an apparently orphan child. At some point it becomes obvious that this is not the case. I enjoyed the first three quarters of the book, but (without giving anything away) the ending was contrived. Following Persepherone's myth everyone loses here. But the last couple of pages plays out like a bad TV show. I feel the reader gets cheated. Still I would recommend The Light Between Oceans despite the ending.
5	1377129600	This book was slow to start. After the third chapter, I couldn't put it down. A novel based on a mother's love for her child.
4	1377129600	This is a very interesting story. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to read it. There is a enormous amount of detail in this book which is all quite fascinating but definitely slowed my reading speed. So much pain that was endured by most every character and also periods of great joy. This is a book that I won't be forgetting anytime soon. Although it was long it was also a fascinating journey.
4	1377043200	I found it was something that could be done by someone who wanted a child very much. I liked the description of the living conditions and could almost hear the ocean.  A nice novel to read.
5	1377043200	Insite on a lonely life. Makes you look at decisions and how they can backfire and affect many lives. Wonderful book.
4	1377043200	It started slow and then picked up quickly!! I haven't cried for a book before but this tugged my &#34;mommy&#34; heart strings for certain. An easy read.
4	1377043200	I began reading this novel as I love lighthouses and novels about them I was pleasantly surprised by the richness of the author's prose. As it takes place in Australia the locales are not familiar, but that ads to the intriguing aspects of this book. Don't miss it.
5	1377043200	This is one of the most profound books I have ever read. It is sad and hopeful and is a call to understanding wisdom. The characters evolve as their lives unfold. This book is about the mistakes we make and the imperfection of people.  It speaks to how and who we are and what we become.
4	1377043200	A little bit of a melodrama, but with enough serious topics to give it some weight.  I especially liked the geography of this novel.
5	1377043200	I fell in love for all the characters. A real story to make you think  what if you were  one of them. What would you do ???????
5	1377043200	Amazing book. Well written, I couldn't put it down. A story with morals, questions and more to think about, read it for diff err points of view
2	1377043200	A much younger woman recommended this book, saying that it was the best book she ever read.  I did not like it at all.  The protagonists continually made decisions that could in no way be justified making them very unsympathetic.  They hurt themselves and everyone else by their choices.  I found nothing redeeming in it at all.  Skip this one.
5	1377043200	Stedman's debut was well worth the read. You could identify with all the characters. Great storyteller!  Can't wait for her next book.
4	1376956800	The descriptive writing in this book is amazing.  There are passages that I marked to read over and over.  The dialogue is not as satisfying.  The story itself beings up some difficult issues, and evokes some strong emotions.  It will make for a good discussion, maybe an emotional one for a book club full of mothers.
5	1376956800	Read the book for our book club book this month and had the review today.  Everyone loved the book and thought the author's writing was exceptional!
4	1376956800	This was our last months book club choice. What a discussion we had! Well written, great characters, and what a choice to have to make. Did they do the right thing? What would you have done? You can feel and understand the emotions of both sides in this story. Rather sad out come, I won't say more. Read it, you will enjoy.
5	1376956800	This was a sweet love story at the beginning but changed to a tragedy about half way through.  By then the reader cares about the characters and wants them to resolve the problem so they can go on with their lives.  However, there really isn't a villain in the story ~ it wasn't easy to see how things could work out for the best for everyone when they were at opposite sides of the problem.
5	1376956800	Extremely moving, often sad, very compelling story.Very nice writing throughout.Look forward to the next novel from this mew author.
5	1376956800	Loved the descriptions of life on Janus and the insights into the lives of Tom and Isobel.. Tears came easily at the end.....great storyi
5	1376956800	Interesting character development which brings many twists and turns to the story.  Many emotional moments while reading this book.  Leaves you with questions about what is right and wrong and the paths that the characters take.  Very good read and we had a great discussion with our book club group.
5	1376956800	I could not put it down. A real study of human morals and the emotions of the heart. Complex, riveting a great read.Brendan Roberts
5	1376956800	So many life lessons are in this book. I fell in love with Isabel,Tom and Lucy instantly. Such a fairy tale life in a remote part of the world, until suddenly life changed. What seems possible in a fairy tale world is not possible in the real world. We have to be accountable and take responsibility for our misgivings eventually. Life is good, and we all have choices as to wether it is good or not. Loved, loved and love this gut wrenching story. I will read this book again. I wish I had the right words to express how dear this book is to me.
5	1376956800	This was very informative about the lighthouse & how much work it entailed.  The characters became so real as you followed them through their lives, the ups & downs.  I absolutely loved this book and was sorry to see it end.  I would rate this book as a 20 instead of a 5...excellent.
4	1376956800	I really enjoyed this book. The setting was fascinating and the characters complex and intriguing.  You are reminded that situations are seldom black and white rather, shades of grey.
4	1376956800	Thought this had a very good  story line, kept my interest all the way through the book.  Would recommend it highly.
4	1376956800	Heartbreak, desperation, love,forgiveness, and sacrifice  all make a great story. I do wish the pace had been a bit faster but over all a good read. Never thought about the running of a lighthouse  before.
4	1376956800	Very good. The author made me angry at the character so I realized I was really pulled in. Can't wait for new book
5	1376870400	This was a book chosen by our book club and it may start out a little slow, but it definitely gets better.  I was captivated by the characters, story line, and surprising twists in this novel.  The themes of forgiveness and motherhood are especially captivating.  I would highly recommend this book and it's a quick read!
5	1376870400	What a charming sweet book that was easy to read and the characters were so likeable and you were rooting for them the entire time.
5	1376870400	This was a good read.A bit out of my usual, but well worth reading.It sucks you in from the first page.
3	1376870400	It was a somewhat interesting story, but took much too long to wind down. Tedious reading toward the end.  Would recommend, but not vigorously.
5	1376870400	Despite the fact that most of the characters have flaws, I found myself wanting the best for all of them. Unfortunately, for each character to have what he or she wants, others must suffer a high price. The landscape of the lighthouse and all of Australia mentioned brings the setting to life. The book doesn't conclude in a fanciful manner - it feels true to reality and how the characters would respond.
4	1376870400	I am surprised you had this for me to comment on. I am only half way through, and usually receive this when I finish the book. So far the book. is interesting and the characters are interesting.
5	1376870400	I had trouble putting it down, it was so good.Great story, appeals to all mothers because we all love our children so much.
5	1376784000	Although sad, a great love story, that reflects life's imperfections.  A lot of depth to the writing, It was hard to put down!
3	1376784000	I felt she should have gone to a doctor after the first or second still birth.  It was wrong to keep the baby or at least find outwhy  Grace was in the boat and who she was.
3	1376784000	It was an OK book to read slow at times picked up at the end we read this for our book club we had lots to talk about
5	1376784000	I loved this book. It is written in short bursts of 'stories' that at times had me laughing out loud or gasping with incredulousness! A remarkable story of resilience - truly amazing. Definitely read it.
4	1376784000	Good read, a little sad at times and it includes the lines between who is right and who is wrong
4	1376784000	I enjoyed reading this book,  but wish it had ended differently!  I usually don't read novels - prefer true stories.
5	1376784000	Story was very suspenseful and I really liked thecharacters.  It was very engrossing.  I would highlyrecommend it to all readers.
5	1376784000	Wow!What a powerful story. Right, wrong,good ,bad it has it all. The emotions drive people. Love never dies.I couldn't put it down.
5	1376784000	Wow. Very thought provoking story that illustrates things are not always what they seem and that doing the right thing can seem very wrong. Halfway through I couldn't put the book down.
5	1376784000	For first time Author M.L. Steadman I say &#34;Well Done!&#34;.  It's been a while since I've read such a great story.  This book was a recommendation from my Mom, who was recommended to read by my Aunt.  I, in turn, have recommended it to a friend.  While I felt it was a little slow starting off, I stayed with it and was glad I did.  The character development was excellent.  I loved, wept, hoped and struggled right along with them.  She is a wonderfully descriptive writer.  A true talent!
5	1376784000	Beware, you're about to enter a world filled with sorrow. How do good people go wrong and then deal with the consequences? Perhaps it'd be best to only read the first 1/3, where you can be romanced by the author's beautiful prose and hope for the protagonists. But by then, it's too late. You're hooked, turning pages toward the ruins. It's a terrible story in a lovely book, but it's well worth the trip.
1	1376784000	A good book about relationships, character, love and forgiveness! It shows how important life in a community of people who know you is!
5	1376784000	One of the best written books I've encountered.  Had to go back a few times to previous passages to get the full impact.  A real page turner!  I hope she writes another book soon!
5	1376697600	Wow!  What an example of deep abiding love and the choices one makes to those you love.  An essay on forgiveness and redemption.  I loved this book, I could not put it down.
5	1376697600	So different from anything I have ever read.  Loved everything even though I shed some tears. Looking forward to more from this author.
3	1376697600	This was a good book group selection.  We had an interesting discussion about some of the topics raised in the book.
5	1376697600	A very human story that makes the reader puzzle about how they would handle the problem involved.A different kind of life but with very emotional decisions to make  I felt empathy for the leading characters and also the other woman involved. It really made me think  A great read fully engaging. The characters and their problem a different angle to the usual mystery.
4	1376697600	I liked this book and the character development.  It raised some very good moral questions and was thought-provoking.  At times it did bog down a bit, but overall, a good read.
5	1376697600	Excellent writing. Compelling story. One of the best books I've read. The author makes the south coast of Australia come alive.
5	1376697600	I found the book fascinating.  It gave me such compassion for both families.  It helps us understand there is always another view point and teaches us not to make quick judgements.  Plus I knew little regarding Australia & light houses.
4	1376697600	A book club read. I am about half way thru and so far am enjoying the book. Fairly light reading.
5	1376697600	One of the most riveting stories I've read in a very long time.  I highly recommend The Light Between Oceans
5	1376697600	This book is an excellent read.  I enjoyed the setting and family career--lighthouse keeper's station.  It provided a good look atdifficulties and challenges of a Lightkeeper life, as well as, challenges of maintaining a marriage and family life ina desolute situation.  Alternately a happy and sad book. Fascinating study in human emotions and complicationsinvolved with our decision making.  It is a fast read and hard to put down!
4	1376697600	It has a slow start but then it gets intricate and Keeps your interest. Has you questioning the power of love vs right/wrong???
4	1376697600	really enjoyed to writing.  very well written.  The emotions although very sad was very complete and defined..  Cant imagine that much love would still exist.
3	1376611200	I thought it was a good plot with well rounded characters.  A little predictable, but still an enjoyable read. Get the book from the library.
5	1376611200	The book was a very fast read, well written and made me both love and feel sorry for almost all the characters.  I could understand everyone's viewpoint; even though in my heart of hearts I knew how wrong Izzy and her husband were, and how their choices hurt so many people.
4	1376611200	This story seemed like it was a simple story, at first, but then the psychological twists and turns got started and the connections to the past were made. It's a story about a man, a woman, a child, and a lighthouse, and all the other people who are affected by the decisions made by the first two. I can't write too much about this without giving it away, so if you like stories that happen around a war (which is in the edges of it), you might enjoy this one.
5	1376611200	When I laid it down, I could not wait to get back to it. I look forward to another Stedman novel.
2	1376611200	Not a bad first effort by ML Stedman, a West Australian ex-pat lawyer living in England. You will be drawn in by the moral dilemma facing the main characters Isabel and her light keeper hubby. Where it lacks is characterization and some lack of coherence and emotional pandering.The plot without spoilers, a WWI vet turned light house keeper marries a mainlander youngster, sweeps her off her feet and whisks her away to the island of Janus. After honeymoon bliss with only a naming of the islands' features that for some odd reason the light house keeper finds oddly disdainful, adversity creeps in. After a certain number of miscarriages, desperation creeps in. Then a dead Dad washes up on shore with a very much alive baby daughter. What does the preciously happy couple do? Well that dilemma sets up the plot for the rest of the book.Where I found the book lacking is that the situations and characters were a little too one-dimensional. The first of their marriage too picture perfect happy. He characters them seemed to act out of character for what follows.The good part--it's a hell of a scenario that will at least keep you reading to the end. Something about the book reminded me of The Scarlet Letter but written by Nicolas Sparks instead of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The mainland town citizenry of Partaguese play a similar role of The Scarlet Letter's townsfolks. Both deal with a remote society and how they deal with a moral dilemma in their midst. That part is well and good. What is not, is that by the end the characters have isolated themselves in emotional dregs only to be resurrected again but acting in all sorts of ways that don't seem to be true to who you thought they were.Read this if you are in a book club and its the pick. Read this if you want to be drawn in by the emotions of characters facing tough choices serves up by parenthood and love.  But wait till Stedman is a few books in and has hones the craft of writing if you are looking for a really good and sublime read. By her third book or so, I'll bet she'll be there. --MMW
4	1376611200	I liked the story and loved the ethical issues.  It made for a great book group conversation.  It's amazing that it's a first novel.
4	1376611200	The small description of the plot of this book was intriguing and so I decided to get it. The main character, Tom is so serious and introspective that I wasn't sure if I could warm up to him. However, when he meets Isabel you start to see a dimension to him that really catches your interest. Their life together and the choices they make kept me reading. I was particularly interested in the dynamic between Tom and Isabel and the other characters, as the author wove them together very believably. I especially liked the way the author tied up the issues at the end of the book, not neat and tidy but realistically. I would recommend this book to anyone but the hopeless romantic.
5	1376611200	I love how it tells the story and does not fade off.  Beginning to end.  You will not be disappointed.
5	1376611200	One of the most eloquent books I have ever read.  The author does an amazing job of capturing the emotions of Isabel and Hannah.  My heart was aching for both of them.  This is a wonderful book selection for high school English classes and book clubs.  An excellent first novel!  I look forward to her next.
5	1376611200	Loved this book! Excellent writing! I feel like I know exactly what JANUS looks like! I was prepared for the ending, but it was not as bad as I thought it would be.  The ending was perfect !
5	1376611200	I really enjoyed this book!  The characters were very believable and I loved the setting of the story. I would definitelyrecommend this book!
5	1376611200	Super book!! This may be the authors first book, but I for one hope it won't be the last. Wonderful characters and story, Makes one think of what and how our decisions in life  will effect ourselves and others.
4	1376611200	Beautiful and heart rendering love story between Tom and Isabel.  The setting itself on Janus Rock is like a character in the story without whose presence the story would not be possible.  All of the characters were well developed - one of those tales where you feel each one's pain.
5	1376611200	A  book club favorite. Unputdownable for me. What twists and turns. And how medical treatment has changed in the last century. I was in tears.
5	1376524800	The characters were beautifully created and very believable. The slippery slope of dishonesty was deeply moving and thoroughly engaging. The ending was bitter-sweet.
2	1376524800	Rather weak, very drawn out. Interesting setting and time period. A bit childish,simplistic. None of the characters came to life for me, except the child. She was quite clearly drawn.
4	1376524800	Great story line. Caught me from the very start. Desperate people doingDesperate  things. Good people doing bad things  for understandable reasons.Hard to tell if it represents life in those Times which I read it as,or is it contrived?
4	1376524800	Read this for our book club and I enjoyed reading this fast moving book.  I couldn't put it down.  It was sad at the end, but an excellent read.
5	1376524800	A friend told me about this book and I was not disappointed -- the challenges with living on a lighthouse were nicely presented
5	1376524800	I enjoyed the book very much and our bookclub meets next week to discuss it.  I am looking forward to it.
5	1376524800	Really makes you look inside yourself to see what you would do. Definitely worth making time to read over and over.
4	1376524800	Much to talk and think about as a couple finds an infant and decides to raise it as their own
4	1376524800	This was a revelation on several levels.  The first was the geography of the setting and the second was the constraining lifestyle of lighthouse keepers.  The third was the unexpected emotional storyline.  The consequences of a simple decision was the main topic and the horrific details of that consequence was the emotionally charged impact of it.  It kept my attention and involved my emotions so that I had to read it in as short a time as possible.  What a story!
3	1376524800	At times it held a lot of interest. I was not with the heroin - a little off center, good on the whole
5	1376524800	Hightly recommended. What can I add that hasn't already been positively written about this novel?As with others, I found it an easy read and hard to put down.  Thank youM.L. Stedman for such a well written novel that was like no other I've ever read.
5	1376524800	This book has a great plot and so well written. Was not predictable like so many are. I definitely would recommend this book.
4	1376524800	This book was the first Kindle book I read.  It attracted my attention by two incidents in it's beginning that as it unfolded, were the seeds to the whole story.  It is the story of a good man having to make serious moral decisions and the consequences of those decisions on the people around him.  It is a story worth recommending.
4	1376524800	Made me emotional and torn between the choices that were made throughout the book. I was able to see all sides and was heartbroken for all involved.
5	1376524800	The light represents the literal lighthouse and the little girl. The oceans represent the people torn apart by circumstance and how they handle it. A great exploration in what is the right thing to do. You have to ask yourself, what would I do in that situation. Good story. Helps you self-reflect.
5	1376524800	A wonderful story line with great writing, believable character development and difficult moral issues has kept me interested in this book ever since I read it.  I kept wanting to underline sentences on my Kindle!
3	1376438400	An interesting and well-told story, and so very sad.  Left me feeling unsure what the author's purpose or point was.  I think a truly good book offers some hope or uplifts readers in some way even in sad circumstances.  This one didn't for me.
4	1376438400	This book was better then i thought it would be as well as being a tear jerker in the end.
4	1376438400	Sad, sweet, and loving. Felt such sadness for the Sherbournes. The hurt and pain were so palpable. Good ending. Well worth the read.
5	1376438400	Was a really great heart felt read. Kept me up late at night.  Was a true life event story. Great....
5	1376438400	I have already recommended this book to friends.  We read it in our book club and everyone loved it.  It was very moving, heart-wrenching to be exact.  It was well crafted like a wonderful puzzle where, in the end, all of the pieces fit perfectly together. The story expressed well the pain of being human and the consequences of the choices that we make.  It also plunged the depths of love and what we will do for it!  I say treat yourself and read this book!
3	1376438400	This book is okay... my sister suggested it and I needed a book for the Beach !  Would suggest if you had nothing else to read !!!
5	1376438400	Love the story! Brings up some moral questions. Good characters. Very well written.it was hard to put down.having visited many lighthouses has made me interested in them.
5	1376438400	Kept you wondering until the end what was going to happen with the baby.  Loved the vivid description of the location.
4	1376438400	Not a bad book - not breathtakingly good, but decently written, develops character well, and keeps you engaged, as long as you are into gentle, fairly contemplative books.
4	1376438400	The kind of bookI like. A bit of History, geographical setting unfamiliar to me.  Responsibilities of a lighthouse keeperAnd emotional conflict, loyalty and love.
5	1376438400	The development of the story and the twists and turns as the novel neared it's climax kept me glued to it.  The reader is drawn into the opposing values and emotions of both Tom and Isabel, understanding the responses of each and without doubt siding with the one more like the reader's own principles.  I felt that the greatest impact of their choices was experienced by little Lucy.  Her trauma and her eventual resilience were a realistic and comforting glimpse into current events in real life.  .
4	1376438400	Very good book with good writing.  It keeps you interested in the story from the beginning to the end.  I would recommend the book.
5	1376438400	The book was given to me by a friend. The print was to small, so I had my brother put it on my kindle.I am interested in LighthousesThe Lights and discriptions of the loneliness associated with be a keeper  of light was well depicted. I like the plot and twists the writer woven through out the book. It kept the reader interested in the book to the very end. I would recommend it to friends.
5	1376352000	It was a delightful story with great characterizations!  The emotions were real and one could celebrate and empathize with Tom, Izzy, Lucy and Hannah.  The isolated lighthouse on the remote island of Janus draws you to it simplicity and beauty - as well as its challenges and dangers. Love, forgiveness, reconciliation and life shine throughout the story!
4	1376352000	Tears will flow, and sensations of love, anger and more love, will carry you along the trail of these complex lives.
5	1376352000	Spellbinding and well written. Very understandable how the plot proceeded! Any parent will love this! I will look for more by this author.
5	1376352000	I found this book hard to put down!  This author is extremely skilled in character development, as well as the use of exquisite prose.  It was by far, the best book I had read in a very long time!  I was sad to see it end!!!
5	1376352000	I really liked this book.  It starts out slow, but really picks up later.  You have no clue as to how it ends until the end.  The idea for this book was very unique, and different from anything I had ever read.  Who would think about a lighthouse as the theme of the book.
4	1376352000	I really went back and forth trying to decide to give this book 3 or 4 stars.  I really enjoyed the story and the farther along I read, the more I wanted to know what would happen and how the main characters would have everything play out, and if a book has me looking forward to reading it and getting back to it whenever I can, I know I obviously liked it (thus the 4 stars).  The only reason I considered giving it only 3 stars was because I thought that in some ways, the characters came across a little shallow. I understand that authors will often only give you glimpses of what is actually going on with the characters so that you, as the reader, can figure a lot of it out on your own, but for some of these characters, especially the main character Tom, I felt like the author was continuously toying with me by saying that Tom had this big internal struggle going on and therefore he acted a certain way, and it was brought up repeatedly, but we are never told exactly what it was that happened to Tom or what he went through to make him that way.  Sure, I could guess what had happened, but I felt like I was being teased by having it brought to my attention repeatedly only to then be told I couldn't know the truth.  It was frustrating to me.
5	1376352000	This book got me from the very beginning. As with other books, if the story does not interest me from the very 1st, I will put it down and consider it boring. However, This book I would highly recommend. I really gets you in the very beginning.Read it, Please.
5	1376352000	Very good reading. Makes you feel bad for for everyone. Yet you know that what was done was the right thing to do. Loved the ending!
5	1376352000	Absolutely breathtaking writing.  Very few novels have this effect on me. I finished it weeks ago and still think about it. A beautiful story.
5	1376352000	Reminds me of TV's Switched at Birth with the moral conundrums and twists of fate.  Be careful for what you wish for.
5	1376352000	Great book, a bit wordy in places but a must read ...loved it, oh so inspiring. As a mother understood both sides of the story line.
5	1376352000	I loved this book!  The characters were wonderfully described.  The story line was unique.  Sad but happy ending. Would recommend it highly
5	1376352000	This was a novel that caught my interest immediately and held it until the last page.  The story captivates the imagination and the backdrop of an isolated island off the coast of Australia adds to the moral dilemma facing the protagonists.  The author creates a multi-faceted story that lends itself to interesting discussions.
4	1376352000	The book was simple, and the characters were delicate and fragile. After awhile the story that threaded all of the characters together began become to far reaching for my liking.
5	1376352000	very interesting plotVery well writtenIt held my attention and I had to keep on turning to the next page to find out what happened
5	1376352000	A veteran returns like many from the Great War. A lighthouse, solitudes, a cross current deep like the title. I was drawn by a wonderful tale of loss and redemption. Great read.
5	1376352000	I love the way this book both makes you sad, shocked and contemplate what you would do in the scenario. Realistic through and through. Not too heavy but intelligently and emotionally touches on the human condition.
2	1376352000	VERY SIMPLISTIC NOVEL, FALLS FLAT. SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE LIGHTHOUSE ANDTHE HISTORY OF LIGHTHOUSES WAS INTERESTING BUT THE PERSONAL NARRATIVES WERE FLAT!
4	1376352000	I liked the book but it took a few chapters to start getting into it. It gets better if you just stay with it! I would recommend it.
5	1376352000	Every book club should read this novel.  There is so much to discuss.  It is a book that you want to tellyour friends to &#34;just read it&#34; because there are twists and turns that you don't want to give away.I read this book in two days and look forward to her next book!!  I am a fan with this one.
5	1376352000	very moving.  I enjoyed the characters very much.  The situations and how they each dealt with them were incredible.  Great book.
5	1376352000	Excellent book- hard to decide whose side to take.  Great summer read or book club book.  Plenty of topics to discuss.
5	1376352000	I loved this story.  It was unpredictable and heartwarming, yet heartbreaking, all at the same time. I have recommended this book to many friends who loved it, too.
4	1376265600	I was entertained and felt I was getting an interesting look at a different time and place.  I was drawn in enough to care about the characters but sometimes felt the author threw in over dramatized episodes that were anti-climatic.
5	1376265600	I thought the book was very well written. The characters were real, for that era and for the setting. I could not put it down.
5	1376265600	I enjoyed the story line and found it interesting about the life of a lighthouse caregiver with a beautiful story line.
5	1376265600	I loved the characters, the texture, the conflicted emotions it created for me between the characters. Not a predictable plot, no easy answers for the people living these tragic times. It was not overly sentimental, just hard times & difficult decisions. And a very unique setting. Recommending to all my friends.
5	1376265600	Gets into the hearts and souls of its characters. A book for everyone who has been a parent.  Nicely written from each character's perspective. I wanted a different ending, but this one was more true.
3	1376265600	This book was disappointing and I am sorry I spent any money to buy it.  I found the main character not real in that he did not understand the consequences of his actions and his wife's reaction.  Not worth the time it took to read.
4	1376265600	I'm a chauvenist when it comes to reading books by women, with the exception of books like The Hunger Games and Harry Potter - guess that means I enjoy reading books directed at the young adult market.  The Light Between Oceans did a good job of capturing the male perspective of a man who survives war and feels guilty because so many of his friends didn't make it.  No matter that he's able to experience happiness later in life, the 'what-if and why me' questions remain.  It keeps him from revealing all of himself to the people that matter the most.Stedman also handles the female perspective well.  The natural, and cultural, desire to mother, the intense compulsion to protect her loved ones - especially her children, and internalizing insults and injury long past that which a male remembers.  Bad decisions, made with good intentions, often leave everybody hurt, and this is what happens in The Light Between Oceans.The book was well written, and except for its setting in a period and a tradition that I am not familar with, I would have given it 5 stars.
5	1376265600	great read -want to read more of her books-the ending made me cry - definitely a woman's book, but everyone can relate!
5	1376265600	The kindle is not as easy to use as the original.  Hard to get back to beginning of  the book.
4	1376265600	Very interesting and readable novel.The characters are complex and there are some unexpected twists and turns as the story unfolds.  I recommend this book for book clubs because it would stimulate interesting comments and points of view.
5	1376265600	This is one of those stories that just capture you. Very hard to put down. All about light and dark and regular people making tough choices. Really well written and the setting is amazing.
3	1376179200	The writer had a message to deliver but I did not enjoy the delivery. Enjoyed the male characters. They had substance.
5	1376179200	What a great story.  Many emotional twists.  What happens when you are not true to your nature?  What happens when sadness and grief twist reality in your head?  Does love make a lie right?  Can an act of kindness make things right?  I cried my eyes out the last 100 pages.  The characters are so deep and scarred and real.
4	1376179200	I enjoyed the book, the writing was good and the story line held my interest. I was, however, frustrated with the main character and his righteousness at the expense of his wife's mental health. Maybe I took it too personally. Its definitely worth reading and would lend it self to book club discussion, in the &#34;what would YOU do category.&#34;
5	1376179200	I enjoyed this book for its unusual characters and setting and the premise was well handled. I really was torn in whom to root for.
4	1376179200	This novel develops a serious moral question about parenthood.A reader can also learn about Australia, its WWI participation, and the management of a lighthouse.
4	1376179200	It was great, but I have read better.The writing was easy to understand.The mysterious person who put the notes in the mailbox was not who I expected it to be.
4	1376179200	sad!  life was so hard just a short while ago...people have forgotten  very memorable characters  sad sad sad  sad sad
4	1376179200	It took a while to get into this book but eventually I did get hooked. It was very well written and the setting and plot were interesting and unique.  However, if you are looking for an uplifting or fun book, this may not be the one for you.
5	1376179200	Could not stop reading this story.  I felt like I was right there at the lighthouse with Tom, Isabel and Lucy Grace.
5	1376179200	Simple in its own way but also speaks to life's universal. Connection. Great read but no the kind of book you can't put down. Just sort of warm and fuzzy though. Lovely.
5	1376179200	I loved this book..Tom is man who had trouble living with a lie and when he encountered the birth mother he had to reveal the secret at the expense of his wife who he loved dearly and which nearly destroyed there life together. I thought they were going to end up with Lucy.
4	1376179200	Being a mother makes you understand the power of loving your child. The author weaves you through the character's tales as you struggle to truly decide the truth of right and wrong.
3	1376179200	A well written book, but slow. Very interesting learning about the history of lighthouses and the men who cared for them. A great love story for every women who ever loved or lost a child. This book will make you cry.
5	1376179200	Beautifully written and superb storytelling. This is a wonderful read, literature at its best. Everyone, parents, the old, the young should read this book, for it contains the wisdom of the ages about choices, consequences and the power of love.
5	1376179200	The book literally takes the reader to live at Janus . Great English . Brought back memories of A J Cronin .
5	1376179200	Right up to the end you don't know what's going to happen.  Every time I thought I had it figured out it turned out differently.  I couldn't put it down!
4	1376179200	I was immersed in this story from the very beginning. With the twists and turns mixed with a thoroughly dissected look at human nature I couldn't put this one down.
5	1376179200	I thought this story was great - a lot deeper than I thought it would be.  Loved the way the story unfolded and followed all the way through and did not leave you hanging.  Lots of interesting turns to this story.
5	1376179200	This was such a beautiful, but happy and sad, story. Would recommend it to people who don't mind crying (a good cry)
5	1376179200	Our entire book group was enchanted with this novel. It provided for a great discussion centered around topics such as truth, guilt  and personal responsibility. We also learned a lot about lighthouses -- something that I, at least, had never thought much about.
5	1376092800	This was a well written book and kept me interested all the way through.  Good twists and turns throughout.  I would highly recommend this as a good read!
4	1376092800	Very well written. I enjoyed the character development and depth. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good beach read.
4	1376092800	Enjoyed reading this book.  The author did a good job of building the story to show the struggle between deciding to do what is right and what is wrong.  It reminds us that there are times when making sound decisions along with others may be hard.  Overall it is a good read.
4	1376092800	Really different theme withgreat geographical history. Interesimg characters and  backgrounds. This book kept my interest and moved quickly with just enough description. Read on my Kindle.
5	1376092800	So very well written. How one choice can affect the lives of so many.  I just couldn't stop thinking about the story.
4	1376092800	This book kept me engaged throughout. I would definitely recommend this book but be sure to keep the kleenex handy.
4	1376092800	After I got over the slow start of the book, I was unable to put it down. I spent every free moment reading.  I had a slow start because the beginning was very boring but I was determined to read on and I am so glad I did.I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I gave four stars because I thought the beginning of the story was so boring that I almost didn't finish it. Overall, it was an exciting book to read.
4	1376092800	This novel was different and kept your attention to the end.  You could visualize something most people know nothing about.
4	1376092800	Well written with lots of description and tangled story lines. The author put her characters in many situations where they had to make difficult choices.
4	1376092800	This was a good read with an appropriate ending. It kept my interest and was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time especially if you are a Mother.
4	1376092800	The writing is wonderful.  So many times I asked, &#34;what would I do &#34; or &#34;how would I feel? The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that took some time to get into it, but the ending I couldn't put down.
5	1376092800	A deep moral question is evoked within its pages about the future of a young baby. You'll find yourself wrestling with compassion, pity, and duty along with the characters as they make seemingly irrevocable decisions.
4	1376092800	A good book. Hits all of your emotions  -  happy, sad, scared, worried. I liked the way the story was put together.
5	1376092800	fabulous product, great results...amazing price from Amazon! Recommed it to anyone who uses a straightener and has thick hair. Is not oily or greasy at all.
5	1376092800	This a wonderful story about the power of love and the determination to protect those you love. Sweet story line. I enjoyed it a lot.
4	1376092800	The characters are engaging and believable, the setting is exotic and adventurous, the plot is unusual but credible.  However, the way of solving a sensitive and unimaginable problem is the worst possible.  It makes one want to intervene and suggest a better way of handling things.
3	1376092800	The tragedy in this book is astounding.  If I would have known, I would not have read it.  It lives with me and I think of it often.  Having said that, it was a brilliant book and the author deserves to be read.  But, you have been warned.
5	1376092800	What a wonderful,  beautiful sad and happy book.  I could not put it down.  Loved learning about light houses.  Glad Lucy and Tom caught up in the end.
4	1376092800	Wanting a child and not being able to have one must be one of the most heartbreaking disappointments in life.  This novel is a beautifully written story of a couple who experience exactly that and I almost put it down a couple of times because my heart ached for them.  I'm glad I didn't and I know this is a book I will read again.  Highly recommended.
5	1376092800	This was a thought-provoking book.  What would you do in this situation?  I felt for both the families, and especially the child.  Maybe wish the ending had been a little different.
5	1376092800	From the first page, I was hooked......It opened up so much dialogue discussingthe book and the circumstances......every incident connected to the next and kept youare so engrossed.....at the end of the day, it makes you wonder how you would handlea situation like this.....
5	1376006400	It was hard to put it down!  The reader is left wondering what he or she would have done in similar circumstances.  I was at the edge of my seat throughout and had a lump in my throat at the end.  All the qualities of a great story.
5	1376006400	The twists and turns of the plot made this a hard book to put down. Whose side are you on?
4	1376006400	What would you do if you wanted a baby and couldnt have one? What would you do to make your wife happy because you loved her so much? Very goodbook to point out we are just huma. But right is right and wrong is always wrong and ca just get worse.
5	1376006400	I read this book because several trusted friends recommended it.  The story was fascinating and I couldn't put it down.  I will be recommending it for my book group.
5	1376006400	This is a lovely well written novel.  I took turns being angry, sad, and joyful with each of the characters as I understood the longing for a child while denying another woman the right to know of her child's survival.  The author writes so moviningly and convincingly.  There are no villains - only real people making difficult and perhaps wrong decisions for all the right  reasons.
4	1376006400	Took many turns when not expected, which was good.  Loved the characters and was surprised with the ending.....  Great story sand learned some about lighthouses and what they were used for.
5	1376006400	This book is so well written. I found myself rooting for both mothers and had a hard time deciding how it should or how I would like it to end.  The ending was exactly how it should be, fair but very sad for aisabel and Tom.  I absolutely loved this book.
4	1376006400	A different story depicting how isolation can bring about changes in people.  Every action has a reaction and a little bit of happiness ill gotten can bring great sadness later in life.
2	1376006400	Simple tale. Undistinguished writing. Why did a healthy male die and a baby survive in an open boat? Very overrated book
5	1376006400	What a powerful story told with wonderful insight and emotion. Drying my eyes, I look forward to more work by Stedman.
4	1376006400	This book is beautifully written, it makes you question the multitude of shades of gray in choosing right and wrong.
4	1376006400	I read this book for book club and loved it. While the book starts out a little slow, the pace picks up very quickly in Part 2. What I love is that while reading the novel you can see the events from multiple perspectives, feeling emotions of all of the characters at once. Total tear-jerking. Definitely worth reading.
4	1376006400	Mothers would love this book.  If you are a teen or single twenty-something you might not.  The ending seemed a bit contrived but the emotional struggles the hero experienced were well developed.  I'm glad I took a chance on this book.  The title was absolutely perfect on so many levels!
5	1376006400	There were just no simple choices for the characters in this provocative story. I spent my time away from reading trying to decide what I would do in their circumstances. The story evolved quite believeably, but each decision was fraught with ethical, moral and emotional obstacles. I found it well worth my time and enjoyed the mental gymnastics.
5	1376006400	Maybe it's just where I am in my life right now, but I loved this book.  So personal.  It was interesting how the author showed the perspective from each character giving the reader a true understanding of what it means to make decisions out of love and circumstance. Glad I read it.
5	1376006400	I read the book and after a few days of reading I couldn't put it down.  It was very good.I would recommend it to whom ever would enjoy getting caught up in a story for a few hoursa day or into the early morning reading until the end.  I loved the adventure of this book.Any book that can capture your attention for longer than a day is a great book.Robbie from Orlando, Florida
5	1376006400	I read a lot of reviews about this book being too sad and too depressing. While it was sad, I felt so connected to the characters and you could feel their emotions...all the way through the end.  I thought it had a sweet, not sad, ending.  I'd recommend it.
3	1376006400	Rather simplistic and predictable.  Touching, but not terribly though provoking.  Not enough depth on main character. More background on his war experiences would have improved characterization.
5	1376006400	I loved this book.  Lots of twists that you don't see coming.  You will totally love it if you purchase.
5	1376006400	This was a mystery with a totally different twist.It was hard to determine what was right -honesty or emotion,
4	1376006400	This novel reaches the reader on many levels with questions that will provide for thought and reflection.  The story follows a young couple and the moral decisions they make.  The reader begins to know the characters and  begins to recognize the needs that prompt those decisions.  It's a love story with a serious twist.
5	1376006400	This could easily have happened - and the dilemna the couple has of what to do with the baby. I enjoyed the book form beginning to end; loved the ending as well even though it was difficult situation.
5	1376006400	I am so happy I read this book.  I sat up late to finish the book, wept, and two weeks later I am still thinking about it.  Love, betrayal, trust, morals - all that and beautifully written too, I thought.I am anxiously awaiting the next book from this author.
3	1376006400	It is a good summer read and original in plot and story.  I enjoyed the book and my husband also read it.  He found it to be more of a &#34;woman's book.&#34; Saundra Gray
4	1376006400	Lots of thought provoking moral and emotional content.  Well written so that you can empathize with all involved. Ending seems a little contrived however.  But still a good read.
4	1376006400	I enjoy the history of lighthouses so this book was quite interesting for me.It was also a love story.Having faithin the people or person that you love for a lifetime.
4	1376006400	Good story, well executed and fairly well written. Good values taught and story kept you in suspense throughout the entire book.
5	1376006400	Loved this unique story about a mother's love and a man's sense of duty.  The story started off a bit slow but then takes on a turn and I couldn't put it down.
5	1376006400	A wonderful tale and a great read!  I highly recommend it, whether you have personally experienced Australia or not.  Enjoy!
5	1376006400	This is a well-written novel about a couple who move to a light house on a remote island off the tip of Australia. The wife is unable to bear children and when a baby is washed ashore in a row boat, she convinces her husband to keep the baby and raise her as their own rather than notify the authorities.  I was not able to put the book down.
5	1376006400	Good and interesting story which takes an improbable situation and makes it believable.  Warning!  You will cry!  I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about the workings of lighthouses and about the northern coast of Australia.  I recommend this book!
5	1375920000	The moral question that the main character, Tom, faces is very well detailed. Tom and Isabel's life on the Australian is well described. I cried in quite a lot of this book. I would recommend it to everyone.
4	1375920000	Without giving away what happened in the book I would like to say that it was a page turner the characters are very real I cried I laughed and my heart ache!
5	1375920000	Interesting story,  sad and thought provoking.  What would you have done in their place, considering their circumstances.  I recommend this book.
5	1375920000	Very compelling work.  Kept my attention and I wanted to skip to the end for the outcome but disciplined myself.  Hope to read more of her works soon.
5	1375833600	A heart-wrenching story of facing the consequences of one's decisions.  I was caught between reading fast to learn what was going to happen and not wanting the story to end.  It is a wonderful, emotional read.
5	1375833600	The Light Between Oceans is the best novel I've read in a long time (and I'm an avid reader).  Stedman has a way of bringing you into the story so that the characters struggles become your own.  The entire story is based on a moral dilemma and really makes the reader put himself into the characters' shoes and think about what he would do in their situation.  There were points in the novel when I found myself stopping reading to grapple with the issues the story was bringing up.I highly recommend this book.  It's definitely a tear-jerker, though, so have the tissues handy!
5	1375833600	Loved this book.  A wonderful story from this first time author. It is impossible not to feel the pain of all the characters in this story and to second guess their painful decision.  Who is really right and who can say it was wrong for them to do what they did or was it just an act of pure love?  It wasn't surprising that during our book club's discussion of this book that there were many opinions of what these characters should have done or said.....but would that have made for more pain for less?  All choices were going to bring pain to someone.  It's imposssible not to be pulled into the world of these people and wonder what you would have done.
5	1375747200	This story -- tremendously effective -- puts sympathetic characters into a powerful ethical dilemma. I'm not a big cryer, but the last chapter had me sobbing -- cathartic, deep and beautiful.
4	1375747200	A great &#34;beach book&#34; that is engaging and pulls the reader along.  The ending is a bit too pat for my taste - a disappointment.
5	1375747200	This was a very provocative book, in addition to being a great read. Beautiful language, very visual - I could imagine this on the big screen. But beyond that, it forced me to ask questions: what would I have done? What happens when you are faced with a moral or ethical dilemma, where either choice has many ramifications? That's the first question. Next is this: can you correct mistakes you made in your past? Can you undo something, or is the correction worse than the original act? Should you aspire to hurt the fewest people? Or should you do what is right regardless of the hurt? Or should you protect your loved ones above all else, including the law. The road forks several times in this novel that takes place in a small Australian town and an isolated light house, and the right path is often not clear. The characters take life on the pages - they are flawed for sure, yet mostly good. There is no villain here, only people trying to do the right thing, in its all its permutations.
2	1375747200	I enjoyed learning about the lighthouse keeper's life.  The author milked the sadnessinf WW1, miscarriages, losing husbands and kids, unreasonable mob behavior, dangerous critters, family relations,  separations and bowing own will to please another.  Perfect for a lifetime movie.
5	1375747200	Steadman's writing is a work of art. Her capacity to express and understand emotions and the human condition is unparalleled.C.Capron, Licsw
3	1375747200	Well written and a decent story although somewhat predictable.  I just never connected with the characters to the degree I would have expected.
4	1375747200	Tom, whose records as a lighthouse keeper are meticulous and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel has taken the tiny baby to her breast. Against Tom&#8217;s judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them.
4	1375747200	Loved it. Not your typical love story.  Will read more by this author. Great book club read. Thank you amazon.
4	1375747200	An interesting read with real dilemma and gut turning choices. The author eloquently describes life on a secluded island and the ramifications of making decisions you don't think will have any affect on others.
5	1375747200	Beautifully written novel. Loved it from start to finish. Wonderful story about intense love and loss. Would highly recommend this book.
5	1375747200	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I know there is much more to it than the story that was told, so I am going to spend some time thinking it over in order to gain an even deeper, more meaningful appreciation for this book.
5	1375660800	Very compelling story that every mother can relate to. Loved the premise & the depth into each persons past & humanity. A &#34;Sophie's Choice&#34; ethical & moral dilema in a harsh & beautiful setting.
4	1375660800	I knew the gist of the book before I read it. I thought it was well written but I just couldn't identify with Tom and his decisions. I found myself wishing his character was written differently and that is why I only gave the book 4 stars. But, as a mother myself, I was tortured by the course of events and eventually feel the ending was a strong conclusion. Enjoy!
5	1375660800	Although it started slowly, I couldn't put it down as it progressed...wonderfully written, I was drawn into the lives of all those affected by an old tragedy.
5	1375660800	If this was the authors first novel......I can't wait for her next endeavors.It was such a real look into peoples emotions, thoughts, and character.I don't want to give any of the plot line away, so all I can say is it was a wonderfully touching story. P.S: A box of tissue will come in handy from time to time.
4	1375660800	I will certainly suggest to our Book Club this fall, as there are many events in the story that would prompt good discussion.
5	1375660800	This story draws you in and captures your heart.  A great read for anyone who has ever had to make a hard choice for those they love.
5	1375660800	M.L. Steadman has an incredible gift of conveying the feelings and emotions of her characters into the hearts of her readers.  What an experience!
5	1375660800	This is a very interesting book that could generate a fascinating discussion of moral values in a book club setting.
4	1375660800	I thought that the author did a fine job placing the characters accurately in the post &#34;Great War&#34; historical context. It was interesting to think about living in such an isolated environment and to wrestle with the moral choices that were presented to this couple when a baby suddenly became part of their lives. The author deftly portrayed the considerable effects that isolation, moral values, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, attachment, and grief and loss, had on the main characters.
4	1375660800	Great, heartfelt and heart breaking. A bit slow to start as background is being built, but eventually u can't put it down.
5	1375574400	This was a great story...such a tear jerker at the end though.  The author really makes you feel like you know the characters.
5	1375574400	a beautiful moral dilemma. great character development that made me truly empathize with the characters. i couldn't put it down
1	1375574400	Really disappointed after hearing such rave reviews.  Don't like stories where the whole thing is obviously choreographed and you know the character is in for doom.
5	1375574400	Love is a powerful emotion.  What would you do for the ones you love?  Lie? Cheat? Steal? Forgive?  In this beautifully written novel our characters are presented with life altering choices. As you read you will find your self thinking &#34;what would I do?'&#34;
5	1375574400	I cried heartfelt tears with this novel. I felt such sympathy for Izzy and Tom. They were so happy it almost seemed like a true, God given gift they received. Until the truth of Hannah came to light. What a dilemma Tom felt to tell the truth. What strong feeling this book held for me. From telling truth, no matter how painful and gut wrenching. To forgive, instead of holding on to hate. It was one of the best books I have ever read, truly.
5	1375574400	This was a very good story and I enjoyed Ms. Stedman's writing.  I was disappointed in the ending but that is something the reader does not have control over.  I was glad that the couple were able to make peace with each other.  I would recommend this book to other readers.
4	1375574400	So much interesting stuff about the plague and how they treated it and what they thought it came from and about the &#34;healers&#34; and those who took advantage of the sick people.  And then, the denouement - fizzle!  Someone remarked that the publisher got in touch with the author and hurried her along - and she ended it badly.
4	1375574400	This book was recommended to me by a few friends and co-workers. I downloaded the book onto my Kindle and honestly, I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it.  My friends encouraged me to continue, but it was SO SLOW and descriptive. It took me to read 42% of the book before I felt &#34;hooked.&#34; This was an amazing story of a married couple who desperately wanted a family and would go to any means to make their dream come true. The husband's love and devotion to his wife is what really warmed my heart.  I love how the book ended and I would recommend it.
4	1375574400	I love the Australian dialogue in the beginning!  Description of settings is also a strong point.  Some obsession within characters bogs down the plot at times.
5	1375574400	This was one of my favorite books that I have read in a long time.  The plot was interesting; the characters sympathetic; and the setting extraordinary.  Truly a wonderful read.
5	1375574400	It may not be the ending you hope for....but it's the only ending that's right. I absolutely loved this book!
5	1375574400	A great story of love and loss.  It was one of those books that's hard to put down.  I really enjoyed it!
5	1375574400	A not to put down book, waiting for the next happening..  Our book club loved it.Showing parental love outdoes all.
5	1375574400	A delightful novel with mystery, passion and love.  Can't put it down.  You can really feel the emotion of the characters.
5	1375574400	A wonderfully involving novel. The atmosphere created was brought to vivid life by the author as were the characters whose lives were wrenchingly dilineated. It was a beautifully written story that created questions not easily answered long after the final pagewas read. I loved it even though it brought frequent tears to my eyes. I strongly recommend it.
4	1375574400	In spite of an environment that is structured in repetition & tradition, the people and the lives herein are not predictable ..... and that's where this book gets so interesting!
5	1375574400	Very pointed story. Emotional story of ups and downs involving family, a  nation and a way of life that no longer exist. Certain to be a good read.
4	1375574400	The  book told of life in Australia, and that of living on an isolated island where the couple were the only people there.  Several times a year a boat arrived with supplies.  After the wife has had several miscarriages, a boat arrives on the island, carrying a dead man and a three-month old baby.  Does this couple look to find the family of this baby, or is this God's gift to them for the three miscarriages the wife has had?  The book gave a study in life on the mainland, and on the island.  I enjoyed the book.
5	1375574400	I can't remember how I found out about this book but it is one of the best books I have read in a long time. An engaging and delightful story, I never wanted it to end.
4	1375488000	I slogged through the first half of this book, but the second half rushed over me like a wave.  It is a beautiful story of love and heartbreak.  Well worth the read.
4	1375488000	I loved the intricies of the plot and the potential resolutions they suggested. However, I don't think I would have chosen the one the author chose. That's just me, however, and there were a great many possibilities. All of which were plausible.
4	1375488000	The descriptions are beautiful but a little tedious.  I skipped some because I was more interested in the story.  Without giving anything away, I will say it broke my heart.  ;
4	1375488000	Great characters and a tragic yet also uplifting story. I felt like I was there and could identify with so many of the characters. Great read.
5	1375488000	Great read enjoyed it very much kept me turning the pages wonderful description of how a mother loves her children
5	1375488000	A story about the tough choices life requires to be made trying to honor oneself and the ones they love.
5	1375488000	As a mother, I found this novel fantastically heartbreaking. The author captured the heartbreak of losing a child in so many ways and an undying love a mother has for her child in a way that I could not put this book down. A must read!
5	1375488000	I enjoyed this book so much. Full of real humans with real emotions. I would recommend this book to any mother
5	1375401600	I could say so much about how much I've enjoyed this. It's touched me in so many ways. It's tragic but beautiful. There is no rush to the story. The characters were so well defined I felt like I could relate to their story and their situations. Because the author took such great care of detail I was able to create an image so real for every page. Behind all the sadness in this story there is a beauty there you just have to chose to see it. &#34;We all have a choice&#34;
5	1375401600	Different and compelling unexpected ending overturned recommended. Why do these reviews require so many words? I would take the time to review more books if I didn't have to write this much.
4	1375401600	liked this story very much. Interesting character study. would like to find more books by this author. would recommend to others.
4	1375401600	Good book to read at the shore.  Interesting plot. My heart went out to both women in this story. Recommend you read this book.
5	1375401600	This story reminded me that we have a choice in every action. It is a beautiful story of trials,love and faith.
4	1375401600	The unhappy position created by attempting to go along with the desires of his wife, was so disturbing.  Readers all felt torn by the terrible situation.
2	1375401600	Clearly a writer who has much maturing to do.  Her characters are void of depth.  The women's only response to emotional challenges was to become manipulative or go mad.  I read to the end only because I can speed read and wanted to see if the character could mature.  They did not.  I was never fully engaged.
3	1375401600	I thought the characters a little undeveloped; perhaps because they were in an isolated setting.  I thought the story plot was very good and sufficiently complex, but ..... something is missing. Just my opinion. For a first novel, I consider it, overall, an excellent effort with a complex theme.
5	1375401600	I enjoyed it a lot!!  A book that&#34;s  hard to put down.  Very good story, even though many parts were sad.
4	1375401600	I am in the middle of reading this and am enjoying it very much.  The characters are extremely interesting and I find it difficult to put the book down.
5	1375401600	A friend recommended this book, and I was unsure at the beginning. It was a little hard to get into at first, but once it gets going..Wow! Very descriptive without being overworked.I really enjoyed the story, as well as the character development. No-one is exactly as they seem..which I found kept the book interesting. Overall, it was a fantastic read.
4	1375401600	I enjoyed every bit of this book!  The story was captivating. It's been a while since I was unable to put a book down.  My only complaint was that the end came too soon. I wish the author had expounded on the details of the climax of the story.  Not only would I recommend this book...I have!
5	1375401600	I was looking for a new title and came across this book. It was priced fairly low, apparently because it is one of the author's first novels. That is what drew me to it. I wanted to read someone new.I enjoyed the story line very much and was always anxious to read more as time allowed me. The author's character development is right up there with the best. It was a joy to read. Not only would I read M. L. Stedman again, I will be anticipating the author's next book and looking forward to it!
4	1375401600	At first I wasn't sure I would like the book but then discovered it took place in Australia--and I love anything Australian!  The setting and characters were somewhat unique to any other book I have read lately.  I like the time frame it was set in, right after WWI.  Sort of semi-modern but without all the modern day communication.  The author really takes you inside the characters and the human experience.  What we will do under certain circumstances and what our bottom line is in life--what we can live with.
4	1375315200	Wonderfully written, hard to put down. I felt happy and then very sad all within the same page of this book .The end of the book brought up emotions that I thought were long in my past. I plan to read M.L.Steadman in the future.
4	1375315200	Someone recommended this book to me, and I'm glad they did. It is filled with happiness and sadness, wonderfully developed characters, interesting plot, and the historical references are excellent
5	1375315200	The beginning was a little slow but that was just the build-upfor the ending.Once the baby Lucy arrived,  I found it hard to put the bookdown.Also, learned more about Australia and it's lighthouses.A good read!
5	1375315200	Beautiful love story, in a land unknown to me, Australia. Couldn't put it away. It will play with your emotions.
5	1375315200	Well written!  Compelling story!  couldn't put it down!  The  descriptions of the area were so vivid that you felt as though you were there.  The characters were wonderful.  The most touching parts were at the end. Love and loyalty forever.
4	1375315200	The book raised so many moral questions. The life of a lighthouse keeper at the turn of the 20th century was so restrictive and it was an interesting read. The characters went through so much and I could empathize with the women and the young girl. Every decision was a challenge and the story raised so many questions. I was held captive by the tale.
5	1375315200	This book had it all for me- the imagery, the writing, the characters, the story. I found myself so connected in this book I was sobbing and smiling throughout. No spoilers- but it was a hard book to read towards the end. Definitely one that kept me thinking for days about it!
5	1375315200	Moving, a story that parallels all of our respective lives. Guaranteed to make you examine the influence your existence has on others. Couldn't put it down.
5	1375315200	This novel was rich with details that painted such a clear picture in the mind's eye.  The plot was gripping, and the historical backdrop added all the more to the story.  High recommendations for this novel.
4	1375315200	To start, this a beautifully written book.  The prose is vividly descriptive in some cases to the point where you can almost feel the wind and taste the salt air.  The plot is unique, the main characters for the most part are well developed and real you could meet them on the street or in your neighbourhood watering hole.  But most significantly it leaves you asking the question, &#34;What would I do?&#34;  Which frankly does not happen often in novels these days.My only complaint, and is minor, is that the ending dragged.  No other way I can describe than the sense that it was a rush to finish, almost as if the ending was not the good part.I will read another of her novels and I recommend this one to all.
5	1375315200	One of my favorite reads this summer.  The characters were easy to connect with.  I was constantly putting myself into their decision making processes!
5	1375315200	I feel about this book as I did about Kite Runner. It's a complete story. Both agonizing and hopeful. Simply amazing.
5	1375315200	I loved this book!  I couldn't put it down.  It was so well written and the subject so sensitive, at times it brought tears to my eyes. It is probably one of the most moving books I have read in a long time!
5	1375228800	After reading so many positive reviews I was excited about reading this book. I was not disappointed! I haven't been moved to tears by a book in a long time but this book did it to me. A very touching story about what one will do for love and family. I would definitely recommend this book!
2	1375228800	Although I am often disappointed by "best sellers" I decided to give this book a try after seeing 4.5 stars out of almost 2000 reviews, and because it was only a few dollars. Disappointed again. I finished the book, so it held my attention just enough to get me through, but I can't say I was ever surprised by what happened next and so, it was pretty boring. To top it off the characters all seemed very similar...they all had the same core personalities despite their different backgrounds, situations, and roles in the book. I was annoyed by the random memories or events sprinkled throughout, in what I can only guess is the author's attempt to "develop the characters." I wouldn't recommend this book unless you just need a quick, easy read that doesn't take much thought or consideration by the reader.
4	1375228800	The author's descriptions of places and people are incredible. I was sucked in from the first page. Heart wrenching and warming at the same time. Towards the end it did feel like dragged slightly and some the plot seemed repetitive but I will read this again. I hope, but doubt Dreamworks will do this novel justice.
5	1375228800	The book presents a daunting look at the love of two mothers for a child as well as the conflict of a husband who must choose between love and following the rules.
4	1375228800	Beautifully written, even poetic.  But the story is a difficult one to finish.  You want everything to turn out perfect for each character, but it is more that everything turns out perfectly realistic--and that fact is not necessarily beautiful.The reading is easy, the story is developed well and I was drawn into each character.  I found myself wondering about them in between sittings.  But I also found myself wondering, "how is the author going to tie everything up neatly and pretty by the end" and that ending just never can really occur.I highly recommend the book and I would read another by this author, but a bright, happy beach read this is not.
5	1375228800	This book was beautiful from beginning to end. The time spent reading will not be regretted. I'm sad it's over.
3	1375228800	Great writing but the setting was so small I sometimes was bored and had to skip forward.  Again, I do emphasize the writing was good!!
5	1375142400	I enjoyed this book very much. I could feel the emotions the characters were going through and why they made the decissions they did...right or wrong. I feel it ended like it should.
5	1375142400	M. L. Stedman is a true wordsmith and the story is incredible. Imaginative and poetic, the author weaves a plot that will not disappoint.
4	1375142400	I enjoyed the writing style and the subject.  It brings up a moral dilemma that will keep you turning the pages.  Highly recommended.
3	1375142400	Definitely a woman's book.  Too mushy for men to read. The writer was good but,  again too mushy for me.  I can see this book made into a movie for the Hallmark channel.
3	1375142400	I have such conflicted feelings about this book.  I loved the concept and I wanted to love the story, but something just never clicked for me.  It was a slow starter, for one.  By chapter 11, I still didn't know anything that hadn't been printed on the cover blurb.Then when Tom and Isabel finally made it to the mainland and the true conflict began I feel like the book lost some emotional touch.  Reading it felt like going through the motions of this real life horror story, but I never felt connected to what the characters were really feeling.I wasn't sure who to 'root for'.  Tom & Isabel, the two characters who saved a child and so desperately wanted to love her as their own? Or Hannah, the long lost mother who had been dealt a poor hand of her own?  This was troubling for me, but I also suspect that this may have been the aim of the author in choosing to frame the story the way she did.  I just wish she had dug a little deeper.The ending was lovely.  I will concede to that.  I don't want to give spoilers, but I will say that I finally shed some tears and I was happy with the outcome while simultaneously heartbroken at the way the lives of these characters had twisted throughout time.  Perhaps it's that bittersweet conclusion that's the real beauty of this book?  I'm just not sure...
3	1375142400	Takes too long to get to some tension.  Too much detail about babies.  The last part is interesting as it has some real moral dilemmas.
5	1375142400	If you live in Florida you will enjoy the read... Great character development and exciting and interesting twists to the story!
4	1375142400	A very compelling story.  How often do you feel truly empathetic to both the protagonist and antagonist, while still being fully conscious of the wrong that has been done?
5	1375142400	M.L. Stedman created a very interesting story. It is excellent writing and also the story is captivating. I hope to read more by Stedman
5	1375142400	...and I wasn't disappointed. Stedman makes the reader feel the isolation (physical, mental and emotional) of his characters in this book. Just when I seemed to be reaching my angst threshold, I'd get caught up in the mystery-suspense element of the story and read on! I was very glad I did.
5	1375142400	I read this book from first page to last without pause. I swept away my tears and kept following the narrative. I've already recommended this deeply moving story to three friends and plan to follow M.L. Stedman's other writings.Irena Chalmers
4	1375142400	Poignant tale that gives one pause to ponder our choices, our values, and our situations. Well written; keeps it very real.
4	1375142400	Good description of a  part Of Australia I've not known about. good characterization.. It seemed to me they could have shared Lucy rather than their brutal  solution, thought of the needs of the child, like in divorce settlements. But the description I guess that would have taken away the conflict which novelist need. Good First novel.
4	1375056000	I really enjoyed the beginning and middle of this book - couldn't put my Kindle down.  I only wish the last quarter of the book was more developed and had the same believability that the earlier sections had.  Still, overall, I would recommend this book for summer reading.  It is an interesting snapshot of a complicated life in a different time period. While it's not the most intellectual of books, I'm glad I read it.
5	1375056000	You know what a great feeling it is when you're reading a really good book and you don't even want to go to work because you just want to read?  That is how this book was for me!
4	1375056000	Highly recommend this book.  Great characters and interesting plot.  Characters are richly detailed as is the places in which they live.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Extremely well written.  Very talented writer.
4	1375056000	A well written story that keeps you reading from start to finish. Nicely developed characters that you can really understand and relate to-even if they are a bit 'off'.
5	1375056000	incomprehensible; the loss of a child, whether your own or that of another. Combine the two, and this novel takes you to some places you may not want to go. Questions get asked and answered. When is love wrong ? Is it ever wrong ? Does justice ever prevail, OR does justice even matter  in some cases. I'm glad I was fortunate enough to buy this book.
5	1375056000	This a beautiful story that stays with you for a long time after closing the book. One of the best books I have read in years! Don't miss this great read!
5	1375056000	It has been a long time since I have cried while reading a book!  I totally fell in love with the characters and my heart ached for them throughout the entire book.  Although I pretty much predicted the ending, it did not matter; I wept anyway!  I enthusiastically recommend this book!!
5	1375056000	Very emotional and thought provoking.  I enjoyed every minute and wanted to see what would happen so it kept me reading .
5	1375056000	Every time you think you know what's just around the bend, it's not.  Emotionally charged in a way that takes you by surprise.  It would be a spoiler to say which parts, but the story must be read it entirety.
5	1375056000	An enticing and emotional challenge  awaits in this story.  What would I or anyone  do faced with a beautiful gift, as was given in this novel.  I loved the characters and their struggle to overcome and their overwhelming love for one another.
4	1375056000	This product performs as stated.  However, being of a more ladylike nature, I prefer some of the more gentler scents.  This one I passed on to my husband for use in the fishing boat or working in the yard.
3	1375056000	The premise of the book was good, but I couldn't get invested in any of the characters. If I wasn't stuck on an airplane I probably wouldn't have finished it...
5	1375056000	This is the best book I've read this year. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put this book down. Couldn't have a better ending.
4	1375056000	Likes the characters and the vivid scenery.  Ending was just the right mix of unpredictable and sad.  I would have liked Mom to meet daughter .
3	1375056000	I have not completed this book yet. It is interesting, reads quickly, and has taught me things I didn't know about lighthouses.
4	1375056000	A Good book.  I liked that there was a definitive ending with nothing left hanging.  I would recommend this book.
5	1374969600	This is a novel I will re-read many times.  It is a thoughtful presentation of how choices that seem unavoidabe at the time have consequences that reach far into the future.
1	1374969600	I had high hopes for this book and really tried to look for the good in it but page after page was a disappointment. The interesting part of the story could be summarized in one page. The rest is looonnnngggg - completely drawn out for no reason, nothing you weren't expecting happens. The writing isn't very good and the characters are annoying. I kept waiting for something uplifting to happen but the whole book is depressing. Skip it - there are much better books out there to invest your time in.
5	1374969600	These days it's hard to imagine life before cell phones and internets, and even harder to truly relate to the daily forces at play in such archaic times.  Maybe the closest we get is to occasionally wonder at the different way folks 100 years ago perceived time.  The way my daughters now suffer through watching Bambi because it is &#34;too slow&#34;.This novel transcends the time gap (the ocean of time?) with the story of how normal life can become insanely complex.  The technology isn't ours, and the weather is inverted from the standard northern hemisphere perspective. But the forces at play are instantly recognizable and thoroughly fascinating to explore as the story unfolds.I considered a 4 star review but realized that nothing was lacking in the telling, only in my interpretation.  So a very deserving 5 star review for the story she wanted to tell!
5	1374969600	I really enjoyed this book, but did not care for the way it ended.  I guess I always want that perfect ending and this did not provide that for me.  I could rationalize with both of the main characters points of view and I feel the author did a good job of character development.  Besides the page turning main story, I enjoyed learning about the inner workings of a lighthouse and the job of a lighthouse keeper.
5	1374969600	I just finished reading The Light Between Oceans and tears are streaming down my face.  I hate to see it end and I already miss the characters.  The story is heartbreaking and gut wrenching but hard to put down for me any way.  If you are looking for a nice and tidy happy ending I'm afraid you won't find one here. Having struggled with infertility and finally accepting it, I know the grief, the heartache, and anger Isabel felt.  The unfairness of life and how simple and natural having a child should be but isn't true for everyone.  As My heart ached right along with her.  I know quite well the desperation and could understand her rationalizations.  I loved the book and I am amazed that this the authors first book.
4	1374969600	I had a hard time getting into this book, but once I did there was no putting it down. Great plot that I would recommend over Gone Girl any day.
5	1374969600	A journey into the emotions and minds of powerfully crafted characters. A reminder that we are all a blend of good and evil trying to find and follow the light that illuminates our individual lives.
5	1374969600	"The Light Between Oceans" is a beautifully written tale of love, loss.  deceit, shame, remorse, forgiveness, survival, acceptance, remembrance and everlasting love.It is the story of a WWI survivor and a young girl who had lived a rather sheltered and lonely life since her two brothers died during the Great War.  She at once fell madly in love with Tom Sherbourne and he with her.  They married and lived as sole occupants of the island of Janus, where he was the lightkeeper.  Isabel had 3 miscarriages and was desperate for a child.  One day a small row boat beached on the island with a dead man and a baby aboard.  All the rules were broken and Izzy and Tom raised Lucy as their own, although Tom had a guilty conscience. This guilt is compounded when on leave for a shore break, Tom and Izzy find out that Hannah Stoenfeldt had lost her husband and daughter at sea.  Hannah is a broken and haunted woman.  In the end, Tom must tell the truth.  The book tells the story of the idyllic life on Janus and the result of the truth being told.  It is definitely painful to read.  First book that has brought me to tears in years.  Moral of the story:  One has to ask, does the truth set you free?
5	1374969600	I really enjoyed this novel and when I was finished reading it, I was sad it was over!  I couldn't put the book down and ended up spending an entire afternoon just reading it.  I thought the author wrote beautifully, especially when describing the various settings and emotions of the characters.  The human dynamic is this novel is very interesting, complex and honest.  The book manages to make you feel frustrated, compassionate, sad, happy - all of these emotions directed at all of the characters at various points in the book.  By the final pages, I was definitely shedding a few tears.  This book has made a place for itself on my bookshelf with some of my very favorites, and I plan on sending a copy to my mom to read.
4	1374883200	Totally did NOT see the finale coming.  Stedman did a beautiful job of creating characters that I cared about and for.  His story is told with a light touch and a wrenching twist.  The location he sets his story is vivid to me even now.  I can see, feel and smell the sea and the old light house and island and wish I could travel there, too.  Stedman's writing is good and I'm watching for more books from him.
4	1374883200	A wonderful story about choices,  lies and how the past intertwined  all. I've read this wonderful book twice. Once on my own and a second time with my book club. I highly recommend this book. It never disappoints.
5	1374883200	This book was wonderfully written. I read it then suggested it for my book club. I just finished it for the second time.  I loved it again. I would recommend it to everyone I know.
5	1374883200	What an emotional story and so well written. I couldn't put it down. So beautifully written. Our book club will have an interesting discussion, I'm sure.
5	1374883200	I read this book on the recommendation of Amazon and other professional reviewers.I would highly recommend this book to everyone.  The story line is unique and out of the ordinary.  It was very poignant and made me cry at the end.  I absolutely loved it.
4	1374883200	I really enjoyed this novel, though I had some doubts to begin with.  It takes place in 1920's Australia, but is really rather timeless in it's storyline and ideas.  It kept my attention throughout, caused a few tears to flow, and I may have learned a thing or two about lighthouses, which I enjoy visiting and photographing.
4	1374883200	The story poses an ethical dilemma of enormous proportions, and the husband ultimately can't live with the decision, which makes the outcome even more wrenching.  What would you do is a great question, however.
4	1374883200	Liked the &#34;history&#34; lesson  about the War and also some of the information about Light Houses.  The story was very believable and sweet..
4	1374883200	The Light Between Oceans: A Novel was an interesting book. I was instantly drawn into the plot and characters within the first few chapters, and I continued to read it whenever I could. However, after a certain point, it became confusing, upsetting and even a little boring. It was a good book to read once I got into it, but it certainly wouldn't be on my top 25 books I've read. However, The Light Between Oceans: A Novel is a good book if you're looking for something to fill your time.
5	1374883200	Loved it!  It made me cry. Not many books do that anymore. It's a book I wish I had written, and I have written two award-winning novels. Satisfying in every way.
5	1374883200	I loved this!  It's beautifully written.  I could almost smell the salt air and see the gorgeous lighthouse.  Tom's love for Isabel is timeless and their love for Lulu is a testimony.  Their journey is heart-wrenching...I could not put my kindle down!  Well done, Stedman!!
3	1374883200	Somewhat entertaining, pretty predicable and educational about light houses..  Good read would recommend the book.  The love story was done well.
3	1374883200	The  light between oceans is a good read. The story captivates the reader from the beginning.  The story is about a young soldier returning from World War I. He meets a young girl and they marry. The war has traumatized him. He seeks an appointment attending a lighthouse in the ocean 100 miles offshore from the barrier reef. One not acquainted with Australian  geography would wonder why you need a lighthouse 100 miles from shore. The great barrier reef can extend that far from shore. The reader is also concerned by the lack of common sense Displayed by both characters. He is so in love with her he fails to make good choices. She is so desperate for a family and so lonrly she fails to make good choices. All of which comes back to hop in the end. And spite of their questionable judgment the story is a very good read. It is easy for the reader to relate to the loneliness that each character feels. I give this book 3 stars and recommend it.
5	1374883200	Well developed plot and characters. Interesting to consider the life of a remote lighthouse watchman. Easy to get caught up in this complicated moral dilemma.
5	1374883200	Great book I loved the characters, the setting and everything about this book! the main character is a man any woman could love and respect.
5	1374883200	I could not put this book down. a lot of my friends don't have a kindle reader so I told them to go to the library or buy the book. I will be looking for more from this writer
5	1374883200	The story line seem a little cheesy with a baby washing up soon after a miscarriage but the development in characters make up for it. I was a little surprised the way it ended and glad I was wrong. I like books that let you know what the characters are thinking. These characters were believable.
5	1374883200	Best book I have read in a long time. Really makes you stop and think about what you would do. Easy read, relatable characters!
3	1374883200	Tom, a war hero and Isabelle a feisty young woman, fall in love, marry and move to live out  their ideal life on the secluded lighthouse. Only it is not so ideal.  After three miscarriages, Izzy is distraught and Tom is unable to console her.  Then one day a small boat washes ashore with a wee tot inside and a dead man.  You can guess what happens next.  All drama and heartache ensues.  The book is slow in the beginning, but the second half goes faster and the ending is lovely
4	1374883200	A good story, well told.  Holds your interest from beginning to end.Well drawn characters. Great selection for book discussions.
5	1374883200	One of my favorite books.  Incredibly and beautifully written.  Wonderful character development and an amazing story.  Will touch your heart.
5	1374883200	Loved the wonderful way the author developed and presented the deepest thoughts and feelings of the characters in this engrossing story of a couple's love, hope, joy, sorrow and despair and the impact their lives and choices had on others.  I would strongly recommend this book.  And I look forward to reading other books by this very talented writer
4	1374883200	Terrific read. Unique story. A lot of sadness but the world is full of that and I thought the end was not so easily predictable and quite wonderful. A solid first novel. I hope Ms. Stedman finds some other historical fiction topics to create a story from.
5	1374883200	I found The Light Between Oceans to be an incredibly romantic, thrilling and heart-wrenching story.  It was a book that you couldn't wait to turn the page and see what was going to happen next.  I was actually sorry to have it end.  I would highly recommend this book.
5	1374796800	Good writing and interesting setting and characters. Keeps you guessing as to the outcome.I would recommend this book for a book club selection.
5	1374796800	Once you start it, you can't put it down. Have a box of tissues handy...but that being said, you will smile a lot to.
4	1374796800	I enjoyed the book and wondered about yet understood the behavior of a woman who has lost 3 babies and is so isolated.  I imagined several ways the author could resolve the problems but what happened is the only real way things could/should turn out.I did find the changes in tense throughout the book was insteresting.
5	1374796800	This book was not one of the normal reads where you kind of know what is going to happen.  I thought there were lots of twists and turns.  I was intrigued with the workings of the lighthouse as it was back then.  Interesting book.
2	1374796800	Well written held my attention for the entire book  Good character development . Felt all their pain and dispare. Thanks for the read.
4	1374796800	This story seems s bit unreal but I enjoyed it anyway. If you enjoy a story that includes the ocean, romance and heartbreak, this book is for you!
4	1374796800	We read this for our book club.  We had lots of great discussion since there were many interesting characters. Trying to imagine ourselves in the same positions, and relating to personal experiences we had some great sharing.
5	1374796800	Really good...made me nervous wondering what wld happen...like all the references to Australia and other cultures, the geography and info re lighthouses and how they are managed
4	1374796800	I am so glad that I stayed committed to this novel - because in the beginning things were moving too slowly and I seriously considered abandoning it for another book.  So, stick it out through the first fourth of the story, and you will be pleasantly surprised with the rest.  The tale takes surprising twists and turns, and as the reader you are left pondering how it's going wrap up in the end.  I am so pleased with the ending, and even though I cried through the last couple of pages, M.L. Stedman picked an ideal way to finish this beautifully, complex story about love and family.
5	1374710400	Hard to put down novel.  Shows the pain of wanting a child and not being able to carry one. Shows desperation of keeping a child that is not yours. It also shows the pain of losing a child.  I enjoyed learning about lighthouses.
5	1374710400	Twists and surprises kept me glued to the pages the last half of the book. I couldn't predict, and couldn't wait to find out the outcome of a situation.
2	1374710400	This book what not what I expected. The author seemed to be trying too hard. The writing was repetitive, the symbolism gaudy, and story found wanting. For a book so highly recommended, I was disappointed almost the entire way through.
5	1374710400	Still grappling with the morality issues. Caused me a lot of thought after reading. Would of been a great book club read
3	1374710400	This was part of our book club.  It certainly gave us a great deal to discuss, because if you actually tried to put yourself in the shoes of the different characters, you really have to wonder what you would have done in their situation.
5	1374710400	Between my tears, I would say that this is one of the best reads I have come across in a long time! It grabbed me from start to finish!!
5	1374710400	I could not put this book down as I could not wait to see what was going to happen at the end. After reading this book,  I found out that this was the author's first book.  I hope she continues with more books like this one.
4	1374710400	Well written.....a bit slow and drab in discription of places...lesson learned...sometimes nobody comes out a winner. I would have liked a more indepbt description of characters
4	1374710400	A fast read.  Well worth the time.A story of good people making bad decisions.I would never have picked up this book except for the fact that it was my  book club's selection.
5	1374710400	The reading on the back cover got me interested... I love historical fiction, and the couple here grab your heartstrings and make you sympathize what a mother's love means to any mom... recommend this to anyone who loves history, who knows what it is to lose children and how one might react to something that for normal women would be a no brainer, until they are presented with that type of situation.
4	1374710400	Beautiful story and imagery. Definitely not a light read. It makes you think about life and your decisions more seriously, and the language is absolutely lovely. Worth a read.
5	1374710400	What to do??  The characters wrestle with the emotional vs legal aspects of keeping a child washed up on their lighthouse shore. The writing is wonderful, characters easy to relate to identify with.  Compelling.
4	1374710400	This story touches on human emotions on the subject involved in the book and is well written. It gives a little history of what light house keepers did at that time and to be living in a remote setting like that.I did like how the writer also wrote about the child's emotions too as many people only focus on the adult side of matters like this and never what the child thinks or how they are effected.
5	1374624000	Full of emotion. This book kept me reading late into the night. You feel for all the characters in the moral choices the have to make.
4	1374624000	I loved this book.  I was completely wrapped up in the story.  The authors descriptions of the surrounding are superb.
5	1374624000	This book was intriguing and endearing.  An excellent read that kept me wanting to go back for more.  Loved it!
4	1374624000	It was a sad but beautiful story!  I really enjoyed it and the way it was written!  Also, loved the characters!!
3	1374624000	Ok I loved the beginning. Hard boiled hero and girl fall in love and how and odd circumstances.  Excellent writing. Not over dramatic and good description.  But something happens and there is a moral dilemma... I couldn't stand it because I just had to find out what happened. Because of circumstances I knew the middle of the book would be long and drawn out so for the first time ever I skipped the middle. So sorry to the author after all that hard work but I had to!  Painful and heart wrenching but unlike many books I have read recently I thought the end was very well done!  Well written as I have said before.
5	1374624000	This book was incredible!!  A little slow to start, but so worth it!!!  It will have you sobbing in the end!
4	1374624000	Doing the right thing isn't always easy, but it can certainly set you free. Loved the descriptions, the anticipation of &#34;what are they going to do?&#34; and &#34;would I be strong enough in this situation&#34;?
3	1374624000	The book kept my interest for the most part. I knew a rough outline of the story before I read it, and reading it pretty much followed what I knew.It kept my interest enough to read it, but it isn't the best book I have read lately!
5	1374624000	I love lighthouses, so that's why I chose to read this book.  It was, of course, about a lot more than a lighthouse and was very well written.  I would read more from this author.  Great read - realistic ending.
4	1374624000	A story that allows the reader to question how far they'd be willing to go to make their loved ones happy, and whether the end justifies the means. I can't wait to discuss this in book club!
4	1374624000	Very good book, heart wrenching, but I really enjoyed the book. Really makes you think about what you would do in that situation.
5	1374624000	Love historical novels, really enjoyed this one.  Sometimes you do the wrong things for the right reasons.  Really found the ending a good twist.
4	1374624000	Clever story, well written for the most part.  There were areas of the novel that smacked of a second-rate romance but, all in all, a very enjoyable read.
3	1374624000	The book is a little slow at times but worth the read. Would be good for travelling as u can put it down and pick up again.
5	1374537600	This book told a wonderful heart wrenching story. It was a pleasant read which kept your interest throughout. It was recommended to me by many friends and I highly recommend it to you
3	1374537600	Well written but  the heart wrenching drama I was led to expect was not there.  The events unfold as I imagined they would.  The writing is solid but I found the main female character's irritating at times. SPOILER:  I sympathized most with Hannah and I disliked how the writer portrayed the parents who essentially stole this baby.  I don't think I'm supposed to hate the main character!All in all, an okay read but over hyped!
5	1374537600	Beautiful story with many moral issues to discuss. Especially good for a book club to read and ponder.Highly recommend it.
5	1374537600	This is a wonderful story of love and sacrifice for not just a child, but for your partner in life. It's a compelling story that had you wondering what you would do.  Your heart aches for everyone involved in this story.Literally could not quit reading it until I was finished!
4	1374537600	Good story. Heart wrenching but satisfying in the end. Style of writing changed some which would feel odd at times.
5	1374537600	This book is beautifully written. Great beach read! I highly recommend it to all mothers. Makes me long for my grown children.
4	1374537600	It took me a few chapters to get into this book, but I am glad I persevered. I would definitely check out another book by this author.
5	1374537600	Wow!  I couldn't put this book down.  What an amazing story.  I feel as though I have been part of the characters' lives.  I smiled AND I cried as I read this book.  I usually click right past the review option, but I can't let this story go yet. It's one of those books that you keep thinking about after the last page.  It is one of the few five star books I have read.  You will be captured by the writing and the vivid images that the author creates.  This one is a keeper.
4	1374537600	M.L .Stedman did an amazing job bringing all of the characters to life.  You felt as if you knew them all.
4	1374537600	Author:M. L Stedman is an Australian born first time author.  She is now based in London where she previously worked as a lawyer.The setting:Western Australia, in the years intervening the great world wars. The spectre of World War One still hangs heavy over the storyline and serves as a strong backdrop to the feelings of the time.  The War wounds are still open and raw as we discover the hurt anf hardship that has been inflicted on a nation and its people.The plot: Tom, a young decorated war hero, takes up employment as a sole charge lighthouse keeper. Emotionally battle scarred he seeks solace on his Janus Rock posting, an isolated island intersecting the Indian and Southern Oceans. On route to the island he passes through the small coastal port of Point Partageuse, where he befriends a young lady, Isabel. Over the following year, through letters and shore visits their relationship grows and leads to marriage and Isabel joins Tom on Janus Rock. While on the island the couple suffer three crippling miscarriages spiraling Isabel into deep depression. Not long after the third miscarriage a small boat washes up on the island. The couple discover a dead man and crying baby on-board. The grief laden couple make a harrowing decision that is later to have consequences that stretch far beyond their island shores.Highlights:M. L Stedman writes with a disciplined hand keeping the storyline on a tight leash never allowing the vivid descriptions of the island setting and its towering lighthouse overshadow the emotional force of the plot and characterization.Deft empathetic touches feature throughout the book as Stedman has the uncanny ability to make the reader feel as the character feels.  This raw emotion is captured brilliantly when Isabel is seduced by the notion that the baby's cry heard from the washed up boat was in fact the cry from her still born child.Quote:"When a baby's cry came to her on the wind, she looked instinctively to the new grave.  Before logic could interfere, there was a moment when her mind told her it had all been a mistake - this last child had not been stillborn early, but was living and breathing." (pg121/122)Great for:Very "book club material", as the moral dilemma presents rich fodder for discussions into the bigger questions of life. The story examines what happens when moral decisions are made under extreme circumstances and how emotion can play havoc with reason. Uncomplicated in her thematic approach and void of any moral crusading, Stedman succeeds in allowing the reader to make their own moral judgments as the story leads them down uncertain paths.Romance novel fans can also use this book as a pathway towards reading literary fiction.  The book  does have many romantic elements which romance fans will enjoy and best yet the book's plot is simple and easy to read.
5	1374537600	The author was able to evoke sympathy for all the characters, even though they couldn't all get what they needed.  Great moral dilemma, very thought provoking.
4	1374537600	So easy to relate to the characters and you keep reading hoping that everyone will be happy.  I also enjoyed the setting...
5	1374451200	I really enjoyed this book.  I like the light imagery and the attention to nature.  I also liked the story line and enjoyed understanding the characters and their motivations.  I like books that engage me and give me something to think about.  The Light Between Oceans did just that.
5	1374451200	This book tells a story of wrong made right no matter the outcome. Your chooses effect more than your own life
3	1374451200	I spent a lot of time feeling sorry for the characters - all of them. I had expected more of a mystery.
5	1374451200	An Excellent read!  The writing style is beautiful.  Descriptive to the point where you see everything without it being over done.  Truly loved this book and have recommended it to many
4	1374451200	This was an interesting read.  The moral dilemma presented early in the book grabbed your interest and took you through the story to the end. The characters were well developed and real. I really enjoyed it.
3	1374451200	I was drawn into the novel by the quality of the writing in the early chapters.  Like many readers I am sure, it was hard to get through the middle of the story when the idyllic isolated life at the lighthouse is shattered.  It is always difficult for the reader when the author focuses on the actions of unlikable characters, or has characters in which the reader has emotionally invested a great deal of sympathy act in a difficult, painful fashion. Although the reader may have wished for a different,&#34;happier&#34; ending to the story, I found the ending was realistic and emotionally compelling.
4	1374451200	It was a beautiful story filled with joy and saddness.  Though it started slow I could not put the book down.
5	1374451200	A beautiful story, exquisitely told, about a childless couple who find themselves suddenly with an infant that appears mysteriously in their lives.  It is beautiful and heart breaking, and you will be caught up in its enchantment.
5	1374451200	No one could tell from the title alone that this book is absolutely brilliant. The writer captures all of the characters' personalities so that you know them well and can almost predict how they are going to react in situations. This book would make a great movie. Hope to see it on the big screen someday.
4	1374451200	This book was wonderfully written and made you feel like you knew the characters personally. I finished it in 3 days and was sad to see it end.
4	1374451200	This novel was very well written and I enjoyed it very much,  There were times while reading it when I felt it moved a little slowly and it felt a bit repetitive.
5	1374451200	This is really her first novel? I would have thought she was a veteran writer. So well done! Beautiful but sad, believable and so realistic. Thank you, definitely recommend!
5	1374451200	This book was recommended by a friend by asking &#34;asking what would I do if presented by the same circumstances?&#34; This  question intrigued me, so I had to read to understand her question.  I learned about the life of a Lighthouse keeper and family, a very lonely and isolated life!!!!.  Without giving away the story, I would have handled the find a great deal differently.  Twists and turns keep you interested to the end.  I hope others would enjoy this book.
3	1374451200	A good study of how our decisions, good and bad, shape our lives. Some of the reading was difficult because author is Australian and many words, etc. are not familiar to an American reader. As compelling as some of the story is, the trite B movie ending was a major let-down.
2	1374451200	Start to finish, this was just a little too depressing... The bleak parts of any good novel that are usually balanced with beautiful, hopeful parts are replaced, in this book, by boring descriptions of lighthouse terms and history. And I love lighthouses in general, but yeesh, I could not muster up the energy to care about all those bland descriptions or the backstory of every single character mentioned.It was a very captivating plotline, and it was something I wanted to see through to the end, but once I reached the end I realized that the book had fallen on the side of "too bleak." Looking back, it even started out that way.Could certainly be interesting or worthwhile for another reader, just not my cup of tea.
4	1374451200	I like to read true crime typically, but this book description intrigued me. I especially like a story that you can't guess what's going to happen next.
4	1374451200	I enjoyed the book, love the sea... the dilemma of their happiness. It was a good read and well written.
5	1374451200	I enjoyed the book , I was hooked from the beginning to the end. I recommend it for a good read.
5	1374451200	Rarely have I read a book in which I felt empathy for every character, but with this book I did. The morally complex plot draws you in from the first page to the last. Driven by the pain of losing a child, how far would you go? Each character carries their own pain and driving motivations which you can totally understand. Very hard to make a judgement as to who is right and who is wrong. A beautifully written book about love and loss.
3	1374364800	One has to know where this whole plot was going. I cried for the child and both mothers. I felt bad for everyone.
5	1374364800	I enjoyed the reading of the light between oceans.  I was a story that took me into the lives of story.  I hated to see the book end.  I wanted to continue in their lives.
5	1374364800	I loved this story!  I thought about it for days after I read it.  I have told all my friends and highly recommend it.
4	1374364800	This is deeply felt story with complex characters.  A mother's love is revealed as true as has ever been written.  It tugs at your heartstrings and doesn't let go.
4	1374364800	A couple living in isolation on a lighthouse island off the southwest coast discover a live, healthy baby that drifts up, along with a corpse that turns out to be the baby's father, in a small boat. Having experienced the agony of loosing three at childbirth, (one recently) the wife insists on keeping and raising the child. After a few years, on an infrequent trip to the mainland, they learned that the identity of the biological mother. Evidence presented to authorities by a quarterly lighthouse island food deliverer results in the arrest of the husband, who protects his wife by maintaining that he force her into accepting his decision to keep the child. The saga takes many unsuspecting turns before the final and sad outcome.Even though this is primarily a chick book (some) men will enjoy it.
5	1374364800	Catches you right from the beginning and keeps getting better. A story that makes you think.  What would you do. A must read!
4	1374364800	A portrait of a beautiful, loving couple  whose storybook marriage is thrown into chaos through an act of deceit. Isabel's burning desire for a child nearly destroys her, until her devoted husband, Tom agrees to collude in the unthinkable. Blindsided by love, he agrees to participate in this act of unspeakable deceit to ease her pain and perhaps recapture a bit of the euphoria of their former lives. They continue to live their secret in deluded happiness, until one day when their house of cards begins to crumble. At the heart of this story lies a moral dilemna without villains, only victims.Yes, this book is beautifully crafted with an engaging story, first transporting readers into a world of fanciful fiction that eventually crashes into shards of painful choices fraught with raw emotions.Lois W.

4	1374364800	This book held your interest and made you sympathetic to all people involved.  It also provided details on a lifestyle of a light keeper that was very interesting.
4	1374364800	it is a great story, quite intriguing,  but it does deal with some difficult issues.  Some who have encountered similar issues may find this a hard book to read.
5	1374364800	This book was recommended by my sister. I loved it as much as she did. I could sympathize with each character and have no idea what I would do in similar situations. The author really made the people real.
5	1374364800	Beautifully written tale of a couple very much in love, but who need, but can not have, a child to complete their life.
5	1374364800	Refreshing to read a well written intriguing story with a unique plot and characters you feel you've met.Good read
3	1374364800	SERIOUSLY? She doesn't let Lucy come around until ONE WEEK after Isabel's dead. What a crappy ending. Besides that, interesting story. Good writing.
5	1374364800	I rated this book a five star because the plot was so gripping. I was always wondering how it was going to turn out, making the book a page turner. It gripped my heart and I felt I knew the characters intimately. I am amazed that this was Stedman's first novel. BRAVO!
5	1374364800	Wow, what a read!The descriptions of the oceans on the western side of Australia are really interesting. The story line is fascinating, especially as it uses recent experiences of the ANZAC soldiers in WWI to describe the struggles of the main character.It's also a beautiful love story.
5	1374278400	I loved this book!  The writing was beautiful, the characters and story were original and the setting was wonderful.  Didn't want to get to the end.
5	1374278400	I read so many books on my Kindle that I frequently forget which ones I reviewed, which one I loved.  I had to reread the last chapters of the book to write a coherent review.This book is the one of the few I have rated 5 star.  "Why"? I asked myself.  So I re-read the ending so I could speak intelligently.This book hit me at a visceral level.  I felt the feelings and experiences the main characters  had as a small family of three.  This book is completely genuine and is not repetitive in action, sentiments or style.  I have rarely read such an original book.  There are no real villains or heroes here.  There are simply people who struggle with love, conscience, upbringing, etc.The book is a poignant mystery, a commentary on common folks dealing with an uncommon situation.I found this book to be true to real human actions and results.  The book is also beautifully written and the characters are believable in the most realistic way.If you want to switch from Action Thrillers (which I frequently read) to something truly emotional, suspenseful and honest, read this book.  It is a truly different reading experience.S OBrien
5	1374278400	What a nice surprise - I downloaded it on a whim because it was a Kindle sale book but I LOVED it. It has an unusual plot in a setting that is rarely used (Australia in the early century). Highly recommend this book.
5	1374278400	I loved this book.  The characters, the writing, the story.  I could feel the joy, the despair, and the love between Tom and Isabel.  Beautifully written
5	1374278400	Great read, and a truly remarkable story. I have no idea what I would have done in Isabel's position, but I hope I would have done the right thing.
5	1374192000	A friend recommended this and I am glad she did.  I loved every page.  I used to live at a lighthouse so I had a special interest.
5	1374192000	Kept my interest .a little slow starting and almost put it down.glad I did not.could not wait to see what was coming next.life can be rough.the ups and down s can make you crazy.
4	1374192000	I had a hard time getting started with this book.  Once a certain turning point occurred, I had a hard time putting it down.  Good book!
5	1374192000	What  a beautiful story.  Once  I started I couldn't put  it down.  So truthfully, it describes the love of a mother (and father) and child.  I cried through the end, the words touched me and I was sad it was over!!  I will be reading more from this author for sure!
5	1374192000	Stedman is a plot queen. This story was so well put together and thus so incredibly difficult to put down. It left me wanting more.
3	1374192000	A pleasant read with appealing characters.  The moral  dilemma  was intriguing and the resolution sad but satisfying.  The setting was a perfect reflection of the story.
5	1374192000	These characters were very well developed and I came to love them and feel deeply involved in their conflicts and relationships.  I got lost in this book and that is one of the reasons I love reading.
4	1374192000	The story line was interesting.  The turn of events was plausible.  I can imagine this actually happening with a young couple who had lost so many children through no fault of their own.  It was an interesting book.
5	1374192000	Book was very well written and crafted.  Chock full of moral dilemmas and plot twists.  Characters were real and identifiable.  Book was hard to put down.
5	1374192000	Good author and it kept you interested. Different than most may be because she is an Aussie and location is Australia. Would read another book of hers.
5	1374192000	Loved this book which has moved onto a short list of all time favorites. I look forward to Stedman's next book.
4	1374105600	The angst of people who make decisions in the moment. This book is a personal emotional journey that unfolds from one compassionate and selfish decision. You can never go back and make it different.
4	1374105600	It is a first novel by this author and it is powerful. It relates to current issues involving around biological parents vs. adoptive parents.
5	1374105600	This was such a moving story! I was happy, sad, scared, worried, and heartbroken right along with all the characters. The writing is so good, I could picture myself in Australia on Janus with them! It shows how some bad decisions made by truly good people affected not only themselves but so many other people around them. I thought it was sad, but its still a story that I will definitely read again.
4	1374105600	I really enjoyed this book.  The setting was interesting, and the characters were well drawn.  The ending was realistic, I thought.
5	1374105600	I cried all the way through this well written novel.  The story of how people struggle with right and wrong and profound love.  Not an easy read but one you won't soon forget.  I would love to see this as a movie.  I think the bleakness of living on such a small island, flashbacks to the war, and the love story would be riveting on screen, unlike most every other book I have read.
5	1374105600	There is such a conflict in this story, one that seems rational for both sides.  A heartfelt story of parents' love for their child.
4	1374105600	This is a lovely and sad love story that will literally have you in tears especially in the final chapter. It is well written and conjures up images of the beauty and bleakness of both the ocean and the life of a lighthouse keeper. The story also reminds us that secrets and truths untold often come back to haunt us.
5	1374105600	The author did an awesome job with this book however it was very emotional for me. At the end I found myself crying uncontrollably. I felt the pain of the three main characters and really would have preferred a happier ending. However life doesn't always give us happy endings and there are many timely lessons to be learned from the story.
4	1374105600	The book kept my interest, but wasn't one I absolutely couldn't put down.  Isabel wasn't the most likable person --selfish is how I would describe her.
4	1374105600	Wonderfully written! Beautiful story. Not as sad as everyone makes it out to be. Anticipating her next book. _ lp
5	1374105600	Spellbinding. Haven't read a book this wonderful in a long time. I didn't want it to end. You feel like the characters are a part of your life.
5	1374105600	From beginning to end.  The emotional and moral conflicts in this novel will keep you guessing to the end. It is a heart wrenching expos&eacute; of the bond that love brings and the emotional highs and lows that decisions make in one's life.  There may be some phrases that appear not to be of the era, but they do not detract from the story which draws one in.
4	1374105600	Not bad for a first book, the story was interesting, sad ending...interesting subject matter. A worthy read. I'll recommend it friends.
5	1374105600	I really enjoyed this book. It had a good pace and I like the style of writing. I got emotional at the end.
5	1374105600	Was enlighting to hear about life on an lighthouse island.  Enjoyed the story and development of the characters.  About forgiveness and making a wrong into a right.
3	1374105600	I enjoyed the first half of the book as the plot developed but the two main characters began to annoy me with the decisions they made and their actions-I felt it was unrealistic
4	1374105600	Very touching and sad end to the book. I just wished a happy ending. But that is life. I really liked how the author really made me feel what izzy and tom had felt through their lives together
5	1374019200	The first couple of chapters bored me so much, that I considered putting it down.  BUT, I'm so glad I continued reading it because it was AMAZING.  The characters were developed well and the story was compelling.  I will be trying to find more from M.L. Stedman.
4	1374019200	It took me a while to get into it, but once I passed a key moment in the story, I was drawn in till the end.  Since English is my second language I can say that it was challenging at times but that is why I read on my Kindle as it allows me to highlight any word I don't know and get the definition.  So this story was interesting and a very good read.  I would not say it was a page-turner for me, but I enjoyed it.
4	1374019200	Enjoyed the book.  Brings one think about what they would do in a similar situation.  Very good and interesting book.
5	1374019200	This novel was hard to put down. It's one of the best I've read in a good while. I loved it.
5	1374019200	This is a &#34;you cannot put it down book&#34;  with many moral and ethical dilemmas.  I highly recommend it.  Best book I have read all summer.
5	1374019200	Thought it was excellant.  Was hard to put down. Great book for book club.  It was a great book to discuss and appealed to each of us.
5	1374019200	Powerful, moving and thought provoking. I think this book portrays the depth and ferocity of a mother's love more than any other that I have read.
5	1374019200	This is an amazing book and I am only half way through it. I look forward to the end of this book. and more from this author
4	1374019200	I loved her use of words not often seen in todays writing.  Would have liked a different ending, but it held my attention until the end.  An excellent book that I have recommended to all my friends.
5	1374019200	This book is worth reading just to experience the descriptions of the Island,  Add to that the dynamic story of lost motherhood.  It is a very compelling story!
2	1374019200	Pace was painfully slow, characters one-dimensional, writing style maudlin.  I didn't feel any depth of relationship and Tom's failure to act, chapter after chapter, was insufferable.
1	1374019200	I love a good story, and love a good romance even better, but this book was a sore disappointment. While the author has beautiful moments of writing, the underdeveloped characters, shifting storyline, and forced plot are at once maddening and typical. The author also does more telling than showing when it comes to plot, giving snippets of influential moments haphazardly, and leaving the rest of the book to unfold in cliches. Recommended for a book club, I stuck with the story to the end, and found after 150 pages I was intently curious how things would play out. My hopes lifted for at least a happy conclusion, I was again disappointed by the book's resolution. The only solice I can take is that the end of the book was as much of a let down as the hundred or so pages that began it
3	1374019200	I found the story interesting and the process ethically challenging which,of course, is what impacts the crisis in the story.  Nt a bad first book
5	1374019200	A tear jerker in the end that is the perfect book for a book group.it is hard to put down as live and love lead you through the time after WWII when live was still raw and affected daily by the  actions of hatred.Interesting to see the quiet of lighthouse tending.
3	1374019200	Bawled through the last chapter or two and stayed up too late on a work night to finish, which surprised me because this book was add to get into.
4	1374019200	It was a good story, an original story.  I have never read anything similar.The characters were well-developed and their actions and reactions seemed very plausible.  I learned a lot about the workings of a lighthouse, which I never knew anything about before.  Also, the feeling of living isolated on an island came through very well.  And the story brought home the fact that Australia's seasons are the reverse of North America's, which I knew but have not experienced.I was a little disappointed with the weak ending which seemed unnecessarily sad.But, all in all, it was worth reading and I would recommend it.  It has romance and suspense and a predicament which seems it cannot be resolved without leaving someone unhappy.
4	1374019200	Very well written with amazing character development and great descriptions of the life of a lighthouse keeper. Without becoming tiresome, the author gives us insight into the world of this unusual occupation.The book was hard to put down!  I look forward to reading more by M.L.Steadman.
5	1373932800	This is a beautiful story that anyone can appreciate. Many moral questions will leave you thinking about what you might do if you were in any of the character's shoes. Great read
4	1373932800	Lets you think about the decisions you make, with the best intentions, may not always work out for the better. Definitely kept me interested from the beginning and hard to put down.
5	1373932800	Do yourself a favor and read this book! The only problem that you might have (if you are as sentimental as I am) is that at the end, you will have a headache and swollen eyes....not just from crying-but from sobbing.I can't say enough about this book-it moved me more than most-and I read a LOT.Yes, it's a story set on an island lighthouse that sounds incredibly beautiful. But the real story is about what the light in the lighthouse represents: love, loss, and LIFE.The love of a woman for her husband and the strong bond between a parent and a child. It's also about how both good and bad come and go in our lives...like the storms, the waves, etc.And about how each of us knows deep inside what is RIGHT.... and it is up to each of us to decide exactly how much that 'right' means to us.Be sure to have plenty of tissues ready near the end...because in the end, all that matters is love-and-that time goes on.
4	1373932800	This book was well written and centers on ethical dilemmas encountered when parents desperately want a child after recurrent pregnancy loss. The ending drags a bit, but in general this is an excellent story that is worth reading. I give it a 4.25/5.00!
5	1373932800	I loved this book!!! Couldn't put it down. Very well written, liked the characters. I would highly recommend it. Look forward to more from this author.
4	1373932800	Beautifully written story about good and evil, light and dark, safety and danger...how lives can be affected years later by choices we made. Thought-provoking...I recommend it!
3	1373932800	I would have given this a higher rating if it hadn't been so painful to read. The writing was excellent and it was a great story, but it was just so sad. I'm not a mother, but reading about the pain of losing a child was difficult. I often made the mistake of reading this at night before bed,which is normally a relaxing act, but this one always caused my heart rate to increase. In this heartbreaking novel (that's what it says in the description, so I should have known), a lighthouse keeper's wife suffers miscarriage after miscarriage, and so when a boat washes up with a dead man and his living baby, she feels that the baby is a gift from God and that she must take on a new role as her mother. So many people are affected by her decision, which is understandable but also selfish, given that she mostly wanted the baby to replace her own loss, never bothering to find out if that mother was alive (spoiler alert: she was). The husband, Tom, is an unwilling participant and spends the following years trying to make things right. The pain endured by all involved was just so hard to witness because, though its fiction, readers have to know that this sort of thing has happened to so many people everywhere.
4	1373932800	An enchanting story and incredible twist. Shows young readers a world we have never envisioned before. I would strongly recommend.
4	1373932800	This book is beautifully written. The main characters are well developed. However it was sad. I would have liked a happier ending.
5	1373932800	I loved the characters in this book. I wanted it to work out for all involved. The conflict will keep you reading to the end. This was an excellent first novel. Congrats to the author!
3	1373932800	Too much detail once the story got going ... but it was an okay beach read.  Ending kind of went too fast, or it was just weak.
4	1373932800	Good book overall.  The ending definitely makes you think about what is truly &#34;right&#34; versus &#34;wrong,&#34; and how the perception of those concepts is variable for different people regarding the same event.
5	1373932800	This story was emotionally strong, compelling and at the same time satisfying.  I enjoyed every part, even through my tears.  An exceptional read.
5	1373932800	The writing of this book is exquisite and the characters very rich and fully developed.  You don't know where the story is going . . . which can be uncomfortable, but is intriguing.
3	1373932800	The writing is lovely, the story sad.  This is a rainy day book not a summer beach read.  The people are a bit weird.
5	1373846400	The conflict of conscience was heart wrenching while written very well. A book I could not put down. The multiple plot lines added to the overall appeal of the story.
5	1373846400	I loved the light between oceans I even cried at the ending! It was mystery, love and compassion for human beings.
5	1373846400	The characters were very well developed and the plot was also well thought out.  It is a stroy that makes one think of the situations for all, and for once, the child's point of view.
5	1373846400	A well written book with a page turning story. The characters have depth and I cared about them. Touching and interesting.
5	1373846400	Very moving story. Excellent writing style. It has the power to evoke deep emotions in anyone who is or ever was a parent.
4	1373846400	I read the book in our community book club. The first three chapters are slow, so keep reading, the story gets better and is amazing!
5	1373846400	I couldn't put this book down.  The writer does a good job of exploring human emotions in very difficult situations with realism that draws the reader in.
4	1373846400	Well knit multi-layered story that seems to be coming in part from the very real experiences of the author, which makes it quite believable.  Engrossing view into the conflict between personal honor and complex commitment.
5	1373846400	A life is really about choices. Tom & Izzy make choices & learn to live with the consequences of their choices. They suffer. They cause suffering. They are forgiven. They forgive each other and ultimately they forgive themselves.
5	1373846400	I felt the love and torment that each of these characters felt. And I shed tears right along with them. Beautiful.
5	1373846400	This beautifully written book engages the reader from the first page. It is a vivid portrait of life after WW1 in Austrailia as well as good intentions turning out badly .M
5	1373846400	A very enjoyable book.  Kept me interested in the story and loved the ending.  Every woman should have a man love her like that.
5	1373760000	I enjoyed this book from the first page. The characters are well drawn and interesting. The reader could feel Isabel's pain when her babies were stillborn, and her joy when a gift from God literally appears out of the blue. Tom wants to do the right thing and tries for the entire book to right the wrong he feels has been done. Happy is not always the best ending and this one was a tear jerker but it was one I could accept.
3	1373760000	At the beginning of this book I found myself thinking this was going to be a new favorite book. Sadly, the book started lagging, and it honestly took be a while to finish. I have very little complaints about the writing. I finished this book on a flight, and I found myself wiping away tears. I felt like the ending was a great way to wrap the story up. I give this book a 3, because the writing style was really good. In general, the book was good, not amazing.
4	1373760000	I am an Aussie fan.I found the story fascinating and heart breaking...The ending was dwindeling and not as powerful as the rest of the book.Thanks,Maya
5	1373760000	Best thing I've read in a while. Good story, interesting world, big dilemmas and emotion. Really good read, I recommend it!
5	1373760000	I loved this book because I could relate to the reasons why she kept the baby and also the real mothers feelings. It touched your heart for both of them.I felt it was a little slow starting but then I couldn't put it down
4	1373760000	The Light Between Oceans is a well written and good story. You really didn't know how it was going to end until the last few chapters.
5	1373760000	It has been a very long time since I have read a book that was intelligent and very well written.  No spelling mistakes,  No grammar mistakes.  But best of all interesting and sad and emotional.  You could feel the highs and lows and would highly, highly recommend this novel.  Made me cry at one point I had to put the book down because I felt the story.  Do yourself a favour and read this.
1	1373760000	I found that Stedman writes well about the sea, rocks and the lighthouse, but I found the plot predictable and the people cardboard.
5	1373760000	The minute I started this book, I was completely immersed in the story.  I finished the book in 2 days which is unheard of for me.
3	1373760000	I prefer less flowery prose and I did not particularly sympathize with the primary female character. I thought the story overall was rather weak but I did like the technical and historical information about light houses pre World War II and the author really captured the unrelenting isolation of life out on the edge of the world.
4	1373673600	Well written and a compelling story.  The tale of how each person has their own battles to fight as they grapple with what life bestows on them.
5	1373673600	Loved the complexity of the characters and circumstances. As story unfolds and comes to an end you realize there could be no better ending.
5	1373673600	Such a beautifully written and heartwretching story. You'll have trouble putting it down. My only problem was trying to read through the tears.
5	1373673600	One of the most moving stories I've read in a decade. Every moment spent in these pages is time spent in the grasp of this masterful storyteller.I'm not sure why I avoided this book for so long. The reviews I'd read made me feel as if it was a sad story and I didn't want sad. While I cried (probably more than I should have) I was left with a feeling of hope, and joy, that I had grown to know these characters. I'm sure someone is clamoring for the movie rights. This is one of those stories that rarely come along. A story that shows us the best and the worst of us but also reminds us that the simplest things are what make life such an interesting road to travel.And Tom. Where are the men like Tom??
5	1373673600	Starts out alittle slow, but becomes a book you can't put down.It's about honor, value and love that never ends.It's a heart touching story. One you will remember long after the story ends.Highly recommend this book
4	1373673600	After a couple of years on a Western Front Tom Sherbourne returns home to Australia. He is promised and takes a job as a light house keeper on a very isolated island that is over ten hours away from  the coast. The closest town to the island is a small town named Point Partageuse. From there he arrives to the island and in this town before he leaves for the island he meets a beautiful and very strong willed, honest and direct girl by the name Izabel, who becomes his wife.Together they build a life on the remote island, a perfect life for them, by all accounts happy, but complications arrive from Izabel's loosing her children in miscarriages or their death at birth. And then a boat arrives, bringing to their shore a dead man and a baby girl. In spite of Tom's desire to make it a well known fact, by registering the facts in a log of a light keeper, he had to give in to his wife's plea to wait a bit and the child stays with them. They named her Lucy. From there on its only a matter of time when the tragedy of good people making bad decisions evolves. Its is written in a bit of a predictable manner, but it's still well written. For me it was a pleasant and easy reading. Also this book is written by a writer who knows well Australia. That made it very interesting. Facts of history or life on this still young continents is a big portion of this book.
4	1373673600	Most of the time, I read only non fiction. I don't know what drew me to this book but I am so glad I read it. Hands down, the best I have read in many years. Some profound things are said about forgiveness and the wasted energy we expend to nurse a regret every day. I intend to read it again. It is full of beautiful phrases and sentences
5	1373673600	Engaging story that draws in the heart and mind. Life lessons wrapped between elegant lines. I will recommend this to my community of readers.
5	1373673600	Great story.  I was really happy it was a choice for our Pinot and Pages book club so I could discuss it!Excellent to read on the Kindle and handy to research unknown words.
5	1373587200	Keeps the reader involved.  Greart ending with the girl becoming a grown up and missing the opportunity to meet the wife.
5	1373587200	This is a definite must read. I loved the characters and the storyline. One of the best books I have read in a while!!
4	1373587200	This book about a lightkeeper and his wife set in the 1920's Australia had my emotions running high throughout. The choices that weighed on their conscience had me questioning what I might do faced with the same situation. I would not call this a love story. I would just call it a story about lives and decisions and consequences.
5	1373587200	Excellent.  This story is peopled with well drawn characters. The descriptions of the ocean and island made me wish I could be there
5	1373587200	Just loved this Book, since I grew up on a Bay on the Northsea ( Germany) I understood what they were talking about.And it kept you interested for sure.
4	1373587200	Life has its moral dilemmas to be faced, and this novel centered around a life changing one for the characters involved. Although parts of the storyline were rather slow, overall, Stedman's details built the suspense of the storyline and added to its interest. It was heart-wrenching at times and exhilarating at others.
4	1373587200	Interesting read with many interlaced aspects that kept it interesting, from the solitude of the island / lighthouse....the ups & downs of the main characters lives..the unexpected arrival on the island....to the life decisions and impacts made based only on love.  Great story.....fun read
5	1373587200	Wonderful read.  Good character descriptions.  Good life story.  Not a predictible ending. Recommended for those who enjoy a good  story about lifes trials.
5	1373587200	It was a very DEEP love story...............in so many ways, from the very beginning to the surprise ending. I couldn't put it down!
4	1373587200	I liked learning about the culture of living at a lighthouse.  I thought the circumstances were a little unbelievable, yet I was definitely drawn into them.  I kept wondering what was going to happen.
5	1373587200	I felt the story was very believable considering everything Isabelle went thru to make a life for herself & Tom.  Being so isolated from the rest of the world for much of the year, she allowed herself to believe that God had intervened with their lives by sending them an infant.  It was very unfortunate that her & Tom's actions, so well-meaning on the onset, affected 2 families lives so profoundly.  LOVED this book!
5	1373587200	A beautiful tender, touching love story that has surprises along the way, I definately could read it a second time
5	1373587200	This is great book club read. Plenty to talk about and so well written! My club us reading right now and I'm so excited to hear their thoughts.  I know they are gonna love it like I did.
2	1373587200	I came to this book with at least medium-high expectations. . .after reading comments by Maile Meloy and others. . .and after seeing that Amazon did select the book as one of it's best of the month in 2012.  Re the kudos from Amazon  - I surely don't agree.  My best "five star" books either are life-changing or written in prose I find absolutely stunning. . .then, failing that. . . in descending order. .  - I look for characterization, arc of plot, and always - how well the book is written.The plot of "The Light. . ." seemed totally contrived - almost maudlin.  I'm thinking it needs to be a Lifetime movie.  Seriously.Sadly, the writing didn't help -it hindered the story.  I started underlining all of Stedman's overused metaphors and similes but got tired of doing that pretty early on.  The flowery descriptions of nature, the ocean. . .too too much!  And those descriptions that were meant to perhaps set a mood - just of no value.Here's the wild part - I didn't like this book at all but what I got some value from it - - - I spent several hours googling Australia in the early 20th century - reading about the ANZAC Forces in WWI - the tremendous lossesthe Australians suffered,and the battle of Gallipoli. This info was new to me.That same week I read a book by AM Homes - she's on my short list of terrificwriters.  As expected, I found it so darn satisfying - so for any of you who didn't like thisbook - try her books.  I had just finished "This Book Will Save Your Life".  The writing just WORKS!!
5	1373587200	I think the author set up an interesting dilema for the protagonists to deal with.  The characters were convincing, and I enjoyed the plot development.
5	1373587200	It was well written, the characters were lovable and real and it makes you think about the human behavior and how you would handle situations for love. Also gave great insight into the life of lighthouse keepers years ago. Wonderful story.
4	1373500800	Well written. Nice images. Easy to read. The plot kept me involved. As with many novels today, the story flows back and forth in time in the characters' lives. Stedman's style of writing, using symbolism and imagery, gives depth to the story.
5	1373500800	Captivating reading.  Causes one to think of your own values and how you would handle the situation.  At the end..........was there even a possibility of the right solution?????  The answer is up to the individual reader.
4	1373500800	I don't generally read this type of story and don't know why I even purchased it but was pleased that I did.  It was a little drawn out at first and a little dull for me but enjoyed the tenderness of Tom's love and the end was very satisfying.
4	1373500800	A fast reading novel that gets to you emotionally.  One group of characters will rejoice at the saving of a child and another will face devastation at their loss.  Who do you root for?
4	1373500800	Enjoyed this story very much.  It was a huge success at our book club and I would recommend this book for your club as well.
5	1373500800	M.L. Stedman did a very good job of creating characters that you could become involved with. Heartbreaking at points it is a good story that doesn't leave you easily. I would recommend adding this one to your reading list. So when is the movie coming out?
2	1373500800	This book was too slow at the beginning which made me lose interest. I didn't connect with the characters in the story and I feel there was a lack of emotion to the book which I look for in books. I like to feel along with the characters but even though the main storyline is an emotional filled situation... it didn't evoke emotions or connections with me.
4	1373500800	Loved reading!  I was totally absorbed in the story line.  Believable characters with emotions I had no trouble empathizing with along the way.
4	1373500800	Set on a small island, the story of the lighthouse keeper and his love becomes as turbulent as the sea that surrounds them. Unusual plot and satisfying development.  The characters were likable.  Worth reading.
5	1373500800	This book had twists and turns which keeps  the reader interested and looking forward to the story.  You will enjoy it
4	1373500800	Some interesting historical (Australia, WWI) fiction mixed in with a multi-faceted love story (husband/wife, parent/child).  Although written with a lot of Aussie colloquialisms, once I got the rythm of the writer, it was hard to put down!
3	1373500800	The book is good, but it's Aussie English is not easy so is the novel, for some chapters not that easy to read. The end is great
5	1373500800	This book is so beautifully written I found myself marking passages and rereading them simply for their beautiful wording.  What a beautiful presentation of life--its joys, sorrows, losses, and things that confirm the good in us while bringing out our less-than-perfect human side.  Who among us has not struggled with decisions made, knowing that no matter what we do someone will be hurt?
5	1373500800	I'm almost finished reading the book, but even tho it's sad, I really enjoy the story.  The facts about Australia is very interesting too.
5	1373414400	Although this novel has an improbable ending, it was essentially a  very well written.  The character development was complicated and interesting. Enjoyed the book.
5	1373414400	Found the characters in the book had depth and was heart felt. I enjoy reading books in that time era.
5	1373414400	For a long time I put off buying this novel because it was described a a romance. Of course it is a romance but I found it to be so much more than that. There's the historical perspective, which is the main reason I chose it, but also the character development to appreciate. It is so well written I found it difficult to put this book aside. I would definitely recommend this book and look forward to reading another by this author.
3	1373414400	This is a good but heartbreaking story. I thought I would enjoy it better than I did, and sometimes I wondered if I should continue such a depressing book.
4	1373414400	Decisions we make matter.  This book evokes real emotion. Motherhood and fatherhood plus other family relationships weave themselves together with lasting consequences
5	1373414400	Beautifully written story that will pull at the heartstrings of every parent. Stedman's descriptions of the loneliness of a lighthouse keeper and of the limited landscape of the keeper's environment is artfully done. The novel deals with an ethical problem that is fraught with unbearable alternatives for the main characters. Is the law or is love the right choice when a child's happiness is at stake? How one man makes this choice is the subject of this lovely book.
4	1373414400	Although it doesn't end as anticipated, the story leaves you reflecting on it's outcome & parallels in your own life. It was well written & an easy read, very enjoyable.
5	1373414400	It was great reading,held my interest all the way!  it was recommended to me and thanked thr gal that recommened it to me
5	1373414400	I realize that there probably is not a real Janus Rock lighthouse - at least I cannot see one on a map- but the book was historical enough for me.  I enjoy historical novels even when loosely based on real locations and history.  A woman's desire for a child can sometimes overshadow reason.  Recommend this book
5	1373414400	This is a wonderful story, heartwarming, sad, happy and so very much more...........it brings out all the emotions. I hope this first time novelist can do it again!I have already recommended reading this to many friends,
4	1373414400	Well done for a first novel. Engaging and thought provoking. What would you do in the same situation? Isolation, the mother's need to &#34;mother&#34; someone, relationships under stress, all themes to ponder. Nicely done.
5	1373414400	After reading numerous light hearted "summer reads", it was refreshing to pick up a book that got me emotionally involved and to the brink of tears as I read the final chapters.  This book reminded me of my favorite book and movie, "Bridges of Madison County".  The right choice is often a hard choice to make and sometimes one of the saddest.
5	1373414400	It's been a long time since I couldn't put a book down! This novel is moving on many levels- full of adventure and emotion.
5	1373414400	I could not put this book down from the start.  Stedman's writing was wonderful and compelling.  So full of emotion,  there were many times I read with tears in my eyes.
5	1373414400	A great story with all the elements of a great read!  This is a book you don't want to put down--then you don't want it to end!
5	1373414400	I gave 5 stars because this was a good book. I felt sorry for Izzy and Tom but at the same time I was upset with them for keeping Lucy. This book kept me interested, I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book to read.
5	1373414400	Well written. Makes you think about the choices we make and the consequences of those choices. Learned about lighthouses, also.
5	1373328000	This book had my attention right from the first chapter. I didnt want it to end!!!  Its captivating, original, well written..i look forward to more from this author.
5	1373328000	Love this book - felt like I was there alongside the characters. Issues of love, loss, and motherhood were explored deeply. I didn't want it to end!
4	1373328000	Very good historical novel.  Lots of suspense.  Author use very descriptive scenes in the story.  gives the reader the feeling of being there.
4	1373328000	I enjoyed this book.  I like historical fiction and found it interesting learning a bit  about what it was like to be a light-keeper back in the 20's.  Throughout the book I had the feeling that nothing good could come of the decision to keep the child.  A book that really makes one think about the moral and emotional dilemmas faced by the characters.  The book kept my interest right to the end.
5	1373328000	I really enjoyed this book.  I enjoyed the setting, the character development, and the moral questions it poses.  I cried through the last two chapters.  If you are a parent it will get to you.  Very well written, interesting Lighthouse history, and what that life would have been like.  Definitely worth the read, enjoy.
5	1373328000	deeply moving novel that captures your emotions. read it until my eyes were too tired to go on. would recommend for anyone.
5	1373328000	The characters and the plot were unusual yet very human at the same time.It brought out all of my emotions.It is a book we will read for our Book Club
5	1373328000	What a beautiful story of love, both pure and painful!  It kept me entranced and coming back for more, not really wanting it to end!!  The ending, which of course did arrive, left me in tears.  One of my hallmarks of a great read!!  I recommend it to everyone..
5	1373328000	I loved the story line.  It is touching and so typical of human nature. A great setting and so believable!
4	1373328000	This book was very interesting, both in its geographic setting as well as the story line. The characters were all believable, and it really transported one back to a simpler lifestyle. It was hard to put aside, as one wanted to know the ending for all the characters. This was a good tale, well written, and did not head to bad language. It stayed with the tone of the time it portrayed. I read a lot of genres and this kept my interest to the end. M.L. Stedman is able to truly describe the land of Australia, it's water and the lighthouse keeper' s lifestyle, without losing you in too many adjectives.
5	1373328000	This is a subject we never considered that is looked at from the different angles of good people.  It is beautifully written.
5	1373328000	Beautifully written, recommended after TheStoryteller. Excellent beach read. Gave A sense of adventure with the west coast of Australia and you felt deeply connected with the characters .
3	1373328000	The book was ok, but the plot predictable and even believable and i found myself skimming through it and not savoring it as one does in a really good read.  Yes, one can understand he heartache of losing babies but it is no excuse for carrying out a lie.  Certainly not fair to the heartache that ensues for all parties, especially the needless trauma to the child who did overcome it in the end.  I  couldn't feel much bonding with the lighthouse couple and in the end felt the real hero in the whole needless saga was the grandfather.I read the book for my book club and we did have a good discussion but I can't recommend it.  Don't waste your time on this.
3	1373328000	My interest in lighthouses and their history and especially the stories about them is what first interested me in this book. But the book seem to start a little too slowly for me with a few too many details on the lighthouse keepers technical duties. It picked up fairly quickly, though, and held my interest till I could finish it. I could see what was going to happen, and I had to keep tuning in to see how the lighthouse keeper and his wife would deal with their secret being let out. Little pieces of their secret started to show up in a town too small to hide things. First, I felt very sorry for the wife having miscarriages, then I felt sorry for the lighthouse keeper and his desire to make her happy, even if his conscience told him it was wrong. But the story didn't turn out like I was hoping, and the ending, which might've seemed right for some readers, seemed a very wrong for me. This was truly a love story and I got very involved in the character's lives. It left me feeling disturbed about the choices made for love.
5	1373328000	This book showed the complexities that lies and deceit can bring, and how it effected so many people. It had very believable, yet complex characters. Their lives were engrossing, flawed people that made me feel compassion for each of their plights. It gave a lot of insight of what it must have been like for the lightkeepers and their families, and if you like history -this gives very descriptive portrayal of the time and part of Australia . Loved this book.
5	1373328000	Smoothly written and sure held my attention throughout. The whole setting and occurrences were a little extreme to be believed but it still was a good read and flowed nicely.The characters in this novel turned me so up and down as to how I loved, hated, sided with or wanted to run from and I never was able to totally release these feelings even at the end. It held me to the end as I hadn't a clue how it would be resolved and I won't spoil it but it did end with a fairly plausible ending and one I could accept and walk away from the novel saying that it was, indeed, a fair ending.
5	1373328000	Excellent..lots to think about.  You really can understand how each of the characters feel.  It is so easy to judge others.
5	1373241600	I love this book (about halfway through) because there are not any &#34;slow&#34; parts.  It keeps you guessing.  While the story seems a bit unreal, it is well written and an enjoyable read.
5	1373241600	Our book club read this book - lots of good discussion points.The moral issues are worth talking about. The characters are identifiable.
4	1373241600	Very good. I felt the star almost got what she deserved. The husband was a saint. Good to her until the very end, even though she nearly destroyed his life.
4	1373241600	Started off slow but really picked up ad then I couldn't put it down! I would recommend it to anyone up for a heart wrenching read.
5	1373241600	wonderful character development unable to put this novel down ;learned a great deal re. the workings of a lighthouse and the very lonely existence of the keeper
5	1373241600	This novel takes you on a, hold on for your life, emotional roller coaster ride!  Any one who has ever experienced love, loss, guilt, shame, or denial can feel the agony and the ecstasy of our main characters. This book will re- acquaint you with  emotional highs and lows that have been long suppressed. I have never read a book that has presented so many examples of doing the wrong thing for the right reason, and the painful consequences of our choices. This reading was a spiritual experience for me. I loved it. Keep a box of tissues close by, you'll need them.
5	1373241600	For me, at the end - it made me think of the importance of family in my life. Any book that makes me stop and do that is/was worth the time. I Really enjoyed this book.
4	1373241600	A beautiful, touching story, which kept me engaged from start to finish.  I have recommended it to several of my friends
5	1373241600	I haven't finished reading this book as yet but do find that it has captured my interest from the start. The delivery to a Kindle is an astonishing phenomenon. I am a book, that is paper and binding, person. That I love the Kindle is so far a departure that I can hardly believe it. The newer Kindle has rekindled my love of reading.
5	1373241600	I was in tears for the last half of the book -- and I hardly tear up at even the most sentimental movies. I was crying out loud and went to my bedroom (at 2 AM -- couldn't put it down) to hug my wife and 3-year-old son. It is very well written, a good story, and with excellent character development and depth. I highly recommend it.
5	1373241600	A great book with well developed characters.  The setting and lifes style were unique to me and added to the books appeal.
5	1373241600	I don't give 5 stars out easily, but The Light Between Oceans was extraordinary, both in the storytelling and the story.  The story is about the ethical dilemma a childless couple face when a baby comes into their life suddenly, and the events that follow their decision.  Stedman had a way of describing the sad story in a way that made you need to read more.  It is her first book and I hope to read more by her.
4	1373241600	The story is original and gives a good examination of the temptations and consequences of human behavior.  However, I felt the grammatical structures in the writing (including inappropriate word usage and switching of verb tense) detracted from the reading and left me wondering who edited this book.  Somewhat disappointing as a result.
5	1373241600	This book was easy to read and was a page turner to the end. You got emotionally tied to the characters as well. It was a well written book. Make sure you have a box of Kleenex handy. Enjoy!
4	1373241600	Very thought provoking.  Will be an interesting review in book club.  I liked the writing style and the character development.
5	1373241600	This book is consistently interesting, paints a vivid picture of life on a remote Australian lighthouse, and is also incredibly moving.  The author has captured the way that humans fall unwittingly into decisions that will heavily impact their lives and the lives of others. It is a love story on many levels.  I love this book1
5	1373241600	I enjoyed the book tremendously.  Stedman has a wonderful story-telling style that quickly captured and held my attention.  The story is quite believable and the characters are engaging.  I rated the book with five stars which I've rarely done before.
5	1373241600	Intriguing plot, you won't guess the end, don't dislike the mom. She had her reasons, love mixed with her hurt.
4	1373155200	This book made me cry.  It pulls on your heart strings.  Some parts were slow but still a good read.
4	1373155200	I enjoyed this story full of colorful, completely developed characters doing interesting jobs in a time when life was not only simpler, but seen as more black and white.  Post WWI was such a time.  I learned a lot about the people, the times, the prejudices which lingered toward the Germans and how they continued to impact life and times.  A good read!
5	1373155200	The story was entertaining and touched my heart. The love one feels for their child is so great and never ending.
5	1373155200	I love a book where the author paints a picture so richly that it is like watching it on a giant movie screen.  M.L. Steadman does that perfectly in The Light Between Oceans.  Each character comes to life on the pages as the story unfolds and connects to the reader in a very special way.  I am using this as my book club selection and recommending it to all my friends.
4	1373155200	I enjoyed this book, once I got past the overly descriptive first part.This is a controversial subject, which there are no definite answers.It is a sad story, but worth reading!!
5	1373155200	I would give this book 10 stars......been a long time since I have read a book I truly enjoyed and was sorry when I was finished.  I need to find more novels such as this one.
5	1373155200	I really enjoyed reading this novel. Kept me interested the whole time. A lot of conflicting emotions throughout.You will want to root for everyone in this book!
5	1373155200	The choices that the characters make during this novel are life altering into their senior years. It was very interesting and food for thought.
3	1373155200	Good charcter definitions. You do get the feel of lonliness and yet beauty in the description of the Light House.
3	1373155200	Overall, I would give The Light Between Oceans a 3.5. It was a nice story and I enjoyed the ending, but for me, it was a little slow. I was just feeling it was more of a chore to get through it until about 60% of the book. I enjoyed it well enough to try another one of this authors stories, though.
5	1373155200	I thought this book  had a great story & was beautifully written.  I did not want to finish it  . I slowed down my reading toward the end so I coyuld savor every word, One of my favorite books !
5	1373155200	There are two sides to every story they say, and that is so well illustrated within the pages of this book.Right and wrong, shades of selfish versus unstinting love. The two sided coin with which we pay our dues in this world. I found myself cheering for opposing sides in this novel set in post Great War Australia as the nation came to deal with the aftereffects of terrible losses and attempted to cobble together a new life within the parameters of gaping holes in the psyche and very fabric of life. Sacrifices are made and dealt with. Some of those decisions were right and some were right for the wrong reason. Well worth reading.
5	1373068800	A very moving novel that had me spellbound and reading late into the night.  I felt the angst of the main character being torn between right and wrong.  I would recommend this book to others who liked &#34;The Snow Child:  A Novel&#34;.  It was interesting to learn a little bit about light houses!  I enjoyed the book very much!
5	1373068800	A slow start, aided by the first part, thinking I knew how it would end...but I stuck with it. Well developed characters and honesty in the thoughts of each made the book real.  Excellent story pulled from the pains of war, the hurt and joys of parenthood, with the finality of relationship: really knowing and being known. Definitely a candle burner...hard to put down once the reader is connected with the characters...not a mystery, but holding on to each word as if it were! Excellent read!
4	1373068800	I loved this book, it kept your attention, was a different story line and truly believable.  The couple sad adventure into carrying a baby...happens to a lot of people, and the way they solved it, or should I say, resolved it with something most people could not do, but it is truly believable in this instance.
5	1373068800	This is a thought provoking book. How what decisions you make, good or bad effect so many people. What seems right at the time may or may not be the right thing.  Good book for discussion, hello book clubs.
5	1373068800	An absolutely wonderful book that is beautifully written. I enjoyed every minute of this great book. I strongly suggest it!
5	1373068800	This is such a heartfelt beautifully written story of love, and commitment, and life.  May we all know this kind of love in our lives.
5	1373068800	I was immediately compelled by the characters and setting. The writing is clean and in many ways, I felt an observer to the lives of my neighbors. It was not until the end, when the tears streamed down my face, that I realized how thoroughly engrossed I was. Beautifully done.
5	1373068800	As the reviews on the book have stated, this is a great first novel, comparable to Steel Magnolias. A quick and enjoyable read.
4	1373068800	This book had a very good storyline.  Although I found  parts of the book were far fetched, including the ending.
5	1373068800	This book was slow at first, and I thought I wouldn't continue to read it.  However, I am so glad I did!!!!  I loved it.I cried so much towards the end that it was hard to read.  It is one of the very best books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books!!!!
4	1372982400	This book was recommended to me by an obscure connection, which I don't normally take those suggestions because in the past they have often flopped. I don't know what I was expecting and maybe I didn't read the synopsis correctly, but what happened in the story I did not expect... I am not saying it wasn't a good story, just that somehow it wasn't what I was expecting. I won't spoil anything but it isn't a happy go lucky book (which was more of the direction I thought it would go) by any means and really touches on the themes of truth and forgiveness. Great writing, M.L. Stedman really paints a picture with her writing allowing you to step into the scene yourself. Over all good read.
5	1372982400	This book was wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. It starts slow but is worth every word. The characters become alive and part of your life as you read. Enjoy
4	1372982400	A beautiful story of love, loss, and endurance.  Would you do the right thing or the wrong one?  A very good story.
4	1372982400	My book club chose this book and it was a great read. We had a great discussion. What would you have done?
5	1372982400	This book was strongly recommended  by a colleague.  From the first page to the last, the beautiful language and intriguing story captured my heart. I couldn't stop reading it.  I already miss it like a good friend.
5	1372982400	I love that this author's characters have flaws. Their flaws  make the story all the more believable and endearing. A great love story,even in its tragic moments.
4	1372982400	A Very touching story about love and loss.  A reminder that life can change in an instant.  Couldn't wait to get to the end.
4	1372982400	I am not quite done with the entire book but I am  enjoying it very much. It is well written and touches your heart.
4	1372982400	No one should have to face giving up an adored child. Yet legally and morally it becomes necessary and almost unbearable..
4	1372982400	Couldn't help but think of paradise when the island was being described. Noone there but the two young lovers . Their paradise was un spoilt & secluded. They weren't challenged by outside influences.Her desire to have a child is so strong that it causes them both to do something they know is not right. They easily put aside their guilt so that he can make her happy. It is a fall from grace and they know they will pay the price. They enjoy the child and lavish love on her until they return to the mainland where they learn of a lost child & father. They continue to feel that they have saved the child and therefor she is theirs.Their original sin is compounded now that they have to pretend she is theirs and they lie to her parents & the towns people. The town is a microcosm for society in general, both judge & jury. Noone will forgive them, they will be banished. It is a sad story .A moral dilemma and once that is wrenching. The reader  is happy for the young couple and at the same time knows there is another side to the story.
5	1372982400	I purchased this book for my Kindle, because my book club is reading it this month.  The price was right .
5	1372982400	I loved this book. The author paints wonderful pictures with her words. The setting makes for an incredibly interesting story and the characters are unforgettable. The novel contains some really nice memorable truisms about life. It's all about love and choices. Soooooo good. Highly recommend this book.
5	1372896000	This was such a good story that could have gone in any direction.  Very touching indeed. Everyone in our book club thoroughly enjoyed it.
5	1372896000	Don't want to spoil anything but I did love this book. Heart-warming and heart-wrenching. Nice price for a wonderful read.
5	1372896000	A fantastic book! I highly recommend it to any one who's known love before. Absolutely, loved it! Great plot & writing.
5	1372896000	Love the way each character is revealed.  The truth of life is so evident in the highly descriptive wording.  We are separate yet not separated from each other.
5	1372896000	A great read.  So much wisdom between a parent and child.  And the strong, strong pull of loving.  When you think of the reality of it, its ending is the right one.
5	1372896000	The story of loving a daughter.  Of how our choices can make or break our futures.  Excellent story and well written for a first novel.
5	1372896000	Beautifully written, charged with the strong emotions associated with the love that parents have for their children. Descriptions of the scenery, events, and characters was powerful and wonderful. If this is Steadman's first, it is certainly a portent of great things to come from this writer.
5	1372896000	Story was compelling right til the end.  It was heart wrenching and provoked deep feeling. Loved it! A wonderful summer read.
4	1372896000	Wonderful plot and characters with a heart wrenching story.  Filled with historical light house information in the early 20th century.
3	1372896000	Not a complete waste of time but not spellbinding! If it becomes available as a free download the go for it!
4	1372896000	Almost immediately upon commencing The Light Between Oceans by M. L. Stedman, the reader experiences a feeling of dread. We meet Tom Sherbourne who has returned to Australia from fighting in Europe in "The Great War." He has what would now be termed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and only wants a post on a lonely lighthouse as its keeper to ease his nerves. On his way to the posting he meets young Isabel and the reader begins to believe that perhaps she was mistaken about the ominous signs and this will be a love story.It is a love story, but not a simple one as Stedman examines the fabric of love and marriage and the strains which can exists even between two honorable and caring individuals. Tom who is perhaps one of the more honest and dependable characters is given a fateful choice between love and honor which will result in far reaching consequences.The Light Between Oceans has a carefully conceived plot with each piece of the puzzle fitting tightly together. While taking the time to craft the setting and the background of the story together, the reader feels the bleak loneliness of Janus Rock and the power of the ocean. I will admit to feeling a bit of impatience for something to finally happen, but once the plot starts moving forward, I could not put the book down.I would expect that readers of historical fiction, those interested in relationships and anyone who likes a good cry to appreciate this story. I certainly am looking forward to reading more by Stedman in the future.
5	1372809600	I'm not very good at writing book reviews, and I'm terrible at summarizing books without giving away every important detail, but all I can say is how incredible this book is. This was one of those that I couldn't put down, and I found myself bawling my eyes out quite frequently throughout the book. The writing is absolutely beautiful, and made me feel as if I was intertwined within their lives. I would recommend this book to anyone!
5	1372809600	IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHOICES WE MAKE AND THE CONSEQUENCES WE ARE THEN FORCED TO LIVE WITH....JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG...LOTS OF SHADES OF GRAY SLAP YOU IN THE FACE!
4	1372809600	Captures your attention with an interesting story and characters.  Intricately detailed landscape descriptions slowed it down for me in spots.
5	1372809600	There are many lessons to learn in life and many roads to take.  This story stays in your thoughts as you read about the choices these characters make, due to circumstances they must endure.  It takes place in &#34;the land down under&#34;, which makes for an interesting, colorful backdrop of the country, it's way of life and it's people, around the time of the Great War, of the early 20th century.  It held my interest and I savored reading it and guessed many times, how it would end. Enjoyable!
5	1372809600	bought these in a store about 2 years ago in black--they finally started to give way and of course I went to Amazon to find another pair. happy I got them.
5	1372809600	Nice surprise--sometimes when I purchase a book that is on special I am disappointed. Not this time. Wonderfully scripted characters. A pleasure. Well written and moving, I truly enjoyed this book.
4	1372809600	M.L. Stedman writes wonderful prose. At times I was drawn to the book as if  reading a classic novel of Dickens, Steinbeck, Thoreau...I was drawn into the world of Tom and Isabel Sherbourne.  Alas, perhaps a bit too long...and the pace drags a bit leading to the climax.  But this is a writer I will seek out.
4	1372809600	The book The Light Between Oceans is excellent reading. I have many friends say it's the best book they have read.Me I think it was a good story with lots of suspense.Patricia Massie
4	1372809600	I enjoyed the book very much. Some of it was predictable, but still worth a read. It was quick reading.
5	1372809600	A gripping and emotional story that will keep you engrossed until the end! Two mothers who end up at one point in time suffering the loss of a child, the same child, not to death but to each other!
5	1372809600	This is a touching story of heartbreaking love of parents and children.  Well written and gripping!  I really enjoyed the story and found it hard to put the book down.  Would recommend it as a good summer read.
5	1372723200	This is a What would you do book ?  I loved it and all characters. Was a love story with tragic happenings.  Enjoyed every page.
5	1372723200	Wonderfully written, the characters and settings come alive with detail and clarity.  Makes you ask yourself if we are always where God wants us to be.
5	1372723200	I wish I could give this book 6 stars instead of only 5. This book was so full of emotion and feeling.  The author brought to life these characters and made me feel the feelings they were having.  I enjoyed this book so much.  It actually brought tears to my eyes a couple of times.  I could hardly put it down and wish she had written another one.  I can thoroughly understand why over 1,600 people gave it 5 stars.  It was worth the money and worth the time to read it.  If you enjoy this type of read you won't be disappointed.  I have read books by seasoned authors that was not his good.
3	1372723200	This book in a way seemed highly predictable except for a few twists.  There was a part in there where I kind of got distracted and had to re read a few pages again.  This book was recommended by a member of our book club.  It could however be very likely turned into a movie for TV or theatre.
5	1372723200	This was a great book. Can't wait to read more by this author. Be prepared to shed a few tears.
4	1372723200	A great read!I do NOT want to rate the books I have ordered.  Do not request that I do this again.Betty Brodes
5	1372723200	The book, though it started off slow, is a great read. I would highly recommend reading this book to anyone who loves a good read and an encapturing tale.
5	1372723200	This story is like getting into. Your car and riding through the lives of a young couple. With many hardships. To overcome. Deep emotions are threaded through each day making you turn each page to the end.
5	1372723200	Pulls you in weaving a story of such raw beauty of both depiction of nature and the turmoil of human existence. Eloquently written, profoundly thought provoking. Stedman has much to live up to if another book will be forthcoming. A wonderful read.
3	1372723200	I expected this book to be much more of a mystery and less of a romance.  It seemed romance won out.
4	1372723200	Beautiful story of love and loss. Believable characters and well written plot line. Unpredictable and resolute. A sad and loving narrative.
5	1372723200	I usually don't reread novels, that said, this is one I will.  So moving, I could not think how this story would end and with such gripping feeling for this couple and their circumstances.  This book kept me reading late into the night before I could put it down.  Great read!
4	1372723200	This novel is compelling with great characters, some of whom you will root for and some you won't, all the while wondering why you won't. The human condition is complicated and the author demonstrates this artfully in her story telling.
5	1372723200	This was a wonderful novel that kept me involved until the very end.  I was so amazed after finding out this was the author's first novel.  Great read.
4	1372723200	It had a slow start in the beginning, but we'll worth it. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a good romance and to people that love being a parent.
5	1372636800	I loved the description in this book-- some passages I re-read a couple times and savored.  Pacing was good, the story believable (anyone who has been a mother and/or been a mother who has had a loss/losses) will understand the choices made, and the conclusion is a natural rounding.  I was not shocked, horrified or disappointed at all!!  It is like this book gently embraced me and asked me to listen to a strange but wonderful tale.  It does not sugar coat,  but it also does not demand you choose a side although you might, and then feel your choice as wobbly in the light of compassion (dare I share here what I would have done!).I willingly found moments in my busy day to read, and often read deep into the night having a hard time putting it down.  (Also, I think I must be a &#34;lighthouse person&#34; and you get me or you don't depending on what mystical power those towers of light have over you, too--grin).Special note to mothers who have had loss:  I have had two pregnancy losses, one of which I suffered alone at home.  It was years ago now, the pain no longer keening, but I wondered if I could handle reading this book.  I was better than expected and more closely connected to the story most likely due to my experience with loss and as a mother to three wonderful children today.  In fact, I have to wonder if some of the negative reviews are due to not understanding the emotional tsunami a loss can bring with it.
5	1372636800	This was novel was referred to me from a friend and it was just wonderful !  You felt like you were there with them on the Island in the Ocean.
4	1372636800	I liked it, then for a while I didn't like it, then I really liked it.Good story, could be a great movie if done right.Sad, more of a woman's book than a man's, but very enjoyable, nonetheless.
5	1372636800	A lovely story full of surprises. Kept me guessing about how it would end...I enjoyed reading this book. It was a quick read Learned a bit about lighthouses as well. A little sad,but worth the tears.
5	1372636800	This is an excellent book!!  A very gripping story that holds you until the last page. I am still drying my tears as I type.
5	1372636800	One of the best books I have ever read in my 55 years. Could not put it down for one minute!
5	1372636800	This book is not what I expected. I read the description several times before deciding to download it. I suspected the drama might be a bit - heavy handed. It was actually perfectly balanced with an intriguing, original story.
5	1372636800	Read this even after reading bad comments and still loved it. Not everything has to have a happy ending to be good.
5	1372636800	This book was very well written.  It was complex and very enjoyable.  I had started 'reading' it by audio, but then purchased it because i wanted to READ it.  Great read.
3	1372636800	Exceptionally written.  Story was a little heavy for me (that's why 3 stars) but still, it was quite good.  I wasn't prepared for the tears.  She really can pull the emotion out of you.
5	1372636800	I didn't want to read this book because I thought I wouldn't enjoy it. So glad I read it!!!! Wow. Talk about a book that makes you ask, &#34;What would I have done?&#34; It's a difficult question and when I finished the book, my heart broke for both of the main characters because you can see both sides of their choices, yet, it's still hard to imagine being in that situation.
5	1372636800	Well written, surprising that it is his first novel.  Sad but believable fiction.  Everyone in my book group loved it and would recommend it.
5	1372636800	I love, love, loved this story.  I read it in two sittings.  There was no way for me to know the ending, so I simply kept reading, reading, reading
2	1372636800	I cannot recommend this book unless you like reading tragedies.  It's well written.  You feel every emotion and gut wrenching plea.  It is just too painful.
5	1372636800	It's been a long time since I have loved a book this much. I can't believe how well written it is for a first time author. M.L. Stedman knows exactly how people think and feel. I picked it for my book club. Should make for a great discussion.
5	1372636800	Enthralling and sensitive. Could not put it down! This author has an incredible talent to describe the protagonists' innermost emotions and struggles in this dramatic novel. A definite read!
4	1372636800	I usually only buy books on recommendations from friends and family - and I am very critical. If a book doesn't grab me in the first 3 chapters or so, I will stop. Life is just too short to waste on bad books (or movies or anything else for that matter :) ... I bought this on a whim, based on an Amazon recommendation. Just wanted something to read. I loved it. It was touching and intimate, the characters so loveable. As a mother it really struck a chord with me, because you really can't understand what it is to love your child until you have had one. The rich backstory of the characters, their relationship... all of it. Could not put it down. I highly recommend it. Oh - and it would make a fantastic movie - so if you are in the movie biz reading this, read the book, make the film and let me know when it's out :)
3	1372636800	I enjoyed the book. It had some suspense but at many points it dragged on. The ending was unexpected and did offer suspense and a bitter sweet ending.
5	1372636800	A first novel?  Hard to believe!  The story,with many twists and turns, catches the reader's attention from the beginning and holds it to the end. Anguish, love,confusion, guilt, all create a wonderful story.
5	1372636800	I've recommended this book to many friends.  I enjoyed the suspense and resolution.  Great story set in Australia.  I'll look for more books by this author.
5	1372550400	This was a good that made me really empathize with the characters and each of them will stick in my mind.
4	1372550400	At times I ached for almost every charactier in this narrative of post world war two island existance.  The characters, at first seemed rather flat, but there were increased layers presented as the plot evolved.
5	1372550400	The love story of Tom and Izzy is a special one with their tale of living on a desolate island. But it is the love of a baby that finds her way to their shores and their hearts that makes them a family. The story is full of difficult choices and their consequences and leaves you to question right and wrong and to realize that some things are neither. I couldn't stop reading and cried my way through the ending. An excellent book!
5	1372550400	Beautifully written, Her descriptions are short but well choosen.  I felt I was with them every step of their emotional crisis.
5	1372550400	I thought this book was fascinating. A strong moral question arises and tests on how do each of us respond. I am not certain how I would have delt with such a difficult decision. This will test your beliefs. A great read.
4	1372550400	This is a great read but very heavy.  The author does a great job developing the characters.  We enjoyed discussing this book at our book club.
5	1372550400	This book had a slow start for me, but once into it I couldn't put it down I cried my eyes out during the whole 3rd part.
5	1372550400	I couldn't put this book down. It will be our book choice of the month for book club.  I will always think of the story when I see a lighthouse.
4	1372550400	Two mothers. The lighthouse keeper's wife who found the child and raised her with complete love until she was 5. The other, the real mother who had mourned for the child she thought was lost at sea. The light housekeeper who knows the truth. An interesting story well- written and thought-provoking. It also gives a glimpse into the highly unusual life of the lighthouse keeper.
5	1372550400	I thought this book was extremely well written.  The character development was excellent and each person had a valid point of view.  I was able to identify with all the main characters and &#34; feel their pain&#34;.  It presents some intriguing dilemmas and perplexing situations.  This would be an excellent book club selection.
4	1372550400	This book starts off slow...almost making you wonder when will the story begin.  However after reading further the tale of isabel Tom and Lucy start to pull you in. I couldn't stop  reading, by the time I had reached the end, I was in tears. This was a good read
5	1372550400	As you read this wonderful book the characters and places described come to life.  You feel the love between these people.  The island is serene and beautiful.
5	1372550400	The story itself is sad beyond words, The reader understands why the characters make the decisions that they do, but the way it all plays out is inevitable and tragic.I kept waiting for a happy ending for these people but there really isn't one.Love is never wasted, but sometimes it is misguided.Unfortunately there are also unintended consequences and this story is all about consequences.Keep a hankie with you.
3	1372550400	overall this was a good story that got a bit dull in the middle! not bad for an easy read but for me, it wasn't a &#34;great&#34; read.
4	1372550400	This was an interesting book.  To begin with, how many people would choose the isolated life of a lighthouse keeper?  The hero is a martyr of sorts that gets caught up in right and wrong but alas, justice and love prevail.
4	1372550400	Really good book that I read in a couple of days. It ends pretty much how one would think it might, with tears running down your face. Makes you cherish your own children and recognize how lucky you are to have them.
5	1372550400	really enjoyed the story line and more important the writing style recommended by by my 94 year old mother in law and this 52 year old loved it
5	1372550400	This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The author pulls you into the lives of the characters and keeps you there till the end.  You do not want the story to end. A real page turner.
5	1372550400	how would you have reacted if you were isabelle.  ....that willl run through your mind during the whole book.  wont want to put it down
5	1372464000	I don't want to give away anything more but the books has some unexpected turns that will draw you in and keep the pages turning. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
5	1372464000	Ending brought tears to my eyes! I'm glad she came to look for them in the end, brought him closure.
4	1372464000	A trip back to a simpler time, the 1920's, far away in Western Australia.  A love story in many ways, developing in the shadow of a lighthouse.  Noble thoughts weaved throughout. I highly recommend this fast reading novel
5	1372377600	I loved this book.  It was beautifully written and some sentences I reread multiple times.  Looking forward to more of Steadman's work.
5	1372377600	I just loved this book. Recommended to many friends . Well written. Suspenseful. I was afraid it might end up a psychologicalthriller ?? like Gone Girl. But was a great read.
5	1372377600	One of the best books I've read.Great description of what it was like to be a Lighthouse keeper back in the days prior to GPS, needless to say it was not for the faint at heart!Good read for anyone that just likes a good novel especially if you happen to be at a beach house on vacation watching the waves roll in and out. And the next time you visit a historical Lighthouse, believe me, you'll think twice about what it took to maintain one &#34;back in the day&#34;...Also a well thought out twist of events, one I never expected!
4	1372377600	I enjoyed reading The Light Between Oceans| A Novel.  I liked reading about the coast off Australia and a lightkeeper's life.  Tom,and all the characters felt real.
4	1372377600	Interesting book. Entertaining, This story was easy to read and kept you wondering about what was going to happen in the future. I was surprised to learn this was the author's first book. But she came in with the winner!
4	1372377600	The book started out somewhat slowly, however it did gather momentum and the author faced  reality head on, but did soften the tragedy with an almost happy ending. Thought provoking.
5	1372377600	If this is her first novel, I'll be waiting in line for her next.  Enjoyed all the character's personal dynamics and the emotional struggles of  finding the &#34;right&#34; thing to do for Lucy/Grace. This is the FIRST novel that I actually shed tears (and I have been reading a very long time).
3	1372377600	Mr. steadman is a gifted writer. The detail of his characters and the way he unfolds a story is very engaging. The tone is set at the beginning of this book. It's not like there's a dark cloud over everything, but you get the sense this is going to be a powerful, sometimes difficult read.... and it was. I did enjoy it, but personally feel like I could have stayed away from this book to save my brain the sadness it recalls with this book. It is lovely, but pretty sad. There are some bright spots, if you can call it that... but not bright enough to give me that "ahhhh it was all worth it" feeling.
4	1372291200	I gave this book 4 stars because I almost didn't finish it both because of the pace and because it was so sad.  Liked learning about lighthouses and Australia.  There are parts that are so beautifully written, references to nature which I loved but I wanted it to end.  Certainly gives a sense of how heartbreaking and debilitating miscarriages are and that needs to be said.  Did like the the way the author developed her character's predicaments and how their choices affected the lives of so many but, overall, I felt so sad throughout the book, all the way to the end.
5	1372291200	The book is a tale structured so well you are deeply engaged without realizing it. It is touching, emotional and exciting throughout.
5	1372291200	This book is interesting and a quick read. It is a classic moral dilemma and one that many mothers and fathers will be pulled into. This book is a page turner and grabbed me during the first chapter.
4	1372291200	Well-written and thought provoking.  You aren't always sure who to root for, nor what would be best for this little girl.  Certainly held my interest.
5	1372291200	A surprising and sensitive novel, with a plot line that kept me absorbed and with characters I iediatrly cared about. Passages of lyrical writing drew me into the world of the book, years and miles away from my home.
5	1372291200	The story was lovely an engaging.  You feel the love and anguish as you follow along the story line.  Hard to put down.
5	1372291200	She has the gift, she is quite an author.  Will be looking forward to her next book.  Sad book, but also a good book
4	1372291200	Great Book....A little hard to get into at first but worth the read. The story line is very well written.
5	1372291200	Loved this story, my heart broke for Izzy. This book was a rollercoaster if emotions. The writer did a good job bringing the story full circle.
4	1372291200	This well-written novel made me think. An interesting plot with some fun twists kept my interest as I finished this book quickly. 4 stars instead if 5 because I thought the ending was really depressing.
5	1372291200	Loved this book I learned a lot about Austrailia and the high toll they paid in Europe during the war. I felt as if I were living the life of thebookcharacters
5	1372291200	This story is a heart wrenching story of a baby who has two mothers!  It is heart breaking because the little toddler loves the mother who brought her up, but now has to be with her birth mother.  The imigery and symbolism in this book is so creative and fits perfectly with the story line.  Our book club just discussed this book and it really lends itself to an interesting book club discussion.
5	1372291200	A wonderful, thought provoking story.  The characters are realistic, with faults and very admirable traits simultaneously.  Like all of us, they make mistakes out of heartbreak and human error.  A must read.
5	1372204800	Good writing and a good story.  Interesting details about lighthouses, loneliness, and coping skills.  The charactersmake this book great for book clubs.
5	1372204800	The book brought out all different types of emotions for me.  Of right and wrong, of good and bad and of life in general.I am glad I read this book.
5	1372204800	A story of the real depth love takes when a child is  loved.  Very well written, with an ending that concluded the tale!
4	1372204800	I hesitate to highly recommend because of the subject of the book, not the writing. I found the subject of losing a child hard to read about
5	1372204800	Interesting and well written. Hard to imagine living such a secluded lifestyle.  This is a very moving story of love and life.
4	1372204800	I really liked this novel.  It will be a great discussion book for our book club.  There are a lot of moral and ethical issues to get you thinking.  The author made you feel like you right there in the middle of the ocean with them.  I learned a lot about how lighthouses worked in the early days and won't look at a lighthouse the same anymore.  Still can't imagine what a lonely life it could be.
5	1372204800	If I hadn't been introduced to this book by my book club u would have never  purchased it or even stuck with it . The previews and quick book blurbs alert the reader to the fact that this is a "sad " story . The challenge becomes deciding to jeep reading to see where it is all going. All 15 members of our club were happy they did. Lively discussion if the plot , character development and author style fly around our table . Suggest it to all book clubs regardless of age.
4	1372204800	This book was so sad a lot of the way through. Even when you knew some of the characters were making bad decisions, it was easy to understand why they were doing so. The ending was good and not so good all wrapped up in one. Makes you remember there are always consequences to our actions!
4	1372204800	Very well written and pulls at your heart for all characters involved in the struggle. Makes you think who would you choose?
5	1372204800	Great ethical topics for discussion.  Historically intriguing.  Good character development.  Couldn't wait to learn how it ends!  I highly recommend this book.
5	1372204800	Loved it! A story of love, hope and forgiveness. Tears will be cried so have tissue on hand. Very moving.
5	1372204800	Cared about the characters, wondered how I would react in their position, couldn't put it down, and hated picking it up.
5	1372204800	I really loved this book, it is a little slow at the beginning, but what a story.There are a lot of truths to be learned from this book, and each characterplays a contributing part to the story.  If you like historical fiction, familystories and love stories, you will love this book.
5	1372204800	emotional needs of women and men.  how each one deals with issues.  needs of the child.  so many people impacted by one act
4	1372204800	I wonder if I may have made a similar decision, faced with the same situation.  I really don 't known.  It would certainly take a lot of soul searching.  I can relate to Isabel's feelings but not Tom's.  Beautiful and vivid descriptions of  the oceans, light  house and the many people you encounter while reading the book.  I recommend the book, it is a good read. Looking forward to the movie when it comes out.
5	1372204800	Excellent story telling. It was nice to think as I read. We all have a journey in this life we live. How we choose to live with the cards we are dealt is up to us.
5	1372204800	This novel starts off mildly enough, a sweet, unexpected love story--but then out there in the bucolic existanceof the lighthouse, the miracle happens.  A baby!  Whose is it--and should they keep it, or try to return it to itsfamily, whoever they are?  What would you do if what you wanted most in the world was a baby?This is the first book in a long time that I could not put down--and I mean that.  I shut off the computer, turnedoff the TV and READ!!!!  Gripping and heartbreaking.  Can't recommend it strongly enough.Joan Conning Afman, author
5	1372118400	It took the right mood to get into it, but once I did, I inhaled it. This is a lovely read.
5	1372118400	A nice, relaxing summer read. Well-written, well-developed characters, and an ending that may leave you with tears in your eyes.
4	1372118400	4.5 stars. The author gives readers an excellent look at a complicated moral issue from the viewpoint of several characters, without giving a pat &#34;right or wrong&#34; solution, so that readers can think about it for themselves. I'm still reflecting on what I think should (or should not) have been done.
5	1372118400	I really enjoyed this book. It is a great story with a lot of heart. Makes you consider things like war, isolation, desperation and love. This book made me feel many emotions. Parts of it brought me to tears. The story feels very &#34;real&#34; - as if it is something that could have actually happened. The ONLY negative I can think of is that the story is set in Australia I didn't understand all of the vernacular. Even still, you can use context clues to infer the meaning(s). I really enjoyed it.
3	1372118400	Good story  slow moving, sometimes too slow.  Sad, characters are will developed.I would reccommend it .  I liked it but could put it down.  Not a page turner.
5	1372118400	But so glad  I read it, opens your mind to a  different world at a different time but author makes all the characters very human and sympathetic despite the exteme conflict that weaves the story together.
5	1372118400	Long has it been since I have cared so deeply or had such an emotional connection to the characters in a book. This is a beautifully written love story about a time and place so removed from our present day chaos. But neither time nor place can change the human longings for love, family and happiness. What is right? What is wrong? Who of us should judge? Buy an extra box or two of tissues, and then settle back to read and enjoy. I can't wait for the movie! (I hope there is someone who is taking this story to the big screen.)
5	1372118400	I wished it never ended!  What a great author and a very different kind of book.  Although the subject was very difficult and sad, it was so beautifully written and the characters richly portrayed. A must read especially for a book club!
2	1372118400	The plot was implausible, yet the book was a slow read.  I read this for my book club, but it is not my type of book.
5	1372118400	Wonderful, touching.  The characters lived. A wonderful  story about the way good and bad are hard to define by love comes through.
5	1372118400	Not done with it yet, and not sure where the story will end, that is the reason I enjoy this book.  Most books I can figure out the ending way in advance, not this one.  Hard to put the book down, and I have recommended it to friends. The last book that has kept my interest like this one was &#34;The Snow Child&#34;.
5	1372118400	The characters were very well developed and the plot was interesting.  This was one of the best novels I have read this year.
4	1372118400	This book surprised me.  It took a turn I did not expect.  A good reminder that our actions impact can not only us but others as well.
4	1372118400	The authors description was truly wonderful, I felt like I was on the island with them. I would certainly recommend this book, easy read and very enjoyable.
5	1372032000	This is probaby one of my favorite books of all times...purchased for kindle....wonderful story and well written.....couldn't put it down.........movie?!
5	1372032000	Excellent! One of the best books I have read in a long time. Highly recommend it. Couldn't put it down.
5	1372032000	This was an excellent book. Fascinating story and kept me interested until the very end.  Didn't want to put it down.
4	1372032000	I thought it was pretty good. A fast read. I finished it in a day, but it was worth the money.
5	1372032000	The question comes up over and over again.  What is best for the child?  This book does an excellent job of giving both sides of the story.  Do you consider the rights (and feelings) of the mothers or do you think only of the child.  It is a very complicated story and I believe the author got it right.  You be the judge.
4	1372032000	This book was kind of a slow burn. More character than plot driven. It definitely makes you wonder what decisions you would make in the same situation.The book was lovely and heart-wrenching and uplifting all at once.It makes a nice beach read. Anyone that enjoys character driven stories would like this book. You may not always like the characters, but they are fascinating.
3	1372032000	This plot has been done before. The only thing that makes it interesting is the information on the lighthouse keepers along the coast of Australia after and before W.W. I. The author does make good use of his characters as representative of things that occurred to them during the Great War.
5	1371945600	It was fascinating to experience the author's choices for his characters.  It presented a completely unique set of circumstances that enabled me to do what a good novel should do for the reader - totally immerse myself in another world.
5	1371945600	I loved this novel.  it was so sad but so interesting and to try to put yourself in their place.  What would I have done if this child had shown up on my doorstep.  There were no real winners. it hold you spellbound until the end.
4	1371945600	You want so desperately for it to work out with the child but the emotional wave carries you away along with the characters
5	1371945600	This is truly a good read.  I'll be looking for Mrs. Stedman' s next novel. Just when you think you know what's gonna happen....you don't.
5	1371945600	This is such a wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down.  It is very sad but what a great story of love of family.
5	1371945600	This book stirred up one of the longest and best discussions my book group has had in a long time. There are many layers to the story to unwrap!
4	1371945600	This book starts out a little slowly but once I was 70 pages or so into it I couldn't put it down.  A somewhat heartbreaking tale, it is refreshing in that it doesn't have the typical happy ending.  the characters are complex and well developed. a good read.
5	1371945600	One of the best books I've read in a while. Make sure you have a small chunk of time to read it. What a dilemma in this story! Have some tissues ready at the end.
3	1371945600	It was rather predictable, but it did tell a lot about the isolation of lighthouse keepers and their families and how it affects them.
5	1371945600	Great book after the first 40 pages, kept my interest to the end. Great for bookclubs to read. Great discussion.
5	1371945600	Very good writing. Kept you in suspense. For the first time ever everyone in my book discussion group enjoyed the book very much!
5	1371945600	Enjoyed the story tremendously.  It captures your attention by drawing you in to its morally compelling drama.  A great read!
5	1371945600	What a spellbinding story told in a way that it is unpredictable from page to page.  Great story to lose yourself in.  You won't forget it for a long time.
5	1371945600	You know it is a good book when it pulls you in and you really feel like you are there. I really enjoyed reading this.
5	1371945600	So touching, so interesting, and so different. The characters are complex and genuine. The setting is fascinating and so well described. Couldn't put the book down
4	1371945600	We read this book for our book club and it was a good discussion with most of the women liking it.
5	1371945600	I loved this book and told all my friends to read it.  Its a beautiful story with a lovely ending but have your box of tissues handy!
5	1371859200	I loved this story.  It was one of the few books I did not want to put down.  For me it held many of the qualities of an Aesop's Fable, with lessons learned from actions taken.  I fell in love with the Australian locations, with the island of Janus Rock, the lighthouse, and the characters rich with their strengths and flaws and personal conflicts.  It is a beautiful read, but don't sit down without a tissue, because you will need it at some point.
3	1371859200	The book has rather disturbing characters and a story line that makes you wonder how you would react in the same situation.  Each character is needy in some way.  One questions who is the one being &#34;saved&#34; in this story?  Or do the characters spend their lives wondering about the decisions they ultimately made and how those decisions affected so many lives?
5	1371859200	We read the book in our bookclub and everyone thought it was an easy book to read and the arthur got 5 stars from most of the members.  Amazing for this being the author's first book.  I have been recommending it to friends.
5	1371859200	All about the complexity of life, the consequences of decisions,and forgiveness. Best book I've read in awhile.  Also fun learning about old lighthouses.
5	1371859200	I loved the book.  Found it hard to put down. It was an unusual story about life in a lighthouse.
5	1371859200	This is my favorite so far from Amazon.  The story is beautiful, sad, sobering.  The writing is magic and makes the reader see and experience everything it is trying to show us.  I'll definitely look for other books by this author.
5	1371859200	Better have some tissues ready.  A very thought provoking book that is great for a book club discussion.  You won't be sorry you read it!
5	1371859200	Every part of the story pulls at you and keeps you hoping for the best possible solution to terrible situations.  The resolution of it all is plausible and satisfying.I will read this again!
4	1371859200	I found it quite difficult getting involved till I was nearly half through. Then I was totally taken in, hence only 4 stars. Very worth the read. Excellent plot with believable characters. Artfully composed.
4	1371772800	I enjoyed this book so much. The characters were well developed and the plot took some twists and turns that I did not see coming. I felt like I could identify with the characters.  This is not a light read by any means but a wonderful, deep novel.
5	1371772800	Mysterious and beautiful....even when u don't agree u will empathize with all the well developed characters. Unforgettable ... And a must read
5	1371772800	Beautifully written with characters that are believable and human. A touching story of the effect of choices we make.  But be sure to keep your Kleenex handy!
5	1371772800	This was an excellent read.  Characters were well drawn.  Raised questions about adoptive parents or natural parentsrights to keep a child, regardless of what the child was familiar with.
5	1371772800	Beautifully written story that made me not want to do anything else but read this book. It's not your everyday tale.
5	1371772800	This was a very well written book that held my interest from beginning to end. Not only were the setting and plot unusual, but also the characters were so well developed that one could empathize with each of them. Additionally, there was much one could discuss about the moral implications of the actions of the main characters. Each faced difficult decisions which they resolved according to dictates of conscience, often rationalizing their decisions.I highly recommend this book and look forward to other books by the same author.
5	1371772800	Lots of &#34;feelings&#34; in this story. Well written and hard to put down. Loved learning about lighthouses and the Aussies.I'm not sure if this is a &#34;guy&#34;story, but i loved it...the ending was not really a surprise,or a disappointment, but I suppose it had to be...
5	1371686400	The Light Between Oceans was an intriguing book with emotional highs and lows. Tom and Isabel's life has some interesting twists and turns. This was a hard book to put down because I wanted to find out how the details of their lives turned out.
5	1371686400	This was a great read! Story of the pain of loss and the enduring qualities of love set in Australia. I particularly enjoyed the references to a culture with which I am not familiar.
4	1371686400	Was a slow read.  Liked the characters, but the story dragged on and on.  Lost interest, but finished because I had already read so much.
5	1371686400	I really liked this novel!Our book club read this book and everyone especially liked this selection.I highly recommend it!
5	1371686400	Loved everything about this book, well written, great characters . I would download another novel by the same author in a minute. This book kept me going, and I couldn't wait  to finish it. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great read.
5	1371686400	I was hoping for something good and experienced much more. Right from the start the storyline was interesting, but the unexpected part was how you are drawn in emotionally and then layered on top of that, you had to deal with complex moral issues.On several occasions I had to put the book down and go for a walk to either deal with the moral dilemma or an overwhelming pity and sadness for the characters and the situations they found themselves in. I could not hate any one of the characters and had to sympathize with them all.I am looking forward to further books by this author......
4	1371686400	Had a hard time putting the book down. It reminds me a little bit of books by Jodi Picoult in that it makes you stop and think, &#34; what would I do?&#34; ... &#34; what would my friends and family think and / or do? &#34;...
3	1371686400	This book is okay - but not something I would rave about to others and have them read.  It should be great for a book club discussion, though.
4	1371686400	good character development. parts of the story are contrived but otherwise enjoyable. Gals will enjoy the book generally more than guys but it's not a chick book. how far can you take a lie? What if it entirely ruins another person?
5	1371686400	This is the first book that my new bookclub has read where we all agreed that it was a great read. Good story, well written, interesting characters. Strong recommendation.
5	1371686400	Loved the book especially the ending, couldn't put it down.  Many sleepless nights reading this book, I recommend this book to everyone,
3	1371686400	good story, with an interesting premise. A litle heavy on the sexual side o the couple's relationship.. I have to believe her attraction was more more in depth...
5	1371686400	This was a book that I could not put down.  I could totally understand why the lighthouse caretakers kept the baby and I could also see how the birth mother needed to have her baby returned.  Gut wrenching how things turned out.
4	1371600000	A beautiful story set in a tragic place and time period. Worth your valuable reading time this summer. The Janus, Tom & Isabel will stay with you after you've read the last page. Good book to discuss with a friend or book club.
5	1371600000	Great story.  Slightly historic, very unrealistic story, but romantic and a quick read. I would recommend it for a vaca read.
5	1371600000	Stedman is a master storyteller. Can't believe it's a first novel. The characters were so real I cried for the last third of the book. A must read.
4	1371600000	I got this book for a book club. It certainly wasn't on my reading list,but all in all, it was good. At times the premise seemed stretched, but the author really did well with the conflict of the characters.
5	1371513600	This is my first read by M.L Steadman and I loved it. This book is a page turner. There were times I read late into the night not knowing how the book would end. This is a book that you don't want to end. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
5	1371513600	I just loved the detail of life on Janis. I've never been to Australia and Stedman brought it to life for me. I plan to wait a couple of months before I read it again. That way the details are not fresh in my mind and re-read it will seem like it's the first time all over again.
5	1371427200	This book was so poignantly written...you felt the pain of the situation from everyone's point of view. The things that good people can do, for the love of each other and the love of a child are so vividly brought to life!
5	1371427200	Something told me just looking at the title this would be a good book. I could not put it down. The beginning of it was good, just a little slow. But once you get into the story it is very emotional, I actually had tears on my kindle. A true story of the life and isolation of a lightman and those he loves and how it feels to love and lose a child. It is a must read........
4	1371427200	I enjoyed this story that blends postwar trauma with the challenges of parenthood, relationships and work responsibilities. The portrait of rural Australia between the wars seemed accurate, too.
4	1371427200	The writing is beautiful. I now know what it is like to live at a lighthouse both as a keeper and as a resident.  I also  know I could not do it.  The book shows parenthood in all its happiness and in all its grief. It was a sad tale.
5	1371427200	This story is beautifully crafted.  It is compelling and unexpected.  It will move you and remind you about the lengths people go to for love.
4	1371427200	The book is well written but tells an extremely sad story whose ending is almost inevitable, given the circumstances.  Stedman makes readers feel for all the characters.
3	1371340800	Strong characters, compelling plot, and good writing, but the  pacing was a bit off.  Part 1 hooked the reader, Part 2 dragged and needed trimming, Part 3 began to pick up the pace found in Part 1 only to get bogged down in too many extra scenes. The ending was not uplifting, as some may have liked, but it was true to life and therefore just as tragic as life can often be.  I liked it, but would have liked it more with a much stronger edit.
5	1371340800	I loved The Light Between Oceans for many reasons, not the least of which was the compelling reality of how deeply grief affects us all and in such very different ways.
5	1371340800	When I first heard of this novel, I knew I had to grab hold and read it.  I savored each word, I was not disappointed.  The story is gripping, poetically written, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy memorable characters - yet coated with tragedy.  At the conclusion I had not wept so much since reading about Gus McCrae at the end of Lonesome Dove.
3	1371340800	On a friend's recommendation I read this book - she loved it - I can't say I did.  Knowing the plot was part of my problem because it is  based on a very ethical dilemma and that in itself is what I found hard to comprehend.  None-the-less, it is an excellently written and a well crafted novel.  The first half is almost dream like but the second half, although probably accurate as to how how others would react to the situation they found themselves in, I found it difficult to read because couldn't quite understand the motives of the characters.  The end, however, leaves the reader reasonably satisfied.
4	1371340800	Interesting analogy of the human spirit and mind. Even in isolation from the world at large, the same things happen.
5	1371340800	It's been a long time since I could say that.  There were some interesting turns in the climax.  That said, I usually don't get into novels set in the past or a different country, but this one pulled me in.  The overlying question I kept thinking was: what would I do in that situation.
5	1371340800	the kind of reading you're sorry to see the end of.  great story, great writing. one of the best in a long time, will surely become a classic.
4	1371340800	The storyline of this book unfolds into a wide range of emotions, challenges, and experiences of a young married couple as they live in seclusion within a lighthouse.  The book slowly draws the reader to observe the events with compassion.
4	1371340800	If the story isn't good, then what have you got? I found this very compelling. Characters were strong but the story is the best part!
4	1371340800	It really moves along at a good pace. One can understand Isabella's motivation completely. Her recent losses made Lucy's arrival seem to be sent from God. But back in the town, Hannah can't recover. Her persistence and Tom's guilt win her back her daughter. I personally think they could've gotten away with it if not for Tom's guilt. And, I think Isabella, at her core, knew that she was the right mother for that baby
5	1371340800	Very well written and intriguing.  Developed characters and an easy to follow plot.  Found I couldn't put it down.  Best read in months!
5	1371254400	The twist and turns and emotions made it difficult to put this book down.  Very well written and thought provoking.
3	1371254400	Premise was interesting, maybe a little contrived, at least you could see it coming from early on in the book.She needed to spend more time on the effects of the miscarriages on her psyche.
3	1371254400	I won't be a spoiler but although it is good for a discussion I didn't love it. I found the characters frustrating.  But the story does lend itself to a &#34;what would you do&#34; conversation.
4	1371254400	I had a hard time getting into this book. For me it didn't start until Tom met Isabel.  Once they moved to Janus I was captivated by the story.
5	1371254400	There simply aren't enough superlatives for this exceptional novel, so treat yourself to a real treasure and just read it.
3	1371254400	This is a tearjerker. The story is compelling, but I felt myself adrift until midway when the characters got busy defending their actions. The story did not need the tidy ending.
5	1371254400	A Fabulous read.  I read it aloud to my family so that they could share it at the same time. A beautiful story that we all loved. Spellbinding.The characters are wonderful.. We were still talking about it days after we finishedthe book. I could envision it as a great TV series.I hope the author writes more.
5	1371168000	This is really a great novel in the best Greek tragedy tradition, and the best one my book group has chosen to read. It is well written and keeps the reader in suspense until the end.
5	1371168000	The Light Between Oceans is a gripping tale of human decision-making that follows a fateful occurrence on a remote lighthouse island 100 miles off the southwest coast of Australia. The writing is clear and fast-paced but poetic and the reader can identify with various points of view even when they are directly in conflict. The novel is so  masterful that It is hard to believe that this is the author's first novel.
5	1371168000	No spoilers! What a wonderful book! It's been a long time since I've read such a wonderfully written book! Very bittersweet. Incredible storytelling! M.L. Stedman could be this century's George MacDonald! Highly recommend this gem of a book!!
5	1371168000	Intriguing and gut wrenching a perfect story to be told. Highly recommended  .Describing two very different types of love . Thank you.Will recommend.
5	1371168000	I personally love historical fiction.  This was a well written book with a unique storyline.  As a mother, it was easy to relate to the characters.
4	1371168000	I really enjoyed this book, knowing all along that it couldn't end well.  The first half is a sweet love story, the second half is heart-wrenching.  I found the ending incredibly sad, but satisfactory.
3	1371168000	I felt that the characters could have been more evolved. It was not as gripping as I had hoped and it was so cold in places I thought it strange written by a woman.
5	1371168000	Discriminating readers of literary fiction will really enjoy and appreciate The LIght Between Oceans.  I could read this over and over again - I constantly search Kindle for similar books/authors.  The novel has authentic and original characters, setting, plot - nothing contrived here. Loved it - hope he writes something new soon.
4	1371168000	Love the character development and the emotional aspect of this novel...very thought provoking...stays with you after you have finished reading it.
3	1371081600	Story was very well told and characters very well developed through the majority of the book but I felt the author got tired of writing or lost sight of where the characters should go.
5	1371081600	I loved reading this book. I'd actually read only the first chapter a while ago, put it down, and started another novel. I just got back to it again the other day and I'm so glad I did. It starts out slowly but once it picks up, you can't put it down.It read like poetry to me..just beautiful passages that make you stop and reread them again.The characters were so real and well developed. I felt for all of them. Having had several miscarriages myself at a younger age, I could empathize with "Izzy" and I found myself rooting for her, even if it was wrong. The character of "Tom" was just amazing...such a dear soul.Thank-you M.L. Stedman for writing such a moving story that brought me to tears at the end. Would love to see it made into a movie.
5	1371081600	I loved this book and it will be the one our book club reads next . I loved this man's honesty  and his morals in the story. his wife was precious and only a mother can feel for her . they done the right thing . the daughter coming back to see an elderly  step father was beautiful.
5	1371081600	``````Learned so much I didn&#34;t know about love, loss, and lighthouses.  The morality message weaved without words was deeply moving.
2	1371081600	I usually can make it past a slow beginning, but not this time! Writing was to abstract for my tastes. Not bad , but not good either.
4	1371081600	From the first chapter when the boat washes up to shore with a crying baby inside, I was hooked.  This book was hard to put down.
4	1371081600	Great insight into the lives of the men who kept the ships safe by maintaining lighthouses. A very intriguing moral dilemma and handled very well.
5	1371081600	I loved this book because I could feel the emotions of every single character.  Every character had justification for their actions or inactions and no one was a villan.  This book was well written and it kept me coming back for more.  I couldn't imagine how they were going to solve their problems.  My heart ached for each of them.
5	1371081600	I have been overtaken.... and left mentally and physically drained ....yet captivated....by the journey on which this story has taken me. Picturesque....poetic....ugly....sad....and all together beautiful. Worth every moment!
4	1370995200	Well written, this book offers the reader an opportunity to better understand the solitude life of those manning remote light stations, while enjoying a story with several levels that constantly require the reader to consider the ethical questions brought forth. An intriguing book that is hard to put down!
5	1370995200	Loved the book!  I found this book thought provoking filled with trials and tribulations.  Such a wide range of emotions.  I loved the characters and far from predictable ending.
4	1370995200	It was intriguing with well developed characters, but had a disappointing ending. Tom's life journey was shaped by events and people along the way, but his story was really about his inability to make good choices.  The book was recommended to me by a friend, and I have recently passed the recommendation on to another friend
5	1370995200	My son read and recommended this and I enjoyed it very much. I could hardly put it down and I recommended it to a friend who concurred.
4	1370995200	This book held my interest from beginning to end.  Very good.I never thought about the people that take care of lighthouses.  I have a new understanding of a lighthouse keeper.  The story was wonderful.  I wonder what I would do if I were in their shoes.
5	1370995200	Loved the story, well written.  We reviewed it for my book club and every single member enjoyed this pick.  The moral dilemmas facing the characters were gut wrenching.
4	1370908800	What would you do?  Duty bound to your job or your wife?  Who knows what we would choose if facing the same situation.
4	1370908800	Characters are fully developed, they stay with you. it is a poignant and sad story, one that I would reread to absorb her writing.
5	1370908800	I recommend this book to all book clubs.  There is so much information to discuss!  The characters are so real!
5	1370908800	The moral choices of the characters propel the story forward.  Leaves you understanding how moment to moment decisions have startling effects.
4	1370908800	This book was one we chose for book club, which ended up being a great decision because it sparks a lot of conversation. If you've ever had children or trouble getting pregnant I think you'll find this especially interesting. I would definitely recommend it.
4	1370908800	The effects of war on small Aussie villiage following WWI and the emotional devestation caused by an inability to have a child.  A book about honor, ethics and love.
5	1370908800	This novel was a fun and emotional read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has loved and lost. It was a wonderful story and beautifully written.
5	1370908800	Stedman examines the essence of love and forgiveness with razor sharp clarity. The characters in this story work out their destinies within the frameworks of their inner convictions, their personal demons, and of the world outside themselves.  The story is deeply moving and it will stay with you beyond the final page.  Don't miss this one!
5	1370908800	This was a wonderful story!  True, in the beginning I was a little tempted to put it aside, butI continued and loved every syllable!  There should be more humanity, such as true love,thoughtfulness, kindness, etc. in this world.  I read the newspaper to visually impaired peopleand one of them told me about a fabulous audio book about a couple who took care of alighthouse.  When I picked up on her comments, we found out we were discussing the samebook and she, too, would love more of this genre.  (Made me think of Billy Budd.)  Same thinghapened in our Book Club.
5	1370908800	Very moving story of. Life's  joys and sad times.  I was impressed with the author's honesty in telling the story and avoiding a fairy tale ending. It would make an excellent read for a book club.
5	1370908800	This is a very different story.  No viliains, no scary people, only good people making bad choices which leads to - who is right and who is wrong.  A real moral dilemma that you won't want to put down.  I loved the story.
5	1370908800	an unusual story.  It  makes the reader questions what they would do in that circumstancel  A different vinue.  Absorbing characters.  A book one doesn't forget quickly.
5	1370822400	This is a wlAell written and heart wrenching story. Any one whoHas  ever loved a child will not just read but feel every word.a
5	1370822400	Best read I've had in a while. Got to say. &#34;I loved it&#34;. Great writing, will  buy more books by M.L.Stedman
5	1370822400	One of those books you stay up late into the night reading,so hard to put down. Beautifully written and wonderfully descriptive. Read this for book club and know it will make for great discussion.
3	1370822400	The author wrote with great detail. I felt like I was on Janis with them, but the storyline was just okay, I thought the book involved a great number of characters which made it hard to keep track. But if you're looking for a decent, easy read, this is a good fit.
5	1370822400	I kept hearing about this novel. It reminded me of other stories I read a long time ago. The descriptive writing of the author made you feel like you were living amongst the characters. The information about the lighthouse was so informative. A very good read.
5	1370822400	GREAT CAPTIVATING STORY Tells of true love and brings honor back to triumph.The light is the goodness that dwells when things appear the darkest.
5	1370822400	I would highly recommend this book for nearly anyone who likes a bit of romance mixed in with a mystery.  Thought provoking decisions made by various people in this book and many surprises that keep your interest until the end.  Great read for a book club.
5	1370822400	You may think that it would not be  interesting , but, you would be wrong.  It is a love story with depth.
4	1370736000	I loved the way this book was written. I felt the pain and struggle right along with Isabel and Tom.  Hard times can make people give up relationships. I was so glad she took him back in the end and let him love her. Great job!
3	1370736000	The story was interesting, it was the telling of it that was the problem. Toward the middle of the book I felt it became repetitious and a bit like a soap operas. I think a better editor would have helped.
4	1370736000	Great book, tight storytelling, great character development, intriguing story. Loved learning about the lighthouse, and the richness of the characters.
5	1370736000	I don't usually read a first time novelist's book, but a friend recommended this.  The book is beautifuuly written and keeps you riveted from the begining to the end.  Brought tears to my eyes.  The story makes you think about morals and what you would do in the same or similar situation, while painting a beautiful picture of life post WWI in Australia.  I would highly recommend this book.
4	1370649600	This book explored an era and occupation that I was not familiar with. It was fascinating. Made me appreciate all that we have today.
5	1370649600	I cried in this book as it is the sad story of one child who is loved by her birth mother and also by her illegally adoptive parents. It takes place in Australia on a remote lighthouse. The ending pulled things together well.
5	1370649600	I could not put this book down.  I have recommended it to many people.  I read it in one day.
4	1370649600	Would highly recommend to book clubs.  This book will engender lots of great book club discussions.  Engrossing tale of love and loss set in Australia after World War I.
5	1370649600	The book held my interest from beginning to end.  The strong characters were well discribed.  Would like to read more.
4	1370649600	Sympathy for all characters involved.  Well written and emotionally moving all the way to the end.  I would recommend reading  this very interesting novel.
4	1370649600	This book is well written, interesting subject about which I know little and likeable characters. I would never give up my child.
3	1370649600	If not for the last chapter I would have rated this book lower. It drags in the middle and I found myself losing interest. It is surely well written but took too long to tell despite only being 300 or so pages. The last chapter was great and pulled at the heart strings that I wanted to feel earlier in the book.
3	1370649600	The plot was somewhat predictable and not really a new concept. The book was entertaining in that regard. However, I felt the character development was lacking. The reader does not feel an emotional connection to any of the main characters, and with such an emotional storyline the author could have really shown how the confluence of events affected Tom and Isabel and Hannah on a deeper level. I felt that it just scratched the surface and I didn't really care about the characters at the end, just the little girl.
5	1370563200	I loved this book.  This is a pick for my book club.  It lends itself to lots of interesting discussion.
5	1370563200	Welcome in to the lives of Tom and Isabel.  This book will challenge your perception of right and wrong and leave you wondering if you could make the choices they did.  I spent the last hour finishing this book and haven't stopped crying.  I now have a headache from crying but still this book is a favorite.
5	1370563200	Loved the book and thought it was more than a page turner.  Very well written and characters are well drawn.
4	1370563200	A little slow in the beginning, but then became very interesting.  Easy to read.  It ended realistically even though everyone wanted it to end differently!
5	1370563200	Exploration of a different geographical area of the world.Information on lighthouses.Drama.TensionBelievable characters.In all a bit of a page turner!
5	1370563200	Thjis book is a great story of a very difficult decision that haunts the couple for their entire lives.  I was spellbound by the book.
5	1370563200	Very compelling and beautiful story and  fascinating characters.  Many twists and unexpected turns.  Extremely relatable characters and the author, Stedman, makes you laugh and weep.  A fast and enjoyable read.
4	1370563200	I enjoyed this story.  I could personally relate to the main characters as my husband and I needed to adopt to have our family.  I did feel the story &#34;bogged down&#34; in a few places though.  Overall it was a good book and was written in a descriptive style.
4	1370563200	Life is dynamic. This book  illustrated and reminded me how decisions are dependent on the time and  technology available. . Has there ever been a &#34;black and white&#34; world where no one gets hurt? Good book for discussion.
5	1370563200	Life often makes twists that test our moral values to the core.  Any mother can feel the emotions behind all characters involved in this story.  Which one will you identify with?
5	1370563200	Stumbled upon this and fell in love reading it. Read it in 4 days. Very touching, mysterious, engaging. Recommended to mothers and fathers for sure...
3	1370563200	I did enjoy the first half of the novel.  I was interested in the lighthouse information. The main characters were nicely introduced.  The conflict in the novel was satisfying and the progression intriguing.  Once the story climaxed in the only way it could, the denouement was disappointing.  The characters stopped growing and interacting. The book just slipped away with a feeble attempt at the end for closure.The book was just solid and interesting enough that I would recommend it as a summer read.
5	1370563200	I chose this rating because I found the book grabbed my attention from the beginning and held it all the way through the book.You got to know the individuals in the story and could understand what each of them were going through.I would recommend this book.
4	1370563200	Slow to start, but picks up fast and impossible to put down. I think if you are still thinking about a book weeks after you read it, it's a good one, and this is!
4	1370563200	I found myself driven by the human longing for light in the midst of profound loss and despair the characters endured.  The prose was captivating.  I couldn't put the book down.
4	1370563200	The beginning was slow, but kept me interested and wanting to read more.I started to relate to the characters and enjoyed it overall.
5	1370563200	The book really kept my interest and I couldn't put it down.  It was an unusual situation and the author did a great job of showing all sides.
5	1370476800	This is one of the best books I have read all year. I enjoyed every page, and was so sorry when it was over. The moral question that is at the heart of the book stayed in my mind for a long time. This is a terrific book club selection. Highly recommended.
5	1370476800	This beautifully crafted work is tailor made for book club discussion.  The landscapes are so well written, you feel them in your bones.  The characters are so well developed, you understand their choices regardless of whether you agree or approve.  It has been interesting to discuss the book with friends and family and see how differently we feel about the outcomes and whether 'justice' was served.  Read this book for its beauty and artistry; read it for the truly captivating story; read it because of its indelible sense of place: read it because it will touch your heart and make you consider what is right and what is just.  Congratulations on a masterpiece, Ms Stedman.
4	1370476800	I couldn't put this down. Well written and beautifully descriptive of Australia's rugged western coast line, this novel captivated my senses with its vivid natural imagery and heart wrenching dilemmas.
4	1370476800	Started out a little predictable, but swiftly became a page-turner.  Makes you question what would YOU do in this situation.  A good read.
5	1370476800	The Light Between Oceans is a journey into a world of lies,mistakes,and life. How your choices hurt you or help you become a better person. They always affect you no matter what. Great story!
3	1370390400	I just gave it three strs because it made me so nervous I couln't finish the book. Was too afraid to learn what might happen!
5	1370390400	This book piqued all of my interests: history, human conflict, and what constitutes a family.Have recommended it to everyone who has asked for a good book.
5	1370390400	Great book! Author is very talented at describing characters and their relationships.  I felt I really knew the personalities and could understand their feelings. Will highly recommend to others!
5	1370390400	The story is simple and yet powerfully written in an almost poetic style.  It was so easy to get caught up in the characters because of the way each was developed.  The past and the present were blended in an easy to follow manner.  I also enjoyed the underlying issues of right and wrong.  It made me evaluate how I might respond in each situation...walk a mile in another's shoes. It was a &#34;three-cry&#34; book for me and one I will remember.
5	1370390400	The Light Between Oceans is a fantastic read. The characters are richly developed and pull you in to their story; it was difficult to put the book down once I started!
4	1370390400	Had me hooked about 1/4 into the story.  I rarely stop and just sit and read in large blocks of time, but on this one, I found I had to stop everything just to find out what came next.  While I knew there was bad news ahead, I didn't know exactly how it would play out.Really enjoyed the writing.  Reminded me in some ways of the style of some of classics I read in high school and college.  Very traditional in many ways but crafted so well.  The writing is remarkable.I rarely just sit and sob at the end of a novel but on this one I did.  Totally captured me.Didn't give it five stars only because it wasn't one of those books that just altered my view of everything.  Admittedly, that sets a pretty high standard.
5	1370390400	This is a very enjoyable well written book. Both the plot and the writing make it well worth the read. I will look for more by M L Stedman.
5	1370390400	I really liked it as you can tell from my five star review. It was kinda sad. It made me think. I don't know what else to say because I didn't know we had to WRITE a review. I just wanted to give it five stars . Plus, I don't want to spoil it for you.
4	1370390400	Well crafted, good story.  (If a little far fetched).  I appreciated the conflicts, especially of the two major adult female characters.
5	1370390400	Liked how you got a sense of what it was like living in a lighthouse.  A story of how bad things happen to good people and how they handle it.  I rank it up there with N. Sparks and J. Picoult!  I will be looking forward to more M.L. Stedman books!
5	1370304000	Thank you, Ms. Stedman, for sharing such a beautiful, deeply touching story. Your writing is world class, and the emotions it has conveyed will stay with me always.
5	1370304000	This was a great story about a couple who will finally have the family they always wanted until one day...will they lose it all?  It's a bittersweet story that is difficult to decide what is right. A good, easy read!
3	1370304000	This book rates high praise and heavy readership?  How many times can I read about which birds are making which noises in which trees?  How many times can I read about how the man, Tom, feels badly about keeping the baby?  And, mostly and lastly, how many times will I read a book which seems promising until about mid-point, and then descends into the monotony resulting from yet another writer not knowing how to end a book?  The last half of this book was tedius, and the end parts were extremely poorly conceived.  I am angry, this morning, about how this book seemed promising yet stole two nights of my life.
4	1370304000	Overall I thought the book was good. It was very slow moving in the beginning and I had a hard time getting into it. But once I got through the first six chapters I couldn't put the book down.
5	1370304000	Although the facts of this mystery was known from the story's beginning, how this tale ended was not predictable and as the characters emotionally wove through the story, this reader's attention was pulled in.
3	1370217600	This is M.L. Stedman's first novel, and it was better than I expected when I first started reading it. At first, it is rather slow as you read about the history of Tom and Isabel, it picks up a little when they meet and begin dating, and then once they both move out to the lighthouse on Janus rock, it becomes very emotional. This couple goes through hard times that many women can most likely identify with. The author does an amazing job of capturing the sadness and injustice a couple feels when their children are torn away from them in numerous ways.Once Tom makes a decision to reach out to someone affected by the loss of her child, the book becomes really suspenseful. The author's use of metaphor is one of the better aspects of this book, as it seems that each of the characters goes through a time when they are torn between two different choices or different lives altogether. This book was an emotional one and certainly made me tear up a couple of times. All in all, it was a good read, but not one that I would have the urge to read again, which is why I rated it 3 stars. I hope to see more from M.L. Stedman!
4	1370217600	This book takes you on a journey that can be very scary. Choosing between right and wrong and doing all you can for the person you love. I liked the book but I would not recommend the book to anyone who is pregnant or just had a baby. I was a little disappointed at the ending. No happily ever after here.
3	1370217600	This was a good "easy" read that was a bit slow in th  beginning and I must admit the main girl annoyed me a lot in the beginning. However the author in my opinion did a good job tiring the whole book together and I read the second half in one night because I had to know the end. The characters had depth but also a lot of mystery, at times a little too much to know their motives.
5	1370217600	I loved the story, and felt it was very thought provoking. I tried to imagine what would I do faced with such a decision. I think this would be a great book club selection, what a great discussion!
3	1370217600	This was a book club selection.  Interesting story about the isolation and difficult life of a "keeper" and his family.  Descriptions were well written and vivid; however, storyline was very predictable.
4	1370217600	I enjoyed this book very much. It did keep my attention and made me want to keep turning the page.
3	1370217600	I found the story unbelievable . But at my book club we had a lively discussion. I thought that the moral dilemma was a no-brainer. Others felt sympathy and understanding for both husband and wife.
5	1370217600	I truly enjoyed reading The Light Between Oceans.  I only wished it had more happiness for Tom and Izzy at the end.LOVE IT.
4	1370217600	This novel represented very well how a taciturn loner's motives and reasoning can be misunderstood by others, including the one who loves him. The events were foreshadowed in a clever way so as not to give anything away. I found the description of how the old lighthouse operated and life at a lighthouse very interesting.
4	1370217600	Enjoyed most of the book.  Found it dragged in a few places.  It surely was a bit contrived, but I still found it an easy and enjoyable read.
5	1370217600	Wonderful characters trying to do the right thing and getting tangled-up in their own imperfection.  The writing is superb and the plot is engaging.  I loved it.
5	1370131200	This is a book I've already recommended on Facebook. I will be thinking about the impossible situation these characters found themselves in for a long time. There was no solution to leave everyone happy, but the author developed a very plausible resolution nevertheless. The bittersweet ending left me satisfied.
4	1370131200	Light Between Oceans: It's a good story with an interesting plot twist. Some of the conflict seemscontrived but all and all a nice summer read.
1	1370131200	This was a nicely written story with interesting use of flashback and foreshadowing. She had lots of great detail but the transitions were weak. Although I had this nagging feeling of deja vu, I enjoyed the story greatly.
5	1370131200	The is a true love story. I don't remember the last time I cried at the end of a book. The author's use of language makes the reader see the love and affection between Isabel and Tom. You find yourself rooting for someone who has committed a crime and against the person who suffers because of that crime. I learned about lighthouses as well as Australia in the early twenties and thirties. I really loved this book.
4	1370131200	This made for good reading, it kept me engaged. I do wish the author would have included what some of the slang terms used in Australia meant.
5	1370131200	This novel is a powerful piece of storytelling. The characters are each so complex and true to life, and the descriptions vivid and engaging. Phrases are rendered with originality and grace. The story is deeply personal while the suspense and mystery it contains rises throughout to the climax. Themes of loss, the effect of our past upon us, and forgiveness all are present here, and more. Excellent read!
2	1370131200	Kept hoping for more . Nothing more than a Nicholas Sparks imitator. Draggy, predictable, very little substance. Boring...right up to the end.
4	1370131200	The moral dilemma it  presented was painful and did not have an easy solution.  T he writing was excellent and Tom Sherbourne was a wondeful character.  I could not predict in my mind a gooddlution (unless the author had decided to let  Tom and Isabel keep the child and have Hannah be the much beloved surrogate aunt).  But I believe the author came up with th4e best  solution:  it probably best to let Isabel suffer for her sincere but misguided decision.  Very thought-provoking  book and not too easy to put down.  Pat S.
5	1370131200	I have read 6  book s in the last month ,I could not put  it down took it everywhere. I give  this book 7 stars it was awesome to read!
4	1370131200	This book is well written and draws the reader into its very unique setting at a desolate lighthouse island.  The poignant issues between husband and wife, mother and child, are very touching.
5	1370044800	An excellent book about a dilemma. The author presents it in such a way that one can relate to both sides of the story and yet lets the reader make up their mind!  I highly recommend this great read!
4	1370044800	Intrigued by the setting and era of this novel, I found it lovely and maddening.  It is truly a testament to the power of love.
4	1370044800	This is a story that is based on an unlikely scenario of events. As a result, Stedman is free to formulate a creative story line that tugs on your heart strings at every turn. We read this book for our book club and it facilitated a rich discussion.
4	1370044800	Very good story. This was read by my book club and was followed by very good discussions. I would read more by this author.
5	1370044800	The Light Between Oceans: A Novel was a wonderful character study.  Each character was fully developed.  It was a very compelling novel and I would highly recommend it.
5	1370044800	Part historical fiction, but mostly a wonderful story about love and disappointment. I loved this book and have recommended it to many.
5	1370044800	What a well written book.  Couldn't put it down until finished.  Can't wait to read another book like this one........that's what makes discovering great reads so satisfying.
4	1370044800	This was a book chosen for our book club and we all enjoyed it.  It was an interesting read but it also had aspects that made it great for a book club selection.  There were many different things to discuss about the characters and the plot.
5	1370044800	The book started out slow, half way thru the book I couldn't,but it down. I learned a lot about light houses. I don,t know what I would have done in their situation.
5	1369958400	The reader is drawn in until the book can't be put down. It reaches into the core of your heart. Recommending it to my bookclub!
5	1369958400	It was a very interesting book.  It included romance, mystery and life's lessons.  Made a good book club discussion book
5	1369958400	Beautiful first Line, so typical of author's prose: On the day of the miracle, Isabel was kneeling at the cliff's edge, tending the small, newly made driftwood cross.Tom Sherbourne, a World War I veteran, educated engineer, returns home to Australia, to  forget and find a job where he can be of use, and to be left to himself. He takes a job as the lighthouse keeper, a life of isolation where the supply boat comes four times a year, and shore leave might be granted every other year at best.To this life, Tom brings a young, and loving wife, but years pass, and after two miscarriages and a stillbirth, Tom sees that the wife he loves more than life itself is wasting away before his eyes. One morning while tending those tiny graves, Isabel hears a baby's cry on the wind. It is not her imagination. A boat has washed ashore. Aboard are a dead man and a tiny living baby girl.No one has taken better care of the Janus Rock Lighthouse than Tom Sherbourne. Everything gleams; every bit of machinery runs smoothly; and his records are meticulous. Tom is an intensely moral man, and he wants to report the man and infant immediately, but Isabel has taken the baby and clings to her like a drowning woman to a life raft. Against his better judgment, the incident is not reported, and Tom and Isabel claim the baby as their own and name her Lucy. For Isabel, life is idyllic for two years. Then leave is granted, and the family of three return to shore where they are reminded that there are other people in the world, and their decision has ruined the life of several of them.You would never dream that The Light Between Oceans is a debut novel. The descriptions of the isolated setting of Janus Rock are beautifully  drawn: the wind, the birds, the air, the waves, the light at night. The sights, the scents, the sounds-- they all come alive  as do the streets and the inhabitants of the small town of Partageuse where Isabel's parents live, and where Tom, Isabel and Lucy spend their infrequent leave.It's impossible to read this book and not become totally drawn in by the setting and the characters.You won't find any easy answers in The Light Between Oceans, but you will find a beautifully written and sensitively told story about people who make mistakes and endure the fall out that follows.
4	1369958400	..Any reader with a love affair for Lighthouses will enjoy this book. Many little details of nature add to the book.
5	1369958400	Yesterday, I noticed Amazon had dropped the Kindle edition price on The Light Between Oceans to $4.99. I couldn't pass it up. It would have been a deal at three times the price. This is one of my favorite reads in the past year, maybe the past decade. It's been a long, long time since I've read such beautiful prose. M.L. Stedman, the debut author, is brilliant. Because of her talent, the Janus Rock Lighthouse, and its isolated setting will stay with me a long time. I'm not kidding when I tell people that Chapters 2-6 are some of the most relaxing words I've ever read.But there is a story here too. A fantastic, emotionally-charged story that isn't so relaxing. You name the emotion, it's here. Some of it in the setting of the Janus Rock Lighthouse. Some of it in the port of Partageuse, both set in Western Australia.It begins in the 1910&#8242;s with Tom Sherbourne, a veteran of the Great War. A man who felt guilt for the things he'd done in the war and was now just looking for some sort of inner peace. Those horrible things that happened in the war shaped his decisions throughout his life. We're with him when he finds what he thinks is the perfect job for him, keeper of the Janus Rock Lighthouse. We follow him as he meets Isabel, who eventually becomes his wife. Isabel is a happy-go-lucky girl whose spirit brings a lot of life and contentment to the isolation of life as a lighthouse keeper. But each miscarriage she has, and ultimately a stillborn baby, erodes that contentment and starts a series of choices that change their lives.Throughout the story, I'm reminded that this is a book about choice:"We always have a choice. We live with the decisions we make. That's what bravery is. Standing by the consequences of your mistakes."And throughout the story that's exactly what the characters do - they all develop from the choices they make in life. It seems like a common, simple premise, but this book is written so well, with such vivid imagery and detail, that it doesn't feel simple anymore. It's anything but. The plot is constantly moving along, there's never a lull. It feels real. And life is more real than it is simple. As a reader, I genuinely felt every emotion the characters did - happiness, sadness, loneliness, humiliation, frustration, fear - it was a real emotional roller coaster. I loved it. I didn't have to work to feel these emotions either, the writer just took me there with ease. It was pure pleasure reading these pages.I literally can't wait to see what Stedman writes next. I know I won't wait a year to read it!
5	1369958400	I stayed up late to finish this book, tears running down my face as I concluded.  The beauty of this book is that the author managed to show us the situation from each major character's viewpoint, with their love, their flaws, their reasoning for the choices they make.  It's truly a sign of a good novel when you feel you "know" the characters and are sad to leave their world.  Others have outlined the story, so I don't feel the need to do that.  I just loved the characters, the writing, the setting and the history involved.  I'll be eagerly looking for this author's next book.
4	1369872000	I really enjoyed this book because it seems real and makes you wonder what you would do in the situation.It's a page turner but a bit more on the darker side.  It is not a "summer, take to the beach/pool" read,  it's a "cozy up on a brisk morning in early spring or fall" read.Enjoy
5	1369872000	This is an outstanding story. It is well written and has you guessing through all the twists and turns. I would highly recommend it!
5	1369872000	For anyone who has, like myself picked up this book and stopped reading it, PLEASE pick it up again and read on. I found the book to be somewhat slow in the beginning but in the end I couldn't imagine the start of it to be any different. This book was an emotional struggle for me, one that I would never wish on any mother.The love and loss found in this novel is hard to write in a review. What a fantastic book, I will recommended it to everyone I know.
5	1369872000	5 Stars. A beautifully written first novel. The imagery and the accuracy of the emotional ebbs and flows that life throws at us is as powerful as the ocean that serves as a backdrop to this story. A constant reminder that we all live with the choices we make and that life goes on regardless of us. Please please please Ms. Stedman write another one!
5	1369872000	A beautifully told story of classical dimension: filled with struggles between right and wrong. Many strong symbols add depth. I read it once quickly for the story then re-read it for a deeper understanding of its many layers. I will read it again. Indelible strongly-drawn characters, fascinating setting, compelling and dramatic story.Tom and Isabel begin their marriage on a island where Tom is the lighthouse keeper.  A small boat washes up in a cove and the story takes off.This would be a great book for a high school English class to read and analyze.
5	1369872000	This was a beautifully written story about people I liked. It was a joy to read  and it would be great for a book club because there is so much to discuss.
4	1369872000	Heart wrenching story of devotion and loss.  Touches the part of your that longs for a happy ending.  I would wholeheartedly recommend it.
5	1369872000	I did not want to put it down it was so good. I empathized with the characters and story. The ending was sad but I liked it.
5	1369872000	Morally complex and beautifully written.  Take the time to savor the imagery and ponder the deep meaning behind the passages.
5	1369872000	I seldom cry, but there is a sweetness to this story that moved me so.  Love and tragedy, and gifts of the spirit.  It's a wonderful book.
5	1369872000	This book reminded me of books written by one of my favorite authors, Thomas Hardy.  It was well-written, filled with beautiful imagery, and had a page-turner of a plot.  Highly recommend.
5	1369785600	This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The characters were interesting and well developed, and the story was unique.  I look forward to her next book.
4	1369785600	At first I wasn't sure but after the first few chapter of history I really enjoyed this book..couldn't wait to know what was going to happen. I was very happy with the ending. Our book club would highly recommend this book!
5	1369785600	I just starting reading and it is hard to put down. It's a lot like &#34;The Snow Child&#34; I read a few months ago. I would suggest both these books to anyone.
5	1369785600	The character development is very deep and detailed. There is no black and white in this book - only gray. You'll find yourself torn on what ending you're hoping for.
5	1369785600	Stedman's ability to take the reader by the hand into the atmosphere of the lighthouse on Janus Island enriches our knowledge of such an isolated setting.  The impossible quandary that Tom and Isabel face is daunting.  The child, Lucy's arrival on the island was somewhat biblical like Moses being found in the basket by the Phraroh's daughter. Her 'adoptive' mother, Izzy welcomed her as a gift from God.  The untenable situation of Tom's inner struggle between his duty and his love for Izzy is a constant reminder of how truth hurts. The shadows of war  hang heavy in Tom's memory, perhaps clouding  rational judgement. In the end, nobody really wins. Recovery does come from a surprising source at the end. An excellent story with an adequate solution.
5	1369785600	I loved this book.  I could just picture the lighthouse in which the couple lived and how life could become very lonely. Their desire to have a child and the support of the husband was a true love story.  This was a book that I could not put down.
4	1369785600	Interesting story line.  Enjoyed reading it, although not the most interesting book I have read.  Could have been a bit faster moving or something.
5	1369785600	Loved the characters, reading about their lives and the twists and turns.  Highly recommend!!  Will be looking for more books from M.L. Stedman.
4	1369785600	IT WAS VERY SAD ON MANY LEVELS.  A CHILD TORN FROM THE PARENTS WHO LOVED HER  AND SENT TO A STRANGER.  THERE WAS NO OTHER RESOLUTION POSSIBLE, I SUPPOSE.  OFTEN THE CHOICES WE MAKE WITH OUR HEARTS AND EMOTIONS ARE HARD TO LIVE WITH AND HAVE CONSEQUENCES WE MUST SUFFER FOR IN THE FUTURE.
4	1369785600	I particularly liked the way each character shows their humanity through positive and negative thoughts and acts.  The book is quite well-written and a good story.  I'm a writer and fussy.  I would love to write a book this well. It explores a little-known life-style in a generally unknown environment.  The writer's use of metaphor and symbolism makes the whole work shine.  Not the best book for a book club, because everyone admires it so much there is little room for argument. .
5	1369699200	Just loved this book.  So beautifully written.  I felt As though I myself was experiencing the beauty And vastness of Janus.  The ending was gut renching.  I could hardly read it through my tears.  The lessons learned from this  book are many.  Life is wonderful.  Life is cruel and finally, life is just a acceptance of whatever it has been.
4	1369699200	A very good story, but left me feeling sad. I kept hoping for a surprise happy ending, where all are reunited.
4	1369699200	This novel engages the audience with details of the life of a young Australian man who returns home to Australia after fighting in the First World War.  Although I did enjoy the book overall, much of it was too predictable.  It was a nice read that conveyed the need to do the right thing even when the end results would bring heartache.
1	1369699200	I'm not even certain the term 'chick-lit' fully describes how unbearably cheesy & insufferable this supposed 'Best Book Of The Month' was. The shallow plot & stereotypical characters result in a bad soap opera-esque story that is so transparent & irritatingly slushy it was annoying to endure. If I read one more "Izzy Bella, Darl" or am reminded again about Tom's post-war era ghosts in an effort to endear these intolerable characters to me I'm going to kick a puppy. I am at a loss as to how 2,372 reviewers have given this an average of 4 1/2 stars, I'm guessing all of Lifetime Network's viewers banded together to rate this terrible book in between sipping glasses of chardonnay & penning love letters to Ryan Gosling.I'm all for easy summer reads but if you don't want to drown in literary sticky sweetness that is devoid of an interesting story or relatable characters, skip this book.
5	1369699200	We are currently reading this as a book club pick and everyone I've talked to gives it a thumbs up.  It's an easy read and one you can't put down.  Not as predictable as you might assume.  Every main character is having an ethical  dilemma that does not have an easy answer and I found myself sympathizing with each one.  Should lead to an interesting discussion at our meeting!
5	1369699200	The beginning is hard to get through, but builds for a beautiful story that makes you question what is the right answer and what would you do. The ending is touching and brought  a tear to my eye.
5	1369699200	This book was beautifully written with  unforgettable characters. The story unfolds quickly and has several unexpected twists. I highly recommend this novel.
5	1369699200	A child of the flesh or a child of the heart,love makes the two merge. This poignant novel explores love, loss, and betrayal. The light between oceans allows us to find one another and salvation. I highly recommend this insightful novel.
5	1369699200	This was a great relationship/family book.  It was also true to life.  There was no easy solution and no obvious villian. A story of a child who is lost and found and of all the lives that she effects.
4	1369612800	This book was extremely well written!  I enjoyed the unique storyline and sympathize with everyone of the characters.  Great example of how the consequences of one choice can alter the course of your life.
5	1369612800	This is a love story of two families bound together by a child.  Very moving. Enjoyed it from beginning to end!
5	1369612800	Deeply moving and so well written. Really stirs the emotions and touches a mother's heart. I will look for more from this author.
5	1369612800	Sad, Sad ending. Love like this doesn't happen often. Very good writing!! Truly enjoyed it. I wish it would have been longer. Wanted to read it again.
4	1369612800	The Light Between Oceans shines a spotlight on some ethical questions any book group would enjoy discussing.While the language isn't complex or the ideas original - it's a page turner...
5	1369612800	It's so beautifully written! The author has a gift with words. The author also deeply understands human nature and human emotions. The characters are beautifully developed and the reader quickly learns to love them and empathize with them. Lots of wisdom in these pages, especially about forgiveness.
3	1369612800	a good quick read.  but there are so many unbelievable choices made by the characters as the story continues to what I believe is the inevitable conclusion.
5	1369526400	Oh my gosh! I loved this book. It was hard to put down. The stories of the intertwining lives and connection to a
5	1369526400	This book is a moving love story, hauntingly taking residence within you. "The lights" and Janus are characters as true as Tom and Isabel and the life they reveal on its pages is both horrifying and inspiring. I loved every minute of this beautiful story.
5	1369526400	This book was so hard to put down.  The author weaved a story of two families and the love of a child.  Worth reading. It will touch your heart!
4	1369526400	Unusual story line and so made the book a pretty good read. Not a super good read but I did like it and the characters were interesting.
4	1369526400	Well written story.  It's interesting how Tom and Isabel lived on a desolate island as lighthouse keepers in the early part of the 20th century.  And how their life is altered by chance.  Isabel can be maddening in her choices but this is a truly touching story of love.
5	1369526400	I love this book. I thought it had wonderful character development and a plot and story that engaged the reader. I was fully invested in the lives of the characters I was reading about, and cried and laughed along with them.
4	1369440000	This book kept my imagination going. I just wanted more and did not want the book to end. I thought the book was great!
5	1369440000	A compelling storyline. Found myself wondering what I would do in a similar circumstance. Somewhat contrived but a good read.
5	1369440000	Haunting; beautifully written and very thought provoking.  I had to wonder what would I do if I was faced with the decisions the main characters had to make.
4	1369440000	I enjoyed this book.  It was a light read and interesting.  I struggled with the ending of it as I had hoped for a different outcome.
5	1369440000	Good book club selection.  Pretty believable considering the time frame and the secluded place where the story takes place in australia
5	1369440000	I loved it from the first chapter to the last page.  It was heart breaking and a beautiful story.  The choice that 1 family made that caused the heartbreak of another mother.  Very well written.
5	1369440000	There were phrases in this novel that took my breath away and left me ruminating about relationships and our own sense of self long after the last page.
5	1369440000	This was a wonderful read.  It should be a book club requirement as there is so much to discuss and second guess about the story and what drives the characters.  This book is worth the money and effort to read it.
5	1369440000	I enjoyed every single word. The characters were believable and the plot was rivoting.  I couldn't put this book down.
5	1369440000	Most  heart rending book since Little Women in my opinion.  Steadman's  colorful descriptive language creates a strong sense of place, Australia; and conflicting emotions: right and wrong and the consequences of misplaced love..
4	1369440000	An interesting story leaving the reader to ask, &#34;which is best for this child?&#34;  Another situation posing a question for the reader was the way the husband handled the eventual return f the child. I like a book that asks me to make a choice; to examine my own conscience.
4	1369440000	Great summer reading material.  Interesting plot line, quick moving, easy read.  Well written novel with good character development and a story that is not run of the mill . . . love the information given about how lighthouses work.
5	1369440000	An incredibly HEART wrenching story.  I knew where the story was headed. I cried for everyone, but it was Tom that l really connected,too.  What an extraordinary first novel!
5	1369440000	This book was wonderful.  I am wiping away the tears as I write.  The story touched my heart from beginning to end.  If you enjoy romance, family, mystery and love, them I recommend this book highly.
5	1369353600	The first half of the book was a bit slow, but the second half made up for it.  I was surprised with how it all turned out in the end, but really enjoyed the read.
4	1369267200	Everyone was reading it on the beach, by the pool, so I decided to read it as well.  I would recommend this book for a book group selection.
5	1369267200	The book was very interesting, it took turns I did not expect.  It was a great mix of happiness and sadness.
3	1369267200	This is just an average book in my opinion.  A little mystery but not very engaging characters or depth of story.
5	1369180800	The Light Between Oceans was a sad but sweet book that had you turning pages as quickly as you could. I really enjoyed it.
5	1369180800	Loved this book. My book club agreed that this was one of the best selections we have read. The author's style of writing keeps the reader engaged. A great book for discussion.
3	1369180800	I expected far too much, given all the positive reviews. it seemed to me that events sometimes jumped and leaped; I was often disconcerted, a little disoriented. Although I enjoyed the book, I was underwhelmed by Isabel and her issues. Actually, I didn't like her very much at all.  Ever. The best parts for me were the lighthouse years--I knew nothing about lighthouses and a dedicated keeper of the light!  Now that was worth reading.
4	1369180800	I like it because it was about the ocean and what goes on at the lighthouse it was wild how it went down on the lighthouse
5	1369180800	I could not put this book down.  I was hooked from the first page.  Her prose is beautiful and the story makes you think&#34; what would I do?&#34;I hope she writes a second book SOON!
5	1369180800	My book club read this book and all members liked the book.  We had the best book discussion in a long time.  Much of the talk centered around what is the meaning of being a honest and just person, and doing the right thing.  Would recommend this book highly.
5	1369180800	Quick good read that still makes you wonder about the decisions made.  I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend.
4	1369180800	a unique love story, many turns that I did not expect. Enjoyed the details and Australian geography. good character development
5	1369180800	I had been told this book was really good.  It started a little slow but I knew it would get better and it did!! I couldn't put this book down.  I thought about this book for several days after reading it.  That makes a good book in my opinion.
5	1369008000	A great book. Perfect for a book club. You could relate to every character which is rare. Really really good.
5	1369008000	I enjoyed this book.  It was slow moving the first 50 pages and then the events starting happening one after the other and I could not put the book down.  I discussed it with my husband and retold the story.  He was amazed.  I wish that Lucy would have been able to spend more time with her step mother but at least she spent some quality time with her DaDa and her son.
5	1369008000	Sad story with many characters that I liked. Moral issues that seemed to have no way out and the reader was pulled many ways.
5	1369008000	What a lovely and thought-provoking tale. The  characters could have had more depth so that we knew more about them.
5	1369008000	Loved it and bought it for my daughter for Mother's Day. So much insight into family values and the importance of keeping that foremost .
4	1369008000	I love a good story and this is a good one; heartbreaking but still good.  I would have preferred a happier ending, but I guess I'm a hopeless optimist.
5	1368921600	I am not done yet with this story, but look forward to my time to read it each night.  Was picked by my book club.
5	1368921600	The Light Between Oceans was a very intriguing book.  Great for Book club discussion. A story of love, struggle and resolution, twists and turns.
5	1368921600	Beautifully written.  I loved this book and wondered at the incredible decisions made that created such heartache and misery for everyone.
4	1368921600	Cook book ingredients but put together very nicely. Home from the wars issues treated as if they are just like those current vets' experiences - a rather big &#34;if.&#34;
4	1368921600	Thought the ending was a let down and didn't resolve much.  Would like to have seen more details of characters.
2	1368835200	A very fast read....I could not wait for it to end!  The author seems to lose interest in the story and has trouble finding a reasonable, or even clever, way to get out.
4	1368835200	interesting premise, learned a lot about jobs that are isolated from people and their personalities. how they interact when others join them in their isolation
5	1368835200	The beginning was a little slow but well worth the wait.  The writing was superb.  Made for a great discussion at our book group.  What a dilemma all the characters had to face.  Really makes you stop and think.
5	1368835200	It described human nature which always includes good and honest traits but also selfish and dishonest actions. The story  was an easy read and held my attention.  It described the climate and geography of Australia.  The primary thread of the story concerned the love of a mother for her child, natural born or not, which is one of the strongest bonds in nature. It also describes the sacrifice that one will make for the happiness of a loved one.
5	1368835200	Great storyline in the perfect setting without the need for any gimmicks. Good character development with careful attention to grammar and editing. As the story unfolds, a chance event at the most emotionally vulnerable period in the lives of the main characters leads to a plethora of opportunities for making decision fueled by the best of intentions and a desire to believe in the healing hand of divine intervention has arrived. These decisions deliver the reader to the abyss where the edges of crime and due justice get smudged and grey.
5	1368835200	At first I thought that the book drag a little, but after I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  This is one of those books that stays with you long after you read it.
4	1368835200	The protagonist is correct: Lighthouse watchmen have a lonely job. Add a young wife and a marooned baby, and what happens? Well-written in clear prose, I found the characters in the novel intriguing but the ending predictable, and loneliness pervaded all.
3	1368748800	For the price, you really can't go wrong here however, the button to turn the beam on and off is very finicky and tough to keep on while playing with the kitties.
5	1368748800	The book kept my interest all the way.  I looked forward to reading it, a very different story, well written.
5	1368748800	Only a woman could write something like this. Her prose is magnificent. Her treatment of love, desire, and sex, is delicate and inspirational.  A Classic. One of the  best books I have read in a long, long time. JAS
5	1368748800	the Light is a complicated and lovely story about life alone on an island and the importance of life and family. So difficult today to find such wonderful, descriptive writing without a single cuss word in the entire book. This book tackles an incredible moral question and ties it into a magnificent setting and time. Excellent read.
4	1368662400	This is a sweeping story covering lots of ground both geographically and in years. It takes place in the land of light houses, with lots of details regarding their use and how they work, maybe a little too much. But the real meat of the story is the personal one, including relationships within families, man and woman, ethnic conflicts and attitudes, mother and daughter, and birth mother vs adopted mother. Any one of these relationships would make an active discussion. I found my loyalties shifting several times throughout the story. A very satisfying ending. Worth the read.
4	1368662400	This novel , a story of a light keeper and his wife and the baby delivered by the ocean, does a fine job of describing the complexity of  decisions and their aftermath.  The characters are beautifully delineated  and the outcome as satisfying as could be.
4	1368662400	Amazingly realistic too :) Perfect for the use that I had in mind. And it was hard to find large denominations. Happy!
5	1368662400	The beginning drug a little---then you are off and running to see what happens. Imagine living in a light house trying to raise a baby!
2	1368662400	A great story compelling to the end.  I am still not sure who was the right mother for Lucy. But in the end I always feel a child belongs with its rightful mother. So be it.  Well written. I especially enjoyed some of the Australian lingo.  Would recommend this book highly.
4	1368662400	I enjoyed the writer's ability to describe deep emotions, from loneliness to joy.  Made me reflect on loss, forgiveness and living and loving in difficult situations.  One of my criteria for a good book is that I think of the characters and story after I put the book down, this book definitely provided things to chew on.
4	1368662400	It is a wonderful story that could be a true story. I got so involved in Izzy and Tom's lives it felt like I was losing a child. And then a very close friend when Izzy passed.
4	1368662400	This book gave excellent insights into people dealing with deeply emotional issues. War trauma and prejudices were also explored. Good read.
4	1368662400	We read this book for a book club and it generated lots of good discussion.  I liked that there was no villain.  Just regular people I could relate to.
4	1368662400	It was hard to put the book down once I got a couple of chapters into it.  The characters were very real human.  The deli a
5	1368662400	This book was exceptionally well written. A human interest story that kept me revetted to the book. I really enjoyed reading it and I highly recommend this book.
5	1368576000	It was the most well writen book I have read in my life!  It was well writen and wonderfully layed out.
5	1368576000	This book deserved five stars because I didn't want to put it down. Through strong characters and an excellent plot, Stedman reminds us how our decisions often impact others. I was also reminded of the importance of forgiveness,  not only of others but also of yourself. Great book! I would recommend this book to my book club.
4	1368489600	I enjoyed this books with its insights to losses that mothers may experience. A good study in seeing &#34;both sides of the story&#34;, when deciding right and wrong. A little dark with a not so predictable ending.
4	1368489600	I loved the idea of the setting of solitude this book seemed to promise- was not disappointed.  And I loved being presented with the tough choice the couple had to make- nice ending- although it may have felt a little abrupt- gave proper and not cliche closure.  I absolutely recommend this.
5	1368489600	The book was extremely well written.  The ending was terrific with a real twist.  I totally enjoyed reading it and couldn't believe how fast a read it was
3	1368489600	I like the story-line and I think the writer is good, I just felt the book was too slow for my taste.
5	1368489600	I just fell into the story and felt like I was in the story. Love, life events, death and redemption,all the things that make a book great!
4	1368403200	immediately got into the book and kept going back to it to read more. From the beginning it reminded me of Anna Quindlan's Blessings which is why I did not give it 5 stars. Although it is a different story the premise is the same.  If you haven't read Blessings you might give this 5 stars.
4	1368403200	Enjoyable book with an interesting setting off the southwestern coast of Australia.  Characters a little hard to believe at times.  Izzy almost too rigid in her relationship with her husband.  Moving but frustrating story line. (I wanted it to end differently) I loved the setting of the island and the lighthouse.  Our book club enjoyed discussing this book.
4	1368403200	Although beautifully written and a well developed story with a relateable cast of characters, this book is just sad overall.
5	1368403200	It is difficult to choose sides in this book.  All were so loving and protective of each other.  My heart went out to both mothers .
5	1368403200	I thoroughly loved this book. I think the author did a brilliant job of weaving a compelling and beautiful ( and at times very disturbing) story.  My book club met tonight for discussion, and 8 out of 9 of us really enjoyed it.
4	1368403200	I thought the book showed excellent insight into the feelings & actions of a wide range of personalities especially where children are involved.
3	1368403200	An interesting read even though the characters were not lovable to me.  However, the book made for a great discussion at book club..l.one that made us all ponder some heavy questions about love and doing the right thing.
4	1368403200	Love is strange, people respond to it in many different ways.  Who was right? or was there a right or a wrong.  You make your choice and enjoy this heart felt story.
5	1368316800	I have already recommended this book to my book club.  I like the way it is written:  smooth between transitions of current and past thoughts.  The plot is quite different from most books I have read and the story moved many emotional feelings.  I loved the consciencousness of Tom, the maternal need of Isabel, and the unwavering love Tom bore her.  If only there were more men with those moral beliefs.
4	1368316800	Good book  Interesting about  human emotions and why weDo some of the things we do. And about forgiveness, it is easy to forgive ,just do it.....
4	1368316800	It was a predictable ending, but well thought out and interesting characters. Sometimes, I wonder how can things not be said or why would you not defend yourself. Sacrifices are a nice thing to do, but at who whose expense? I would recommend this to anyone.
5	1368316800	This book is built on a very simple question; "What Would You Do?" and then proceeds to delve into the consequences of the action taken.Tom and Isabel live a simple and secluded life on Janus Rock, the lighthouse island between the Southern and Indian Oceans. Tom seeks the seclusion of the life of a light keeper as a way to help him deal with the horrors he has seen on the battlefields of The Great War. He lives there for several years, alone until he meets Isabel on shore leave and soon they are married and living alone on the island. They have a happy life, until Isabel suffers several miscarriages and the still born birth of a son. When a boat runs ashore on the island, with a dead man on board and a screaming baby found still alive a decision is made that will have consequences for many more people than just Tom and Izzy.This book is beautifully written, from the descriptions of the island and life in such seclusion, to the despair of a mother losing her children, to the unbreakable bond between mother and child. It also addresses the lengths some will go for those they love, despite their better judgment.I could not put this book down; it was one of the most heartbreaking books I have read in a very long time. Even when I began to see where the book was heading I couldn't help but wish for a better outcome. What seems a simple choice can destroy more than one family, as well as other loved ones, including the one person you never meant to hurt at all.At the end of the book I thought many times about the "what if's" and how things could have ended so differently. And the very end of the book had me in tears. This is Ms. Steadman's debut and all I can say is wow and I hope she has another book as compelling as this one in the works.
5	1368230400	A,  'What would you do?' kind of book. I loved it!  Learned some new Austrailian words.  Fast read.  I highly recommend it!
4	1368230400	And this story is appropriately tied to the ocean. The author is able to make you feel the intense emotions of the characters though her apt descriptions of key situations. The main characters are all flawed, perhaps making them all the more accessible and real. A real tear-jerker that keeps the pages turning...
5	1368230400	I loved this book!  The writing is amazing.  I could see it...feel it!! I won't forget this book.  Highly recommended.
4	1368230400	I would have given it a 5 star but felt the language was too flowery repetitive.Nice story.  Good character development.
5	1368230400	what is the right solution for the people involved with the orphan is a wrenching story.  All aspects are explored for those who love the baby.
5	1368230400	I just finished this novel and cried like I haven't in years.  There are parts I laughter out loud, parts I got very angry, and parts that made me feel good.  I feel like I'm a better person thanks to this wonderful book.
4	1368144000	Like most books it took a chapter or two to get in to it but then I couldn't put it down. It really made you think about what you would do in their situation.
5	1368144000	I Loved this book! Perhaps because it is set in a fictional, but romantic island in Australia. The author gave to a character's traits in few and very descriptive and meaningful terms - I like that! Author Stedman finely tuned into character traits those malicious strengths urging the strongest flaws to rule. I read it in one day. Thank you for a refreshing change!Dr.C
3	1368144000	it was an okay readit was very readableIt just was not great.Not particularly memorable.Not something I'd tell friends to spend time with it
5	1368144000	Kim Davidson would like it. Could be classified as :depressing' BUT IS definitely not--u just have to keep on reading.
4	1368144000	It's a wonderful story about hope and love and mistakes and forgivness. It's an easy read with strong characters and an unusual situation full of pull and push.
5	1368144000	Absolutely excellent.  It is almost an epic poem with beautiful phrases depicting emotions through natural events... like paintings created through words.  It was so beautiful and so sad all at once.  Can't wait for her next book.
5	1368144000	This book was recommended to me by a woman that lives in Perth and I met her in Croatia.  I recommended the reading to my book club when I got back and we all enjoyed it very much.  A very difficult decision to be made by all the different characters in the novel
4	1368144000	This was an interesting story.  I didn't give it five stars because I save that for a book I will remember forever.  This book did hold my interest and explored an interesting &#34;What IF.&#34;  What if we just kept a baby we found because it seemed right that we should have it.  What if no one would ever know that it was not ours.  It was an intriguing look at a different time and a different place.  A place that I would only want to explore vicariously.
4	1368144000	I enjoyed this book but it is a book about life as it is not what we would like it to be.  If someone is reading this book hoping for a wonderful ending then don't read it.  It does end well but not was you would like it to.  It is a great book for a book club since there is a lot of discussion that will go on.
5	1368144000	Been taking  Posture-D for many years and have no side effects as some calcium pills do.  itake it wit or without food withno prblems
5	1368144000	I loved this book because I spent some of my childhood days on the Maine coast.  My mother,s family were sea faring and light keeping men, so I was raised on  tales that  we're  passed down for generations
5	1368144000	A friend of mine recommended this and I was slow in getting to it. However, once started, I was so very glad I had. The characters are well written. the moral dilemma faced gave cause for me to reflect on my own values and beliefs.Thank you M. l. Stedman!
5	1368144000	Even though it took a bit of time to get into it, could not put it down as the plot thickened.  A dilemma that no woman should ever have to face.
3	1368144000	The editing was a big problem, many words, sentences and even whole pages were missing.  Also there would be repeating of sentences and the font would change from page to page.  Very difficult to follow the story because of this.
5	1368144000	This was a great book.  I was sucked in immediately.  I enjoyed the author's writing style.  Without listing any &#34;spoilers&#34;, I was surprised at the end of the book, but happy at the way it ended.
4	1368144000	Beautifully written with complex  story line. The end made me so melancholy I couldn't get it out of my head. As a mother, I couldn't imagine going through what the characters endured. My heart broke the way it all ended!
4	1368144000	I really enjoyed this book. The characters were well defined and realistic. While I wanted things to work out differently there was really no other way for things to have worked out. It is well worth the read.
5	1368144000	I was surprised to find that this was the author's first novel.  Its beautifully written and she has the ability to make you see the landscape and back drop.  Its a story about a moral dilemma; the effects of decisions made.  Great book.
5	1368144000	A beautiful story  I was surprised by the ending,  i fell in love withthe characters and could only imagine their pain.
4	1368057600	an interesting story again proving that ethics do count; but had the right thing been done as soon as possible there would have been no story
1	1368057600	I have the Kindle edition of this book. I doubt anyone over the age of 20 liked this book. It's juvenile, poorly written, and boring. The description is unimaginative, circumstances unrealistic,and the characters immature and unbelievable. It's devoid of emotion and told in flat narrative. I especially hated the way it slipped into present tense more frequently than not. And point of view is often indeterminate. You will like this book if you rarely read and know nothing about good writing. I'm going to finish reading it because it was selected as the book for a new book discussion group I found on local Meetup websites.
5	1367971200	This was just a wonderful and thought provoking story.  There were so many emotions that surfaced as the story unfolded. as I read, I thought on numerous occasions that there are so many sides to this story and that no one answer was necessarily the right one.So glad my friend Kay recommended this book.  It was exhausting to read from an emotional point of view, but also heartfelt.  I look forward to more books from this author.
3	1367884800	The story outlined the life of a lighthouse operator after WW I .  Tom, the light caretaker lives 100 miles off the coast of Australia, visiting the mainland only after three years of isolation.  Tom marries and after several miscarriages they are destined to be an isolated ,childless couple.  Then a young baby comes to their island in a boat with a dead man.
5	1367884800	I like the character development of the 2 main characters and especially the protagonist.  The subject matter really had me thinking what I would do, if I were in that situation. I looked forward to being alone to read!!!
5	1367884800	A wonderful story about true love, family and a life coming full circle.  The characters are likeable, and easy to relate to.  A great read.
4	1367884800	Spending time in this book is a journey of emotion.  The tale of love, loss and forgiveness is painfully beautiful. Lighthouses have always fascinated me and it was nice living in one through the eyes and hearts of these characters. I very much enjoyed the book.
4	1367884800	I very much enjoyed this book.  It was a change and it was very realistic.  I began to feel that I was experiencing the anguish they felt.
5	1367884800	Leave it to apple to make their latest phone so it doesn't work with any of the charging cords you already own! That was a drag!! But this little adapter helps.
5	1367884800	I won't bore you with a description since you can read that here, but one mark of a great book for me is if I can't figure out where the plot will go, and I never knew how this one would play out. This story will stay with me for a while - I highly recommend this book. I would definitely read more from this author.
4	1367798400	This book really explores some moral dilemmas and the inner struggles with which people deal.  The characters are well developed and I found myself empathising with all of them.  Very human.
5	1367798400	Heart wrenching story of what good intention can go areighSo well written it keeps you engaged from the start . U
3	1367798400	I didn't love or hate this book.  It's really about good people making bad choices and lacking conviction to do the right thing.  The story is compelling but it unfolds slowly and I wondered why we were on tangents that didn't seem to matter.  As the consequences of these bad choices finally comes to a head, the book finally drew me in but then again expired at a slow wrenching pace.  I'm not saying don't read it, there is some good work in here, but it's not at the top of my list.
5	1367798400	An extraordinary and heart rending story that I couldn't  put down. The characters faced unbelievably difficult situations that made for a compelling story.I would certainly reccomend this book and feel it would please a wide audience. My book club will be reading it this summer.
1	1367712000	I don't like to have to answer something when I don't know, so stop already and let me out of this page
5	1367712000	I loved this book.Not only for the moving story and beautifully realized characters, but for the history and revelations into Western Australia post-WWI life.
5	1367712000	Unique and powerful story in location that is remote and  fascinating with characters that are well created as story unfolds.
5	1367712000	well written - interesting story with a lot to think about. Questions of family, relationships, responsibility - to whom and for what; worth re-reading!
4	1367712000	I enjoyed reading this but it was a little slow and heavily descriptive. Not as memorable as other books I have read.
5	1367712000	It's a beautifully written exploration of people making difficult choices. The characters are flawed but I found myself sympathizing with them.
3	1367712000	It was hard for me to really get into this book. Our book club trad it and some loved and others thought it was ok.
3	1367712000	I really enjoyed this book but was not crazy about the way the book ended.  I would have liked to see a happy ending.
5	1367712000	I loved everything about this book.  It was definitely a page turner and kept me glued to my seat reading.  I felt compassion for all of the characters.  It is one of those books that stays with you long after you've finished reading it.
4	1367712000	I have not finished this book, however, I am certainly enjoying it and I know that it will have a sad ending. I do recommend it.
5	1367625600	I thought this book was quite compelling and certainly filled with emotion.It kept my interest to the very end.
4	1367625600	The Light Between Oceans is a story that binds together the love and heartbreak of families. It travels through happiness, decision and heartbreak. It talks of the effects of war on the soldiers, the love that connects two people and trust and distrust. What does life allow us...... The decisions we make can determine our entire life. The story is easy to read, well written and carries you from beginning to end like a train making stops but speeding along wanting to get to the end of the line.
5	1367625600	Many times throughout this book I asked the question &#34;if I were in this position what would I do?&#34; Truth or lie, keep or give back, stay or return, run away or persevere?The characters of Tom and Isabel are well defined and true to themselves throughout the book. They are predictable in a familiar way. They do what you hope they will do, but there are still surprises along the way.Hold on to your heart though,you are in for a ride on a rough sea.
4	1367625600	Intriguing, sad and an enjoyable read..Won't be a book that I will rave to my friends about but should it come up I will simply say that I &#34;Liked It&#34;- which I did and do not regret buying and reading it.Simply put.
5	1367625600	The Light Between Oceans....is a must to read.  I could not but it down once I started it....five stars The characters where so real and I felt I
5	1367625600	This book was recommended to me and I downloaded through Amazon.  Last year I purchased my Kindle and very happy with how easy it is to purchase and share books.  Not only can I download books, but movies, emails, web and more.  Also bought a anti-glare screen so I can use my kindle anywhere.
5	1367625600	Beautifully written, a completely enthralling and unique story. I could not put it down - it kept me entertained on a 10 hour flight from LHR to SFO
4	1367625600	I enjoyed reading this novel.  It was well written and kept me on the edge of my chair wondering when everyone would know of the baby that came to shore.
4	1367625600	This was a quick read and very interesting subject matter...lighthouse living in Australia. I thought the author did a good job developing the characters and the plot was very realistic.  I recommend the book.Joan
5	1367539200	The Light Between Oceans is a powerful tale of love, loss and something akin to redemption. Stedman pulls the reader into the story immediately, weaving together a plot complex enough to baffle the mind, yet simple enough to tug hard at the heartstrings of anyone who has ever loved a child. Readers get a peek into the solitary life of a lighthouse keeper on the bare Australian shores and glimpse the loneliness and longing that could lead a man--or a woman--to desperate deeds. I finished this book during silent reading time with my 7th grade language arts students. They were very concerned to see tears running down my cheeks as I closed the book. That experience gave me a great opportunity to explain how books can, indeed, take us away from daily life and can impact us in ways we can never imagine!
5	1367539200	A tender, touching story with many facets.  What does it do to a person to love so deeply and to lose those who were loved so completely. Parent for child. A child for a parent. How does one go on?  The author adroitly weaves a compelling narrative that illustrates the highs and lows of emotions as the very realistic characters deal with intense moral issues.  You will not want to put this book down once you begin reading it.
4	1367539200	This was such a tragic book. The situations the characters were put in were very difficult. That being said, I really don't know who's side I was on. I felt sympathy for every character in the book. It made me very emotional. I thought this novel was good, and the story line was like nothing I had ever read before. The only complaint I have about it was towards the end I was skimming because it seemed to drag on in parts. But overall, I would recommend it to anyone who likes emotional historical reads.
4	1367539200	Enjoyed reading about this place at this time in history.  Was different but kept you wanting to keep reading to find out what happened in the end.
4	1367539200	This book made me so angry and frustrated as I read it.  The choices of the main characters leave you scratching your head WHY?  Yet you can't put the book down because you must know the resolution of the story.  It is truly interesting and yet frustrating at the same time.
5	1367539200	This book is very well written. It has a good plot which holds the reader's interest until the very end. The ending was very touching and I think that it is a good read.
5	1367452800	This is a wonderful book---well written and an interesting story.  The story is vividly written so that you feel that you are in that space and time.  You also feel the emotions of all the characters.  I was sorry to have it end.
5	1367452800	This story of good people who make bad decisions for understandable reasons is well constructed and beautifully written with nuanced, empathetic characters.  I thought this first novel was a gem.
4	1367452800	This was a choice for my book club.  Great and fairly quick read!  The story kept me interested all the way through.
4	1367452800	The story captured interest from the start.  The bittersweet ending was not what I expected.  I enjoyed this book, which was a &#34;book club&#34; seledction for our club.
3	1367452800	When I first started this book, I didn't think I would enjoy it, because I was learning more about lighthouses than I ever wanted to know, but once the story began to take shape and the characters developed I enjoyed the book. It reminded me of a Jodi Picoult novel where people have a strong since of right & wrong as black & white ideology, but that's really only true as an abstract concept; when moral challenges are tied to people, the grey area creeps in. Even when you strongly feel something's wrong, you understand the wrong in a different way if you &#34;know&#34; the person/character. This book is about how choices right & wrong shaped lives and how those choices follow them forever . . . it tugs at your heart strings.
4	1367452800	Loved the story, setting, and I was quickly captivated by the book! I recommend it, a great book for a vacation read
4	1367452800	I really enjoyed reading this book.  I find it hard to believe this is the authors first novel.  It was interesting, exciting and held me captive to the end.While reading , my mind raced ahead with ideas of what will happen next, but the author surprised me right up to the end.  I look forward to another novel by Stedman.
4	1367452800	Beautifully written. Historic elements entwined with a tragic love story. My heart ached for those involved. I still have to believe it was the child's destiny to be with Isabel.
5	1367452800	The characters in this book were very likable.  The story was about a woman he wanted a baby and would so anything to get a child. She lived with her husband on an island with a lighthouse on it. He would do anything to make his wife happy. From that point things started going wrong. I read this for a couples book club and the discussion surprised all of the women. The majority of the men said they'd do what the husband in the book did. The women didn't think the husband should have gone along with his wife. This is a fascinating book club read and subsequent discussion.
5	1367366400	The book held my interest.  The characters were deep and well developed and the theme was new yet universal.  It resonated with adoptive parents who were in our book group.
4	1367366400	A story pulled from the past, set post WWII, this book is great for a variety of ages.  The strong characters, conflicting agendas and intriguing plot keep you turning the pages well into the night. A great read!
5	1367366400	I chose this book randomly from the list of available titles and then could not put it down. It seems like a book that only woemen would enjoy, but it is certainly meaningful for men as well. I have recommended it to many of my friends.
4	1367366400	This is a really good book......but it falls a little bit flat because of the darkness of it. I was really hoping for a much happier ending....although I will say that the end was very well written
4	1367366400	Loved the complex levels of the character development. When the lines between right and wrong are so blurred it makes you have to really consider each perspective. The author did a great job pulling the reader into the moral dilemma. My book club LOVED this book. Great for discussion.
5	1367366400	Truly a page turner, with loads of wisdom. Aussie tale is novelist's first; and does not disappoint, as a nicely constructed tale.
5	1367366400	It was a little slow in the beginning but finally picked up.  The subject is very emotional.  Loved the ending.
4	1367280000	An interesting read about a different time and a different place - Australia. The story starts out slow but gets more interesting and by the last few chapters I couldn't put it down. This is an excellent story for recommending to a book group for discussion as in: what would you do?
5	1367280000	I absolutely adored this book. The characters and the plot were spellbinding.  My heart ached for Tom and Izzy.  I look forward to reading more by this author.
3	1367193600	Not my type of book a little dark, this was a mystery, but I preferr murder mystery novels however others I know liked the book
4	1367193600	I could feel for both sides and waned to keep reading to find out how it ended.  Very good story
5	1367193600	This book held my interest from the first page.I could not put it down. A must read for all ages.
5	1367193600	I could not put it down.  The plot was excellent and the book was well written.  I highly recommend it
5	1367107200	Beautiful writing and eloquently described settings and characters! It was a pleasure to read! I will be recommending this book to my book club.
4	1367107200	This book actually made me cry. Author was able to articulate the vantage point of the main characters-you had empahty for all involved. Probably the only additional plus would be a deeper character development of main character during the war.
4	1367107200	I really enjoyed this book;  it was written well and held my attention throughout.  I found the ending very satisfactory as it 'made things right'....  I'd recommend this book to anyone.  In fact i chose it for my book club read!
5	1367107200	I could hardly wait to get back to this book each night. Loved the unexpected twists and excellent descriptions of the settings.
5	1367107200	This was a really good book.  Very sad at times but it really gives you something to think about.  I really loved the characters and all of their flaws.  Our bookclub read it and we all agreed it was a good read but some felt they would have done things very differently.
5	1367107200	Stedman has truly set a beam on how good people, trying to do good can swim or sink. Or is everyone truly trying to do the right thing? These questions are the result of a dramatic story involving such real people that you want to kiss them, to clock them and to make it all work for each and every one. But sometimes in life that is just not possible.Light Between the Oceans is beautifully written, I was barely able to put it down and when I did come to the end, I was truly shaken. It is a great emotional ride. For a bonus, as a lighthouse lover, I enjoyed the experience of living on the island, tending the light and weathering the environment. I cannot wait for the movie. If it does justice to this excellent book it will be wonderful.
4	1367107200	Although this book gets off to a slow start it is a very good book and I really enjoyed reading it. Our book club had a excellent discussion on how we would have dealt with the plot.
5	1367107200	Beautifully written with great imagery.  Learned to really love the characters and worried about what would become of them all.
5	1367107200	I liked this book very much because the characters of the different people seemed so very human in nature. I have visited lighthouses in different country's and always wondered about who would live in such isolation in remote regionsThis book gave me the inside of such life. I found The story believable, It was for a page turner for me to the very end. I would recommend it. Great book for a first novel, and well researched.
4	1367107200	Good book with good characters. Do read. It is a good book. Good ending. Lots of warmth , love and despair.
5	1367107200	Well written, sensitive. Hard to put down. I cried again when telling the story to my husband!  I recommend to all especially Mothers.
5	1367107200	This book was recommended by a friend.  She was absolutely right.  Loved the entire story.  I cried at at ending.  How sad for a woman to lose a child and then to never know that child, as an adult, returned to her roots.
4	1367020800	This is a wonderfully crafted novel.  The writing is lovely, and the story so compelling. The greatest strength of the author is character development.  All were complex and real.  This is a great read!
5	1367020800	Couldn't put this book down. If you read and enjoyed Memory Keeper's Daughter, you will love this book.Great story to the end.
5	1367020800	Loved the story. Couldn't put it down one the story for going. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good read.
5	1367020800	This book made me cry, but is a great story about love and loss, and the long reaching effects of our actions.  Great read, but keep the tissue box handy.  I loved the setting of the lighthouse, and the depth of the characters.
4	1367020800	Great book, a little slow to start but hard to put down later. Well written. Have a box of tissues close at hand.
5	1367020800	A great read for anyone who- wants insight into the hidden effects war can leave on the soul- loves the ocean- has ever lost a child- likes a surprise ending (I was sure I had it nailed!)- enjoys a story so enthralling that it can bring you to tears
5	1367020800	Very well written. It kept my interest all thru to the last page. The author should write about Lucy's new life with her real mum
1	1367020800	This book had too much history for the first 100 or so pages, and it was a bore!  The author was very&#34;wordy&#34; in her writing, long sentences and lots of &#34;Aussie&#34; phrases that I had to guess at what the meaning was.  The story line was good, but it was too long and too descriptive in her writing.  I liked the story, but not the writing.  Would not recommend the book.
4	1367020800	This was a very well written bookWith beautiful detailed descriptions.The story keeps your attention and you really fall in love with the charectors.
5	1367020800	Well written, compelling and a pleasure to read.  I look forward to reading more of Stedman's novels in the future.
5	1367020800	Loved this book; excellent writing; kept my interest throughout the bookI could not put it down.Highly recommend - our book club all enjoyed it and it provided some great discussions.
4	1366848000	Good story with lots of food for thought. Tells a tale of a couple torn between the right path to take and their emotions.
5	1366848000	This is a great story for a book club? What would you so in this situation?I found myself conflicted and will enjoy our book club's  interpretation of the events!Read it
4	1366848000	I found it to be an interesting story.  It was something I never knew about lighthouses.It was an easy read.
4	1366848000	I was a little disapointed with the ending.  Loved it up until then. I would recomend this book to everyone
4	1366848000	As a parent of an adopted child I sympathized more with the &#34;adoptive&#34; mother.  I NEVER have believed bio parents have greater rights.  However, in this case the bio mother had no control over losing the child.  Just tragic for the little girl.
5	1366761600	This book is a fantastic read for a book club. The character's moral dilemma is thought provoking and provides a conversation starter.
5	1366761600	I couldn't put it down. It is so well written and a great story. So romantic but not overly mushy. No naughty bits.
5	1366761600	The yin and yang was fascinating. I found myself talking to the book, scolding and alarmed at the action taking place. It was a super plot, the characters well drawn and sympathetic and continuously surprising. ML Stedman is now a new favorite.
5	1366761600	What a wonderful love story.  I wasn't sure I would like a book about a lightkeeper but this was more than wonderful.
5	1366761600	I love Australia and this story.  There were so many instances when they could have made a moral and good decesion and yet they didn't. I liked the way it ended too.
5	1366761600	My book group read this book & we all loved it.  Really good read.  Easy to follow the characters.  Many moral dilemmas dealt with or lead you to think about.
4	1366761600	It starts off slow, but gets better as you read on. Good twist in the middle. I enjoyed reading it.
5	1366761600	I love it when I read a novel that I regret the end has come.  I was torn between the biological mother and the foster parents who so loved baby they believed was sent to them by God during their own tragic loss of their baby.  How the lives of the characters intertwined and effected one another is so profound tears came to my eyes more than once.  A must read.
5	1366761600	I loved the story, very human, very real. Makes you consider and reconsider life with all it offers. In the end, the decision made determines the rest of your life. I truly recommend this book.
5	1366761600	This is a book that appeals to the romantic, those with children and, those that like moral issues. Where  would you stand and what would one do in their shoes. Drippetoe
5	1366675200	This is not usually my "cup of tea" but I was drawn by the title, cover art and a desire to see Australia some day.  A lovely novel about how we sometimes make the worst decisions with the best intentions, especially out of love. The story is told in a series of vignettes or short set pieces that are gradually woven into a rich tapestry of love, loss and heartbreaking tragedy. I don't think I have ever read a novel where I felt so connected to the characters, even the minor ones. This is a fine novel by freshman author ML Stedman. Can't wait for her next one.  And if they ever make it into a movie I can easily picture Aussie Sam Worthington playing the role of Tom.
4	1366675200	Recommended by my book club and going to look for other books by this author. I know i like a book when i don't want to finish it.
5	1366675200	I really loved reading this book. It brought to life the hardships of those who served their tour of duty in the war and those left behind during WWI. Their suffering over the lose of their sons, cousins, and nephews either through death or mental and physical disabilities was quite apparent.  I do believe the author does a good job of portraying the heartbreak of losing not one baby, but three.  One doesn't realize the full consequences of ones actions when they go against their conscience in making a decisions.  Tom was torn between doing his duty as an honest man and helping his wife who was suffering over the lose of yet another baby. Yet, end the end he could not live with his decision and thus so many ended up being hurt. So many hurting especially Lucy (Grace) who has little or no understanding of why she is in the situation she finds herself in. The author also portrays the narrow mindedness of the people within the community which lead to the problem in the first place.
5	1366675200	I loved this book. It was hard to put it down. I would recommend this book to every Mother and daughter out there. Such an emotional roller coaster.
5	1366588800	Very good read. Makes for some serious soul searching. Once you reach a certain point in the book, you can't put it down.
4	1366588800	I found this book very sad but it was a good read.  I particularly empathized with Tom, who was trying to do the right thing from the beginning.  A heartwrenching situation.
3	1366588800	Stedman's novel has an interesting premise with a thought-provoking dilemma.  As the plot unfolds the characters are given classic choices and left with heart-wrenching consequences. The reader doesn't know until the very last page how it will be resolved and then the question about making ethical decisions lingers. Which is to say, this is the book's strength.What lingered too long were the lengthy descriptions of the heroine.'s beauty and the child's charm (pages and pages of both).  Well-developed character and plot are to be admired; overkill is not.Would I recommend this book? Yes, it was a nice escape, an engrossing tale in a unique setting. Is it a memorable literary work? Sadly, no.
5	1366588800	In my small dining room, I need extra seating for guests, but don't want to have the room feel crowded at other times. These folding chairs are just the thing. They are well made, fairly easy to open and close, and have the feel of &#34;real furniture&#34; so you don't feel as if you're in a church basement. I have had them only a few months so can't say how they hold up over time, but I am pleased with this purchase.
5	1366588800	A slow start , but picks up quickly! It also has a pretty unpredictable ending that I'm sure you will enjoy!
5	1366588800	I truly enjoyed this book. Seemed very pausible and very well written.  A great book for book clubs because of the extreme choices the main characters choose.  Great for discussions.
4	1366588800	I usually read young adult fantasy but was getting sick of the cookie cutter plots and characters since the explosion of this genre!  Wanted to take a departure and this fit the bill nicely.  I usually only pick books where I think I might be able to identify with one of the characters.  I took a chance with this one as it is also set in the early 1900's in Australia...not a time or place I can relate to in general but found that human nature still abounds and with that the familiar emotions any man or woman would experience, regardless of setting.  A satisfying, if not exciting read.
4	1366502400	This novel lives up to the hype. It was a page turner about a husband and wife suffering a tragic personal situation and then faced with a heart wrenching decision that is intellectually wrong, but so emotionally driven that it feels "right" to the couple. The author vividly illustrates how their decision impacts each person it touched. Well done!
5	1366502400	The Light Between Oceans is heartwarming. It proves to what extreme people will go to obtain what they really want in life. At times other people's feelings and the possible consequences that they may incur are not considered. Very captivating read.
4	1366502400	I liked this book a lot but towards the end I felt it became to predictable.  I did become very invested in the characters and I truly enjoy when an author can draw me in like that.  I will be anxious to discuss it at our next book club.
5	1366502400	I did not want to put the book down. The characters pulled me in to their lives and they became real. Faced with a choice, and either choice hurts some one, what do you choose?
5	1366502400	This book caught my attention from the first page and kept me entranced to the very end. Many twists and unexpected turns that keep your attention throughout.
5	1366416000	Well written and very enjoyable.  Thought provoking.  Teaches important life lessons we should all ponder.  Hard to put down.  I loved it.
4	1366416000	The book is very well written. The struggle between right and wrong in this situation can be related to many struggles we all face. Can we face the truth? Can we live with it? The author keeps you squirming and guessing and the ending helped resolve things in a way I did not expect.
5	1366416000	I really enjoyed reading this book although it was sad . The author painted a beautiful and vivid picture of the characters, and settings.
5	1366416000	This book gets you hooked right away and keeps your attention throughout. I had a hard time putting it down! There is a lot to talk about when you finish the book. Makes you think about what you might do if you were placed in a similar situation.
5	1366416000	A very moving a good reading book.  It really makes you think of how muchof your values you are willing to give up for someone you love
5	1366329600	Now my son's dog has a part of the UofA spirit even  though they live far from tucson!  Every dog should be a WILDCAT!
5	1366329600	This story is a mystery of the heart with a compelling plot twist.  It is told from the point of view of a man of character, a loving mother and wife, and a small town mystery. When I finished reading it, I was left with conflicting emotions that have persisted in my memory.,
5	1366329600	As I read this book, I just couldn't decide if the decisions made along the way were right or wrong--very unusual for any book I have read.  Even at the end, I was thinking &#34;what if they had made different decisions?&#34;  It is indeed a book deep in thought, but not weighed down with the author's bias.  I even learned much about the life of a lighthouse keeper and the complexities, both physical and emotional, of living such a life.  A very good read.
4	1366329600	Well written.  Presented an interesting perspective of motherhood.  I really enjoyed the setting in Western Australia and the information about lighthouses.
5	1366243200	I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The act of loyalty and depth of love shown are what we would all love to have in our own lives!!!  Or at least I would!
5	1366243200	Loved the book. Read it in two days, I was so attached to the characters, especially Tom. Great first novel
5	1366243200	It's a compelling book filled with powerful late in life love and a moral dilemma that yields a festering wound that eventually explodes bringing about destructions and reconstructions with all the pain only the reader can totally feel.
4	1366243200	Haunting descriptive setting and as the plot unfolded you felt pulled along and caught up in the anguish of the two main characters.  Went right to the heart of making the correct decisions.
5	1366243200	Beautifully written, characters well drawn, dilemma with no perfect ending, highly recommend it.  Set in Australia after WW1, very descriptive as to the geography involved.
5	1366156800	Very few books leave me with wet cheeks at the end, and this was one of them. The characters are realistic and believable, likeable, and you can empathize. The writing is very good and the story ends in a heartfelt, emotional, and understandable way.
4	1366156800	This was a good story.  I escaped my mind all the way to the Aussie on a remote island lighthouse.  Amazing how the story unraveled and a set of previous events came together.  I recommend reading this book.
3	1366156800	I read this book for a book club - not my favorite book, but an OK read.  A little too predictable.
5	1366156800	At first I didn't think I would like this book.  The beginning, for me, dragged and I almost wanted to give it up.  My friend (who recommended the book) urged me to read on.  Well, I am so glad I did!  After a few slow chapters, I could not put this book down!  I literally cried real tears while reading this book.  I have to say its one of my favorite of all time.  So if you find it slow as I did, please don't give up.  You will be glad you didn't!
5	1366156800	Different plot.Intriguing story. Good Characters.Took me awhile to get into it but enjoyed very much. Would reccomend it to anyone.
5	1366156800	Terrific writing of a complex tale revolving around a major moral dilemma. Couldn't put it down. Had to look up a few Australian references.
5	1366156800	Haven't we all, with the best intentions, made decisions and choices that complicated our lives. In this case, not only are the lives of the actors complicated, so are four of those around them. An excellent book if you are interested in people and their decisions.
1	1366156800	I read the reviews and was excited to read this book.  I am about 1/3 of the way through and it is very slow and boring.
5	1366156800	An unusual story about very interesting people and their quest for fulfillment!  The lighthouse is a central feature and so isolated. The mystery of human behavior is palpable. This book captures the need many have to live beyond the hassle of ordinary life.
5	1366156800	Great book!!!!! The whole story it keeps you thinking what would you do if it happened to yourself!! An incredible tough choice!
3	1366156800	I liked the premise and setting of the book.  It examined the harsh choices the characters made and how they had to live with the consequences. I felt the story line dragged a bit though and I did not like how it was resolved.
5	1366156800	This was a very good read with intersting charactors and credable story. The story will keep you intersted throughout with a good ending.
4	1366156800	I did not love this book when I first began reading. I thought it started off slow, and despite knowing the general plot, I just didn't see it developing enough to justify an entire novel. I was wrong though, and it was an AMAZING story.What I find to be so captivating about this novel is the fact that I was feeling a tornado of emotions - I was both for and against the main characters; I rooted for them but then I rooted against them; I was both avenged and left heartbroken when it ended. This is the perfect book people can recommend to their book club, and then spend hours discussing the topic, because I am certain there will be no two like opinions on what should have happened or what was right or wrong.I simply adored this book. I am still feeling very torn between what I wanted to ultimately happen; for this reason I am glad it was chosen for me. I was so vested in all the characters in this novel, and still my heart hurts for so many different reasons.
5	1366156800	This is a story that stays with you after you read it. I felt the solitude of the lighthouse keeper and later the joy with a wife as they explored the island and the newlywed life. When the moral decision came to bear on them I felt right in the middle of it.  Hers as a woman needing a baby to love and his as a man sworn to honesty and  truthfulness. A great read---I have recommended to all my friends.
4	1366156800	Wonderful prose, sad story.  I use books to travel so i enjoyed reading about this little section of the world. I wish I liked the characters more, I grieved for them all.  The author's writing skills kept me going, I am a fool for good writing, regardless do subject.
5	1366156800	A great novel. Moreover, it was only 2.99 which was a steal.  The plot was simple and the characters believable. My daughter read it and enjoyed it also.
5	1366156800	A great piece of equipment,well designed,sturdily made, and my dog loves it. A little expensive , but would buy again.
5	1366070400	I read the other reviews and, at first, decided against reading this...but something kept drawing me back to the summary and I finally gave in to my curiosity.  The beginning is a little slow, but necessary and by Part 3...I am blubbering like a baby for all of Part 3 of this book, but I can't put it down.  Amazing story, with amazing details and descriptions.  I've never been to Australia, but feel like I've been there now.  The story's messages about  Love, Honor, Betrayal, Hope, Loss, Despair, Friendship, and Forgiveness - all make this one novel I will not soon forget.
5	1365984000	What an amazing story!  Couldn't put it down. The storytelling was evocative. Felt every emotion of the characters. Can't imagine how I'd act in similar circumstances.Highly, highly recommend.  Best book I've read in a very long time.
5	1365984000	Some books leave a deep impression on you; this is one of those books.  Stedman writes eloquently about love and both the joy and pain it brings. A wonderful read.
5	1365897600	Not my usual style of book, was picked by my book club so I gave it a shot.  I did truly enjoy it!  A lot of things to make you stop and think about what you would do yourself in those situations.I feel it was well written, things were put together in a way it was hard to put it down sometimes.  I would recommend this one to others, in fact, I already have.
5	1365897600	I was captivated from the beginning until the very end of the book.  Hope to see more books from M.L. Stedman.
3	1365897600	I read this book for my book club selection for this month.  It was an easy read and enjoyed the characters.
5	1365897600	I thought the novel was thought provoking.It presented a moral/ ethical dilemma that will be discussed at my book club.I also liked the portrayal of the main characters & the depth of their emotions.One of the interesting aspects to discuss is the effect of mental illness on a person's judgement.The writer, Stedman certainly captured my interest & inpired me to think about how a person makes a decision tha twill impact on many lives..
4	1365811200	I think this would make a beautiful movie as the setting is so picturesque.  I did enjoy the story line though I thought the dialogue was a bit &#34;sappy.&#34;  Liked it but didn't love it.
4	1365811200	This book really makes the reader think...what would I do if I had these choices to make, and could I be as strong when my own values and morals are being compromised by someone I deeply love?
5	1365811200	I loved this book. Absolutely wonderful, hard to put it down. As someone said, the story will stay with you for ever after you read it. It is a beutiful sad story, may be not for anyone. Very well written, excelent developement of characters, in incredible places description. As you read, you feel as you were there, you feel inside the book like a movie. It is a book I enjoyed so much. Looking forward to reading more from the author.
5	1365811200	I liked the descriptions of all the different spots on the island. Also very interestingto learn a little about the operation of the lighthouse and see how much pride wastaken in caring for the lenses. The characters end up in an interesting moral dilemma.
5	1365811200	This was a really fun book to read.  It was a beautiful story.  It was very different. I had not read a REALLY good book for awhile.  Very hard to put down.
4	1365811200	Good, easy read. Interesting plot and somewhat predictable but entertaining all the same. Will read another Stedman book soon. Nice cover.
5	1365811200	I thought it was well written, very descriptive but not boring.  Story moved along well and even though it was not a &#34;feel-good&#34; ending, it was as it should be.  Very real and true to life.  I liked it a lot.  I think most adult age groups would enjoy this book.
5	1365724800	A moving story of decisions made in love and the ways thatthey will result . A wonderful book I would recommend  toany one  it shows the power of. forgiving.
5	1365724800	This is a story about life.  The good, the bad and the ugly.  Some people are lucky enough to have an easy life, while others like Tom and Isabel have a hard one.  All they wanted was a child to love and they got that opportunity for a short period of time.  Everything that happens in life shapes us as it did with Tom and Isabel.  The end was awesome.  Their lives made a complete circle.
5	1365724800	I could not put this book down.  I fell in love with the story and the characters.  It evoked so much emotion and I felt transported to a different time and place while reading this book.
4	1365724800	This book was written well and had interesting insights and perspectives.  It presented a very thought provoking dilemma which held interest to the end.  A good read and recommended especially to women.
4	1365724800	I enjoyed the historical setting in a place and time so different from where we live and how we live today.  However, circumstances like this have happened in our time so it was a relevant story.
5	1365724800	Beautiful book.  I'll recommend it to my bookclub for next year.  The characters were very human and they take you along for such an emotional ride!.  Read it... seriously, read it!
5	1365724800	A beautiful, thought provoking novel that will make you hold your children tighter and make you question your own moral compass. I highly recommend, especially if your book club is searching for a read with layers of discussion topics. The author brings the characters and the landmarks to life with incredibly beautiful prose. Historically interesting combined with a heart wrenching love story, Stedman's Light Between Oceans is not to be missed.
4	1365638400	Any parent can truly identify with the story.  It was a heart tugging tale taking place in the early 1900's.
4	1365638400	I really enjoyed this book. It made me happy and yet sad. This is a fantastic book. I would recommend this book to anyone!
4	1365638400	I so enjoyed this story. I thought at first it was going to be the usual love story but it was so much more.
5	1365638400	Exquisite writing, deep characters and a gripping story are why I could NOT put down this book! The ending could have gone so many different ways but the author chose the best way...which both tore me up and warmed my heart.
4	1365638400	A beautiful novel that is ultimately about love. I would give this 4.5 stars if it was an option. Wonderfully descriptive, I did not want it to end.
5	1365638400	A wonderful read. The covers so many emotions and does so in a unique way.i have never read a book quite like this.
5	1365638400	Such a compelling story and really makes you question what we are capable of to protect something we treasure!A great read!
5	1365552000	Loved this .  Read it on my IPAD.Great story.  Book club had a good discussion.I recommended it to two book clubs
5	1365552000	Stedman grabs hold of your emotions and doesn't let go until you're exhausted. Each main character is as endearing as the next. The story constantly begs the reader to ask what s/he would do in the situations that faced Tom. Isabel, Hannah, and above all, Bluey.
5	1365552000	I just loved this book - I could NOT put it down!  I've always loved lighthouses which made this story extra special to me.  Learning about the day to day life of a lighthouse keeper was fascinating, but most of all, the story itself was riveting.  It pulls at your emotions like few stories have done and keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next.  The characters are all flawed and full of life which makes this story wondeful - I highly recommend it.
1	1365552000	The product was burning the skin.Irritated it more than handled the baggage under the eyes.I was very disappointed
5	1365552000	Life for Izzy and Tom offered so much promise and so much sorrow.  Life at the end of the world offers a readjustment of living for this couple and the appreciation of the vastness and loneliness of a lighthouse keeper.  When fate brings them the thing they need the most, they accept the gift and ignore the consequences until they no longer can.  Choices made for better or worse impact their lives and those of many others.
5	1365552000	The writing is superb!  Should be a model for a class on writing fiction!  I would definitely take that class!
4	1365552000	I liked the book because of the good job the author did in writing his story.  It kept my interest throughout the book.  I felt conflicted about the two main characters situation.I would recommend this book.
4	1365552000	I finished the book two hours ago and still have tears running down my cheeks. This story was so compelling and deeply heart-wrenching, it's the kind of book that makes you search your own soul. The main character was an admirable man, quietly heroic yet totally, imperfectly human, who deserved much better than he got. I cried for him and for Hannah, and loved the supporting characters of Ralph, Bluey and Knuckey.I was actually shocked to learn that the author is a woman. The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five was because I wished the character of Isabel had been developed a bit more. Isabel was a bit too one-dimensional in some respects and although one can truly feel and empathize with her dilemma, I would have liked more insight into her thought process - was she just that blazingly naive and impetuous? Was there something in her psychological makeup or upbringing that drew her so quickly and intensely to her future husband, and that explained why the prospect of life on a remote island with no other people around for months or years at a time did not raise any qualms in the heart of a vibrant 19-year-old girl? And how did the multiple tragedies this young couple suffered during their first few years of marriage affect them? Nobody comes away from things like that with their love unscathed. If that aspect of the story had been developed just a bit more, this novel would have been simply perfect.Please do not mistake those comments - they are small quibbles about a novel that is in all other respects so beautifully written, so engrossing and rewarding, I wish it had been a couple hundred more pages.It's been years since I cried after reading a novel. Thank you, Ms. Stedman, for your fine work and a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience. I will be eagerly looking for more of your titles.
5	1365552000	A beautiful story that highlights the multidimensional aspects of love and of the difficult choices that one may have to make in the name love.  Woven throughout the story  the &#34; Do the right thing&#34; theme forces the reader to vacillate on what constitutes the &#34; Right thing&#34;.
5	1365465600	Very rarely do characters curl up in my heart.  But this young couple living on a lighthouse off the coast of Australia face very difficult decisions and must live with the consequences.  I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it.  Warning - it will break  your heart.
5	1365465600	It was hard to put down as you couldn't wait to find out the outcome.  Full of Suspense and and the writer really held your attention.  Great Book.  I highly recommend.
3	1365465600	I felt it was repetative at times, as well.  The characters were one dimensional and predictable.  It was a bit too long.
2	1365465600	It just made me feel sad and did not add anything else to my life. Would not recommend it to anyone, especially to a new mom.
5	1365465600	A great book of love and care people, who made a decision that cost them a lot in the end. I would definitely recommend this book to read, as a fast read with a great story. Really Enjoyed!!!!!!
5	1365465600	Couldn't put it down, very compelling. Its hard to not want it to turn out well for everyone. I seldom read a book clear through in a day.
5	1365465600	captivating story about a mother's love.  it made you think about what you would do if placed in this situation.
4	1365465600	I really loved this book and the emotional journey it took me on.  I am always looking for a good read and this one will stay on my top ten list to share with others for a long time!
5	1365465600	Familiar themes of love and motherhood. Appeals to women. No real surprises but touches the heart! A VERY quick read.
4	1365465600	Tough decisions for two families including tragedy, love and loss.  It was hard to choose between the two families because they were all good people.
4	1365379200	THis well written emotional family history tugs at so many corners of the heart and mind that, unless one stops to explore and consider the possibilities, you are cheating yourself.
5	1365379200	This book was recommended by a friend. I am not sure what choice I would have made in similar situations.  A different time. A different way of life. Heartbreaking and full of love and sacrifice. I highly recommend this book .
4	1365379200	The Light Between Oceans.  What a wonderful book . A must read. So informative and gripping . SARAH D. CAMPBELL
5	1365379200	Lovely book. The characters are endearing, I found myself feeling for each and everyone. Literally could not put the book down. The story stays with you long after you finish the book.
5	1365292800	This is a story  about a couple who lives on an island and keep the lighthouse in the 1920's  off the coast of Australia . After three miscarriages, a baby and her deceased father arrive on their shore.  This book is very well written.  Some of the Australian terms made me laugh to decipher.  The reader learns about postwar life in the 20's.
5	1365292800	I couldn't put this down...a must read. The heartache I felt for these characters had me in tears at the end.
5	1365292800	This as a very interesting book.  Our book club loved it.  It makes you wonder what you would have done in the same situation.
5	1365292800	This book was beautifully written and an incredible read. The plot, sometimes twisting, sometimes crashing, with an ebb and flow, characterized the many ocean themes in the book and the unique, fascinating, and very touching story of love lost and found again. Well worth the read for everyone. I couldn't help crying at the end. Wow!
4	1365292800	Good read, a slow start in the beginning but mid way through the book the plot picked up and I couldn't put the book down.
3	1365292800	A very nice story, I enjoyed it. Not as much as some,but ok. Its  sort of like a romance novel, with a twist. I wasn't overly impressed, though.
5	1365292800	This was recommended by a friend who has suggested other great reads. I like it because it puzzled me at first because it started with some history and moved to the present. It has a lot of psychological truths about people and the love of mothers for their child, what they will do for them and how events can change a person .
5	1365292800	Great story! Heartwarming as much as it was heart wrenching in places. Great characters and setting. One of my bookclub favorites.
5	1365206400	This book belongs with great literature.  It's style and structure make it something that should be studied.  The story was so compelling and posed so many moral dilemmas worth considering.  I couldn't stop reading it.  The characters were so real and the country so vivid.
4	1365206400	I enjoyed this book. The story was interesting and compelling. My only complaint is it was a bit hokey in places.
4	1365206400	This book is one that will stay with me. The author did a great job of making Janus real and vivid. The story line kept me reading and the characters were very real. Made me realize a lot about forgiveness and love.
4	1365206400	When a book makes you cry and stay awake thinking about what you would do in their situation, it is a good book. We were surprised to learn it was a &#34;first book writtten&#34;. Well done.
4	1365120000	The beginning of the book was slow and I almost put it down for good. Once past the beginning I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Good story, characters, etc.
5	1365120000	One of the best books I have read in the last 2 years. Not only did I learn about the life of a lighthouse keeper, I was also filled with the emotional love of a mother. There are many unexpected turns of event, and I was surprised at the end.
5	1365033600	Compelling story. Very talented writer. Expertly weaves in details about Australia and WWI that make the story more realistic and interesting to reader. Very strong in presenting point of view of characters. Hope to read this author again.
4	1365033600	I did not like this boook at the beginning but I pushed throgh sice it was my book club's selection. It definitely gets better!
2	1365033600	Well written if you want to be down most of the time. The details about maintaining and running a light house was the most interesting in the whole book
5	1365033600	The characters were well developed and I felt very connected to their emotional plight.  Extremely well written - never disappointed
3	1365033600	Story is a bit drawn out and contrived. Kept reading because I thought it would pick up speed. Also, I didn't feel the characters well fleshed out considering the length of the book.
5	1365033600	One of the books you could not put down. One of the few books you read where you like everyone in the book. Whether it is criminal, circumstantial, everyone actions are understandable.
4	1365033600	I found this book to be really gripping.  The characters were for the most part well developed, and the story was original..  I found myself reminded of the caution that literature requires &#34;a willing suspension of disbelief&#34; because realistically I don't believe that the plot could really happen in the way described, but I really didn't care.  I liked the characters and was willing to accept the plot despite my rational belief that much of it was unrealistic.The author's style is literate, and she confronts many issues of morality in a reasonably nonjudgmental fashion.  There are no villains, which is a welcome departure from the typical contemporary novel. I recommend this book.
4	1364947200	The moral dilemma in the plot lends itself very well to discussion. Most members of my book club indentified very strongly with one or the other of the two main characters.
3	1364947200	ending left me unsatisfied.  The story is quite depressing and I was able to finish the book only because I wanted to find out how it ended.
4	1364947200	story is like a trainwreck, you can not look away.  Gripping.  Crazy what love does to people and relationships. It was very moving.
5	1364947200	I found the story compelling from start to finish.  The characters were fleshed out in such a way that you felt them very believable, their reactions realistic and true.
5	1364947200	The descriptions of the lighthouse were so vivid I felt as though I was there.  I felt for all three of the main characters, felt I understood their feelings as events progressed.  Really enjoyed the book.
5	1364947200	Just a good read----well written!  Each character was so well described that you could identify with them all.  Hard to put it down!!!!
5	1364947200	Beautiful story of how love, integrity and spirituality help people make decisions that will affect so many others. A must read.
5	1364947200	Loved this book!  Beautifully written. I was hooked from start to finish.  But beware, the ending is a tear jerker.  I'm hoping this story is made into a movie.
5	1364860800	I have two adopted grown sons.  My feelings for these kind of stories are very close to the surface.  I could feel for both women.
4	1364860800	A deep, romanticized, dream-like story of a couple; each with a past. Different tempraments, difficult decisions, harder realizations...Life in some of its deepest moments, yet coming to a true adjustment to every day life. Worth the read.
5	1364860800	This is one of the best novels I have ever read.  Hands down.  I gave it a look because the cover looked pretty and the title soudned interesting.  When I read the back I thought it sounded okay.I could not put this book down!  Really got under my skin, just an amazing storyteller.  I highly recommend.  The characters are completely believable and the book will completely transport you to another world.  What great novels are meant to do.
4	1364860800	It took me awhile to get into this book but once I did it was a fast read.  I did not know who to root for in the book.  Lucy had become such a part of a family (and extended family) that needed her...but then her biological mother was lost and needed her too!  I actually think I was disappointed at the end.  I wanted a happy ending and not sure that is what I got.  Or was it??
4	1364860800	a sensetive read.Very much like the ruling of Solomon.Surely a book for women with children.i liked it
5	1364860800	I loved the characters, the description of the lighthouse, and the isolation. Some of the plot was predictable. I loved the ending.
3	1364860800	Not fabulous, not terribly well-written.  A good tale, but completely depressing, and semi-tragic.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this one - just ok.
5	1364860800	I give five stars to rate this book because I could not put it down, it was very sensible, the caracters well done, the story was a novelty and all the emotions where like living them.
5	1364774400	Well structured and very enjoyable. Would recommend. Makes you think about how life's twist effect a web of people. Good
2	1364774400	The kernel of the story was interesting but could have been told in 10,000 words or less. There weren't any subplots and the characters were flat. After the first two chapters, I mostly skimmed it. It was a book club selection; otherwise I would have stopped completely after those first chapters.
4	1364688000	It's hard to discuss his books without giving away key plot points but it is an interesting view of life as a lighthouse keeper and what happens when you try to do something for the one you love, while knowing you could be causing grief to others.
5	1364688000	The characters are well developed and so is the story.  An excellent read.  The characters stay with you long after the last page has been read.  Enjoy!!
5	1364688000	I loved this book!  Eloquently written, twists and turns I didn't want it to end. Get a box of Kleenex for the end.
3	1364688000	Story was intriguing from a moral standpoint, though it was slow to get moving. Interesting story, somewhat predictable at times, but a great lesson in forgiveness and resilience.
5	1364601600	I recommend this book because from the first sentence it held my interest.  It was the type of book that you plan your day around finding time to read.
4	1364601600	I choose this rating because It kept me interested in coming back.  Because it takes place in Australia, I sometimes found the language a bit confusing.  But the story is a good one and is definitely worth reading.
3	1364601600	The novel was engaging, but written in a simplistic manner. Makes for an enjoyable easy read, good beach book. Not too long, wish the characters had been flushed out more.
5	1364601600	Amazing story that addresses so many issues. Every character had me rooting for them but in the end this book is heartbreaking.  I don't know what I would have done had I been in any of the situations in the book.  Recommend!  Great book club book too.
5	1364601600	This book started out a bit slow but I found it very readable none the less.  There was something that kept me reading on.  The story was good, the characters were interesting.  Once the story gets going it keeps you turning the page.  I think everyone in my book club read the book and enjoyed the book which does not happen all the time!
4	1364601600	This book's story and moral dilemma will stay with you long after you've finished reading the book... location and cast of characters are unique.
2	1364601600	I felt as if I was reading a soap opera and knew the plot by the end of the second chapter.
4	1364601600	This book is set after WWI . It is a story about Tom, a soldier returning to Australia after the war. He meets and marries  a young woman Isabel and takes her to live on a remote island where he is the light keeper.  The book is beautifully written and  I became completely absorbed in their story.Tom a former soldier, is very regimented in his life. Isabel is more of a free spirit. In one scene she comes to Tom in the lighthouse naked and wants to make love.Tom is horrified , not because she is naked but because she is naked in his lighthouse! and quickly carries her to the house.  Isabel wants a baby but after 2 miscarriages and a still birth she is despondent. She believes it is a miracle that a boat washes up with a dead man and a baby. Tom insists that he needs to report it but isabel begs him to wait and then asks him to let her keep the baby.Against his instincts Tom agrees.  That decision will have terrible consequences. This is a tragic story with  a moral dilemma that is difficult depending on your perspective. My book club either loved or hated the book but it generated lots of discussion. Highly recommended.
3	1364601600	Really liked this book but although I thought the middle of the book was slow and it took a while for the book to get flowing again.
4	1364515200	Finally enjoyed a book that I could not put down or stop thinking about. Thank you for the unique plot and character development. A very enjoyable read!
4	1364515200	A very thoughtful moral tale with just the right ending.  Makes you understand more fully the rythym of life and how forgiveness and love can heal.
5	1364515200	This book was one of the BEST I have read in a long time. At my book club we had a lively discussion with all the symbolism. Very well written and touching story with many layers. Guaranteed to make you cry.Carol H
4	1364515200	This book could have taken a turn in either direction several times.  Only a mother could understand the points of view of each side.  Suspenseful, a mystery of sorts, and a very good summer read.  Enjoy!
3	1364515200	Over a thousand people have given this book five stars. I am not one of them. For me this is firmly in the three star camp because I really am in the middle - there are lots of things I liked about it, and plenty that I didn't.On the positive side, this is a story with lots of potential. When a boat washes ashore on Janus Rock, the lighthouse keeper is faced with a dilemma. Does he immediately report, as regulation dictates, the dead body and the (living) baby found in the boat? Or does he allow his grieving wife who has just buried her third baby, to take on the child as her own? The decision taken reaches both into the future and the past, binding families together and tearing others apart.While the moral dilemma is at the heart of the story, so too is the work of a lighthouse keeper and this story delves into both the connections and dislocation the keepers feel. It is also a story that is rich in detail, describing a coastline that is both fierce and beautiful.On the whole I enjoyed the premise of the story, however, it lacked something in the execution. Given that the novel is set in Western Australia where I lived for ten years, I'd expected to feel a closer connection. The novel, however, really feels like it was written for an international audience whose knowledge of Australia is grounded in the Crocodile Hunter. It invokes every possible Australian colloquialism and Australian animals, reptiles and insects are inserted liberally. Perhaps the language was appropriate for the era, but I just found it irritating. To an extent this may have been exacerbated by the fact that Stedman never seems entirely comfortable writing dialogue. Her descriptive prose is beautiful and lyrical, but the conversations are often stilted and jarring.Stylistically there are also some weird things going on, particularly in the use of past and present tense.  Every new section starts off in the present tense, and then invariably meanders into past tense. You don't notice it happening until you reach the next section and the present tense jumps out again.Something odd too has happened in the overall structure. The first half is largely confined to two points of view and the suddenly there's a whole lot of random head hopping going on - often into the heads of characters who are never heard from again. There are also some random elements of back story that are introduced but never fully developed or explained.Other reviewers have suggested that it reads like a book completed in a hurry to meet a deadline, and I understand that feeling. Perhaps this is true. Or maybe it was picked up by a publisher in its early draft form, and now bears the hallmark of a book that was recrafted to suit an international audience.I didn't love this book, but I would definitely read the author's next. Perhaps with a bestseller under her belt and a bit of breathing space to write, we will get to see her considerable talent put to better use.
5	1364515200	I found this to be a wonderful book.  Beautiful writing, well constructed characters, fine story and very smart.  Did they make bad choices?  And if so, which ones?  That's for the reader to decide.
5	1364515200	This was a very good read.  I liked it so much that I didn't want to finish it in fear of how it would end, because I could definitely see both sides.
5	1364515200	I loved this book.  A story that keeps you interested with no additional sex to keep you interested.  The whole bookwas great and though the ending was a little sad I loved this book.  One of the best out of the last 60 books that I read.
4	1364515200	The author takes you to the island, and you live there, isolated, with the characters. and that is why it is then so difficult to face the decision, because you face it right along with them. Try and see both sides.  Try and understand.  Be relieved that at this point the characters are on their own.
4	1364428800	I liked it , one because of the setting, also the story line and the ending. Felt sorry for the child but guess she was alright at the end of the book.Think the book would make a good movie. maybe even a great movie.
3	1364428800	Some of the book was really beautiful and descriptive which I liked. The author did a good job of helping you understand how being all alone on a tiny island was both appealing and lonely.I didn't care for the characters all that much though. It seemed like for a married couple who only had each other to talk to, they didn't communicate their thoughts to each other. At times they seemed like distant friends rather than husband and wife.
5	1364428800	I read this book for my book club and highly recommend it. You get a glimpse of Australian history as well as a very well told story of love, betrayal, morals with a good ending. The writing style is very descriptive and an easy read.
4	1364428800	This novel takes place in between the world wars and in remote Australia, but the characters' struggles with themselves, their marriage, and others are universal.  Engaging and thought-provoking, makes you wonder &#34;what would I do&#34;.
3	1364428800	Good plot, thought provoking yet mostly predictable, written well if not slightly labored, great characters that you become invested in.
3	1364428800	A good story does not necessarily create a good book. It has to be well written. I found the dialogue unrealistic and banal; therefore the relationships between the characters were weak, uninteresting, and lacked depth. But the essential dilemma posed would make a good discussion for book groups.
5	1364342400	It is rare to enjoy the experience of such a wonderfull book. I could not stop reading from beginning to end.
5	1364256000	I enjoyed every minute of the read.  It's such a touchingly beautiful tale.  The descriptions of a part of the world I do not know were very enlightening.  Can't wait to discuss it in our book club coming up.
4	1364256000	Very compelling!  Thought it could possibly be trite and it was anything but!!!  Motherhood is very complicated...seeing at least three different women deal with it very indivudually was revealing.  There is so much emotion and so little practicality.
5	1364256000	Sad but a good read. I can't imagine the loneliness felt by the couple after so many losses. Would recommend to friends.
3	1364256000	This is a well written book with an easy plot to follow.  An isolated couple keeps a child that they believe is abandoned, and when they find out otherwise they have to struggle with the consequences of their actions.  Unfortunately for me, the plot was a little too easy to predict.  It took me until the second section (the book is in three sections) to become engrossed with the characters.  The first section takes some time to set up the characters for the reader, a litle too dragged out for my personal taste.  The author tries to provide one or two twists during the story but as mentioned, I found the plot easy to follow and not very exciting or eventful (ie not full of surprises or unexpected behaviors by the characters).  If you are looking for a book that is an easy read, written well, and contains an easy to follow storyline, than this book is for you.
4	1364256000	There were many was this story could have ended, and I was enthralled thinking about the possibilities. A very enjoyable book!
2	1364256000	This book was very depressing.  It took me a while to get into it and when I finally did it just totally depressed me!
5	1364169600	This book was good! It pulled your emotions in so many directions that you could identify with each character in different ways. The ending was heartfelt and it was a tear jerker.
5	1364169600	You start off thinking you know how you want this book to end up then you change your mind then you change your mind again.  Very good book
4	1364169600	This was a nice book, with a conflict that most people will understand. It has a good ending and will be a satisfying read overall.
5	1364169600	The setting, a remote island, with only mainland contact being the rare visits by a 'packet-type' boat make this story special from the get-go. Life affecting decisions made in the name of love keep the reader turning pages with a faster-beating heart!
5	1364169600	It is hard to believe this is Stedman's first novel. Powerful, thought-provoking, masterful descriptions and dialogue. It gets right to the reader's heart and won't let go. A book I look forward to visiting again sometime.
5	1364169600	This story kept me interested through out the whole book. The characters and their challenges really had me questioning what would I do.
5	1364169600	This is a great book. So sad and bittersweet.. The main character Tom was a man of integrity, even though his moral decision was too harsh for Isabel to bear.
4	1364169600	This book generated quite a lot of discussion in my book club.  There were many questions and thoughts about the characters actions. Very interesting!!
5	1364169600	a different kind of book.  sad but so bitter sweet.  Keep my interest, could not put it down.  very good
4	1364169600	This book was well written. The twists kept it interesting and I felt that the emotions portrayed were believable. There was no smut or bad language, something that I appreciated.
5	1364169600	One of the best reads. Gripping dilemmas resolved in a way for you to decide if they were harmonious or not...Check it out!!
5	1364169600	I can't remember the last time I stayed up til 2 am reading a book!  A great story with well-developed, believable characters.  A must read.
4	1364083200	Beautifully written and beautifully told. A poignant story about love and loss. I couldn't put it down. Amazing first novel.
4	1364083200	I  found  the psychological motives of all  three major characters intriguing.  The symbolic isolation of the lighthouse also played a major role. Totally readable. Loved it from the first page, the characters were so likeable. Only minus was the far-fetched plot. A gripping read.
5	1364083200	This was a very good book.  Well written and thought provoking.  All in my book club enjoyed it very much!
4	1364083200	Have not finished it yet, a little slow, but I am enjoying it. A little sad so far but I will see how it goes.
5	1364083200	loved this book.  I felt all of the emotions.  Easy to read and very real.it is amazing how everything we do affects so many others.
3	1364083200	Enjoyed it, but not as great as everyone rated it. Not a happy story. I read to feel to be uplifted, this book will not do that for you.
4	1363996800	I enjoyed this book though I thought some of the conversation between the characters when they were young was annoying and trite. The story kept me coming back to find out how all would be resolved.  I was involved enough to be very annoyed by the female character and her utter selfishness.  I would recommend the book.
5	1363996800	There is something magical about lighthouses and the people who are the caretakers of such places. The story takes you to an emotional place where you know the characters cannot find happiness in the end. But none-the-less everyone moves forward with the best intentions. Reality hurts and is certainly corrective.
3	1363996800	I initially liked this book, found it interesting and the characters well depicted, easy to envision. Then halfway through the book, you know what's coming. At some point you want to shout "Get ON with it!" Then it comes, and it drags. Finally, the sad final third, and the tear jerker ending. By the time I was 75% through the book, I was getting so depressed I just wanted to finish it asap so I could be done with it.Not sure why there are so many reverent reviews. I guess people want to delve into the morality issues, debate "What would you do?".  Frankly, what I would do is find a different book.
5	1363996800	I wasn't sure what to expect when I began this book. Little did I know that some of the trials this young couple come to face would reflect some of my own personal grief. It was quite liberating to cry along with the couple through their journey. Gives me hope that I too will find peace after enough time has past.Highly recommend this book!
5	1363910400	I thought this was a wonderful read in every way: beautiful writing and an unusual topic to ponder. Every member of my book club agreed. I look forward to the movie. SLH
4	1363910400	I enjoyed reading this book; the ending was somewhat unpredictable, but one that I liked.  The story centers around a lighthouse keeper and his family; the book reveals what it's like to live near and work in a lighthouse.  This novel had me asking what I would do  in a similar situation.  In the end, love prevails for all involved, and the characters do the right thing.
5	1363910400	Great book!  Author was great at describing ocean, land and sky.  I could visualize it all.  Events were tied up neatly at end of story.  Great storytelling!
5	1363910400	Great Item:Great Item: Ipad, Iphone, Ipod, All wires now nicely tucked away and hidden from view. Even the price is right.
4	1363910400	A thought provoking book, it raised questions - which only the reader can answer.  A sad but moving story, I enjoyed it.
4	1363824000	This was a fantastic book.  I will read it again.  Will recommend it to others!  Loved it & glad I got it.
5	1363824000	Engrossing, well written tale from down under!  Highly recommended.  Was my reading for a recent cruise, and was hard to put down!!
5	1363824000	This story was excellent, rich in detail about the things people will do for the sake of loving another person. This book so deeply touched on interpersonal relationships & how they change us forever. The details of life in the early 1920's was intriguing & full of details that really put you in that time. The facts about Austrailia & light houses was very well described. I highly recommend this book.
4	1363824000	Read this for a book club and isn't something I would have normally picked; however, I did like the book. It makes you think and was great for a book club discussion. Would recommend but it will pull at your heart strings.
5	1363824000	Wonderful book to read with so many emotions flooding you at every turn. A definite recommended read. One you should not pass up.
5	1363824000	I really enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it!  Very engaging characters and story line!  Thanks for the break from real life!
5	1363824000	I really like this book.  It did a good job of keeping my interest and it had a pretty good ending.
4	1363824000	The writing was suberb I felt like I was watching their lives play out in front of mevery sad I could not wait to finish this novel. It still haunts me Life does not always come with happy endings.very human story
5	1363737600	Characters and story beautifully written.  This is the best book I've read in a long time.  Lucy was such a believably drawn child.  Will look for more by this author
5	1363737600	The story is well written and quite beautiful.  I could not put it down but then also knew I would be in tears before it was over.
5	1363737600	I read he book with ecitement.  The lighthouse and the child came to be symbols of the two worlds involed.
2	1363737600	I wish I had not read this book.  I don't see any reason for a book that has disastrous endings for all the main characters.  I read to be entertained not depressed.
5	1363737600	The story line was both heartbreaking and yet hopeful. In every way a parent's worse nightmare wotj the only pos.sible resolution.
5	1363737600	Wonderful story that any mother or father could relate to....well written, very visual....highly highly recommend this - would make a great book club choice.
4	1363737600	The prose alone is worth the read.  Lovely images of lonely yet fulfilling spaces along Australia's vast coasts.  The story is intriguing and will captivate.
5	1363737600	An excellent book.  It grabs your interest within the first few pages.  It's a book I could keep and read again and enjoy it over again.
5	1363737600	A lighthouse keeper off the southwest Australian coast and his wife find a dead man and a live baby in a boat that washes ashore. A well-written novel about &#34;ordinary&#34; people making life-changing decisions - thought-provoking.
5	1363737600	Very good story about early years of Australia. Steadman spins a great yarn. Makes you feel like a part of the story.
4	1363737600	This is a well-written, easy to read novel of Australia following World War I. Apart from a good read, I also learned a lot about lighthouse keeping and their role in the safety of the seas.
5	1363651200	This book had me from the very first few pages.  I started it early so I could take my time reading it for our book club.  I could not put it down & finished it weeks before our meeting.  I would definitely read something by this author again.  Great book to take on vacation but bring another one along as you will zip through this.  And the ending was not disappointing like so many of them are.
5	1363651200	Realistic writing about the beauty and harshness of living at the edge of the sea.  Sad but beautifully told story of a parents loss and the tormenteddecisions we sometimes have to make
5	1363651200	Loved reading this novel.  The story is simple in plot, yet complex due to the insightful introspection of its characters.  The layers and lives of the characters beautifully unfold and the emotions run deep with Stedman's skillful writing.
4	1363651200	This is a great story about a couple who live on an isolated island off the coast of Australia as lighthouse keepers.  They desperately want to have a baby but Isobel has several miscarriages and it seems they will never be parents, until one day when a small boat crashes on the rocks below the lighthouse with a baby and a dead man in it.  Should they keep the baby?  How would they ever find the parents?  As lives are forever changed you will change your alliance with the characters as the book progresses and start wondering what would you do in the same circumstances.  I gave this a 4/5 stars only because a few of the plots seemed a bit contrived.  It is an easy read and I would highly recommend it.
4	1363651200	I read this for a book club.  I thought  it started out slow, but pretty good overall.  All of the book club liked it.
3	1363651200	A little melancholy. Does not have a happy ending but is a good read. I would have liked a different ending.
3	1363564800	All in all an okay read.  Good enough to let you feel for the characters, but sometimes the writing and conversations were annoying.
2	1363564800	Sometimes, there really is only one clear-cut choice.  This "soaper" story was not "gripping," as one reviewer stated.  The characters were faced with a basic decision (for which there really was only one option) and, instead, made a poor, selfish, choice.  There never was any justification for their decision so I never felt the tension of whether their decision might possibly be acceptable. I didn't feel any sympathy for the main characters at all when things starting going badly for them.  I only felt disdain - they were basically just kidnappers.I had to finish the book for book club; otherwise, I would have stopped reading about half way through.  If anything, this story reveals the domino effect of poor choices.The author, on the other hand, is a talented writer and I could visualize the setting very well; I hope the author will explore other topics in future works.
4	1363564800	This is a moral delemma with no quick answer even though we were all agreed it was an easy answer in our book club.  Well written.
4	1363564800	What a wonderfully told story of love loss and undying allegiance. I loved this book and the characters become so real.
4	1363564800	Couldn't put it down and had you guessing with every chapter.. Not quite as predictable as might be expected based on the description
5	1363478400	Such a heart felt story, you want both families to have their child, the feelings of all the characters were so very well written,As I read this book my heart went out to all of them.  Thank you for such a good story and the information on a Lighthouse Keeper's Life..
3	1363478400	This was a good book that deals with the choices we make and ultimately the consequences we pay for those choices.  Sometimes you just can't have something because you want or feel you deserve it, and this is at the heart of this sad story.  You feel for all the characters in the story and unfortunately, none are winners.  You know that this couple is making a very bad decision but it's  easy to understand why these people made the decisions they did.  You can feel the conflict and you just know it will not turn out well but still interesting to see it evolve. This book has a sad theme and limited  &#34;happy times&#34;. If you are a reader who needs this to enjoy a book, it may not be for you.  Primarily because of the ability to emotionally connect with the characters though, I would give this book 3 and a half stars if I could.
4	1363478400	Enjoyed the story's twists. And the description of the solitude of living on as an island and the juxtaposition  of making decisions on your own even though part of a sacred coupledom.
4	1363478400	I really enjoyed the story.  Brava, Ms Stedman.  Keep writing, you are an author.My book club reviewed it .
5	1363478400	Absolutely loved this book and am sure I will someday enjoy the movie.Learned a great deal about the life of a lighthouse keeper and the lighthouse itself.  Presented easily.The love story that is entwined between husband and wife and parent and child is delicately handled andwill open the doors for discussion for years to come.  Great read.  Don't miss this one.
5	1363478400	I love this story.  I have a book club and it is going on the list for next season. It is a believable story and the characters are difficult to be angry with even though their actions are so painful to others. Love is a active emotion and cannot be denied even though the cost can destroy us. Well done!
5	1363478400	I highly recommend this book!  Beautiful language, a heart-rending story, and a believable ending. Stedman has truly given us a gift.
4	1363392000	From the beginning, this book captures your attention.  It takes you on an emotional roller coaster and you find yourself feeling a range of emotions throughout the whole book while feeling you are in on a little secret.  Continuously, you ask yourself what you would do.This was actually a book club selection and since I am in two clubs I am recommending it to the second.  Great read, would highly recommend.
5	1363392000	Great book - learned alot about the geography too around Australia.  This book was very moving from start to finish.  Would recommend to anyone.  Its really a great portrayal of the hardships of life.
3	1363392000	While the story was compelling, it was obvious as to what the outcome would be. As so often happens in a good book, the reader finds herself mentally warning the characters not to do what they are planning to do.
5	1363392000	Took me to a place on earth far outside my experience, with recognizable and likable characters facing difficult decisions.  Questions of family, parenthood, honor resounded through imperfect, realistic characters I grew to care about.  This book provided what I hope for when I pick up a new book: it picked me up and captured me and carried me forward with it.
5	1363392000	At first I couldn't'  get into the story, and wondered if I really wanted to read it, but as I got into the life's of the characters, I knew it was going to be a terrific  book.  What dramatic events, your heart ached for all of them.  Made you wonder what choices you may have made that has affected others.
5	1363392000	As someone who has lost a child the grief and dispair felt very real in this book. I like that it was realistic and didnt have a fairy tale sort of ending. I loved the descriptions of shore life and lighthouses, which have always been a fascination for me. I wouldn't recommend this book to just anyone but for those who want to feel deeply, it's for you.
5	1363392000	Couldn't put this book down. Compelling story about a lighthouse keeper and his wife who can't have children of their own and at the wife's urging, end up raising a baby that washes ashore in a boat with a dead body. Meanwhile, the mother of the baby agonizes over what happened to her husband and baby girl.
4	1363392000	Although I didn't feel a real connection with any of the characters, this was a great story!  I was highly engaged and recommend this book.
5	1363305600	We are all the result of our choices through this life. This story is a perfect example of that. The characters are unforgettable as are their choices.  Wonderful read to remember long after you've read it.
5	1363305600	This book was a fascinating story of two people  and their love for a child. The emotional turmoil and dedication to each other as well as their decision to do the right thing in the end took its toll on them as well as others.
4	1363305600	Well-written story about love, family and character. I was drawn into the characters' lives and understood their decisions completely.  I highly recommend it!
5	1363305600	This was one of the best books I have ever read!! Really did love it.  I will look forward to other books by this author.
4	1363305600	This book offers so many conflicting topics. It's a great book club book. I enjoyed the characters and their conflict over what to do.
4	1363305600	Life is not black and white. Decisions are never simple. This book makes you think about the complexities in life.
3	1363219200	This was an impressive book for a first-time author.  The descrptions in it were beautiful or intriguing.  I enjoyed the book, but felt that it got tedious in the middle.  This was due to all the conversation.  There was too much &#34;he said, she said&#34; which did not progress the story, particularly the conversation with the child.  I wondered if some of this was autobiographical. At times I felt that the author was telling me more about lighthouses than I wanted to know.  This was not a happy book; the seclusion of the island depressed me.  I  felt the ending could have given us more relief if Lucy had gotten to her adoptive mother before she died.  I would recommend the book because it is an unusual story and well-written.
4	1363219200	Engrossing story about a lighthouse keeper and hid wife who find an abandoned baby after having lost several of their own, their decision to keep it, and how it affects their lives and others. Book was recently nominated for Women's Prize for Fiction. Am looking forward to this author's follow-up.
5	1363219200	I loved this book!  It was an easy read, but the story becomes so complicated. You find yourself wondering what you would have done had you been any one of the characters. It was a bit heart-wrenching, but worth the ache!
5	1363219200	I loved this book! I was sorry I finished reading the book! Great story! Beautiful setting, great story, interesting problem!
5	1363219200	All of us have made choices in life.  Some worked out well, while others did not.  This story shows us how to deal with both results.  Loved it!
5	1363219200	I downloaded this book on the recommendation of a friend! I wasn't sure what to expect, but instantly fell in love with the story and the characters. You get a feel for the hard life of a lighthouse keeper and what he and his family must endure. It is an excellently written story with many different threads expertly intertwined.
4	1363219200	It was sad and heart wrenching.  very thought provoking. As in what would I do ?  I will recommend this book to my book club.
5	1363219200	I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were both effective and very  appealing, particularly Tom..  The anguish that  all three,,,Isabel, Tom , and Lucy, went through was very real, very human, and heartbreaking.  I felt that Isabels suffering manifested itself in her illness.  A story of such loss,,,and only a glimmer of renewal of the soul.
5	1363219200	I would recommend this book to everyone. I was wary at the beginning but the story and author are so wonderful!
4	1363132800	This book provoked many discussions about wrong and right.  Is it only wrong if you don't get caught?  If you love someone shouldn't you help them do the right thing -even though they are suffering?  What would you do??
4	1363132800	I knew this one was going to be sad. I gave it 4 stars because I didnt love some of the things that went on.The story was pretty cute at times. It showed a timeline of a man who went ahead his better judgement. I basically cried the entire end.  Althought I think I totally wouldbe left him, Im sure it was hard for her to forgive him all those years. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to read an emotional novel on love and heartbreak,good and bad and the consequences that come with it.
4	1363132800	This book was great but sad...I highlyrecommend it to anyone looking for a good read. It is not a cheerful book and I cried towards the end. Other than that...it was good!
5	1363132800	I so enjoyed the story, the lives intertwined, and the emotional love story.  I appreciated the symbolism of the lighthouse.
5	1363132800	Interesting story the characters and plot were very well written!!!! I read this book for my book club!! I would recommend this story to friends
5	1363046400	This book was gripping on so many levels...As  the story unfolds, you begin to think of so many consequences and possible outcomes...Amazing complexity in the writing style for what I believe is the author's first published work....
5	1363046400	It's hard to read a book that you know will not end well but the author did a great job with this.  Very readable, engaging
5	1363046400	What a great book. I read it six months ago and I am still thinking about it. Very powerful story.
3	1363046400	I understand the actions of Isabel but find them unacceptable. What she did was wrong. I found it hard to enjoy the book because of this fact.
5	1363046400	This book was an excellent read....I hated to see it end.  The story was compelling and the characters well developed.  I loved this book and am recommending it to all my book reading friends.
4	1363046400	I really enjoyed this book.  The dilemma it raised was a heady one.  Interesting and thought provoking.  Highly recommended for individual or Book Club reading,
5	1363046400	What I liked is that the characters were drawn well and I also liked that there was a dilemma that required a struggle. I found myself changing sides several times about what to do. My conclusion is that nothing is clear-cut and we can&#8217;t really judge what decision someone makes unless we are confronted with the same one. Left me pondering, a good thing.
5	1362960000	This was a truly amazing book.  The last few books I read were disappointing so I was thrilled to find a book to read that I could not put down.  Even if I only had a few minutes, I reached for my ipad to get in a few pages.  I stayed up late to finish it, then was disappointed and sorry that it was over.What I liked so much was that I felt that the three main characters were so real and well-written that I could sympathize with each one.  Isabel, who longs for a child so deperately, Tom, who also longs for a child but can still see that taking someone else;s is wrong, and Hannah, who wants nothing more than to have her child back.  I found myself thinking about my own reactions and feelings and what I would do - would I really take someone else's child if I was in Isabel's position?  How would I feel to have my child restored to me only to find that she loves someone else as her mother?  And Tom, torn between wanting to make his wife happy and doing what he feels is morally right.  The writing is beautiful, the story truly gut-wrenching.  Some say the story is too sad, but the blurb clearly states what this book is about so anyone who thinks this is going to be a light-hearted, feel-good read should be fair warned.I will keep an eye out for the next novel from this very talented new author.
5	1362873600	I have recommended this book to several of my friends.  There were many situations that would prompt one to consider &#34;what would I do&#34;.  This would make a great book club book.  It would create much discussion.  I loved the characters.
3	1362873600	It's a hard choice that is made in this book, and there are difficult choices to make as the reader. I fell in love with Tom and Isabel and Lucy, and I never stopped caring about there family. As a father, I could empathize with all sides, but that doesn't mean that I liked the resolution. The last half of the book was emotionally draining in ways that I had never given thought to. I hoped for the happy family of the Lighthouse, and shed many tears at the thought of what could be found, and subsequently lost, in a lifetime.
5	1362873600	This is a well-written story of Tom and Izzy and what shaped them to be the people they were.  It is a touching story, full of emotion, and in the end it is a story that anyone might claim.
5	1362787200	The story was a moral dalema, with an ending that was unexpected.It was well paced.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this one!
4	1362787200	yes the author seemed to deliberately choose parts of the plot line to deliberately 'push people's buttons' but it kept you wondering exactly which way things would go and made for good discussion
3	1362787200	Predictable and melodramaticStory began well and after reading 2/3 of the book I began to lose interest. The ending did complete the story sufficiently.
5	1362787200	Very good readA book that you do not want to put downThis gets a good recommendationsThank you
4	1362787200	It was charming and a fun read.  It dealt very lovingly with issues of isolation and sorrow and the effects of the psyche and therefore the decisions one makes, which may be very different in a different physical situation.  Family and loss are a deep part of this story without being at all morose.  The one flaw was its predictability.  Nonetheless the ending is satisfying.
5	1362787200	My friend recommended this book to me and she was right on, I loved it.  Now, I am recommending it to all of my book friends.  It would be a good choice for a book club read.
5	1362787200	I loved this book.  Full of beautiful imagery of the ocean, people, sights sounds and smells I was transported to their world laughing and crying with every character.  I read it straight thru and now am sad they are gone.  Highly recommend the book!
5	1362787200	This was an interesting book - the story pulled you in and kept you involved.  The book was well written, with beautiful prose.  I'm still thinking about the book months after I read it, and that speaks for the quality of the story and the mark that it left on my heart and mind.
5	1362787200	Very interesting story, beautiful prose.  Heartbreaking at times but very satisfying at the conclusion.  I enjoyed this book very much as did our entire book club
5	1362700800	I love how the story goes so easily and the characters are so seamlessly brought it. I feel in love with all three main characters and I will miss them.
5	1362614400	I loved it!  It was a roller-coaster of emotions; I was torn between both sides of the conflict.  i look forward to reading more from M. L. Stedman.
5	1362614400	The Light Between Oceans is a very well written book with a hearbreaking story that holds your interest and makes you want to keep reading.
5	1362614400	This was the choice for book club this month, and otherwise it may not have been a book I would have picked up to read. I like the cover and thought it suited the story quite well.English: Lighthouse keeper on the steps of Sandy Cape Lighthouse, Fraser Island, Queensland, ca. 1907 Chimney of the superintendent's house just visible behind the lighthouse, to the right. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)I found the beginning of the book interesting, and then ran into a bit of dry patch that I have to admit I skimmed through before becoming thoroughly engrossed in the book to the point I did not want to put it down. It is a love story between Isabel (happy go lucky) and Tom (serious young man just returning from war), who meet, fall in love, and live the first years of their marriage on a remote island south of Australia. Tom is employed as the lighthouse keeper on an island called Janus. Other than the supply boat, that arrives from the mainland with supplies every three or four months, they are virtually isolated from the world.After suffering three miscarriages, a boat with a dead man and a baby mysteriously appear in the lagoon, and Isabel, while visiting the grave of her baby, hears a baby&#8217;s cry on the wind. What follows is a story about right and wrong, and how the lines are not always so clear.The story is very well written and I found the book to be an enjoyable read. It was an informative story that teaches the reader about life as a lighthouse keeper on a remote island. The book also presents the reader with a moral dilemma, which may have you swaying first one way and then the other as you contemplate the decision of the characters, that you have to come to love, will make. You will read of decisions made out of love and in then in the name of revenge, and then forgiveness. As the quotes from the book suggest, The Light Between Oceans is a thought-provoking book and I encourage you to read it.Book Quotes:&#8220;Your family&#8217;s never in your past.

5	1362614400	This made me realize what it was like to be a lighthouse keeper, and what I am looking at when I tour a lighthouse.  Loved all the twists in this book.
5	1362614400	M L Stedman&#8217;s The Light Between Oceans is an irresistible debut  and a gem of a book - part mystery, part geography lesson, part historical novel -  a joy to read and impossible to put down!  Yay!
5	1362614400	THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK, Very thought provoking with lots of info about life on an island and the effects decisions MAKE on other lives. A true love story that would make a good movie.
5	1362528000	The story and characters kept me riveted - I couldn't put the book down.  I even googled the region where this story took place.  I wanted to see what was being described.  One of the best stories I've read in a long time.
5	1362528000	I thought it was well written and the story held my interest. I could identify with male lead character, as I am a combat veteran myself. A Good love story !
5	1362528000	Life alone is fine until the apple is presented and moral issues come up. Life in Australia is very isolating but love takes care of that
5	1362528000	Great book for discussion at a book club.  A real &#34;can't put down&#34; read.  Your heart goes out to both women in the story.  I cried at the end.  I highly recommend this book!
4	1362441600	Very imaginative throughly enjoyable.  The twists and turns were interesting.  Keep me guessing.  The vocabulary unusual because of the setting.
4	1362441600	I gave this four stars because I  and my book ckub thought that the ending was either week or contrived.
4	1362441600	Hard to read at times but only because of memories of child loss.  Wonderfully written and only found 10 spelling or phrase mistakes.  I am a Virgo and have OCD so I sure pick up on those errors quickly.  Sorry about that but all in all, a very good read.
5	1362441600	Very moving, you don't want the story to end.  Characters are well developed and the story keeps you reading and reading.
5	1362441600	I so enjoyed this book.  It was a can't put down book.  Thank you.  I hope many others read it.
5	1362441600	This story opens up each persons story of yearning for somebody or something to connect too. I felt each persons joy and heartache. Couldn't put the book down
4	1362441600	I could definitely relate to the situation that led each of the characters to the choices they made, though in the extreme heat of the crisis, I found Isabel the least sympathetic.  Ultimately a pretty satisfying resolution.
5	1362355200	This was a great book and I learned more about lighthouses than I ever knew!  The characters were well developed and very interesting!
5	1362355200	Loved this book so much!!  A Must read!! Can't wait for the next M. L. Stedman book to come out!!
4	1362355200	Practically everyone in the story is in serious pain.  Tom is in agony over what he did in the military --killing people and all.  Then he is in pain for betraying his wife's secret.  Then he hurts more when he loses the daughter and sees what pain he has caused others.  Then he feels more pain when he has to endure jail for what his wife did.  He also revisits the pain of his military life.  His wife, Isabel has not one but three miscarriages, then she loses the child she thought was hers.  Hannah is in pain in two doses - first, losing her baby and then finding her at 4 and discovering her baby rejects her.  the little girl is in indescribable pain, but Stedman describes it anyway-- frequently, symbolically and effectively.  The whole village is in pain, too.  Those of German descent are loathed by those not of German descent, the grandparents are disappointed in several ways.  Finally a cancerous death concludes the story.I read this for a group discussion or I never could have made it through.  I hurt with each wave of wrenching distress, dreading the next wave of emotional assault.  Stedman describes the outer world in loving and expert detail and that world is beautiful.  She describes the inner world of the characters with the same expert detail so the reader feels the pain throughout most of the book.
3	1362355200	This book has an interesting premise and it was highly recommended to me by a book club friend.  I thought it was slow moving and predictable in many ways.  The idea of living in the middle of nowhere tending a lighthouse was interesting in and of itself, but the main plot points didn't grab me as much as I was hoping they would.
4	1362355200	This book was chosen by my book club..did not think I would enjoy it from the blurbs but downloaded the book anyway.I was quite surprised at how much I liked the book the storyline the characters flaws and all..it touched on all human emotions  ..it also had a myriad of twists and turns..and I truly enjoyed the ending..it tied up all the loose strings..Moral of the story you cannot judge a book by its cover..I read it in a day and a half ...could not put it down..and would recommend it to others..
4	1362355200	I started this book on Saturday night and was finished by Sunday afternoon. It was not a short book but because it was so well written, and the plot moved at a steady pace, I found that I could not put it down.Meet Tom Sherbourne, a veteran of WWI, who comes back to Australia to be the lightkeeper at Janus Point. This post is on a real deserted island, with only the lightkeeper present to the lighthouse illuminated each evening as a beacon/warning for ships on the outskirts of Australia. Service terms are 3 years long, with a ship coming seasonally with supplies and news from the mainland. This arrangement suits Tom well, as he does not think he can be part of the world after the horrors he has seen.He meets Isabel on the mainland prior to his first term and they become a couple. She is a young idealistic girl, over ten years younger than him who sees this as an adventure with the man she loves. Time and tragedy change her perspective and after three pregnancies that end without a live child, she is disillusioned and bitter.As she buries her third baby, she hears an infant's cry in the wind, carrying to shore from the ocean. A boat washes up with a dead man and a small infant. Rules would dictate that Tom post this immediately to the superiors but instead temptation takes over and the struggle to appease a mourning wife becomes paramount as he tries to save those he loves.This is only the beginning of a saga that continues with choices continually made and the ramifications that ensue. Many lives are touched by these rash decisions. What a great read!
4	1362355200	Stedman does a fine job of enabling the reader to experience both sides of the conflict. Well-written and engaging. A quick read.
4	1362268800	Beautifully written. Especially loved seeing the story from each of the main characters point of view. Very sad though. As in real life, often there aren't winners and losers; everyone had so much to lose, and lose they all did.
4	1362268800	It made you think what would you do in that situation but it was somewhat predictable.  Reasonable for book club.
5	1362268800	This book is a great read for anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, or simply wanting a great story about the power of love and the longing we have for a child.
5	1362268800	I couldn't put this book down. It was well written and definitely pulled on the heart strings. It made me wonder about what lengths I would go to in order to keep a found baby.
5	1362182400	I would recommend Light Between Oceans to anyone who doesn't want to be ashamed  for their books to be on the coffee table.  The visual imagery immediately grabbed and held my attention.  While there are  struggles common to all humans, they are written in such a way that the language and situations  do not offend, but did bring me to tears as if I was one of the characters.
5	1362182400	A  book full of what ifs. Tremendously well written...blurs the lines. Our book group discussed the repercussions of each character's choices for hours. We loved it and highly recommend this novel.
5	1362182400	What a ride between right and wrong from good people on both sides of right and wrong. The author did a fantastic job of making the reader see both sides. Loved it.
5	1362182400	This is a great story that holds your attention all the way to the end.  Loved all the characters and truly didn't know how this story would end until it was over.
4	1362182400	The story and characters catch your attention.  You can feel with them in their struggles. It touches on the struggle one can have with doing what is right for all, not just an individual. It shows how loss and love can affect one's behavior.
3	1362182400	Good character development and setting, but the ending seemed forced.  Would enjoy reading a prequel about Tom's experience in WWI.
4	1362096000	This novel was recommended to me  by a friend; I truly enjoyed it, and it definitely held my interest.  I felt I learned the role of a lighthouse keeper while agonizing over the plot.  The conclusion was satisfying.
4	1362009600	Tom and Isabella are immensely likable characters, deeply in love and devoted to the other. Their world on a remote island where Tom is the lighthouse-keeper suits Tom's need for solitude and certainty after his lonely childhood and horrific war experiences. Isabella loves Tom and his world on the island fascinates and draws her in. All they want is a child to make their lives complete but Isabella's repeated miscarriages and a stillbirth crush her spirit, causing her to doubt what had been a life of supreme confidence. When a small boat with a dead man and a live infant crashes onto the island, Isabella sees the hand of God  and takes the baby as her own. Tom, a pessimist or realist by nature, cannot accept this and, although baby Lucy becomes part of his heart, he feels a moral imperative to  right what he perceives as a terrible wrong. The story is marvelous, set in the unfamiliar settings of a small town at the end of Australia and the island, and the characters wonderfully drawn and complex. There may be wrongs committed by the main characters but I am still torn as to whether it could or should have been made right.
5	1362009600	No let down for this series.  Be sure to start with the first book.  The characters are so realistic and I am looking forward to following more books.
4	1362009600	The Light Between Oceans is a beautifully written book. At first I thought this would be a TV mini series but the physical descriptions were so lovely that I soon was hooked. The ending was a bit predictable but the moral dilemmas were quite real.
5	1362009600	This was an amazing book! The characters were so well developed and reacted to situations within character. I came to really like each one and to follow them through their maze of reactions and consequences emotionally.  I would highly recommend this book.
5	1362009600	This is my first time reading a book by this author.  I am a big reader and not many books compare to The Light Between Oceans.  The author told his story beautifully.  I will recommend it to all my friends.
4	1361923200	This was a great read..........I could feel for all of the characters.  I did not anticipate such an emotional ending :)
5	1361923200	The story was riveting and complex.  The author spun a very complex tale and was very descriptive of the situation with which the characters were confronted.
4	1361923200	This author is one of the most elegantly descriptive authors I have every read. Her prose flows with a kind of beauty that causes you to pause and read it and second and third time.Excellent book and will look forward to her next work.
5	1361923200	I couldn't  put this one down. The setting was magical the story intriguing.  I had to turn each page to see how each new development would be handled by this little post WWI community.  A gripping story. I can't wait till this author writes a new tale.
3	1361923200	This story held my attention throughout. A complicated plot that pulls at you and makes you wonder what you might do given the circumstances.
4	1361923200	I enjoyed the book.  I like the emotional turmoil the couple goes through.  Makes you wonder if they did the right thing.Good character studies.
4	1361923200	actually enjoyed the author's style.  makes the premise believeable and I found myself pulled into the story.I read it while at the shore, oddly enough.
5	1361923200	There are so many layers in this story...our book club loved it and enjoyed the discussion.  I highly recommend it, especially if you can talk to another reaqder about it.
5	1361923200	This is one of those books that once you start reading you don't want to put it down. Excellent and believable characters come to life with their demons, flaws and passions. I would recommend this book to a variety of people because it covers romance and intrigue and everything in between.
5	1361923200	This truly is one of the best books I've ever read.  It was a pleasure to read Ms. Stedman&#8217;s lovely turns of phrase, and I was deeply moved by her poignant exploration of the frailties of humankind. I whole-heartedly recommend the book.
5	1361836800	I loved the story, the questions it provoked and the characters.  (A real &#34;what would you do?&#34; story). I'm looking forward to another novel by this author.
5	1361836800	Awesome book. As a reader I felt like I was going through the emotions with the characters. Beautifully written, highly recommended!
3	1361836800	Well written with the times and characters artfully described and well developed but the story is very slow to develop
2	1361836800	I thought I could read this book. It is clearly well written and readable. But once the couple began making fateful decisions for the baby that came to the island in a boat with a dead man, I began to feel really uncomfortable with their decision making. It was clear to me that this was going to be a tragedy and i was only 1/5th of the way through the book. So I had to stop and i did.
4	1361836800	Read this book for book club & enjoyed it, it kept my interest. Was glad at how the author ended it.
5	1361836800	It was a slow start but once you get into it its hard to put down.Loved it even thou it was very sad.
5	1361750400	I am not one for overly enthusiastic reviews, and I am difficult to please when it comes to novels.  This story pulled me in from the first chapter (yes, I did the free Kindle preview) and I found myself sneaking off to read it when I was supposed to be doing other things.  Awesome debut work.
1	1361750400	I was very optimistic about this book as it look like an interesting storyline. It turned out to be very simple and predictable. The pages went on and on,but the story never got anywhere. It had way too much bad drama and not enough substance. Very boring overall. Reading it was a waste of time
5	1361750400	This is an amazing story... As I read I realized it is the age old dilemma where nothing can be just black and white, but everything is gray because right and wrong are so intertwined that one has no idea where to begin the separation of the two.  I just finished this book and have far too many thoughts swirling around in my mind to say much else at this time. There is much to ponder!
5	1361750400	A captivating page turner! Well written. Loved the characters...it was hard for me to stop thinking of this story as I read it and now after. I would love to see this made into a movie! Very satisfying read.  Can't wait to discuss at my book club.
3	1361750400	I keep relying on heavily rated reviews to order my next book and it keeps failing me. The book was fine, easy to read, with a few heartfelt moments. However, it dragged on in areas it didn't need to and didn't do the best job for character development.
5	1361664000	So inspiring - the love one has for spouse and child is undeniable and indescribable but tis book captures its very essence.
4	1361664000	Who has ever experienced living in a light house? I think the portrayal is interesting and draws the reader into the isolation and the complexities of family life in that setting. The story surrounding this family is intriguing and disconcerting but with a satisfying conclusion.
4	1361664000	This book  is bittersweet. A tear jerker to be sure, but worth it for the exquisite tale of never ending love and the sacrifices  made for loved ones.
5	1361664000	I really loved this story!  I couldn't put it down.  As a mother, I can't imagine what this woman went through, but I don't think I would have done it any differently.
4	1361664000	This is an interesting story and the pace really carries you along. The plot can get predictable but there are twists that keep you off balance.Not a big fan of babies, so the subject for me got irritating, but it is a good book.
5	1361664000	I would recommend this book to people who like interesting people studies. I enjoyed the beginning, middle, and end of this book. I liked everyone and wanted a happy ending for them all even though I didn't see how it could happen. I read a lot of novels that leave me baffled or unhappy with the ending. I didn't feel that way with this book. I really felt with these folks and shed a few tears at the end.
5	1361664000	I loved this book and will discuss it with our book club in June.  II could not put it down once I got into it
4	1361664000	A lovely love story about a couple who made the wrong choice even though it felt so right. It wadvavgood reminder to forgive and move on.
4	1361664000	This is a touching story that makes you think about what you would have done in the same situation and you can identify with why the various characters do or think the way they do.
5	1361664000	Stedman's novel includes everything that pleases me as a reader: three-dimensional characters, wonderful descriptions of the setting(s), an intriguing plot, and a somewhat satisfying ending.  At the end of the novel, however, I really wanted Hannah to be more grateful for the early year's of Grace's life since without the couple who lovingly raised her as their own, (Lucy) Grace may not have become the beautiful woman she became.  (The novel somewhat depicts King Solomon's dilemma involving the two women who both claimed the same child.)
5	1361664000	Very moving! Beautifully written and great story. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Best book I have read in a while.
4	1361664000	It kept my interest the whole time.  It presents an interesting moral dilemma, and I could hardly wait to get back to it..
4	1361664000	I gave it four out of five but I would have given it 4 and a half if I could have.  This story is written so beautifully from the beginning to the very end.  It is hard to put down and I think anyone would enjoy it.
5	1361664000	Wonderful story that will leave you wondering what you would do but also, what was the right thing to do.
4	1361577600	The book starts a bit slow and the self reflections of Tom can be slightly boring.  The book really picks up about 1/4 through and then the tears and emotions flow.  Well worth sticking through the start!
5	1361577600	Now this was a good read. Loved the setting and loved the characters. Drew me into the story from the first page. I couldn't put it down. Love that!!!
4	1361577600	The premise of the story was very intriguing and I was never sure how it should end or how it did end. All the haracters were very sympathetic
5	1361577600	Very good book and I have suggested my husband read.  The story was well written and had something for everyone.
4	1361577600	Really enjoyed this book, beautifully written. Enjoyed having a sneak peak into the life of a lighthouse keeper. Loved both of the main characters but was a little disappointed with the ending.
5	1361577600	The author transports you to another world, the trademark of a good book for me. I was pulled into the story quickly. I found it to be a page turner. It is the kind of book that provokes thought as you journey with the characters. It is the kind of book that sticks in your brain long after you finish it.
5	1361577600	Extremely well written. Emotional and hypnotic.  Stedman is a natural and wonderfully talented writer. It is refreshing to see such talented writing.
5	1361577600	Avery well written story.  It was compelling and sad.  The author did a wonderful job with foreshadowing and letting us into the minds of the main characters.
4	1361577600	It is a little slow at the beginning, but when it begins to get interesting, I couldn't put it down.  It is an excellent book club selection: topics are loyalty, love, truth and honesty, nurture vs nature, friendship, and more.  The main character Tom is someone you want to &#34;root&#34; for because of his sincerity, his passion for the lighthouse, and his constant and deep love for Isabelle.  It is a must-read.
4	1361577600	Interesting story with excellent characterizations.  The book took a bit of time getting into but once hooked, I couldn't put it down.  All the characters felt 'real' and all the emotions and reactions to events made sense.
5	1361491200	I keep reflecting on this book.  It is thoughtful and has some surprises. It really made me think about my morals and values.
5	1361491200	I was astounded that the Light Between Oceans was M. L. Stedman's first novel.  The writing style is truly wonderful...you can picture in your mind's eye Janus Rock, and the rough and beautiful surroundings &#34;between the two oceans&#34; on Western Australia.  The storyline is riveting and a true page turner....enjoy!
5	1361491200	I loved reading the book.  I was pulling for one side but could see the point of view of the other side as well.  A real tear jerker.
5	1361491200	One of the best book I have read in ages!!  Masterfully written with a superb plot.  This is a great read!!
4	1361491200	I enjoyed this story, but it didn't keep me rivited to the book.  I think it tended to &#34;drag&#34; and be repetitive at times.
4	1361491200	The story at the end really makes this book worth reading through the slow beginning. Stick with it, it will be worth it.
3	1361404800	Liked it, but cheesy - or should it be, cheesy, but liked it? Either way, it's true. The plot felt implausable to me, and I felt like there were a lot of cliches (guy struggling with memory of war, epilogue that takes place in the future, just to name a few), but it was entertaining - I read the second half all together in a few hours. Not a masterpiece, but held my attention.
5	1361404800	I just joined a book club and The Light Between Oceans was the title of the book given to read.I don't know if the author has written anything else, but it was terrific book and I enjoyed it.Hope there's another one soon.
5	1361404800	WONDERFUL READ.  SORRY TO FINISH. HAD TO GO BACK  AND REREAD THE MOST POIGNANT PARTS.  HOPE TO HAVE MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR.
5	1361404800	What a wonderful written book.  It was a very heartwarming story about a husband and wife and a child and a lighthouse..  Tissues were needed when reading this book.  I just loved it and would recommend it highly.
5	1361404800	This is a page turner, and I read into the wee hours of the night to find out the ending-something I haven't done in many years...Everyone in our bookclub loved it!
2	1361404800	A friend recommended this book and it was a best seller so I was looking forward to reading it.  I was, however, very disappointed and had a love/hate feeling about this book.  I kept reading because I wanted to know what happened, but I thought the writing was poor.  I was amazed that there were some glaring grammar errors in this best seller.  I was also jangled by the change in tenses in the story telling.  I couldn't quite believe that the characters would really do the things they did, and the story dragged just before the ending.
5	1361404800	I loved this book and could not stop thinking about it for weeks after I finished it. It is so sad. It justreally made you think about how a situation could turn into an innocent crime, for love. I highly recommend this to all types of readers!
5	1361404800	Another book I would highly recommend.  Was very sad but couldn't put it down.  Definitely my kind of book. Most women would enjoy it..
4	1361404800	Our bookclub choose this book.  We have yet to discuss it, but I think it will make a good discussion piece.The story was different and very descriptive.
4	1361404800	Excellent writing. A story of moral dilemmas...nothing is black and white...only shades of grey. A decision is made. The result of that decision effects many people and changes many lives.
5	1361404800	If I use any other adjectives to describe this book, it will probably give too much away, and since I believe my enjoyment of the book had a lot to do with the fact that I didn't know anything about the story, I will just say that is was very well-written, had great characters and I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
4	1361404800	The book was easy read, made you think &#34; what would I do&#34;Characters were real, and you could feel their emoitions.
5	1361318400	an enjoyable read. Nice to find a book that consumes your mind...has you question what you would do in the (proposed) situation.
5	1361318400	this was a good story. quick & easy reading. I liked the ending even if it was sad. The library had 113 waiting to read this book.
1	1361318400	I was totally suckered by all the rave reviews of this book.  God Lord, it's so unbelievably sappy that I'm embarrassed to admit that I actually read it.  Stylistically it appears to have been written by a precocious eighth grader.  The overblown language is downright laughable if one can stop wretching.  "The pillowcase is wet with tears.  A scythe of moon hangs in the window, too feeble to light even it's own path through the sky."  Gag!
5	1361232000	I really liked this book.  The story was lovely, tragic and chilling.  I still can't get the characters out of my mind.
4	1361232000	Very interesting choices and challenges.....author has ability to get the reader involved with the surroundings as well asthe moral conflict......would want to read more by this author......
4	1361232000	This is a mystery of a different kind. It is a story of a couple who make choices that alter not only their lives, but the lives of many others. It deals with morals and ethics verses needs and wants. It is a story of isolation, desperation, love and tragedy.
5	1361232000	I knew nothing about lighthouses, so that alone was intriguing.  What can I say about these characters? Ms Stedman slowly peels away layer after layer of each character: each one coming together in a final heartbreaking decision. I read every word, as I didn't want to miss any detail. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and thought about it after I finished it. It is definitely one of my favorites.
4	1361232000	The scope of the story was very intriging and wonderful descriptions of life during this time. I became very vested in the lives of the people and tried to imagine how things would be resolved.
5	1361232000	Enjoyed this book a lot ..the ending was terrific!!! Highly recommend...us readers had a lot to think about..Right or wrong!!
5	1361232000	This is a a beautifully written story of love, lies and loss.  Who knew loving a tiny baby could cause a ripple to grow...and who knew that ripple would tear apart so many lives.  To paraphrase 'to forgive only takes once, to resent you must do it every day'.
4	1361145600	Enjoyed this book, but sad subject matter.  Nevertheless, i found it original, interesting and beautifully written.  Great for book club discussion.
5	1361145600	Read it for our book club. Couldn't put it down. A great discussion about choices you make in your life whether its right or wrong.
4	1361145600	The setting (a lighthouse off the coast of Australia) is a great background for the tale that presents a difficult choice that faces the protagonists - how do they react to their discovery of a baby washed up on their tiny island?
5	1361145600	This book was a page turner.  It shows how human emotions can lead to major problems.  Love and heartbreak sometimes go hand and hand.
5	1361145600	this book was written so well and the story line so interesting and I alsofound that I learned a lot about people surviving
5	1361145600	That's all.  Beautiful.  Brilliant and sad and joyful and beautiful.  One of those books where taking the time to marvel at a sentence or a scene doesn't detract from the forward rush of the narrative.  A slow-moving book that reads quickly.  Deserves all the honors it's received.
4	1361145600	I like the premise of the book. I won't be a spoiler. The ending is hard but thoughtful. I liked the characters.
4	1361145600	From the moment the boat drifted into the lighthouse, you knew there was problems ahead  A very emotionally charged story that had to bring some tears to your eyes. Lucy's love for &#34;her&#34; new baby was real and you felt her connection and angst at the same time. Tom did what his heart told him to. But that being said, the author kept you involved and wanting to read more and more.  I thought she wrote an excellent book and look forward to her next.
3	1361145600	Story was good but I didn't care for her style of writing, skips over important events with a backward glance. Would not buy another novel by her.
4	1361145600	I really liked this book.  It was a change from all of the mystery/espionage books I read.  It had some very sad parts but it was very easy to relate to the characters.  Describing the lighthouse and the life of a keeper was very interesting.
4	1361145600	Lively discussion in bookclub.  Ethics/morals/ vs needs/wants...always seems to provoke deep emotions...some might not want to go there...i say take the plunge
5	1361145600	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I couldn't wait to pick it up each day and was so sorry when it ended. It gets my highest recommendation!
4	1361059200	I didn't expect so much of this book as I received.  Very good read with some unexpected surprises.  Liked it a lot.
5	1361059200	A must read book that will stay with you forever. Two oceans two ways to go. The choices we make carves the shape of the person we become.
4	1360972800	This book was chosen by our book club and should make for great discussion. The characters and the struggles they face are very relatable.
5	1360972800	Beautifully told story of difficult choices and their consequences. I loved reading about the light and the keeper's affection for and fidelity to it.  A sad story all around, but compelling - so many small things that made me feel the joy and pain of their love for this child.
5	1360972800	Enjoyed this book . Not your everyday love story.  About people making choices out of love without thoroughly thinking of the consequences .
5	1360972800	My wife can't stop talking about this book. She was impressed with the story (she told me the gist of it and it is a very clever premise) and how beautifully it was written. It even brought tears to her eyes. This book was for her book club, and everyone loved it. She got this for her Kindle, but one of the book club members lent her hard copy for my wife's elderly mother to read who is an avid reader. She finished it in a day - couldn't put it down!
5	1360972800	I just finished reading this book in one day. I don't want to give anything away so I will just say its very worth reading
3	1360886400	It was slow moving, but a good storyline and I was satisfied with the resolution. Lots of unnecessary information dragged it out a bit.
5	1360886400	Loved the story from the very beginning.  Characters are very real and held my interest throughout. Highly recommend this book.
5	1360886400	Understanding, forgiveness and love are keys to this book.  Anger and hatred consume far more energy than forgiveness or forgetting.
5	1360800000	The light between oceans was such a beautiful book! The writing was just amazing. A story about love and loss and what our choices will do to others.Tom and Isabel run a lighthouse and when a dead man in a boat shows up there is also a baby after having a few miscarriage's Isabel talks Tom into not telling anyone and keeping the baby since no one knew she had lost her last baby anyway. They eventually find out what this choice has done to other people. They live isolated on an island I can imagine it was easy to forgot there was a world outside of theirs.If you don't like "sad", "depressing" books this is not for you. I don't like saying sad and depressing because I found this book so touching and wonderful but I can see how some people would feel like that because this isn't a happy full of rainbows book. This is a story that will stay with you long after you close that last page. You will probably need tissues so keep them handy.Loved, loved this book!
5	1360800000	This is a beautifully written book that explores many layers of emotion, perception and morality. I enjoyed the book because of all the layers and how there was never one simple solution nor one &#34;right' path to follow. It was easy to identify with characters and to imagine their dilemas.
4	1360713600	I learned quite a bit about lighthouses and some of the things required of a lighthouse keeper, which was very interesting.  I also learned a little about Australia but most of all, I learned about the main characters in this book.  I enjoyed this book -- but because of the various deceptions of the characters, it oftentimes made for quite a tense read.
4	1360713600	If you like the mixture above, I do too! However, this book is more than sad. It's &#34;ugly-face cry, shouldn't read in public, need to watch a sit-com after finishing to be pulled from the depths of depression&#34; sad. I'm just sayin'...
4	1360713600	It was very spell binding.  It brought out a lot of emotions in me.  Very well written.  I would definately read more of ML Stedman's books
5	1360713600	This book was very well written and kept me interested all the way through it. Warning though, it is a sad book, so don't read it if you want something uplifting.
5	1360713600	I thoroughly enjoyed this book....I loved the characters and the story line.  I held my interest from beginning to end.
5	1360713600	A beautifully written story about chance, choices, and the consequences thereof.  A true story of a mother's love for husband and child.
5	1360713600	This book was filled with surprises. Fate twisting and turning. A study in moral dilemmas spurned from desperation and abiding love. The characters were real for me; people I would have liked to know.
5	1360627200	There is so much to learn about lightkeeping in this novel.  Having the courage to live positively with regrets was the  theme  All the characters had many layers to ponder. I will not forget this story. It reminded me of The Notebook.
5	1360627200	I'm attending book club tonight to discuss The Light Between Oceans and I can't wait to hear what the other members have to say!  We're all Moms and I know there are going to be some very different points of view!  I loved the book; what a moral conundrum!!!
5	1360627200	This is a beautifully written and moving story of two people who meet shortly after the end of World War I.  The book details the story of their life together in Austrailia.  Early in their lives they make one tragic mistake for which they will pay a price and which will haunt them for the rest of their lives.  The characters in the book are are so vivid they come alive on the page.  And the writing is exquisite.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Highly recommend it.
4	1360627200	The store seems to be slow in staruing, but it is hau7ntingly beautiful and will not leave you when you finish the book
4	1360627200	I really did enjoy this book.  I think I read it in two days.  The writer did an excellent job discribing the characters.  It was believalbe to a point.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5	1360627200	This is one of the better books I have read lately.  Well written, entertaining, and thoughtful.  It is a book you will remember for quite a long time.
5	1360627200	Couldn't put it down and finished it quickly.  The story had so many hidden turns it made me see the story on different levels. I probably read more into it but that was what made it even better.
3	1360627200	The story is a good one, moral questions with no easy answers.  However, I feel that more background should have been provided, especially on Hannah!
5	1360627200	I've read the first few chapters, and I like the book very much.  I have no reason to think that this will not be a good read.  I like the author so far and will look for other books by M. L. Stedman.
5	1360540800	Such a well written book with a great plot.  It really makes you think about what you would go through for your loved ones.
5	1360540800	The Light Between Oceans is truly a love story about good people who make poor decisions, however, the strength of their love prevails!
4	1360540800	Because of a serious wrong choice this turned into a very sad tale.  Thankfully recompense is made in the end.
3	1360540800	IT was a well written book and I did like it OK but it was  just too sad for me.
4	1360540800	This is the first book in a long time that kept me going...to the end. I found it interesting to learn about the lighthouse.
5	1360454400	I read The Light Between Oceans for my book club and loved it.  It was very different from most books I read.  I hate to spoil an ending, but I cried for a full 5 minutes.
5	1360454400	I loved this book. It explores the wide ramifications of one small act of kindness like ripples in a pond. The description of the lighthouse island is so well done I felt I could go there and know where everything was. The characters are well drawn and the joys and the tensions in each one of the main ones are excruciatingly beautiful. Highly recommended.
4	1360454400	I liked the writing and story line very much. It was a fast read but I was involved with the characters.
5	1360454400	The suthor captured my interest immediately with the story and sustained it throughout the book.  The development of the characters was well done.  The style of writing was excellent.  The story was unique in some ways, but not unlike real life.  It brought out the pain of loss and the circumstances in which one would make decisions that seem wrong to others at first glance.  Very, very well done.
3	1360454400	Even though the subject matter of the book should have tugged at my heart strings, it just fell short for some reason. The plot felt forced.
5	1360454400	I loved how the author took the story to so many levels of love. The love between husband and wife, mother and child, father and child, grandparent, aunt, sister, friend, even the love of duty and self. Each different but deeply loved.
4	1360454400	Very moving story.  Read it for  book club and seems to be very popular on this circuit.  I would recommend it.
5	1360454400	This is a story with a moral dilemma! Wow, what do you do when whatever you do causes hurt beyond belief?
3	1360454400	This was a book club selection.  It took me a long time to read it because it was a very slow starting book.  By the middle and end my interest was up and I was able to finish this book.
5	1360368000	Found it hard to put down the book like the ocean just rolled along and I read on to find out what happened next. Sad ending but true to life, life goes on, thanks really enjoyed this book
5	1360368000	This book had a fascinating, thought-provoking plot, interesting characters, and a writing style that keeps your nose in the book.
4	1360368000	A good story but a bit predictable.  The characters should have been developed more to truly understand where they came from.
4	1360368000	I liked it would have liked it to have a different ending. If Isabel could have seen Lucy again before she died
5	1360368000	Moving story about how small the world can be and how one choice can change multiple lives forever.  Great book club choice - lots of material to discuss.
5	1360368000	This is a beautiful story with love, justice and compassion. I loved this book. No four letter words! I wish there were more books of this caliber.
5	1360281600	The Light Between Oceans covered so many real-life issues and the author provided language that sustained the reader's interest -- theme, characters, setting were all engaging.
4	1360281600	Enjoyed this, kept me turning the pages. The site is asking for more words, I think I've given enough of my time.
5	1360281600	This book was such a great story. Many twists and turns for Izzy and Tom! A story of loving a spouse, a child and dealing with the many ups and downs life throws at us. I had a Kleenex box close at hand for the final chapter. Rarely, does a book make me cry but this book did!  Tears not only of sadness, but tears of joy also.
3	1360281600	Simple and predictable, but its a good story and its nicely written. Good for a quick read, but have no great expectations
5	1360281600	It is a wonderful book, well written and always with the surprise factor present.I am a lighthouse lover and in this book you can almost feel what it was like to be a lighthouse keeper, the honor it meant.I fully recommend it!!
4	1360195200	Beautifully written. Heartbreaking moral dilemma, thought provoking. Looking forward to more from this author! I loved the Whispersync also, made is very convenient.
5	1360195200	The Light Between Oceans.Well written book.  Tough moral dilema for Tom.  Almost like Sophies' Choice. Emotionally charged and tention filled.
5	1360195200	A sweet, sometimes very wrenching, story about love, loss, and forgiveness. Having lost a child, I could feel Izzy' s and Hannah's pain and the great wide emptiness of the hole in the heart that can never be filled. Tom, Izzy, Hannah, and Lucy-Grace are beautifully drawn characters and the author's wisdom of the delights and pains of life that shape us into who we become had me highlighting many passages for later contemplation.
4	1360195200	This was an easy read but interesting. Although set in Australia it is not about Australia specifically. It made me reflect on the many forms of parenting and that the type of parenting one has affects but does not determine one's life course.
5	1360195200	This book let you feel what it's like to love  and want a child. Made me cry the hard cry many times.
4	1360195200	I enjoyed reading the The Light Between Oceans although the plot was predictable. I would probably not read it again.
4	1360108800	I liked this book very much. The writing style was very good and the character development excellent. The story is sad and essentially a no win situation for the main character. But this is life, and I think it is interesting how the main character deals with his choices, morality, and eventually lives with his consequences. I know I put myself if his shoes throughout the whole book and I think that is the point of the book, to explore within yourself what you would do with these extreme circumstances and what choices you would make.The ending was satisfying though which I did appreciate.
5	1360108800	That book was more then great, I want more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't like how it ended but then, all books can't have happy endings.
3	1360108800	The reading was kind of strange and just didn't keep my attention. I ordered it by mistake, so I felt I had to read it. ;-)
5	1360108800	Very moving book-made me see all sides to the story.  Loved the author's writing style as well.  I could feel the ocean and the remoteness of the setting along with the feelings of the characters.
4	1360108800	&#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34; is difficult to rate, I really liked it AND it was amazing, but at the same time, the subject manner is so delicate that I felt myself torn over what was right vs wrong. My stomach turned constantly, my heart heavy, and my conscience questioned what I truly believed. At times I was team Tom and other times I was team Isabel. But I loved them both, I found them realistic and adored their love and their lives while feeling at the end like maybe I only knew a small bit of them. I suggest you read this novel, it's easy to get into, hard to put down, and will allow you to think about some serious questions. Plus it takes place in Australia which made it even better.
5	1360108800	This is a book club selection for one of my book groups and I did not know what to expect. The story was wonderfully complex and artfully told. This should provide for a lively book club discussion.
5	1360108800	The book was well written, the plot was compelling, the characters 3-dimensional. The pace kept me turning the pages wanting to know how everything gets resolved. The time frame of the book was post-WWI and the author did an excellent job of creating a certain time and place that helped underscore the motivations behind the charactes actions. The author did not give into sentimentality at the end which I think lifts the book into the 5 star category.
5	1360108800	In parts this was difficult to read as I felt I was reliving parts of my own life/past.  But, it is well worth the read and the touching of the heart...
4	1360108800	I liked the book. Extremely sad because of the bad choices the couple made,but at the same time very sweet.Would have liked the woman in the story to have lived to see the grown woman the beloved child had become,but authors seem to think there should some kind of punishment even when there was no intended harm.
4	1360108800	loved the history, love, reality, a beautiful story.  A nice get away book.  I really enjoyed everything about this book.
4	1360108800	This was a good story. A little slow in the beginning but I hung in there. I would recommend this book to other book clubs.
4	1360022400	Book held my interest reading to find what the future holds for them.  Quick reading, interesting time frame and memorable characters.
4	1360022400	This was a wonderful exploration of two isolated lives and their ambivalent relationship. Raising the shipwreced baby created a fascinating moral dilemma. The only reason I didn't give a five star rating was that I felt the end weak in terms of resolution to a traumatic experiene.
5	1360022400	There's no telling how or why a book or a story appeals to us. But my heart has not been touched or held by a book in this way since reading Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany" as a young man. The love, the loss, the tragedy, and again the love are so compellingly shared in this story. Read it if you want your heart touched similarly.
5	1360022400	What a well written, thought provoking book!  The writer so effectively draws you into both sides of the story, with no clear right or wrong character. This is a well-crafted, unusual story that truly grips the reader, especially anyone who has had a child. Great book club material, I can't wait to discuss it!
5	1360022400	I was very interested in this book from beginning to end.  I had difficulty putting it down and the story flowed so well and the concept was so different and intriguing to me.  I have recommended it to many of my friends.
5	1360022400	I loved this book even though it was a heartbreaking story.  Every character was a good person caught up in sad circumstances trying to do the best they could.  But there was no way to resolve the situation happily.  I call this book a &#34;page turner&#34; because I just could not predict how it would end.  It did have a satisfactory if not happy conclusion.
5	1360022400	My book club is reading this book so it was required.  The prose is lyrical and the story is compelling.  There are twists, turns, and surprises everywhere.  The characters are clearly and compassionately drawn and the period is well defined.  Great book!
5	1359936000	Excellent read. Well-written and engrossing. A modern Soloman's rendition of the 2 mothers--one baby.Keep a hankerchief close by! Loved it.
5	1359936000	This book was recommended to my book club as a great discussion book.  It starts out slow (too much detail about lighthousekeeping) but then takes off.  I'm really looking forward to discussing with my group.
3	1359936000	It got better as it went , not great but ok. Never thought about who lives in a light house before.
5	1359936000	I read this book as a result of my book club choosing it.  We have a month to read it, however once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  I felt such a part of the character lives and immersed myself into their little island. Make sure you have tissues handy- I had a hard time reading the end of the story because I couldn't see through my tears!  Well written and true to life - you don't always get to live the life you imagined and hoped for but you persevere none the less.
5	1359936000	The Light Between Oceans by ML Stedman, a vey good book.  Not one tht would keep me glued to it, but did enjoy it.
5	1359936000	A lovely book exploring the depths of love of a parent for a child, of two people for each other, and the consequences of their choices.  Beautifully written, this novel stays with you long after you finish it.
5	1359936000	This is a story of how far one will go for the love of one's child.....and the love of one's spouse.  It's amazing how one act of stupidity and cruelty can lead to the tragic events in the book.  It starts out slow, but this is the type of book you can't put down even though it's way past bedtime.  I can see this book being made into a movie.  It would be up there with "The Notebook".  I loved it.
5	1359936000	As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary novel.  Set in Australia in the late 1800's it depicts characters who are flawed but had the best of intentions.  I was continually surprised by the character development and the story line.  Thanks to ML Stedman!
5	1359936000	Well written making the reader feel as though he/she were right there.  Well described emotions made one understand decisions made even though those decisions were faulty.Thoroughly enjoyable reading encompassing the &#34;human condition &#34; so very well.
5	1359936000	A very moving novel . We learn of a subject not common, like the operation of a lighthouse and the power of the oceans. It is considered historical so it must have value in that sense to Australians. It is very enjoyable.
4	1359936000	Good character development and examples of how individual decisions can have far reaching consequences. Good read and good material for discussion.
4	1359936000	Oh no they didn't!  That was my first reaction when Tom and Isabel decided to keep the found baby as their own.  I was intrigued and kept reading till I finished it.  Took me about three days.  Enjoyed it very much.  Moral:  Crime does not pay!
4	1359849600	It's a book that I'll never forget.  Had trouble finishing it because I was crying so much that I couldn't read.
4	1359849600	&#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34; is the first book I read on my new Kindle.  It was most enjoyable and I would recommend it to others.  The story provides an important message about honesty.
5	1359849600	I really enjoyed reading this novel it got you in the first few pages and you care about theTom and Isabel and Lucy. Stedman makes you think about the moral legal and emotional choices we make in our lives !Good read
5	1359849600	Being a lighthouse collector I loved how this book gave the everyday workings of living on alighthouse.  The story was excellent and held my interest from cover to cover. I am going tolook for more books by ML Stedman.
5	1359849600	We all make mistakes in our lives.  But when we practice to deceive, it inevitably results in many lives being torn apart.
4	1359849600	Although the reader can anticipate  what will ultimately happen it is nonetheless heart rending. I think the ending was a little weak for such a powerfully written story.
5	1359849600	This is a wonderful book about the choice that a couple must make and how this choice changes their lives and the lives of people around them.
3	1359849600	I wanted to read to the end, but didn't think it was a great  book. Might recommend for a casual read.
5	1359849600	WONDERFUL story. Very well written. Makes you think. Makes you cry. I know what I would have done. What would you do?
5	1359763200	This is one of the best books I've read in the past 6 months -- so good that I had to enter this 5 star review. The characters were well developed; so, it was easy to get involved with their stories. Moreover, although the book was sad, I didn't think it had a bleak ending; it had more of a bittersweet ending. Overall, it was a very moving book. I even cried when I read Tom's note to Isabel.
4	1359763200	I really enjoyed this book. Very good character development. It makes me think about the choices I have made in my life and the ones I'm making now.
5	1359763200	A real Page turner. A  Fast read with interesting characters.  ILove  it and would recommend  it to my friends.
5	1359763200	I read this in a single day, fully immersed in their world. The emotions totally raw and consuming consuming for me as a mother.  So beautifully done,I just loved it.
5	1359763200	I loved this book.  I got fully invested in Isabel and Tom and the happiness and sadness of their story.  It isn't often a story touches me so deeply that I cried at the end.Bravo to M.L. Stedman on her debut novel. I shall look for novels from her in the future.
5	1359676800	The light between oceans is a novel about love, duty,betrayal,and forgiveness at it's rawest form. M.L Stedman brought froth her characters with such clarity that one can relate to them. It is a tale of lives coming together, and torn apart because of happiness and grief. It tests the readers ethetics, as well as their compassion. It is a tragedy well written, leaving the reader as if they been through an emotional roller coaster.
5	1359676800	Conflict and strife are rampant throughout the story keeping a reader on the edge of his/her seat. Right up until the last I could not see where the author would take me next. No character is really guilty while at the same time life is not fair to any character either. A well organized story and obviously knew her topic well.Stedman accomplishes all the artistic arts an author seeks to accomplish in a book. I recommend it to any adult reader.Jane Cheek
5	1359676800	The story was very engaging and interesting and the ending stayed in my thoughts for days after I finished the book.
4	1359676800	This new novel was reviewed in every magazine and newspaper that I read.  I was looking forward to recieving it on my Kindle.  I became bored with it because the plot didn't move along fast enough for me so I ended up taking a long time to read it.
5	1359676800	This book made me terribly sad and hopeful at the same time.  A reaffirmation of the power of love and the human spirit.5 stars
4	1359590400	Well written, good story, thought provoking.  It kept me going, wondering what was going to happen.  Some of the character traits bothered me some, just because I didn't agree with how they handled the situation.  But that leads to good discussion of the issues involved.
5	1359590400	The Light Between Oceans touched on all my emotions.  It was incredibly moving and left me crying at the end.There was much joy in the union of two wonderful people... awe as their life began to unfold while care taking a lighthouse...grief in their loses...disappointment for some of their decisions...compassion for the lives around them.
5	1359590400	The Light Between Oceans Is extremely well written.  It is as if the scenes described were paintings! The characters were fully developed making it easy to connect. This was a two-kleenex  read!!
4	1359504000	the story was heartbreaking, the scenes vividly described. I felt like I was on the island and in the houses. The characters were each well defined and the real. The characters and their emotions matched the vivid description of the weather and enviroment surrounding the characters. The entire book had a quiet manner, nothing too shocking or plot twists that were shocking.
4	1359504000	This book started off slow, but then picked up speed and it was hard to put down.  I would definitely recommend it to others.
5	1359504000	A wonderful, insightful and sensitive book  I loved every minute og it, couldn't put it down.  This book deals with a lot of womens issues about children, and family relationships on a very deep level.
4	1359504000	This novel draws you in to the range of human emotions experienced by its main characters, Tom and Isobel, and the moral dilemma that is at the heart of their story.  Gripping, and at times heart-wrenching, this well-written novel is more than interesting or entertaining.  It is a compelling human drama that will touch your heart and stay with you for a long time to come.
5	1359504000	Loved It! Absolutely recommend this book! It has been awhile since I have read such a great story. Well written, excellent flow, simply could not put it down. This is a must read!
4	1359504000	I did enjoy this book.  It was a wonderful story of motherly love and what you do for the ones you love. It was well written, I could feel myself in the lighthouse and on Janus.  Would make a great summer read.
5	1359504000	When you thought something was going to happen one way, it turned out another.  The book keep me interested and I didn't want it to end.  Enjoyed the book immensely
4	1359504000	I enjoyed this book, if you like tragic love stories, this one will keep your attention. I would recommend it to friends.
3	1359417600	Tells a story about people in difficult situations; geographically, morally and emotionally. How realistic that all these worlds would have met is questionable, then again it is fiction.
5	1359417600	I could not put this book down--even though I knew what needed to happen at the end, I was amazed how the author lead me through the story to find a bittersweet ending for all characters.  It is a must read. I do not belong to a book club in my community, but this would be an excellent book to discuss
5	1359417600	An unusually poignant and romantic tale with very real characters in a wonderfully created setting.  It hooks you from the beginning.  I recommend it highly.
4	1359417600	I am a lighthouse buff so I found the setting of this novel great. The characters are appealing but flawed and those flaws drive actions that present some very discussable moral questions. I found this a compelling read and hard to put down. I definitely recommend it.
5	1359417600	Wonderful story of grief and desperation and how they can effect your decision making and how those decisions effect other people.  Definitely not a 'happy' story but very satisfying  nonetheless.  Good plot pacing and strong character development make for a great read for a Sunday on the couch.  Strong use of metaphor and symbolism make this an excellent Book Club book.
5	1359417600	The plot is driven by the interesting, believable characters.  Two well respected, hard working people are slowly weave a web of lies that entangle them and leave them with no acceptable way out.  The story is well written and well paced.  I sympathize with involved in the story.  I highly recommend it.
5	1359417600	I thought this book would be very depressing but, it was not.  It was slow moving however, it fit the book because life in a lighthouse is slow paced as well.
5	1359417600	I really enjoyed this book.  It is well written and held my attention all the way to the end.  It was a different kind of mystery/love story with a lot of twists and turns.  I hope we get more books by this author.
4	1359417600	It was an easy read, good for the beach or a cold day by the fireplace.Touching story and raises some interesting questions.
4	1359417600	Enjoyed the story when I finally got into it.  The beginning dragged  and then became interesting.Good book for discussion.
5	1359417600	Although it was great, it was too sad.; the ending broke my heart.The daughter should have been to see her &#34;lighthouse Mother&#34;before she did.
4	1359417600	A book club selection, I was pleased with this book.  The analysis of the characters, and impact of their decisions, was very well written.  My only disappointment was that the very end of the book was a bit trite and formulaic.  Will definitely watch later works by this author.
4	1359331200	This book has a story that keeps your interest from beginning to end.  There are ethical issues to ponder and interesting characters to meet.
3	1359331200	It was a good not great book.  Not enough action.  Characters were kind of dull.  I read it for a book club and probably wouldn't have finished it except for my book club meeting
5	1359331200	I love to read about other peoples lives even though it a fiction, but is it?? I could put my self in Isabel's shoes and Hannah's  shoes at the same time.It was a great read
4	1359331200	After reading a blurb about htis book in Good Housekeeping, I got this book for my kindle.  YOu can read a plot summary in the other reviews.  Since this takes place in Australia, there are some word/phrases that are unfamiliar to the American vocabulary--some i was able to locate in the dictionay, others I could not.  You can sort of guess fromt he context.  The story is something that sits with you for a while, after you finished the book.  You will also learn about the desolate and lonely life of light-house keepers from years ago.
5	1359331200	Very touching story. It is beautifully written. A story of love and of loss. Of the blurry lines between right and wrong. I would definitely recommend the book to others.
5	1359331200	This book was terrific. I loved the setting and the premise.I have recommended it to my friends. Thank you!
4	1359331200	This was a good read! After the first chapter, I got a little bogged down in the history of the couple. There were a lot of details and parts of their story that I didn't think was necessary or important and I got a little bored with it. But eventually the author got back to the heart of the story and I was engaged again. The story was very thought provoking. What would you do if you were in their situation? This would be quite a dilemma. I can identify with the wife and her desperate NEED to be a mother.
5	1359331200	This book, set in Australia in the years after the end of WWI, was a &#34;can't put it down&#34; book for me. The book is historically fascinating with a story line that is very gripping and ultimately heart-wrenching. The writing is lovely and the characters are complex and believable.
5	1359331200	This is a great book! The descriptions of life on a lighthouse and the isolation involved are detailed and provide a great sense of reality. These descriptions help the reader understand how life on the lighthouse can be isolated yet character building. The ethics of the characters is also well developed and provides great insights in their inner struggles. Also the coping strategies that each of the main characters uses are realistic.  Difficult to put this book done once I started reading it. A roller coaster of emotions and suspense are experienced! Great Book!!
4	1359244800	Had a hard time putting it down... at times, environmental details were a bit verbose, but the storyline kept me interested all the way to the unpredictable end.
5	1359244800	What a deeply moving story.  It is hard to imagine all the harm that can be done by meaning well.
4	1359244800	A few pages in, I began to doubt whether I would truly enjoy this book. It was written very simply, and didn't seem to grab my attention. I will say now, I'm so glad I stayed with it. The ending of this story is what makes this book. While I will only say, Grab your kleenex, I could not have imagined a better ending. It's not what you would have hoped for, but it is perfect for the two characters this book centers on.
5	1359244800	I have never read any books by this author, yet this one grabbed me by the first couple pages. It was so well written, a literary delight.  You fall in love and cry at the same time with the love story of Tom and Isabel.
5	1359244800	Beautifully written, I fell in love with the characters and their lives.  Looking forward to more books from ML Stedman.
5	1359244800	The writing of this alluring story was beautiful.  I enjoyed it.  As in the Judgement of Solomon a moral dilemma provides the dramatic push of the story, but there is so much more; WWI, prejudice, duty and human understanding. I'm glad I have in on my Kindle, so I can reread it.
5	1359158400	I enjoyed the story line and character development.  I found the descriptions of the location very interesting and appreciated learning about light houses and how they operated.
5	1359158400	This book was a delightful read!!  The author takes you through a whole range of emotions.  I would definitely read more from this author!
5	1359158400	I fell in love with the characters of this story and didn't want it to end.  Beautiful story and we'll written.
4	1359158400	Started a bit slow by the end was crying. A lesson in unconditional love. A beautiful love story with history lesson
5	1359158400	I loved this book.  One of the best stories I have read in a long time.  The writing was beautiful and I love all the characters.  It was a very heart wrenching book and I look forward to this authors next book.  Highly recommend!
4	1359072000	Good story, but it seemed to drag on in places, especially the end. If you're a sentimental person, you'll love this book. If not, it can get a bit boring. But it does have a good plot.
5	1359072000	Purchased this book for my bookclub reading.  I read it in two days, it was hard to put down.  Very well written, characters and the story line were well developed.  Get out a box of kleenex you'll need them.
4	1359072000	Able to &#34;connect&#34; with the characters. Experienced wide range of emotions throughout the story. Not real challenging but a good overall story.
5	1359072000	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It had great character development and good story line. I highly recommend this book.
5	1359072000	A must read! Teared up a few tines and left me not wanting to put the book down!! Highly recommend! Tiffany Swanson
5	1359072000	I don't want to give away the story line, but it was capitvating, gripping and not what I was expecting. Astonishingly well written for someone's first book!
5	1358985600	Engaging. Flowed well. Spoke to me. Great story that captured the Essence of life by the sea. One of my most recent faves.
4	1358985600	An excellent tale.  It was so good that I could not put it down and was through it in two days.
4	1358985600	This was a very interesting story.  I really enjoyed it!  The descriptions of the land and seascapes was vivid.  I could picture the scenes very well.  And I was in tune with the characters, feeling their emotions.  It was a good read!
4	1358985600	This is the story of Tom and Isabel, a couple that lives at the furthest point of Western Australia, tending a lighthouse, with no one around for miles.After trying to carry a baby to full term for years, Isabella and Tom's lives change forever when a boat carrying a dead man and a very alive baby wash up to shore.  It is a day that will change their lives forever and a decision that will have consequences for everyone for the rest of their lives.This book sounded like it could be boring at the beginning.  I mean, a couple on a remote island, cut off from everyone for 6 months at a time could drag on.  Not the case!  The writing is beautiful and keeps the reader engaged.  It was hard to put the book down, wondering what would happen next.Be prepared to really think about how your decisions impact your life and those around you for years to come.  This is a great, thought provoking book.
4	1358985600	Pleasant and easy reading. It is entertaining.A lesson on how truth comes out and the consequences of aMore of a girl's book.
5	1358985600	I have this skirt in red.  I get so many complements on it when I wear it for matches!!  The fabric and color is great!  Just ordered another color and may even get it in black just in case.
3	1358899200	The author does well with description but bogs down in reminisences about the war.  The story was predictable and needed a better transition to the ending (which was somewhat abrupt).
5	1358899200	Outstanding story and character development.  I developed empathy for both sides of the conflict.  Looking forward to more from this author!
4	1358899200	Wonderful story of families living in remote outposts and loving the isolation of nature's beauty.  The main characters were warm and very interesting.........I kept thinking &#34;what would I have done in similar situation?&#34;  Have recommended it to many since I read it
5	1358899200	Nice balance of moving the story along but savoring the details.  Especially fun for those of us who love anything about the sea, storms, lighthouses, etc.
4	1358899200	I might not have chosen this book myself based on what I had heard but it was a selected title for my book club and so I needed to read it for our meeting.  I actually liked it very much ... and it provided much lively discussion for our members.
5	1358899200	Loved the book.  Beautifully written and interesting subject matter.  I  highly recommend &#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34; to all who care about the written word.
5	1358899200	This book was incredibly touching and sad at the same time. I think a lot of parents can relate to the main characters and really get a feel for the lives they live and decisions they made. I cried at times but reall enjoyed this book!
5	1358899200	I read The Light Between Oceans as a book club suggestion.  I enjoyed the story line and it made for an interesting discussion at my book club.  We all agreed the author did a great job putting together a thought provoking story.  I would certainly recommend this book.
4	1358899200	Choice between obeying the law and the heart. I had to look at both sides. The woman who had lost three babies and could not have a child. The woman who had a child and husband .
4	1358812800	Although this book was a little slow at the beginning while setting the stage for the lighthouse keeper, it made up for it in soon order! I was a bit disappointed at the ending.  It almost seemed like the author was ready to move on to a new project so it lacked creativity. However ... while reading the rest of it I found my self either day dreaming about it if I didn't have it in my hands or talking about it to someone almost as if it was a true story.
5	1358812800	Although it took some effort to get into &#34;The Light Between Oceans&#34;, once in, I was pulled along with &#34;waves&#34; of emotions. As a parent of both adopted and biological children, there were many levels I related to this book. It had me &#34;living&#34; on the lighthouse island , feeling both the loneliness and the beauty, the joy Tom's family found in the simple life there. The consequences of the main characters' decisions weighs heavily throughout the book, pulling the reader between the choices, right and wrong, with no easy answers.  This heart pulling and wrenching story left me pulling out more tissues than any book I've ever read.
4	1358812800	Circumstances guided the characters throughout their lives...some good, but many bad choices were made by the characters due to circumstances.  I would have preferred a different ending to the book, and have the lost daughter come visit sooner than she did, but all in all, I enjoyed reading.
5	1358726400	This book was deeply moving to me, I simply could not put it down. The lives of the characters were so intricately woven,  along with their circumstances, it sucked me into their lives to the point where I was wondering what I would do in their place.
4	1358726400	This book looks deeply into it's characters and then tells a story that, is at once, full of light and emotionallydark.  But, it is the wonderful prose that ties the book together making it a good read.
5	1358726400	Such a wonderful story, I could not put it down.  The struggles encountered by each character are real, raw and cause you to examine the ugliness and beauty every human possesses.
3	1358726400	I read this book for my book club.  I enjoyed it but found it slow at times.  The characters were well developed and easy to follow.  Overall it was an ok read.  It will have some good conversations in book club, I imagine!
5	1358726400	I highly recommend this book, the story kept me glued to the book. It is a story for all ages.
4	1358726400	I'm not quite finished with it yet, but so far so good.  It's different from the type of book I read, but I like it.
5	1358640000	Fantastic new author. Ml Stedman has a way of making the story personal.  Makes you rethink what is morally right.
3	1358640000	This was not really an uplifting story. It was written well, just not what I thought it would be....I wouldn't read it again.
5	1358640000	one of the best books i have ever read! i cant wait to read another book by this author! read this great novel and enjoy a book you cant put down!
5	1358640000	The Light Between Oceans explores the circumstances a simple couple, just wanting to find their own place in life post WWI in Australia, finds themselves immersed in when fate deposits a baby at the doorstep of their lonely light house off the western coast of Australia. Desperate for a child after several miscarriages and a stillbirth, the wife embraces the gift as destiny. The husband, a product of both military discipline and the codes and rules which guide the life of a lighthouse keeper, uneasily desists until time and separation gradually works the child into his life. When it is discovered that the baby's mother was still alive on the mainland and pinning her own life away in misery over the loss, the couple must face the dilemma of losing the child they have learned ot love or to do the right thing and return the child to her rightful mother.This book takes you on their painful journey, honest in its emotions and dilemmas.
4	1358640000	Sad but compelling story which makes everyone who is a parent wonder what they might have done under similar circumstances. Although it was very easy to see the point of view of each side, it is not easy to say who was &#34;wrong&#34; or &#34;right&#34;.
3	1358640000	Recommended by a fellow book clubber. Not exactly what I would call a must-read.  Definitely not terrible, just not one of those books you can't put down.
5	1358640000	It certainly brings a moral dilemma that I'm sure none of us would face but can certainly empathize with the characters on what they did and why. Very interesting premise and compelling read. Completely recommend it. An easy read.
4	1358553600	This book elicited a wide range of emotions. Though I found it slow in the beginning, it ended up being a page turner. I cannot remember when I wanted two outcomes from a book, which I did in this case.
5	1358553600	While reading this wonderful book, there were several times I wanted to shout, &#34;DON'T DO THAT.&#34;. Loved the book fron start to finish
5	1358553600	I have used this perfect paper cement for years for attaching my photographs to notecards, then when Hobby Lobbybdidnt have it, I thought all was lost, then A-HA, I found it on line!
5	1358553600	This story is a fantastic one of love and a good reminder that we all have choices in life. It's a fluid read and a lovely story.
4	1358553600	The  light between the oceans is a very fast read.  I loved the book.  The story really tugs at your heart.
5	1358553600	Interesting story, good development of characters and very well written. It drew me in from beginning to end. Excellent read!
5	1358553600	Great story!  It captivated my interest and my heart.  This book is well written and you will feel the same feelings portrayed in the characters.
5	1358553600	The light between the Oceans.A very well written book and an enjoyable read.Great discussion for a book club or anyone interested in a fine read.
4	1358553600	At first I thought this was not going to be very interesting, but once into the story I couldn't put it down.  We read it for a book club and had one of the best discussions on a book in a long time.  Many important themes: relationships, what is truth, what happens in a small child's life is important!
5	1358553600	I absolutely loved this book.  The character were well drawn and very real and likeable.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story.
3	1358553600	I was hoping for a gripping story, a good page-turner, for a 10-hour flight.  From time to time, I got involved in the storyline, but overall the it was told too slowly, and I became impatient with the characters.  I understand, now, the mixed reviews this book receives.  I read it over a 5-day period...but wouldn't recommend it as a must-read.
3	1358467200	Though beautifully written and  vivid, my heart was ripped out too well by this book.  I will never read it again, however, I've more appreciation for my children.
3	1358467200	This was an okay book but it wasn't great literature.  The plotline really is predictible, and actually, reminded me of a soap opera.  Not great backstory and no in depth character development.  I am not trying to be negative, and I respect everyone's opinions on this, but when it is broken down into basic elements of storytelling, this is about a C-.
3	1358467200	A page turner which is heartwarming yet heartbreaking. Very strong sense of place , credible characters and  rich dialogue .I will recommend  it  to others.
4	1358467200	I think this book would be an ideal selection for a book club as it contains many issues for discussion.
3	1358467200	This book kept my interest, a little slow at times, but glad I finished it.  Good story line.  Would recommend.
3	1358467200	An easy reading book about love gained and love lost due to lies & consequences. Very well written and I highly recommend it.
5	1358467200	book kept my interest-descriptions of the landscape, sea and sky were very good.have enjoyed trying to see how the story line unfolds to an ending..
5	1358467200	It is fascinating story of true life choices and consequences... I cried like the baby at the end of it... I hope that some of the lessons from that story will stick with me for a while. I highly recommend it.
5	1358467200	Beautifully written about the power of love and forgiveness, that produced a great deal of soul searching....and of course, I cried like a baby.
4	1358467200	I'm enjoying this book.  The prose is beautiful.  This is a story of Tom, a war veteran and lighthouse keeper, and his young wife, Izzy,  who live an isolated life on an island.  The author does an excellent job of describing internal and external feelings of her characters as it relates to their unofficial adoption of the foundling and the war experiences of Tom, the lighthouse keeper, but other aspects of thier experiences are skimmed such as the loneliness of being the only people on this island.I will read other books by this novelist and do recommend it.  I gave it four stars because it was often predictable, even though beautifully written.
4	1358467200	I thoroughly enjoyed this story. It presented an interesting moral challenge to the characters that made you really think about what you would do if it happened to you. The author has an easy writing style and the descriptions of the setting for the story were easy to picture as a backdrop underscoring the beauty, desperation and grief of the characters it portrayed.
3	1358467200	It was written well but didn't seem to hold my interest.  It wasn't one of those books you can't put down for me.
4	1358380800	This book is about how an event and decision made by one person can unknowingly at the time affect many people in many ways and sometimes even the person making the decision but not in the way hoped for.  Happy in places; sad in places, but very realistic.
3	1358380800	interesting story but at times moved a little slow. would recommend as a light read for anyone looking for an &#34;easy&#34; read.
5	1358380800	As a sailor and familiar with light houses all over the world, one can imagine actually living with this family and the life they endured. Well-written and a different spin to everyday stories.
5	1358380800	Really like this one.  I have never read any other books by this author.  Good quick read.  It was hard to put down.  I highly recommend it.
4	1358380800	This is a wonder story, emotional without being sentimental.  I would have given it a full five stars but the ending seemed less powerful than the rest of the story.
4	1358380800	This book was recommended to me by two librarians. I enjoyed learning about a lighthouse keeper's duties. The plot was good. I wasn't able to predict the ending, which I like.
4	1358380800	I couldn't put the book down. Enjoyed every minute of reading it but was sad by the ending I felt
5	1358294400	wasnt sure i wanted to read this at first. but it was a nice read. kept my attention from the first page to the last page.
5	1358294400	I have finished the book, but the characters are still with me, and I will never forget them.  One of the best books that I've read in years!
4	1358294400	you really get to know these people and to understand the difficulties in deciding what is &#34;the right thing to do&#34;
4	1358294400	This book was a very enjoyable read from the beginning. I found the characters to be immediately likable, I truly wanted a good outcome for everyone involved.The story was very sensitive yet I was completely empathetic to all the characters involved and even admit to shedding a tear while reading the story. Beautifully crafted, leaving me wanting more which is why I gave the book four stars,  I absolutely recommend this book to mothers, grandmothers, aunts and family oriented sensitive souls!
5	1358294400	This book was full of heartache for multiple characters but they had their good moments as well.  Shows how one decision can change your whole life.
5	1358294400	Was a great book.  Made you stop and think about your own life choices. I would recommed the Light Between Oceans very highly
5	1358294400	What a great read this was.  I was intrigued right away, as Tom reminded me early on of my late husband.  The story has surprises;  some good, some not.  Would have preferred a different ending,  but loved the story anyway.  Will be giving other offerings by Ms Stedman a good look!
4	1358208000	Although it was a little slow in the beginning, this book was a great story with characters that are easy to relate to.
5	1358208000	Very absorbing reading....thoroughly enjoyable....hard to put down once started. I heartily recommend this book to adults both male and female.
5	1358208000	Excellent book. Was much more than I expected.  Quite deep and thought provoking.  Thoroughly enjoyable displaying quite a number of truths regarding life.  Good enough for me to read again and I usually don't do that.  So that is quiet some praise.
4	1358208000	I read the book in one day because I just felt the urge to finish.  This story illustrates how good people, in certain situations, justify their actions.  Unfortunately consequences follow.  It was an easy, thought - provoking read.
3	1358208000	Kind of heartbreaking, actually. At the end, was left with sadness. An odd story, with characters not well thought out.
5	1358208000	I enjoyed reading this for book club this month.A lot to think about and well written.I recommend it.
5	1358121600	At best, you'll discover why I say you'll find M. L. Stedman, obviously a gifted story teller, combines the literary craft of a skilled poet, and the depth of research and attention to detail of a top investigative reporter, with the curiosity and analytical skill of a professional, philosophical ethicist. At worst, you'll just find it a really great read.- Nicholas Johnson[...]January 14, 2013
5	1358121600	This book was suggested to me by a friend. I immediately purchased a copy for my kindle and dug in. Though the story line was not a happy one, the prose actually brought me into the time period and the beautiful yet empty place. Being a parent myself, I throughly related to the pain, sorrow, and loss of many of the prominent characters. It is a very well-written book with excellent character development. Applause to ML Stedman for a beautifully written piece. For anyone who loves to read, this is a definite MUST.
4	1358121600	This was the Jan selection of my book club. I had never heard of this book or the author. I was pleasantly surprised as I read this. It was well written and kept my interest throughout the entire book. The characters were fully developed. The author made me care about all of them. I would recommend this book to all my friends and all book clubs.
5	1358121600	Even though the book subject was intense, the author was able to make the characters clear and believeable and the situation, though heartrenching, capivating.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others.
4	1358121600	Toward the end of the book, I realized I had no idea what was going to happen to the characters.  The ending surprised didn't completely surprise me, but there were twists that I didn't see coming.  A good book to read as well as a quick book to read.
4	1358121600	Very engaging book from the beginning.  I've been taking a &#34;break&#34; from reading since September 2012 and this is the first book I have completed since then.  I've tried to read 5 others and just couldn't get into them for one reason or another (and they all had great reviews).  This book captured my attention and I couldn't wait to figure out what would happen to the Sherbourne's.  I read the book in 2 weeks and would have been faster if I didn't have the flu in the beginning of it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the ending.  I was hoping for more of a twist or something I didn't predict, but alass I saw the ending coming and it was exactly what I thought it might be.  Therefore, I took away one star for being predictable at the end.
5	1358035200	The Light Between Oceans is a beautifully written novel about a heart wrenching situation. The author develops the characters so well, that the reader is able to emphasize with each one involved.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story about love, loss and resolution.
5	1358035200	I really enjoyed The Light Between Oceans.  It is  informative...learned about light houses  but the story about the people involved is touching and teaches a lesson about  the things one will do out of love.I would and do recommend this book to everyone.
5	1358035200	I spent nearly the whole day reading this book.  A great story, although a bit redundant at time.  I would recommend it.
5	1358035200	I really enjoyed this book about a lighthouse keeper, his wife and the consequences of their decisions.  An emotional and well- written book.  I would encourage the author to continue writing.  Very talented.
5	1358035200	I couldn't put this book down - it was beautifully written and kept my attention to the last page.  I chose it based on the description in the Kindle store selection area - which was not only accurate, but persuasive.  I read it cover to cover and was sorry it ended.  It was a favorite I've recommended to my friends with Kindles.
4	1358035200	I liked this book because the lighthouse is described with explanations that make you understand as if you are there, looking at it.  The story in this book is filled with characters that you can sympathize with and a plot that could break your heart.
5	1358035200	Well written and well developed plot. It wasn't the kind of book that I couldn't put down but I definitely found myself wanting to read at least a chapter a day. I enjoyed the depth and the author's ability to go deep and dark in away that was beautiful. The twists and turns in the plot were well timed and not misplaced just for shock value. The story flows at a steady pace. The ending I felt was bittersweet and nice but not very strong but it did wrap things up neatly.
5	1358035200	Very well written and an excellent storyline.  Couldn't put it down. Sad and happy. Easy reading.  Ellen from New Jersey
5	1357948800	This was a very good story!  Hard to put down!  I enjoyed it a lot!One could never have imagined it!
5	1357948800	It takes place in different part of the world.Cities and islands that seem real but are fictional. Characters carefully drawn; an understandable plotline yet even the reader becomes involved wondering how it will end without more tragedy. There were some phrases and sentences that seemed to be highlighted and the word highlight; I kept wondering who chose the highlights because the semi-highlighted ones were the type I want to remember. My final note of approval is attested by the fact that I went back and read most of it a second time.
4	1357948800	I loved this book - the lighthouse setting and symbolism and the whole story, which was very engaging and got "inside" the characters hearts.  I sympathized with Isabel and Tom, and also with Hannah and Lucy.
5	1357948800	This was a sad sweet story of how love for a spouse and a child can cloud our thinking.  The main male character was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.  The sweet daughter was so loved by her &#34;parents&#34;  who were not really her parents.  The real mother was a shadow of her former self and so pitiful.  Everyone of these people eventually were caught up in a situation, where no one was going to come out as a winner.  Forgiveness does prevail and sadness lingers always in the heart.
5	1357948800	Very good book! Didn't like the ending to well. Was hoping they get to keep the baby. Overall the book was great.
5	1357948800	The story started off very slow, so bad that I regretted purchasing.  It did pick up with a well developed plot and then I couldn't put it down.
5	1357948800	I could not stop reading. A great story about love, lifelong ups and down, and tragedy over some historical background. The story interests me as an Ex West-Australian. Would love to see this in a movie.
4	1357948800	This writer introduces thoughts and imagery about motherhood and the bond between husband and wife in a unique, emotional, vibrant way.
5	1357948800	I loved this book.  It was so hard to put down each night and all day I kept thinking about what was going to happen.  The writing was beautiful.  It made you feel like you were right there living the characters lives.  I want everyone to know what a wonderful book this is!
4	1357862400	I am a fan of Historical Fiction.  This book delivers on both fronts.  From an historical point of view,  there is information about WWII, Australian customs and of course, lighthouse lore.  Fictionally, the story was emotional and fast moving, with enough twists and turns to keep me guessing.  The characters were believable, likeable, but also flawed. I think that anyone interested in Australian history would find this particular niche about lighthouse lliving very informative and enjoy a good story too.
5	1357862400	Tom Sherbourne is a damaged war veteran seeking solace in the isolation of Janus Rock. As the keeper of the lighthouse, he is entirely alone for years at a time. But when he sees Isabel while on leave, it's love at first sight. As the two work to build a family on Janus Rock, they meet with disappointment and heartbreak time after time. When a baby washes up on shore, what is the couple to do? Is right and wrong as cut and dry as it seems? Can something that so obviously seems like a sign - an opportunity to have everything you want in life - really be wrong? Stedman builds a beautiful story; her writing is absolutely poetic. The turmoil Tom and Isabel feel is clear, as is their love for each other and for their 'adopted' baby, Lucy. Stedman also does a wonderful job setting the scene, both on mainland Australia and on Janus Rock. This is one of those books that will have you debating with your friends about which course the characters should take, about which path is right and for whom? There are no easy answers here and no happy endings, but it's a worthwhile read all the same.
5	1357862400	this book starts out slowly but then gets hold of you very quickly and is beautifully constructed .It tells the story of two lonely people One niaeve  and one world weary.together they create a terrible dilemmer,and it is this that pulls the story  together so well.
5	1357862400	Great! Highly recommend! Not good at reviewing and sure wish this Kindle didn't have this feature at the end of each book.
5	1357862400	The Light Between Oceans is very well written, descriptive and holds your attention.  This book has unexpected twists and turns.  I highly recommend it as a great read.
4	1357862400	It was a very interesting idea. An era that was very different from our own time. It's amazing the strength of the human spirit and the love for another person.
4	1357862400	"the Light Between Oceans" This is a book one of our Book Club members highly recommended  and everyone has enjoyed it.
5	1357862400	I haven't finished it yet, but it's lovely, very well written and of course you learn a lot about life in a light house.  It's a sweet and sad story.  I am dreading reach the end, I have a suspicion that's not going to end well.  I read a comment, the person who wrote said &#34;I don't need to read non fiction to be crying and become sad&#34;.
5	1357862400	The characters in this novel have remained with me long after I finished reading it.  It is a story of tragedy and loss but it is also a story about the power of love.  All characters' intent was for good but the impact of some decisions resulted in tragedy for others.  Truly moving.
4	1357862400	Loved the story.  So many directions. A beautiful take on love and faith and the power to overcome tragedies in the past.
5	1357776000	I loved this book.  This is a story I will remember for a long time.  I appreciated the depth of the characters.
4	1357776000	Well written and engaging.  I looked forward to reading this book every night- even though the subject matter was tragic.
4	1357776000	This book was captivating. I was not sure what I was  getting into when  initially purchased this book. It was a story of love for a spouse and a child and of loss. Would recommend it to anyone!!
4	1357776000	This bittersweet story of love, loss and redemption had me staying up late turning the pages on my Kindle. I found myself imagining different scenarios for how it could end. The scope of the drama is limited to a few fully-drawn characters. The reader gets to know and identify with each of them, which is why it is so compelling. The main setting, the island of Janus off the coast of Australia in the 1920's, which was home to one couple and a small child, gave me the sense of wide-open space that is somehow psychologically very confining. The conflict in the story arose from the isolation of the family. It may seem a little contrived, but that is not a barrier to enjoyment of the story. I can't remember if I'd read anything like it before. It's not written in a style of great literature - it's just a very good story in plain but perfectly enjoyable prose. I'd recommend the book for anyone who likes historical fiction or stories of love tested by circumstances.
5	1357776000	From the moment I read the first chapter I was intrigued with the story. While i knew full well that tragedy was afoot the author's ability to draw me into the feelings and emotions of the characters made that secondary to inevitable.
5	1357776000	I loved this book!  From the beautifully developed  characters to the vividly described landscape of a wild island 100 miles off the coast of Australia, I found this book a hard one to put down.  I could hear the ocean, feel the salt spray and the pervasive loneliness that the author so ably described.  The story centers around a moral dilemma that shakes the very foundations of the lives of the principal characters.  It's a story about choices and how such choices shape the lives of all the people they touch.  Unlike some other reviewers, I believe the story ends well as the wrongs have been righted and the people involved are finally at peace with themselves and with their consciences.  I will be recommending this book to my book group.
5	1357776000	The twist and turns of life and the consequences of choices are so fully explored in thus book.  What a great and wonderful read!  It's a book full of love and heartbreak.  I highly recommend this book.
5	1357776000	One of the best books I have ever read.  Loved the style of writing and the characters in the story.  Have gladly recommended it to others who appreiate a wonderful story.  Va
5	1357776000	Anyone who has experienced parenting at any level, as the biological parent, adoptive parent, step-parent, or grandparent, will connect with the anguish felt by every adult in this novel. You think you know what is going to happen, but you don't. In your soul, you know what is right, but the reality tugs at your conscience. This is a very powerful insight into relationships and how decisions can affect the fragile dynamic.In the end, the outcome made sense, but it was tough getting there.
5	1357776000	Great book!  I couldn't put it down.  Sad story, heartbreaking.  Personally I didn't like the ending but it is still a great read.
4	1357776000	This was a very nice read that I stumbled upon while browsing. The title drew me to the book, and once I read the Kindle sample, I ordered the book and read it straight through. It tells a story of love and longing to be a complete family in southwesten coastal Australia, a place I know little about.  It also deals with the horrors suffered in war in a time when the term Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome was not known. I don't want to put any spoilers in, so I will withhold further comments on the content here. If you like stories full of believable characters that span many years, you will definitely enjoy this well-written book. I can see this being made into a TV movie.
4	1357776000	I usually like mystery books but I saw this book at Costco and saw Costco's recommendation in their Connection magazine so I bought and read the book and I enjoyed it so I bought this from Amazon for my daughter.  I don't if she's read it yet but I have no doubt that she will like it very much.
5	1357689600	Love The Light Between Oceans.  Well written, engrossing novel.  Put this one on your list!!  Could not put this one down--------------always a sign of a great book!!  Do not miss this wonderful, emotional story.
5	1357689600	Great story of love, the ocean and the love of a baby who turns into a caring young woman.  Author did great job in describing the care of a lighthouse.
2	1357689600	The first two thirds of the book was engaging enough...I like learning about that era in the context of Australia and lighthouses in particular.  However, the final third of the book dragged on and on....I had lost my connections to the characters and didn't really care what happened to them. A case of an author who didn't know how to tie up and finish a book, so s/he just over wrote.
5	1357689600	This book is one that will keep you reading with a very good story. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys a good tale
5	1357689600	Very good story line! This book keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Really takes your emotions from one end of the spectrum to the other and twists your heart in a knot.Well written and enjoyable. Although I've never been to Australia, I felt as if I had visited by the time I was finished with the book.Would love to read more by this author.
5	1357689600	Excellent, hard to put down. I searched to find another by this author only to realize it was the first book by this author. I look forward to the next book.
5	1357689600	This book had me screaming at some points and crying at others.  It shows the crazy, yet enduring presence of love.  It was wonderful:)
5	1357689600	I loved The Light Between Oceans.  The writing was beautiful.  I could almost picture the waves crashing on the side of the island, and the light burning to warn ships of the danger.  But it was the turmoil between Izzy (Isabel), Tom and Hannah that made the book what it was.  Being a mother I cried with Izzy when she found little Lucy after losing so many babies. But then I also cried for poor Hannah, at the loss of little Grace.The book was filled with love and tragedy...all that a good read should be.
5	1357689600	The Light Between Oceans is about Tom Sherbourne, a war veteran, who returns to Australia to take a position as a lighthouse keeper on isolated Janus Rock.  After his wife suffers several failed pregnancies, a boat washes ashore with a dead man and a baby on board.  The story heats up when they decide to keep the baby as their own.This book is fantastic.  Its mix of emotions and steady action left me wanting more.  The characters are extremely well-developed and your heart aches and triumphs with them.  The themes of love, loss, desperation, and hope are fluid and wrap you up in every word.  Highly recommended!
4	1357689600	Good book, but didn't like the ending!  Well developed characters and interesting period.  The author kept you guessing on how it would end!
5	1357603200	Wow, I couldn't put this book down. I read it in a day and a half. The turmoil and tradegy going on with the main characters made it hard for me to put the book down.
5	1357603200	Downloaded on my kindle. Very good book. I'd recommend a book club to have this as one of your reads-lots of content/morals/ethics for in-depth discussion.
5	1357603200	So different than any other book I've ever read!  I had no idea how it would end either!  A must read!!
5	1357603200	Set in the far reaches of western Australia after WWI, this tale of two people living on a remote island, starts out like the calm before a storm with newlyweds tending the light and their lives. But repeated tragedies test their choices and trust ultimately leading to a tumult of trouble for them. I could not put this one down and highly recommend it.
4	1357603200	Excellent read. Couldn't put it down right from the beginning. Stedman managed to hit every maternal emotion. Made me imagine what I would do in numerous situations. I would read another of this author's books.
4	1357603200	Tom is this story's beacon of light - in a sea of sorrow.  Sad and real.  I think of Les Miserable.
3	1357516800	Loved, loved, the first 1/2 of the book.  The second 1/2 is not great.  I understand the need to show the emotional torture of the characters, however, it goes on and on and on.  Honestly, I was annoyed at the end.
3	1357516800	No surprises - an easy read - Lifetime Movie material - o.k. for a fast read, easy summer or vacation reading
5	1357516800	Really loved this book and enjoyed the plot of the book.  Hard to put down and the ending was great but surprising.
5	1357516800	Stedman does a superb job of character development depicting the consequences when good intentioned peopleface the terribled consequences of their good intentions, commonplace heroism and integritry, and the balm of forigveness over all.The light between the oceans is love and love can stay but awhile but it is never forgotten and blessed for all of that.
5	1357516800	I was captivated by this story and it's moral dilemma. The story and characters are well developed and endearing.the story was very thought-provoking and heartwarming.I loved it.
5	1357516800	I enjoyed the author's writing style. I liked the plot developement and conclusion. I recommend this book to all readers.
3	1357516800	I chose this book partially on the ratings. It was well written, just not for me. I enjoy escaping from reality when I read.
5	1357516800	Alright, I'm going to be honest and say that the first half of this novel was slow-going for me. I made excuses to take breaks from reading simply because I couldn't stand how dull Tom seemed as a protagonist. I understood that he had lived through a war and came out a changed man, but for some reason his character just didn't seem all that well written in the first half of the book.The second half of the book, though, kept me awake until 2:00 am to finish it. It was gripping and kept my stomach in knots- partially from anxiety about what may ultimately happen and partially because it was just a heartbreaking tale. This book made me cry, and it's the first one to do so in a long while. I'd venture to say that any person who has any sort of parental instinct will cry reading this book, or at least seriously be moved. It definitely tugs at that portion of the heart.Aside from the plot, Steadman describes rural Australia in a very realistic manner. He set up his various locations perfectly and it was easy to place myself in the midst of their world.This would definitely be on my ideal bookshelf. Read it- you will enjoy it.
5	1357516800	This is a five star book for me. I would recommend it for anyone who likes characters  that feel so real.
5	1357516800	Such a quietly beautiful book infused with mystery and life truths. Reminds me if some of my favorite classic novels.
5	1357516800	I've spent the better part of my adult life around and on the ocean - I've known three loves in my lifetime two have passed and one I lost and then by God's grace found again. This beautiful story has brought home the true meaning of how important it is to be who you are - to be true to yourself and always true to the one you love and most of all to forgive my wrongs of the past and to forgive others that I felt have caused me harm. Who I'm I to judge?  That is not my job. I pray that I shallots always turn to Him to show me the way. This book helped me open that door. Thank you.
5	1357516800	I loved this book. It's about the way our lives unfold based on the decisions we make. Truly captivating story with rich characters.
4	1357516800	I would recommend it.  It was chosen for our book club selection.  It will be interesting to know what the other members feel about it.
5	1357430400	I gave this book a five star rating because I simply could not put it down.  A troubled man takes a job as a light house keeper, lives alone until a lovely lady falls so in love with him.  They marry and move to the island and the story begins.  A decision they make manages to turn their lives upside down, along with many others!  You are constantly changing your mind about the different characters and falling in and out of caring about each one of them.
4	1357430400	The story has some surprises that you wouldn't expect.  I love the timeframe the story is set in.  A good read.
2	1357430400	Rather slow going but getting better with each chapter.  I will keep reading - have heard from my daughter that it will get beter
5	1357430400	The beautiful settings of this book made me feel like I was on the isolated Janus, and in the quaint town of Partageuse. This is the stand-out element of the story, besides the emotionally wrenching dilemma that wraps readers up, and the beautifully imparted relationship between parents and children, that pulls so strongly at the heart. It is a story of family, of right and wrong, of consequences, of character, and of the web we weave through our life decisions.
4	1357430400	This was our book club choice for December and i enjoyed it, as did most of the members.  Good read!
5	1357430400	Let me start by saying that I loved this book.  I loved the fact that it's a unique story of love, loss, heartbreak and the consequences of making a difficult, life-changing decision.The writing was so well done that I felt like I was there on the island, living in that lighthouse.  Tom and Isabel were real people who faced real heartbreak and made a decision that ultimately affected several lives.  I don't know about you, but I know I wouldn't have been able to do what they did.In a way, I'm glad the book didn't end in the predictable &#34;happily ever after&#34; way...although it would have saved me a few tears if it had.In summary, this was a well thought out and well executed book.  I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to some great things from this author.
3	1357430400	The Light Between Oceans is a harrowing tale of motherhood and its parallels to the sea. It is a deceptively captivating story of a couple in Australia who come to learn the hardships of parenthood in troubled times. This book does an excellent job of exploring the depths of emotion that entertwine the couple's marriage and love for their children. I recommend it only if you have a loved one to hold onto while you read it.
5	1357430400	This book is about life.  For those that say it is a sad book, guess what?  Life is sad sometimes.  But life is indescribably good sometimes too.  Deep love gives opportunity for joy you can't explain and pain that sometimes goes with it.  This books provides us with the chance to look at both sides of love.  This is an outstanding book based on reality ...... not the fantasy love that many people seek.  Thank you M.L. Steadman.
5	1357344000	I loved this book..It kept my interest and got me involved with the characters.  I love books set in a different time and place..
4	1357344000	I love reading books about oceans and lighthouse are turkey fascinating and this book really made you feel like you were there on the island with them. Great details.
5	1357344000	What a great book from this first time author. I can't wait to read others that she writes. This was a very moving book that just grabbed you into the story in the very beginning. The reader can really relate to the character's that she has created.
2	1357344000	This book was an easy, entertaining book. I did cry a few times, but overall I felt like it was lacking. It dragged on in several parts and I felt like the ending went too quickly. The hurried ending didn't match the slow pace of the book. I felt like the author had a deadline to make and didn't put much effort in the ending.
5	1357344000	The Light Between Oceans is a beautifully written, engrossing story, with memorable characters who deal with intense emotions and intense moral dilemmas.  I consider it one of the best books I have ever read, and it is garnering raves from all the members of our book club.
5	1357257600	I really loved this book.  The arthor made me feel like I was actually on the scene.  The writing was smooth and easy yet so realistic.  One could feel the happiness and heartbreaks the characters felt at every turn of events.  This was a great story!
4	1357257600	Beautiful story, interesting plot. A bit slow in the beginning but it helps to lay out the story well. Set in Australia, the descriptions of where the story takes place is magical and also allows you to feel the loneliness of what the lighthouse brought to the main characters.
5	1357257600	My book club is small. Each member takes a turn choosing a book. Because of this I am compelled to read books that I would never have chosen for myself. This was one of those books but I am now delighted that I had the opportunity to read this story. I loved the characters. I loved the setting. I loved the anti-war message. I loved Lucy and was emotionally conflicted as to what was best for her although intellectually I knew the answer. It's a great book.
5	1357257600	I am actually at a loss for words for this review.  I can say though, that this story is incredibly powerful and moving.  Excellent read.  One I will probably visit again.  Well done.  Worth all the tears I shed while reading it.....
3	1357257600	"After two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby's cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby." Every choice that is made means another person's tragic loss. What is just?M.L. Stedman draws us back into time of the 1920s, off the coast of Australia on an isolated island. This novel was historical fiction but I'd dare say also realistic fiction. We all think we know right and wrong but do we when things become entangled? The author could have very easily made some of the events become contrived and given us a complete fairy tale but she didn't. She really kept me engrossed in the story, albeit there were times I wish she gave more.Overall, this was a deeper read than I anticipated and I'm glad she didn't give in and write what I would have wanted for all of the characters
5	1357257600	Fabulous,excellent. Can't wait to read the next book written. Very touched by descriptive passages that I wrote them down,like silence is freedom.Another one is"the loss had leaked all over her mother's life like a stain"  WOW!
5	1357257600	I just loved the images of ocean and light and love.  The people were unforgettable and wonderful.  The book was a delight to read.
3	1357171200	The writing style is poetic and flows like an ocean.  The story is a worthy example of morality dilemma.  I, however, found the plot tedious and locked in the doldrums.  This is not &#34;The Stand&#34; or &#34;The Idiot.&#34;
5	1357171200	Good read and discussion on what and who is a parent. Also makes you understand the lengths people will go to become a mom.
5	1357171200	I loved this book thoroughly. It shows clearly that bond between mother and child can begin anywhere. What a journey. So bittersweet.
4	1357171200	Excellent adventure in the book - sounds very interesting. In the book, THE ARROGANCE OF EVIL, the adventure trying to reach the American dream surrounded by greed and corruption.  Where are all of the regulatory agencies that are supposed to protect our investments? What were they doing while all of this was taking place - were they sleeping or going along with it? Are you telling me that billions and trillions of dollars were moving on and off of stock markets around the world and no one knew about it until catastrophe hit? And this is not the first time it happened. Time after time, every 10 or 15 years or so - when these despicable corrupt characters are done destroying one industry they jump to another and establish new damaging games. You wicked bankers with pride who repossess people's cars and assets. You call them losers and publish their pain and suffering on television with no mercy and with laughs. You could care less about people's pain and cries. This is when God's guidance and word comes in.Where is FINRA? Where is the SEC? We are paying these people to protect the system from the wicked and the corrupt. If they're not doing anything about it we should fire them all, shut down the agencies to save some taxpayer money, and then set up a new system. Or finance them and reinforce them and let them go after Wall Street until there is no more corruption. Let those agencies get hold of those corrupt, proud, disobedient, untrustworthy CEOs and leaders without mercy or forgiveness and put them away forever. Then you will see a big difference in the economy, recessions, and prosperity.Are we too late? Where is all of the money? FINRA sets rules for brokers and hosts most of the arbitrations between investors and brokers. FINRA took the duties of the old National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and is now the financial industry regulatory authority. Hello, hello where have you been? Can you advertise? Can you help? Can you tell people you exist and invite them to come and get help?Can we get the money back to the people, or is it too late? The SEC is the main regulatory arm of the federal government and the financial industry. Wow, where have you been SEC? How many people does the SEC employ? The SEC sets and enforces rules and - listen carefully to this - is charged with ensuring the integrity of the markets. The SEC's main concern is the big picture; it does not work for individual investors. Wow, where have you been? Why are you using taxpayers' money to make a payroll? Where are you when we really need you? Every single private company that goes public must benefit the investor and stockholder first before hundreds of millions of dollars are dispersed to CEO's and insiders.THE ARROGANCE OF EVIL WILL OPEN YOUR EYES.
5	1357171200	One of the best books I've ever read. The story keeps your interest with lots of twists in the plot. Excellent choice for book clubs as the moral dilemma provides for excellent discussion. Exceptionally well written.
5	1357171200	Recommended by a friend , really enjoyed it.  Brought out so many  emotions. Made you laugh and cry.  Definitely a good book to read. Made me think about forgiveness and letting go of the past
4	1357171200	This was a winner.  The big question is &#34;What would you have done?&#34; Great book for a book club discussion.
5	1357084800	This was a book that evokes many emotions with a reader.  In the beginning you are rooting for one character, then something happens and you think another character deserves your sympathy.  The book is a story of a mother's love, and the choice between right and wrong.  Very touching story, I highly recommend it.
4	1357084800	I enjoyed the beauty of the descriptions of the island and Australia.  I thought the story kind of dragged toward the middle and end but overall enjoyed it.
5	1357084800	Beautiful unique story! The characters are realistic and heartwarming. You hope for the perfect outcome and learn that many of life's lessons are just not black and white. I truly wish there were more books of this quality available. The author leaves you at peace with being heartbroken.
5	1356998400	Such a unique story. You actually find yourself conflicted between right and wrong when there is usually no grey area. Surprised by the ending...cried like a baby. Would love to see this book made into a movie.
4	1356998400	This was the first time I have read a book by this author. I wasn't disappointed.  The book kept me interested from cover to cover.
4	1356998400	If you like a good tragedy this book will hold your attention.  It's a good, relatively light and easy read.
5	1356998400	what a poignant story...it was so thought-provoking as to the philosophical question as to what  parents really are....are they the people who bring you into the world or the people who bring the world to you?...the characters were well-developed as was the solitary life of a lighthouse keeper...i truly enjoyed the story from beginning to end
4	1356998400	Author makes it very easy for you to put yourself in both pairs of shoes in this story!  Heart breaking for mothers, as well as heart wrenching for fathers.  I enjoyed this story!
5	1356998400	This is such a great book that I feel I need to write a review as I have never done so before.  I am not going to tell part of the story because it has already been done dozens of times.  I am just going to say that this is one of my favorite books and one that I will read again.  What a wonderful story even though it is heartbreaking and at the end I had to grab a tissue to wipe the tears. I love lighthouses to start with and that is why I purchased it and what a wonderful purchase it turned out to be.
5	1356998400	Thought provoking...a page turner...beautiful prose....each character drew you in...I cared about them and kept hoping all would work out for them...this book and the life lessons will stay with me
4	1356998400	very readable,unique storyline.  Nice developement of characters.  Liked the lighthouse setting and descriptions.  Lucy-Grace was handled very well.  That was tricky.
5	1356998400	This was a very interesting book.  The author twisted the plot several times so that you were kept in suspens as to what would happen next.  I would recommend this to all who enjoy a good book.  I am recommending it to my Book Club.
5	1356998400	This was an excellent story; I love that it took place at an earlier point in time rather than in today's bustling world of technology and social drama.  The author perfectly balanced the descriptive landscape as well as the character's emotions.  There was a brief lull in the story just before part III (it just seemed a bit drawn out) but the ending made up for that.  The story and the characters stayed with me for weeks after finishing the book and I saw the reality of such events actually occurring at some point in the past.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to those who want to enjoy a well written, wholesome, love story.  It is a tearjerker, but oh so worth the tears.
4	1356912000	Good story with endearing moments.  Learned alot about life on a lighthouse island, removed from others.  Great read for a cozy night by the fireplace!
5	1356912000	I really enjoyed this book.  It started out good, and kept getting better.  A really creative story considering it almost all takes place on a small island.
4	1356912000	I wish I could have given this book 3.5 stars. It was a little too sentimental and tidy for me, but the writing was exquisite. I'd have no problem recommending it, and for that reason, I went ahead and gave the book 4 stars. I can't wait to see what M.L. Stedman writes next.
4	1356912000	I read this book on the recommendation of a friend.  It is a wonderful tale of love and loss.  The circumstances in which the characters become involved definitely challenge their moral compasses. As a reader, I too, found myself reflecting on my own moral compass. I developed definite opinions about events and characters, only to have my mind changed by additional information revealed in the form of discussions or flashbacks.You will laugh and cry throughout this book. You will be surprised through to the last page. You will definitely enjoy this read.
5	1356825600	I was completely mesmerized by the book.  The premise is interesting, and the writing is wonderful.  Stedman is a good story teller and the lighthouse keepers life is a great backdrop for the tale.  It would be hard not to like this book.
5	1356825600	This book was so mesmerizing as if this could have been a true story.  It made my heart hurt for the loss.  And yet both surviveIn the end.  It was a truly wonderful ebook
4	1356825600	Even more isolated than a small town in Australia is the island-lighthouse 100 miles from its shore.  The lighthouse-keeper and his wife find love and magic until a series of miscarriages/stillbirths rock their world.  When a boat washes ashore carrying only a dead man and a baby what will the couple do?  The Light Between Oceans asks the tough questions about how each of our decisions might impact our lives and the lives of those around us (even extending to the lives of those we've never met).  Layered characters in a poetically-written story capture the reader's imagination and heart.  Although the story stretches on in some points (some new authors could be reminded by their editors that some of our great literary masterpieces were actually under 300 pages--and the reader got her money's worth at that), this is a story that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page.
5	1356825600	What a gloriously written book !  I was completely drawn in to the characters and the locale.  It was however, heartbreaking.
5	1356825600	Living miles from shore on an island in the first third of the 20th century, a boat suddenly comes to shore with a dead man and an alive, healthy baby on board.  What to do?  Normally the answer is easy and the lighthouse keeper buries the dead man and cares for the baby until help can arrive to take the baby to safety.  But in this situation the lightkeepe's wife has suffered yet again a miscarriage with the knowledge that another pregnancy is not possible.  Keep the baby??  What would the repercussions be?  Each character in this novel is handled with care and concern and the true effects of one seemingly innocent decision are felt for years to come.
4	1356825600	I could not put this book down. Such lovely and thoughtful writing. Wish I were still in the story.Thanks to the author for such a treat.
4	1356825600	An emotional story about when good people make poor choices.  Their emotional choice affected so many others unbeknownst to them.It didn't end the way I wanted it to, but it ended the way it needed to.
5	1356739200	I loved this book.  I could sympathize with all of the characters who made choices that created difficult consequences that the characters had to live with.
5	1356739200	Undertones of the best aspects of a Dickensian  novel, this novel is built on secrets and loyalties to the people we love.  The characters are three dimensional and humanly faulted. Lovely read
3	1356739200	It was just okay, nothing exceptional about it, I did finish the book because we are reading it for book club, but I wouldn't read it again. It was too unnerving.
1	1356739200	If you like reading Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-type stories where the tears are so carefully manipulated by the author that is seems cynical, then The Light Between Oceans is for you.  The maudlin aspect of the novel is, unfortunately, not mitigated by the characters who are two-dimensional, nor the plot which is predictable.
5	1356739200	I am forever changed, for the better, of all the people in my lifetime from one person's choice. ML Steadmans choice to pen and paper the intangible of God's great gift in our existence, and our nonexistence all together in this thing we yearn to understand. Life, love, pain, cannot BE without the other. As man cannot Be without God. I thank you M L Steadman, for somehow, you lifted the veil and exposed His light to me, a mere being, here to drink in every gift offered.
4	1356739200	The lighthouse makes an interesting setting for this book.  The story is one that has been told before in other books, but is done in a new light (pardon the pun), due to the unique aspects of the stories setting.  I really liked it and was drawn into and empathized with all the characters.  In the end I was unhappy with how it was resolved, but there was no way the ending could be made neat and tidy.  No matter which way it went, someone would be hurt, and it was a matter of waiting for the book to end to see who that would be.  I like the book, it was interesting without being trite and I would recommend it to a book club as it would be interesting to dissect the characters.  Two thumbs up!
4	1356739200	Good story line but had to start it a second time to really get committed.  Once I was there, it really grabbed my attention.  However, since it was downloaded on my Kindle, I was charged twice for one download and I have not been able to find anyone to help me with this.
5	1356739200	This book was great. Very hard to put down/ The Light Between Oceans is one fine read and I would recommend it for all.
4	1356652800	This novel explored a seldom visited topic. We all make decisions in our lives sooner or later that lead down a path we knew we shouldn't travel. But who is brave enough to face the consequences of our mistakes? The Light Between Oceans leaves you thinking about what happens to us when we excuse ourselves to make these poor choices, how to be brave in the consequences of those decisions, and reminds us that redemption is possible in light of our mistakes. Now who doesn't need to hear that at some point in your life?Thank you M L Stedman for making me cry, fear, love and endure with all of your characters! I have not learned so much about humans relationships from a novel since To Kill a Mockingbird! Approaching this novel with the desire to be in each characters shoes is what enabled me to walk away with so much more understanding and compassion for people, and their mistakes.
4	1356652800	While its not the best book I've ever read. I did love this book. Definitely a page turner. Get this!
4	1356652800	This book is so beautifully written, I could do it no justice in writing a review of it. A tale of love and lose and what happens in between the two; so beautiful and worth reading. You may want some tissues on hand, too.
5	1356652800	Extreme gradations of emotions artfully extracted from the characters by a very gifted writer makes you ponder the possibility that real-life personal tragedy has been a part of the author's life. I have recommended to several others who, likewise, felt the same.
5	1356652800	Two nights ago, I started, &#34;The Light Between Oceans,&#34; by M.L. Stedman, and I finished it this morning. Rarely do I find a book so completely compelling that I have to sing its praises, but this is that book. Who knew I was interested in Australia, post-traumatic stress of WWI soldiers, the inner workings and maintenance of light houses...or maybe it was the heartbreaking story of motherhood and loss. It's certainly not an easy read if you've ever lost a child, but, my God! You feel for every character in this story and the emotions it evoked from me were entirely surprising.
3	1356652800	I felt much of the plot was too predictable. The writing style,however, was nicely done,creating vivid images for the reader. I am glad to have read it,but not the best I've ever read.
5	1356652800	Great read. Wonderful descriptions. Heart wrenching circumstances. Don't know if I would have done differently than Tom and Izzy did.  I would recommend these to anyone.
4	1356652800	This was a good story of moral dilemmas, choices, and their consequences with empathetic characters.  It kept me engrossed throughout.
5	1356652800	Very engrossing story.  This book made for an excellent book club discussion. Hard to put it down once I started it..
4	1356652800	Great story.  Could not put it down from middle to end. I could relate to every character in the book. Extremely well written. I could almost smell the sea. I never knew how important lighthouses were and the sacrifices people made for our safety.
4	1356652800	My heart broke while reading this story of the love we have for our children. It kept me up at night tortured by what choice I would have made.
4	1356652800	This story touches your heart.  It makes you realize how one little fib can affect many different lives.  Even the best people can cause pain to others.  It was a little bit of a slow start to the story but it draws you in and holds your attention.
5	1356652800	Amazing writing - had me from the beginning.  Definitely worth reading another book by Stedman read it in about 3 days.
3	1356566400	THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS was well written, but what a terribly depressing story!  One character viciously cruel, another overly submissive.
5	1356566400	Intriguing and heartwarming. You want to get to the next page but don't want the book to end.want to eradicating.
5	1356566400	Good overcomes desperate decision to rescue child. Interesting portrayal of moral conflict and self serving need. It Kept my interest throughout withdevelopment of main characters.
4	1356566400	This book grabs your attention from it's beginning pages and holds it until the final page.  You find yourself trying to figure out how it ends even before you've read half of the book.  Would definitely recommend this.
5	1356566400	I've read many positive reviews on this debut novel, and final got a chance to experience it for myself -- I must say, I also enjoyed it a lot. It's the kind of story that engages the reader early on and doesn't disappoint.On an isolated island off the coast of Australia, Tom Sherbourne takes a job as the lighthouse keeper after he returns from the from war in 1918.  For Tom, the solitude on the island is just what he craves after seeing the horrors of war.  The only time he sees other people is every (3) months when supplies are delivered from the mainland.  When he meets and marries Isabel (Izzy), the two return to the island and life seems happy and less lonely for Tom.  Disappointments soon face the couple as Izzy suffers several miscarriages and desperately longs for a baby of their own.One day in 1926, a boat washes up on shore with a dead man on board.  A crying baby is found nearby. Who is the dead man and, where is the baby's mother?  Could this mysterious baby be the answer to the couple's prayers, or will a decision of the heart lead to more sadness in their lives?The Light Between Oceans was such a compelling read. Written in (3) parts with Tom as the main character, although the reader gets to know Izzy and other characters through their POV as well. The story will have readers quickly invested in the story and anxious to learn the outcome.  It's one of the books that will have readers talking about the book to others. It's also the type of book that would seem to make for a good movie as well.
2	1356566400	This was a tough book for me to read. I'm a mother, and a woman who has suffered through a miscarriage. It hit too close to home in quite a few places.
4	1356566400	Author wrote about maternal love, adoption, revenge, and forgiveness.  I found it interesting that the grandfather helped to bring the characters together.
4	1356566400	A good light reading experience. Well written and set in an unusual background with characters who are out of the ordinary
1	1356566400	I bought 3 kindle edition books for a family member for Christmas. The gift email was them forwarded to the intended person and they claimed the gift. We couldn't figure out how to get the book onto the kindle so we called amazon customer service and tried to get this thing straight. It took a little over an hour and 2 customer reps ( one manager). The outcome was this. Because i bought the gift from MY amazon account and had the emails sent to me at my email address ( they were purchased a week before Christmas so i forwarded them on Christmas day, this was an option when buying) and then sent them to another email address it wouldn't work. that makes no sense! Then i also didn't know that my recipient who has an amazon account under one email address had two different passwords. One for her and one for her husband. So the gifts were accepted on the Desktop logged into HER amazon and the kindle fire is registered under the SAME email address but different password (HIS NAME). I cant believe that they cant just simply FIX IT. Just get the books i gifted onto the kindle and we can call it a day. All they could do is credit the kindle account for the same money BUT I couldn't get the credit for one of the books because of some publisher nonsense..People all I'm saying amazon products are inferior to Apple, spend the extra 2 bills for a better device and less headaches and better apps. Apple customer service would have never taken that long and would have fixed it not to mention probably wouldn't have happened in the first place.
5	1356480000	This is the best book I've read in quite a while  The story kept my attention clear to the end.  Hated to have it end.
5	1356480000	I enjoyed this book!!  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. I was surprised by the ending, not what I expected at all.  A very good  read.  I have let a friend read this book, & she has also enjoyed it.
4	1356480000	Enjoyed the story very much, while learning some history of Australia and of lighthouse keepers and their work  The story was captivating
5	1356480000	I read this because it was on Oprah's Summer Reading list, and while I am not normally a fan of historical novels, and was not very intrigued by the story of a lighthouse keeper, I still read it.  Thank goodness I did, this was an excellent compelling story about how far a family will go to have the one thing they have always wanted.  It made me smile at the good times, and weep through the bad, which I haven't experienced from a book in a very long time.  I felt myself very attached to these characters, and having experienced the desire for a child for years, I completely related to the main characters.
4	1356480000	Beautifully written first novel by ML Stedman.  Enjoyed the texture of the story, especially the description of the small island and lighthouse.  You could feel the power of the sea and wind coupled with the stormy emotions and tortured souls of the characters.
3	1356480000	Starts well but midway through gives way to predictable plotting and the denouement drags out to a sentimental ending.  Fairly one dimensional characters, both women and men.
3	1356480000	I enjoyed the story, it's a good beach read. I  thought the actual writing was a little juvenile and story a  little predictable.
3	1356480000	This full of emotion and maybe more of a book for a woman.  Interesting if you like history and nature.  not the most exciting book.
5	1356393600	Great book! Very sad but definitely one of the best I've read in months. Well written with a good plot.
4	1356393600	THE LIGHT BETWEEN TWO OCEANS IS A GREAT STORY OF LIFE BEING PLAYED OUT AGAINST THE BACK DROP OF AN ISOLATED LIGHT HOUSE OFF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF AUSTRALIA.  DEPICTED ARTFULLY AND SYMPATHETICALLY ARE THE TRAGEDY AND GUILT OF SURVIVING A WORLD WAR,  REBIRTH AND HEALING WITH AN OFFER OF A NEW LIFE AND A PERSON TO SHARE IT WITH, LOSS OF A CHILD, AND THE UNBELIEVABLE (BUT PLAUSIBLE) MIRACLE OF A SECOND CHANCE,  AND  FINALLY DEVASTATION WHEN THE MIRACLE IS REVOKED AND FINALLY RESOLUTION AND ACCEPTANCE.  THERE ARE NO HAPPY ENDINGS IN THIS BOOK, , JUST THE LESSONS LEARNED  OF THE NEED TO GO ON.
3	1356393600	Predictable and very unrealistic plot line I had to skim throughout the end it got kind of boring the thought of a infant arriving to on a boat to a woman who just had miscarriage was a bit much to imagine happening
5	1356393600	This is one of those books where you know how it should end, but you keep hoping it won't end that way.  A book that pulls at your heartstrings.
5	1356307200	I absolutely loved this book. Amazing writing style, especially for a first novel. It is filled with beautiful metaphors and you can really picture yourself being there, out on that light house in the middle of the ocean. The book wasn't as &#34;sad&#34; and depressing to me as some of the other reviewers stated. Yes, it will make you sad at times and very emotional, but some of the characters are also very strong and give us hope. You also ask yourself, throughout the book, &#34;what would I do?&#34; And it is not always an easy question to answer. Wonderful, thought-provoking story!
4	1356307200	I enjoyed the setting because it was in Australia.  The expressions of language which typify Australia.  The probing into why and how decisions are made and characters formed seemed real.
4	1356307200	The story was very well written and held my interest as I had no idea what the outcome would be.  Love that in a book!  Would recommend as good reading.
5	1356307200	This could be the best book I have read this year. I could not put it down  and friends I recommended it to felt the same way.
5	1356307200	I had a friend who read this book first. Her description of it made me want to read it even more. It was fantastic....i would recommend every woman read this book.
4	1356307200	Enjoyed the book very much though it is sad at times.  A very different storyline and keeps your interest till the end.
4	1356220800	This was such a haunting book, one that truly stays with you long after you finish reading. It's hard to fault Tom and Isabel or not feel sorry for Hannah, but it really makes you think of what you would do in the same situation.
4	1356220800	Great character development and never wanted to put it down.  A must read for everyone - love the backdrop of the setting and  time period.
4	1356220800	The Light Between Oceans shows the readers a very untypical and isolated way of life. It shows how isolation may change your way of thinking and the devesation of that choice.
3	1356220800	The story was interesting but not one I would highly recommend.  If you're looking for an easy, quick read, it's fine.
5	1356220800	This is a very well written novel with a captivating story.  I could not put it down.  The story is not predictible and the characters are interesting.
3	1356220800	I loved 3/4 of this novel.  However, the conclusion, and the events leading up to it, fell flat in my opinion.
4	1356134400	our Book Club choice for January - good light read - informative alsowould recommend it for those seeking light entertainment
5	1356134400	I loved it.  Well written.....terrific plot.  you couldn't help but be on that wonderful small island, and terribly caught up in the agony of giving up the child.
5	1356134400	Loved the characters-with all their flaws. Beautiful description of Janus. Wanted to be there. Sad but satisfactory ending. Would be a good book to discuss.
5	1356134400	One of my favorite books this year.The plot and characters pull you in right from the start.I recommend this one to anyone who likes to read.
3	1356048000	Predictable and disappointing. Found the end to be the most enjoyable part of the book although sad. Was not a big fan.
5	1356048000	This was a book i could not forget. I could feel the emotioins of the characters as I read. The story  was sad but in total had  a good ending.
5	1356048000	This book was not what I had expected it to be, but I love it!  Like an interesting soap opera.
4	1356048000	This book was an easy read. Made you think about each side, if you lost a child and how you would handle a situation.
4	1356048000	This first novel from Stedman is beautifully written. It is very unique in its storyline and occasionally dark, but absolutely intriguing. I am looking forward to new novels from her.
5	1356048000	This book was so beautifully written with great character development, intriguing and quite believable plot line, with an accurate depiction of the ironies of conflicting emotions in marriage and life.  At times I actually found myself talking out loud to the characters while reading, I was that caught up in the story!  Closing the last page was like saying good-bye to family members.  I will be looking for more from this author.
4	1356048000	Excellent story line. Took a little time to get started but did enjoy it  and cried ! I only recommend books I like. I knew it was due back to library soon so I rushed through the middle but couldn't wait to get to the end.
4	1355961600	This was really well written, but a hard subject for anyone with children.The characters are fleshed out so you got to know them well.The plot is intriguing and the theme isn't one you'd find anywhere.
5	1355961600	I really enjoyed this book.  The story is a unique one and the characters are complex and develop throughout the story.
5	1355961600	I did not read this book straight through; first because it was so awesome and beautifully written that I felt the need to re-read so many passages, and second, because I just didn't want it to end too soon. I felt that I came to know each main character and what they were feeling, and I struggled with them as they made their difficult decisions, and rejoiced with them in their better days. I plan to buy a hardcover copy of this to keep with other books I enjoy holding and reading again from time to time. I feel richer for having read it.
5	1355961600	This was a well developed story. I was thoroughly involved in the story. The twists and turns had me on the edge of my chair. At one point I found myself crying out when I thought the main character would sacrifice her husband. I highly recommend this book.
5	1355961600	Extraordinary, beautifully written, intriging, emotional and fascinating story which I enjoyed from beginning to end.One of those books you don't want it to finish.
5	1355961600	The writing is exquisite as the story unfolds holding your undivided attention from beginning to end. When you have reached that destination, divided between the thirst for more and certain frustration in the knowledge that all good things must end, you may wish to start from the beginning. One of those priceless books you may revisit.
5	1355961600	LOVED THE STORY LINE, WELL WRITTEN, KEPT ME INTERESTED ALL THE WAY,  I DID NOT WANT IT TO END !
3	1355961600	Very intriguing topic. Many questions raised , however the two principal characters are not developed . They are too two dimensional and simplified.  Some acts  of the main characters are well handled but some not at all understandable or the reasons seem to be too simplified and superficial. Can be a good book for a Winter evening
5	1355961600	A well written book that keeps your interest, strong loveable characters. You enter tha characters life and feel the conflictilng values of love and commitment.
5	1355961600	How the actions of 1 can literally ripple across oceans. Well told.  Buy kleenex with this book.  It would make a great book club selection... great discussions!
5	1355961600	This is a really good book.  One of the best I have read lately. Started reading it late one evening.  Mistake..  I didn't want to put it down.... Everyone likes something different but I believe you will not be disappointed by this one.  Can't wait to read something else by this author.
5	1355961600	I gained a deep sense of place and time from this intriguing tale of love and mystery. The technical part dealing with lighthouse maintenance was very interesting and informative. Because it was so detailed the reader could imagine being right there as he climbs the many stairs to the gallery. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be transported to another time and place through well chosen words.
5	1355961600	I was skeptical when I started to read.  West Coast of Australia, lighthouse island, then marriage, big twist to the tale and a compelling story of the struggle of right & good.  If no one knows about it, is it really wrong?I got 3/4 through & it became so compelling I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book for any woman or man with a heart.  It will break yours!
4	1355875200	I really enjoyed this book. We read it for our book club and had a very good discussion.Very well writen.
5	1355875200	The writing of this book is superb, I really felt that I knew the characters in the book and the places described.  The story line was excellent -This book can change lives
4	1355875200	Liked the book and the charachters and the descriptions of the locations & scenery - made a good conversation for book clubs
5	1355875200	I really enjoyed this book, and it showed all sides of the story and I felt empathy for all the characters and their actions.
1	1355875200	I had sent the exact product numer of my vacuum cleaner but the hose you sent did not fit it.
3	1355875200	This book was entertaining,  but it was obvious from the beginning what was going to happen, which made it a bit tedious to read at times.  Overall not a bad book,  but not one of my favorites.
4	1355875200	I learned about what life is like being the wife of a lighthouse keeper. The characters were people I cared about. Tough decisions needed to be made under very difficult circumstances. I could identify with both Isabel and the mother of the child. Heartbreaking for both. I would recommend this book. I think women would probably like it better than a man.
5	1355875200	This book peaked your curiousity.  i kind of wish the ending were different, but really it couldn't be.I didn't know being a lighthouse keeper was so technical.
4	1355875200	great love story about a families choice between their happiness and the happiness  Mother of their orphaned child.Great flow, quick read, kept me wanting to read on!!
5	1355875200	What a great novel! The authors debut and what a debut it was. I felt the characters and all their emotions. Rach and every single one of them. I felt their joy and their pain. This story may be a sad one but it doesn't make it any less intriguing. Halfway though the book I layed my other books aside to focus on this one alone. After three miscarriages a boat shows up with a dead man and a baby... From there the story kicks off and doesn't let down. Makes one think hard about the choices we make and the consequences they bring. I highly recommend this book.
5	1355875200	given the same circumstances, what would you do? A thought provoking read......i might have ended it differently. A definite worthwhile read!
5	1355875200	A poignant story lyrically written.  Is there moral certainty in an uncertain world? A book that will keep you remembering and thinking long after you have finished it.
5	1355875200	A real page turner, thought provoker ... what would anyone do in the same circumstances? My heart went out to all.
4	1355875200	Unique story.  Wondered how it would end. There were some parts that dragged on a little bit but overall enjoyed the book very much.
4	1355875200	It was a great read, even though it had made me mad at the husband but if it wasn't for that there wouldn't have been this book!
4	1355875200	I really enjoyed the characters and the story line. I found I kept thinking about the book long after I finished reading it!
5	1355875200	Well written, attention keeping, with characters and a situation you can relate to - love by many, possession by few.
3	1355788800	A great read. I could mentally picture each and every word of the story. There were quite a few dramatic moments with abrupt resolutions. Nevertheless, it would make a good movie.-G.Race
5	1355788800	For me, this was a 'could barely put it down' type of book.  It was a great first novel by this author.
4	1355788800	I enjoyed this book.  Knowing nothing about lighthouses, the education that I rec'd in this interesting setting, made it all the better.  This was our book club pick, and it created great conversation, feelings, and would recommend it to others!
4	1355788800	Well written, believable characters. Illustrates the mess you can get into when you try to hide something big. I had empathy for all of the characters involved in this heart wrenching situation.
5	1355702400	A very interesting book which raises ethical issues with no easy answers.  Multi layered characters who are well drawn and act and react with unpredictable behaviors.  This book was read by our book group and provoked prolonged and  intense discussions regarding &#34;the right thing to do&#34;.  I would highly recommend this book.
3	1355702400	we read this for our book group and we had a very lively debate about it. Not lenghty and an easy read
5	1355616000	I loved this book. Filled with emotion and suspense I didn't want it to end! M.L. Stedman weaves a gripping tale of love, loss and despair.
5	1355616000	This book is an example of good storytelling.  I found myself totally captivated (having conversations in my head with the various characters).  The last few pages ended in a good cry.  It's been a while since a book made me feel this way, thank you!
5	1355616000	This is a wonderful story and had it been written more than 50 years ago, it would surely be a Classic today.I can't remember the last book that brought me to tears at the end.  I recommend this to young as well as mature readers. Great book for discussion groups.
5	1355616000	ML Stedman is beautifully descriptive, without being wordy.  The diction and writing style painted the details of the scenes that created vivid pictures in my head.  This character-built plot it thoroughly engaging and kept my interest without the use of gruesome, sexual or action-packed situations that plague contemporary books.  I consider this book to be a contemporary classic.
4	1355616000	This book is exceedingly well written with excellent character development and exceptional storytelling.  The author weaves back and forth between e past and the present seamlessly, creating a rich plot line that draws you in.So why not 5 stars?Well, you just knew that when Lucy wasn't returned to her rightful family that the wouldn't run out well.  However, because of the strength of the story and characters there was always a sense of foreboding.  The twists and turns towards the end brought the story to a solid conclusion, if a bit predictable.  Still, I really enjoyed this book.
5	1355529600	Pulled me in from the start.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Not your run of the mill story.  Recommended!
3	1355529600	A sad tale about a simple couple and their devastating losses. Well written and hard to put down, but leaves you heavyhearted.
3	1355529600	That lighthouses could be so fascinating...I loved those descriptions the best.  The author did a nice job of delineating the emotional/moral complexities so that no character could be consistently judged as bad or even good....
4	1355529600	There are so many ways this story could have gone.  I loved reading it and trying to figure out which way it would go.  I love the writing style and all of the hidden stories within the main story, which one would really play a major part?  Very sad much of the time but I still could not put it down, I had to know if I had it figured out.  (So many books I do and just read to verify).  I did not get it figured out so that makes it a good read for me.  Loved the setting and the time period from a different point of view than many books during that time period.
5	1355443200	The details in the book make you feel you are there, between two oceans, you can hear the sounds of the ocean against the rocks, while the sun beams its warmth against you. This book has love, compassion, impacts of great loss and the choices the characters make that will change their lives forever.  Great read &#8211; Loved it
5	1355443200	This book is very well written and enjoyable. The characters are well developed and the plot offers suspense and mystery.I enjoyed reading it because the descriptions used by the author brought not only the characters alive but also the scenery of the surroundings where the characters lived.
5	1355443200	A family is torn apart by such want.  Shows the extent love of a spouse gives to have happiness.  Enjoyed reading the workings of a old fashioned lighthouse. The book kept my attention with each chapter.
5	1355356800	I rarely find a book to emerse myself into curious of the outcome. This was fluid, graphic and touched every facet of humanity through the Austrailian backrop.
5	1355356800	One of the best books I have read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  I recommend it highly.
5	1355356800	This story was so touching.  It broke my heart, for everyone involved. The characters were so pure with their intentions.
4	1355270400	I liked the setting (between the World Wars in Australia) and the place where most of the book takes place - a light house between the Indian and Southern oceans.
4	1355270400	I found this to be a good read once the story really got started.  This book tool me through every emotion and the ending was different.
3	1355270400	Some moral issues to contemplate made this book somewhat interesting.  Didn't like the ending.....felt the handling of the child wasn't very realistic.
5	1355270400	Loved this book....a little sad...but well written and memorable.  I would recommend this to other readers who would like something different in a storyline.
4	1355184000	Good read just not the best. The kind of book I didn't mind setting down and returning to later. If you read many books put it on your list. If you only have time for one look for another.
3	1355184000	I know this book had great reviews but I found it too predictable.  I loved all the details about lighthouses,  but it seemed to drag as things went on and then sort of fizzle at the end.  Guess it just wasn't my &#34;cup of tea&#34;.
4	1355184000	The life style required of a keeper has always been interesting - isolation, the stormy sea, many chores to keep the light going. The story was hard to read as I could understand all the sad choices involved. Love and devotion against duty and integrity.
3	1355097600	This is a good story about life in an isolated situation and the extremes that people can reach trying to cope with the difficulties of life.
4	1355097600	This is a good story, well told.  It engaged me from the onset and kept me hooked.  The prose is beautiful.  The author sets up a conflict which she handles in a sophisticated manner; that is, she creates a problem which could not be satisfactorily resolved for each of the interested parties, but does not pander to the protagonists.  This is a book which will be a gift choice for my favorite reader this holiday season.
5	1355097600	An incredible bittersweet story. A story line that spans years yet the pages turn quickly. Well developed characters. A truly great read.
3	1355097600	This book gets 3 stars because I found the information about lighthouses and lighthouse living to be interesting.I also found the book to be very readable.  The sentences flowed nicely and the writing was pretty good.However, the plot annoyed me.  The entire book focused on this one dilemma, and it was rehashed over and over ad nauseum.I didn't see much in the way of character development, though I suppose that in the end, Izzy finally seems capable of empathy.
4	1355097600	I really liked the book but wasn't so crazy about the ending. It was a quick read and very interesting. I'd recommend it.
5	1355011200	Though the beginning of the book was a tad bit slow developing the characters and the storyline, it was well worth the wait.  When the storyline is finally developed, you have become so acquanted with the characters that you feel you are one of them.  And then the story really gets good.  It holds you.  It captivates you.  It makes you want more and more.  Then it hurts you.  It makes you wonder.  It makes you despair.  It makes you happy.  You are making decisions inside your own mind all the while asking:  what would I do.  This is well worth the read.  It's five stars in my book.
4	1355011200	A book which makes one reflect on the decisions made by various individuals.  What would I do in the same situation?  One ends up feeling it is a tragedy for all involved.
4	1355011200	An interesting story about a different era with many of the same issues that we address today love heartache children
5	1355011200	This book touched my heart in many ways.  Last night as I finished reading the book, I tearfully hated to see it end!! As a mother of two who struggled with many miscarriages and later adopted, I sympathized with both women in this story and their sad situation they found themselves involved in. The only complaint I have about this book is that it is the author's only book so far. I look forward to the day when she writes another. Excellent story!! Now off to find another to read :)
5	1355011200	I loved this work of historical fiction and couldn't put it down. It's a sad but loving story. Still thinking about it weeks after I finished it. Highly recommended
2	1354924800	I read this book because it had been recommended by others to a friend in my book club. The plot concept is interesting, and the setting of time and place captivating. The writing starts out to be engaging, but loses its way in the middle. I found the random changes in verb tense from one paragraph to the next to be extremely annoying and distracting, detracting from the better elements of the book. I tried to determine whether it was supposed to be some sort of literay device and concluded it was poor writing and editng.  As another reviewer asked, why was this ever published? And why is it selling so well and rated so highly? Also, having recently read The Forgotten Garden, I am curious about all of these young children who keep showing up alone in boats in Australia and then are taken in and raised by people who are determined not to reveal that they are not actually the parents, instead living in fear of being discovered. ;)
5	1354924800	I would give this book more stars if I could. One of the best I have read in a long time. I loaded it on my Kindle and when I finished, I went out and bought it so I could loan it out. Everyone has loved it. I recommend it to anyone who is wanting a good book to read.
4	1354924800	I would recommend this book as a wonderfully written piece of literature.  It kept me close to the story.  This is real life.  I can see both sides of this problem.  I'm not going to reveal the plot because that is the whole story.  Sad but human. Loved it.  I recommend it highly.M. Dunne
3	1354924800	I was moved to underline some the descriptions as they were quite beautiful.  Interesting premiss for the story and thoughtful questions raised about choices made and living with guilt and consequences.  It dragged somewhat and I tired of so many references to the operation of the lighthouse....I get that he kept the machinery in perfect order, but couldn't do the same for his life, no need to beat the dead horse.  All in all an easy read for an afternoon. It's more of a short story where I prefer something I can live in for days, seeing depth of characters unfold and develop.
4	1354924800	It's a great story. I cried my eyes out and I'm not the kind of person that cries with books or movies.This story warms your heart and it makes you hate, love, feel resentful all at the same time. I gave it 4 stars only because it starts very slow and at first I even stop reading it and began another book nut I went back to it because i don't like leaving books like that and I ended up loving it
4	1354924800	I enjoyed this book very much. I would have liked to see it end differently, but the story was very good.
5	1354924800	I finished this book over 2 months ago, and still think about the characters in the story and their very complicated lives.  People make mistakes, and this book follows persons who are very human, and make mistakes, make corrections. and then .......(no spoilers here.)
5	1354838400	One of the best books I've ever read.  The reader is taken on a journey that challenges the justification of good and evil - all through the book.
2	1354838400	I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It wasn't that it was bad it just also wasn't good. I felt like for the time I spent reading it you can definitely find something better.
5	1354838400	I loved this book.  It held my interest.  I found I was often thinking about the story.  If I had to put it down, I could not wait to get back to it.  What an unusual storyline.  I would have ended it differently, but it is an unusual story and very well done.
5	1354838400	This book kept me on the hook from start to finish.  Could never tell for sure which way it was going to go, which I liked.  I highly recomend it.
4	1354752000	I enjoyed the opportunity to read something taking place in a different part of the world. The scenes at the lighthouse were both barren and beautiful The reader can understand the lure of the distant South Pacific.
4	1354752000	It is a very well written book and kept me interested. I dont usually like this kind of book but i had a hard time putting it down.
5	1354752000	A very moving story about the impact of choces we make in our lives.  I would recommend to all adults.
4	1354752000	I found the beginning a little slow but by the end this book had me crying (it's good for the sinuses) it ended very different then I expected.
4	1354752000	a real page turner, i kept reading to find out the ending to this little girls life as well as the lives of other characters who were all enterwined in one anothers lives, a great read!
5	1354752000	The Light Between OceansWonderful book. Although her first time novel, the writing has you rereading descriptive phrases because they are so unique, but without any superficial fluff. I referred it to my wife who also loved it.JF
5	1354752000	Loved the history in the story line.  Could not put the book down. Strongly recommend book to other avid readers!
5	1354665600	This story will touch your heart!  The decisions we make in life are those that control our entire future.  Great read!.
4	1354665600	This book was a little slow at times but was a good read.  If you are an avid reader, this is a good book for you.  If you don't read a lot, may be a difficult read for you.  Nonetheless, I enjoed this book.
4	1354665600	Poetic-like prose tells the engrossing tale of a lighthouse keeper, his wife, and their "daughter" in post World War I off the western coast of Australia. Definitely recommend.
3	1354665600	The Light Between Oceans is an ok book, great for book club where you only want to discuss the book alittle so you can move on to the latest movie and celebrity happenings. The characters never seem to grab my heartstrings much, and the ending was pretty much what you'd expect, with alittle twist.
5	1354665600	Absolutely loved it! The images and emotional turmoil described in this book are so vivid. Interesting read on WWI Australia.
5	1354665600	I really enjoyed this book.  It was hard to put down.  It had a different story line for me.  It deserves the great reviews.
5	1354665600	After adopting two children, I could relate with with the writings my the arthor. I felt the heartache that is felt by a woman who has trouble with carrying a child. I recommended this to my adopted daughter.
3	1354665600	Close to being all out chick lit. Far out plot line. But, I did finish it, hince the 3 stars.
5	1354665600	This is one of the finest books I have read in a long time. I enjoyed it from beginning to end and found myself empathizing with the viewpoint of each character. I would recommend this book to anyone; male or female and I am looking forward to Stedman's next literary effort.
3	1354579200	The author did a fine job revealing the moral dilemma a bit at a time.  Enjoyable book.  some of the descriptive passages were quite good.  even at the end of the book... was the right choice made??
1	1354579200	The idea is interesting, but I felt that I was reading a very, very old story..It's almost as if sthe author has written the book from a bad movie script.
3	1354579200	a litgtle too sad, i cried at the end.not transcending.The story  and ending were a lillte predictable,still i enjoyed reading this book
4	1354492800	was a little slower pace, but i liked it.  interesting about their lives and living with decisions you make and questioning if they are the right ones.  Believable.  A little different then the same old so i enjoyed it. Explaining how he got to be a light house man and what life was like on the island was unique.
5	1354492800	I just loved this book.  It just reached out and grabbed me from the very beginning.  Yes, it's sad and, yes, I cried a little at the end.  I thought the story moved along well and the prose in this book is almost poetry.  Such a beautiful way with words.  I delayed reading the last two chapters for two days because I couldn't stand to finish the book.  For me, it was that kind of book.
4	1354492800	After reading the reviews for this book I wasn't sure I wanted to spend my time on a sad book, but I read it anyway for the sake of book club and was pleasantly surprised. The writing was engaging and I was drawn into the characters as well as the storyline. It was a bit uncomfortable watching the main characters make decisions that were certain not to turn out well, but that helped ease the sadness factor. The book also raised obvious but interesting ethics questions. All in all a worthwhile read.
4	1354492800	I loved this book because the emotions of the characters were so identifiable for me.  The love, the struggle, the pain and mostly the joy of loving a child.  I will never forget this story!
3	1354492800	I was very excited to read this book as there was something about it that seemed &#34;special&#34;.  It was a solidly good read until the two thirds point where the story started to be disapointing.  The ending became predictable and the uniqueness dimmed.  With apologies..,,,,,
3	1354492800	Good story, but kinda sappy, was not all that liking it - just not my cup of tea.  Would not recommend to others.
3	1354406400	The book was a little slow the first half. Towards the end could not put it down, captivated by Isabel's moral dilema and what she would decide, not to mention Hannah 's choices that would impact Tom & Isabels fate.
5	1354406400	This book, while heart-breaking, is a great read.  It has a lot of opportunity for discussion in a book club setting.  You are rooting for one character and then begin to find out more about another and then you root for them, etc.  Beautifully written and an amazing story as well.
5	1354320000	Suggested this for my book club. It was loved by all. So much to think about. First novel by this author? Sure hope she writes another real soon. What happens when good people make bad decisions. Characters very well developed. Lovely read!
5	1354320000	This book captured my attention from the first page. the characters are well developed and the descriptions of life on Janus are magical.
2	1354320000	I think this book must have been edited to death.  ok in some spots and lacking in others.  I only finished reading it because I paid for it.
5	1354320000	Great reading, well written, different, lot to discuss at a book club, a little of everything, mystery, love, sadness, enlighting
4	1354233600	this book was excellent. The story was different  definitely  not  novel that you can guess the ending. The author 's prose was delightful. It held my interest and was one of the few reads that I could not put down.  i highly reccomend it
4	1354233600	All the good aspects of an enjoyable story.  Characters are compelling, story is gripping, not formula story line...the plot could have taken many different directions.  I'm recommending to my friends.
5	1354233600	Was a great story, interesting for place and topic. How adopted children can be loved so thoroughly and without question.
4	1354233600	While probably particularly appealing to women, this is a haunting tale of love and loss, right and wrong, and the results of decisions made. The characters are richly drawn and will draw you into their lives and move you.
5	1354233600	I loved this book--a real page turner! It was recommended by a friend and I wasn't disappointed.  I plan to buy more copies for gifts.
4	1354233600	Life with  the light what a powerful narrative vivid description of Janus you feel and hear both oceans. Beautifully written story is so rich with love how your decisions always affect others in  this case tragically.
5	1354147200	Holds your interest and passion for the people until the very end...one of my best reads of this year.. A VERY FRESH  NEW STORY  OF LIFE CHALLENGES...
3	1354147200	It got draggy at the end of the book.A little overkill of the description of the management of the lighthouse.
3	1354147200	A decent story but the theme of the book drags on and on with very little of the story line changing
5	1354147200	The depth of character development makes this story feel real. Even the era plays a role in how each character reacts to the decisions they have to make. While this is definitely an internal struggle for each, the story unfolds in a thrilling gallop. Give the beginning a little patience. It will be worthwhile.
5	1354060800	The characters are unique and the story is captivating.  I did want to scream, though, when the main character &#34;does the right thing.&#34; Their lives are isolated yet full and when the gift appears on the beach, one cannot help but be happy even though you know it is the result of someone else's profound loss.  The Lighthouse itself becomes a character in this intriguing novel, beautifully, beautifully written.
3	1354060800	The emotions captured by the author foreach character were excellent.  Being amother who lost two babies shortly afterbirth, I could definitely identify withthe inborn need of a mother to have achild to hold and love.  At the same time my heart was broken for the motherwho lost a child and a husband.I could understand the deep feelings ofthe husband, being a man of character,but also a man who loved his wife dearly.  Also, it was obvious that sooner or later there would be a reckoning day.I thought that the plot was obvious andeventually, it became somewhat overdone.  It took me longer than usualto complete this book, because I becamesomewhat bored before it was finished.
5	1354060800	I give this a 5 star rating partly because the more I read, the more interested I became and the harder it was to put down. About halfway through I could not read it quickly enough! Isabel and Thomas marry and move to Janus, an island with no other inhabitants, so he may tend to the lighthouse there. She suffers several miscarriages when a boat washes onshore with a deceased man and a newborn. She convinces her husband to make a choice that will change their lives forever. Her husband is unable to live with the compelling mixture of fierce love for this baby girl and the guilt that slowly eats away at him. He then makes a decision that will alter the course of their lives and test the love they have for one another. I appreciated the flow of the story and how real the characters were. I found it very surprising that I felt as much compassion for Isabel as I did the birth mother. As a new mother to a 3 month old, perhaps it's the lingering hormones but I cried at the end. There is no greater love than a mother has for her child.
4	1354060800	I like beer, I fart, and I watch a lot of football.  Does that define who I am?  Maybe.  I enjoyed this book.  The story moved slow enough to keep track and fast enough to keep going back for more.  Highly suggest this book to those that foster\adopt or thinking of doing so.  Its a small taste of what its like, good and bad.
4	1354060800	Beautifully descriptive writing by the author that puts you right in the scenery.  A very thought provoking and heart-wrenching story.
4	1354060800	We read this in our book club.  Everyone was tearing their hair out over the no-win situation of these poor characters.  All of them!  Absolutely heartbreaking.  The ending was too slow.  Too agonizing.
3	1354060800	Good book, a little hard to get into at first.  I wish the ending had worked out a little different, but the author did take the time to wrap the story up nicely.
5	1354060800	Loved this book.  Could not put it down!  It is a well-written novel showing a mother's struggle for the love of a child.  Must read!
4	1354060800	I did not like the ending--it seemed rushed and perhaps not as faithful to the main characters as it might have been.  As with all good books, maybe I was just wishing it would not end and &#34;those people&#34; with whom I had become so involved would be out of my life.
5	1354060800	This was just simply the best book I have read in years. I don't want to even start another book because I still have this one on my mind and I know all the books I read for quite a while will pale in comparison. I went through every emotion that all of the characters experienced because they were just so real to me. The author made it so easy to clearly visualize every detail of the lighthouse, the town, the characters, even the flora and weather in western Australia. A really good book is priceless and this was one of them! This will be in my top ten.
4	1354060800	You have to keep reading to find out what vbasically good people do when morally challenged.Life at a lighthouse well defined.
5	1353974400	This novel keeps your attention.  It grabs you with the first page and does not let go until you reach the last page.
5	1353974400	This story has a very interesting twist.  It is set post WWI, and provides some interesting historical insight into the time period.  The characters are very human - flawed, complicated, sometimes lovable and sometimes not.  Those who enjoy historical fiction and a gripping story will find this hard to put down.
5	1353974400	Did not know this author but found I liked this one a lot. A good story for those who love the ocean, islands, boats and lighthouses. May bring a tear to your eyes.
5	1353974400	As a mother, this book was relatable from both Izzy and Hannah's point of view. It was a beautiful yet dark look at love from so many angles and across so many relationships. The characters were complex and the setting was interesting and beautifully detailed.
5	1353974400	This is a beautiful story- once I started reading I had a hard time putting it down! The characters are very real and relatable. Although some of the characters are at odds with eachother, I found myself sympathetic with each one. The story brings up very deep questions of right and wrong, and how blurred those lines can be. Even days after finishing the book, I'm still imagining the scenery as described and thinking about how I would have acted if I were a character in this situation. This is a book you won't soon forget.
4	1353974400	This book was not a quick read for me.Not just because its somewhat predictable, but because halfway through it Hurricane Sandy came and I no longer had a kindle!Three weeks and one new kindle later, I finished. I laughed, I cried- boy did I cry during the last few chapters! - The author draws the reader so intricately into the main characters emotions that I feel like I can feel their loneliness and sadness.The seemingly dark and depressing storyline has a hopeful undertone symbolized by the lighthouse- the light that just keeps going through good times and wars, generation after generation, even through devastating hurricanes like the one I just lived through.  I love that!
5	1353888000	This was a moving story with unexpected twists.  Shows the harsh realities of life and the patience of love.  A page turner.
4	1353888000	Enjoyed this book because it was so much more than just a love story, which I don't usually read.  This book actually had a mystery to it which you just have to see how it all turns out.
4	1353888000	The Light Between Oceans  Heart renching!  This was a most enjoyable story.  Fascinating information on lighthouses entwined with a bitter sweet family saga.
3	1353888000	This is a story about the choices we make and how our conscience affects us.  It was an enjoyable read with good character development, but it became a bit long and tedious in the last third of the novel.  No surprises.
4	1353888000	I couldn't put this book. TIt was so unique. I learned alot about lighthouses.Would like to read more by this author.The caracters were so warm and full of life. May read it again.
4	1353888000	It grabs you in the very beginning and develops into a well intentioned story. I liek that it was set in Austraila
5	1353888000	I really loved this story.  My heart broke for the husband during the whole book.  He was just trying to do the right thing and it really backfired on him.  I have recommended this book to my book club even though I have already read it because I want to discuss it with them in detail.
5	1353888000	The characters, the setting, the plot- all work together to create a memorable and moving story that you don't know how it will all end.
4	1353801600	The time and place for the setting of this novel was what I particularly liked.  It was a out of the ordinary and interesting to read about.  The characters were developed well and stayed true throughout.
5	1353801600	I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new storyline, who enjoys historical fiction, and who appreciates a love story with a bit of a twist.  Well written!
5	1353801600	I loved this book because I felt the emotions of the characters and the events in the story were very difficult to resolve. Since the  time frame was just after WWI, the solution to the problems may have been dealt in a different manner especially with what we have learned about child development and psychology. This book was multilayered and deeply thought provoking.The main character is Tom Sherbourne a survivor of the horrors of World War I who like many survivors carries around a burden of guilt that he survived when so many others did not. This feeling permeates the story line and guides his actions in the course of the story.He meets and falls in love with a local girl, Isabelle, who has lost 2 older brothers to the war. She remains spirited and carefree and is determined to marry Tom. They marry and move to an very isolated island in Western Australia where Tom is the keeper of the lighthouse. Knowing nothing nor having ever given thought to lighthouse maintenance, this part of the book was very interesting. The two of them are isolated and have only each other to depend on. I was intrigued about the life they made and how their love blossoms and grows. We get to know Isabelle and Tom and experience the bliss of their union and then the utter heartache they experience when Isabelle has miscarriages and gives birth to a stillborn. They are alone with their suffering and somehow survive.Suddenly a boat washes up to the island with a dead man and a living infant girl. With both intense emotion and overwhelming need, they raise Lucy as their own. Then the author sets up a twist in the story and the true nightmare begins taking the reader on an emotional roller coaster.As no deed goes unpunished, the book takes us down a very sad road. I hate to elaborate and ruin the reader by giving too many facts and the plot. This books wakes up one's own conscience and the right and wrongs of life. I found it spellbinding and horrific. I look forward to my book club discussion on the issues posed by ML Stedman. The author has done a masterful job where the reader can feel the depth of love, emotion, parenting, and sadness felt by her characters.
5	1353801600	I read this family saga months ago and still am caught up in the emotions and anguish from a world I knew little about.  Integrity, loyalty and  commitment prove to carry the reader through a roller coaster of  ride in Australia.
4	1353715200	It's easy to get caught up in the love story between these two individuals.  And yet, it keeps you on the edge wondering whethering it can really last.
5	1353715200	ML Stedman weaves a story of love, hope and loss that speaks directly to your heart.  This is a wonderfully moving tale of life and loss and learning to live with the decisions made.  Keep a few tissues handy!
4	1353715200	Good book starts out a little slow, but then really grabs you.It made me cry. Good converstion's for book clubs.
5	1353715200	Not only a compelling story, but written with prose that sings- melodic, lyrical, breathtaking.  I will be recommending this book to anyone who will listen.
4	1353715200	The author totally transports you to this unusual and unique area of the world and the world's oceans between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.  Can't give it 5 stars due to some unnecessary plot twists.  Interesting ethical questions presented without judgement.
5	1353715200	This is the best book I've read in a long time.  Kept my interest from beginning to end.  Even a tear jerker in some parts.
5	1353715200	This book was a favorite for the members of our book club.  Awesome, thought provoking story.  Great character development and great book for discussion.
4	1353715200	Loved it!I chose this book for my Book Club this month and everyone loved it! Beautiful story, great characters and a compelling discussion. Have already recommended this book to all my friends.
5	1353715200	Light Between Oceans is worth your time and money to read.  Every character in this book is a good person, none would do anything evil.  This book is about the choices the characters make, some wise, some unfortunate for themselves and others and some that are unforgetable. Tom Sherbourne returns to Australia after a bloody war.  A career as a lighthouse keeper appealed to him. He later marries Isabel, who joins him on the island.  The couple is happy but want a family to complete their life. After having two miscarriages and a still birth, Isabel grieves for a baby. One day a boat washes up onshore carrying a dead man and a healthy living baby.  Isabel is only to willing to give this hungry baby her breast.  What follows is a brillant story of happiness, conflict, honor.  This should be a must read for high school students.
2	1353715200	Information on Australia and a lighthouse keeper's life was interesting, but the storyline itself didn't capture my attention at all.
5	1353715200	Love love love! Such a,beautiful sweet story. I felt every emotion with the ,beautiful descriptions from the author. Amazing read
5	1353628800	Another good book that I could not put down.  I loved the characters and the little girl sounded priceless.  Sorry they could not keep her!!
5	1353628800	This book touched my heart in a way that most of my recent reading has not.  My sympathies moved from one character to another and my emotions were tugged every way possible.
5	1353628800	All the reviews seem to be written by women readers of this book and I can see the attraction, as it ticks all the boxes with romance, heart break and family. But the Tom character is a fascinating man, who suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome seeks isolation offshore and manages to stay sane by living within the rule book of lighthouse management. Isabel saves him from slipping away into madness and becomes his lighthouse, guiding him back from the horrors of war and living with him out on the rock where they tend the light and build a life for themselves. Tragedy visits them and slowly pressure builds to where Isabel persuades Tom to break the rules to give her the child she so desperately wants. Things start to implode from here on in as one lie becomes the wedge between them...........
4	1353542400	Story line draws you in to the conflict between the desires of the heart and the urge to please and the black and white constraints of the law.  Could not put it down.
4	1353456000	This book was well written with descriptive language that brought the characters and their struggles to life.  Look past the lack of plausibility and enjoy being transported to a distant country and a time gone by.
5	1353456000	Very enjoyable book.  Characters were complex but wonderful.  Picked this book up and couldn't put it down.  You could understand all sides to the story.
5	1353456000	Although this is an extremely heart wrenching story, it is the most beautifully written and gripping novel I've read in years.  Brava, Ms. Stedman! I hope you write another--soon!
5	1353456000	Was in Melbourne Australia when I read this book.  The lighthouse that is center focus is off the coast nearby Melbourne. Love, selfishness and pride are shown in each character.  A great and easy read.
5	1353456000	I have read a lot of books in my time..I think this is one book that I could not put down...I was right there on the island..loved ait!!
5	1353369600	Wow I loved this book. It's all about the choices we make and how lies and choices snowball into something huge. Rich characters. Well written.
4	1353369600	It got a bit slow at times, not quite as good as I expected.  I think the idea was better than the actual book.
5	1353369600	As a reader / writer, I am constantly in search of new literature that really does change readers.  This book is amazing - a sort of modern classic.  I can't forget it.  I've recommended it widely, and it's been just as widely received by my friends.  Beautifully written, poignant, sometimes gritty, and often profound, I find that these characters and this story will not leave me alone, even though I finished the book weeks ago.  Mark of a good one, I think.
5	1353369600	I really enjoyed this novel. From the beginning, I was concerned about who the baby actually belonged to. Who was her real mother? What had happened?  I also didn't understand why the father had the baby on the boat without the mother.A story of great love, devotion, loss, loneliness, and regrets. Amazing story.
5	1353369600	My book group very much liked the book.  I have to admit I was not happy personally with the way the story went however it was so well written.  I would recommend it
4	1353369600	As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not a light and cheery story. Stedman gives her characters time to develop and then places them in a moral dilemma with far-reaching and ultimately heartbreaking repercussions. The story really gets under your skin in a &#34;what would I have done&#34; kind of way. Definitely recommend.
4	1353369600	I liked it, but was constantly on edge as to how things would turn out- stressed me a little.  But a very different and interesting story, for sure.
4	1353369600	Picked this up ... put it down ... picked it up and had to put it down again.  It took me a long time to read this book.  It was an emotional roller coaster as I felt every emotion of everyone who lived in that lighthouse.  My heart ached when I knew they shouldn't have kept their secret.  My heart ached when I met the child's real mother.  My heart ached when they had to do the right thing.  However ... I loved the ending.  I loved it. BAB
4	1353369600	Liked the book alot but the life at the lighthouse was a bit dragged out, I also was upset that the husband did not turn his wife in. He knew in his heart this was wrong. I guess if he did the book wld of been too short. But I was glad to see in the end all turned out well. A heart touching read for sure
5	1353283200	this is a passionate story of love and loss.  It is heart wrenching and warm yet gives the reader so much to think about.  What would you do in this situation?  I have to ask myself if the concluding five chapters summed it up in real life.  How would I have liked to have seen it end?  A very difficult question.
4	1353283200	One impulsive, miss guided decision leads to big problems.  I enjoyed this story greatly. At times I found the plot slow to move along but I wanted to know how the situation was resolved. I think this would make an excellent movie....
5	1353283200	When I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  It was somewhat predictable, but story developed well. Good debate for book clubs!It was very believeable.... and heartbreaking.
5	1353283200	I ordered this book as a selection for this month's book club meeting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read, although I know nowthat I had read it previously, many years ago.  It is a heartwarming and thought provoking novel.  It held my interest throughout each page.
5	1353196800	Loved the book.  I have never been to Australia and it brought the country into focus.  Also working in a lighthouse.
4	1353196800	Read for a book club and discussion.  I enjoyed the read, but the discussion turned up many questions about right and wrong and authenticity of the main characters.  While I liked the book, I did not care for the wrap up at the end.  Did we really need to know what happened to all of the characters twenty years later.
4	1353196800	The book was a good read, I did enjoy it. It was somewhat predictable and the character development was okay. Nothing about this book really wowed me. However, the plot was interesting enough to finish. If I could I'd give the book 3.5 stars rather than 4 but felt I' d rather be generous in this case. I did get caught up in a sentimental moment which encourages me to give a 4 instead of a 3 star review. This is one of those books that if the author could take it one step further, it would be terrific.
5	1353196800	I loved this book.  It was very different from anything I'd read in the past and I loved the characters.  It was so very sad, but it was still very beautiful.
5	1353110400	I fell in love with this book right away. It had so much romance, mystery, suspense, and emotions in it.  I felt so sorry for characters at times that I had to stop readying for crying. This is one of the very best books I have ever read.
4	1353110400	I read this book for my book club.  It came very highly recommended by one of the members.  When I started reading it I thought "Oh boy, here we go.  Another book I can't finish."  However, after the first five or six chapters I couldn't put it down.  I had to know what happened next.  The book is very well written and keeps you wondering, what would I do in that situation?  The ethical, moral, and emotional dillemas the characters go through keep you rivited and wanting to know what comes next.  I highly recommend this book. I gave it four stars instead of five only because of the slow start.  You really have to stick with it in the beginning, but it is worth it in the end.
5	1353110400	The story of lives intertwined and choices made that effect others...richly told.  Filled with insights into lives led, this story is mesmerizing.
5	1353110400	The writer did a super job developing all the characters.  I enjoyed this book tremendously. A great storyteller reminding us that sometimes good people make mistakes and change lives. What a great book!
5	1353024000	Such a captivating story. Loved it, definitely will read again. This was a beautiful story of love, marriage, family and sacrifice.
3	1353024000	"The Light Between Oceans" by M.L. Stedman is great for its initial setting -- a lighthouse on Janus Rock, off the Australian coast and overlooking two oceans, the Indian Ocean and the more tempestuous Antarctic. The reader learns about what it used to be like to care for the "light" which so many ships depend on. And the island is described so vividly, all parts of it are memorable. Then Tom, the lighthouse keeper, marries. His wife Isabel has three miscarriages and is desperate to have a family. A boat washes up on shore with a dead man and a living baby. Thus begins the conflict which eventually will be between the real mother who has lost her husband and Isabel. The fight over the child makes the novel fall into the melodramatic and overwrought. Too bad because Janus Rock stays with the reader.--Olive Mullet reviewer
5	1353024000	Very good read!  Nice love story about the importance of family. Quick read that pulled at the heart strings. Highly recommend.
4	1353024000	This is a really easy read, but exhausting due to the circumstances that occur and the decisions to be made. You can actually understand why things happened, but really struggle with what you would do in their shoes. I liked it and would recommend it to the same readers who enjoy Robert Goolrick.
5	1353024000	If you like a mental challenge where you will not be able to predict the outcome, you will love this.  It will tug at your heart and moral compass.  Done extremely well.
5	1353024000	l haven't read a novel in a long time that I enjoyed this much. Beautiful.writing  and beautifully crafted story telling.
5	1352937600	This book shows the strength of the bond between a parent and a child. It highlights the mother, but also depicts how strong it is for the 'father' figure as well.The key element in this book is that it shows how much love a child can bring to any household.  Children are a definite gift from God!  :-)
3	1352937600	it was an unusual story. Started off well but found the ending weak. the author tied too many threads together in a neat fashion.
5	1352937600	This book reminded me again of why I love to read.  Alternately dark and illuminating, depressing and exhilarating, it never hit a false note.  The denouement is flawlessly crafted.
5	1352851200	In times where so many have lost the ability or have never been taught to think and act responsibly, this book hits home.  Good characterizations of human frailty.
4	1352851200	This book was very well written with many unexpected twists and turns.  Made you think about choices that are made on emotions rather than facts.Made you realize that choices do have consequences and can change the course and outcomes of your lives.
5	1352851200	I loved this book, I couldn't put it down! As a new mum, I related to this book so much. It is well written, engages the reader and flows very well. Highly recommend!
4	1352851200	Loved all the characters, very real. Jumped around a bit near the end. Would recommend highly. Loved reading about the 1920's.
2	1352764800	Interesting story, but very poor character development.  I didn't feel like I knew these people after I finished, so I wasn't drawn into their lives.  Needed more detail of surroundings and day to day events.  I finished the book, but was very bored by the time it ended.
4	1352764800	All in all enjoyed this book.  Unique story, haven't read much about lighthouse keeper.  Found the Aussisms a little forced.  Think it would be a fantastic movie as long as Nicole Kidman doesn't play Isabel.  Made my cry. Enjoyable read.
5	1352764800	Nice story line where it really held my interest. It had an intrresting take on morals and ideals and how right and wrong is not always like black and white. I look forward to more books by this author.
5	1352764800	Nice to find a &#34;good read&#34;, still thinking about it.  I'll never look at a light house and not think of this book!
5	1352764800	I loved this book!  I could relate to both sides of this story.  It was easy to read and had several twists to the story that tugged at my emotions.  A great read!
5	1352764800	Wow! Great, moving story. Stays in your mind for a long time after finishing. Learned a lot about a time period and an area of the world I knew very little about.
5	1352764800	A "can't put down" book.  This one will pull at your heartstrings!!  a good choice for a book club.  Lots to talk about after the last page.
4	1352764800	Well written, great story.  Good description of light house living in the 1920's. Not something I would normally read about, but the characters carry the story.  Everyone of them. A baby is ship wrecked to the Island, & fate takes over. Makes you want to pick an ending.
5	1352678400	I loved this book.  It was so well written, kept me thinking about the moral dilemma the story revolved around.  It was a real page turner.
5	1352592000	This book had me captivated right from the beginning. I never anticipated what direction it would take.  I would highly recommend it.
5	1352592000	This is probably the best sad novel I have read in a very long time.  It held my interest throughout.
5	1352592000	As Tom and Isabel Sherbourne lose three babies to miscarriage and stillbirth, a boat washes up on the island where Tom tends the lighthouse. In the boat is a dead man and a crying baby. Tom wants to notify the authoritites, but Isabel begs him to wait just a night... When days turn into months, and then into years, their decision brings about many consequences, and affects many more people. A riveting, heart-wrenching novel that will stay with you long after you have fnished reading.
5	1352592000	This remarkable novel deals with human natures internal struggle between love and doing the right thing.  The choice to make the person you adore happy or to destroy them is the conflict the protagonist must make at the cost of his own personal happiness and thenpeople he loves the most and shou ld protect.  But at what cost?  This is a struggle most endure in life, perhaps not as dramatic but this struggle exists for all.  This is turmoil crosses all boundaries.  We are not oceans apart In life when it comes to making the right decision at all costs.  Humans are not oceans apart.
4	1352505600	We all have choices in this world, and sometimes bad things happen even when we seemingly make the right choice. This book gravely shows that bad things can happen to good people. Beautifully written and full of purpose, this book is a compelling read.
5	1352505600	I loved this book!  It was one of those books that you can't wait to find out the ending, but that you hate that you've finished the last page.This book has a young couple, Izzy and Tom, who had to make a very difficult decision.  The young bride made a decision based on her emotional needs and the new husband wanted a different outcome based on what he could live with. There is also a young mother who has lost her husband and child that must make a decision which determines the fate of the newly married couple.  There are parents and a sibling who are also making decisions about the two.  The story is in a unique environment which also stretches your imagination. While I read, I wondered which of the moral decisions would I have made if I were in each of the roles.  I read this on my KindleFire and would turn into a prune in the bath each night.
5	1352505600	This is a joyful, touching, and heartbreaking account of a couples' life. The author did an incredible job of connecting you with their lives and their choices. One of the few recent books that I have read that caused me to emotionally tear up. Loved it!
4	1352505600	Since I've never been to Australia or been near a lighthouse, this book was a learning experience.  The hard, cold reality of living in such isolation was brought into the forefront.  The fact that Tom's war experience drove him to this life of isolation was very sad.  Izzy was driven around the bend by her multiple miscarriages and she forced Tom to make decisions that were not in his nature.  The book was beautifully written and heartbreaking.
5	1352505600	I thought this was very well written and the story was very compelling.  Great for book club selection.  Lots to discuss
4	1352505600	Very well written, holds your attention and the author describes each character with explicit detail.  Recommend this book to anyone that would like to read something with a little drama.
4	1352419200	This novel contained historical information and supplied great descriptive language regarding a lighthouse. In addition, it presented an ethical question which was realistic and a moral enigma. How would we react when faced with the same decision, especially after suffering great loss and grief? Being a romantic, it would have been nice to have a happy ending for everyone.
5	1352419200	Book you should read. A must read is you want to know what love and honesty will do to a relationship.
5	1352419200	This is one of my all time favorites...one of the best books I have read!  I look forward to reading more ML Stedman books...history lesson...life lessons! I have told all my reader friends to make sure they read it!
5	1352419200	Had a book "hangover" after this one it was so good! I couldn't stop thinking about this book after I read it!
4	1352332800	I guess I was hoping for a better ending, but a tragic story..and the ending just ended, no in between story at the end.  I liked the book until the last 1/4.
5	1352332800	This novel was hard to read -- not because of the writing, which was excellent, nor because of the character, which were well -drawn.  No, it was difficult because the author took the time to introduce this this loving, happy family for whom disaster was inevitable.  You can almost justify this terrible act of keeping someone else's baby . . . almost, until you begin to get the story from the other side.  And by then there is no good, pat solution anymore.  By then, everyone's heart is on the road to breaking.  I loved the descriptions of the island; the physical setting practically became another character, a desolate, lonely, dangerous spirit driving this couple to do exactly the wrong thing.  The book left me unsettled -- in a good way -- and thinking abouit the story for a long time afterward.  I recommend The Light Between Oceans very highly.
4	1352332800	It is a good story.  Not one that you will stay up all night to finish but captivating enough to want to get to the next page.  Light reading yet thought provoking.
5	1352332800	Excellent read. Well developed characters. Reflects the battle of human kind;good intentions versus bad results.Would highly recommend!!Description of lighthouse, its mechanism and actions highly informative.
4	1352246400	The Light Between Oceans was a classic tale of mother's love, but it was also more than that.  At the root of the dilemma was anti-German hatred from the war plus a man's duty to his spouse, his job and his child.  Well written and thought provoking.
4	1352246400	Interesting topic.  Well written.  Timeline of story was shorter than I expected.  I would recommend this book as it was difficult to put down.
5	1352160000	This book is one of my new favorites! There were a couple of nights that I just couldn't put it down because the story kept me so enthralled! It is a great read.
5	1352160000	this book captures all the complexities of human behavior and how one's action can end up destroying someone else.  It is beautifully written.  It does start out a little slow, I think, but soon you understand why the background is important.  The characters are believable and their actions draw you into a huge moral dilemma....I'm not sure who I was rooting for; could have gone either way, but toward the end it still keeps you guessing.  Sad but the emotions expressed in this book are gripping.  A must read
1	1352160000	There was no foreseeing how this would end...I liked that. Very Picturesque story with heart written from both male/female perspectives. Well done.
4	1352160000	I couldn't put the book down,loved the plot and the characters.I felt deeply moved by the place, time and  main issue.It was difficult to take sides.
3	1352160000	Worth a read, but it is not great literature. Fairly good story, no character development, dialogue stilted. A beach book.
5	1352160000	The author effectively developed the characters so that the reader is empathetic for each of them.  The moral struggle is a page turner and provides food for thought long after the book is finished.
3	1352160000	Author had very good development of characters. Took awhile to get engrossed in the book. But a good story. Would probably read more from this author.
5	1352160000	Absolutely engrossed with it as soon as I picked it up. "be true to thine ownself" Good lessons to be learned and lived by.
4	1352160000	I truly enjoyed this book and was pleased that the ending was not at all predictable. The author does a good job of making all the characters come to life and gives both the male and female perspective on infertility.  As I read the book the question of "what would I do?" was always on my mind.  The goodness in Tom is admirable from start to finish--he is a man that I would be proud to know and could very easily respect.  My heart broke for Isabel--her story proves to us just how resilient we can be and how every heartbreak has purpose.  Just when you think faith in her is lost, she comes back stronger and wiser.
5	1352073600	I enjoyed this. It was well written, engaging and heart wrenching. I couldn't put it down once I got into the storyline.  Well worth it.
4	1352073600	Several of my friends downloaded this book from Audible, and struggled with the Australian accent. One even just gave up, which is a shame because it was a good book. An interesting ethical question, and it generated a lot of talk at book club. The characters were finely drawn, and their motivations were understandable. I thought the ending was a little abrupt, but otherwise I enjoyed it thoroughly.
5	1352073600	I have never reviewed a book before...but this such a great book.  I was torn throughout the book and I couldn't put it down.
3	1352073600	The storyline was a little far fetched but the characters were developed well and in the end I got quite attached.
5	1352073600	Great read.....Our book club has read it and also enjoyed the subject, place and time.  We would recommend it for others, don't know if guy would enjoy it as well.
4	1352073600	It's a very interesting book, made me cry. But there were some parts of the novel that didn't quite sit right with me, though.
4	1352073600	Great characters.  You can feel for both of them.  Leaves you asking a lot of moral questions.  Cried a couple of times.
5	1352073600	This book needs to be made into a movie......Excellent!I have recommended this book to many people since I read.
4	1352073600	I loved this book.  The characters were well-developed and the story was very entertaining.  The ending was disappointing to me, but I always hate the conclusion of a good book.
4	1351987200	This was a fast read for me because it was so well written.  You really become involved with the characters.  Would definitely recommend.
5	1351987200	The Light Between Oceans was selected for our book club & everyone thought it was a fabulous book, well written & a controversial story. It is a page turner, wondering how it will end. We had a really good discussion & the questions were found online which made it nice & easy.
4	1351987200	My emotions ran from empathy for a survivor of the trenches of WW11 to a feeling of calmness as he finds a comfort with a new wife and the solitude of running a lonely lighthouse on a remote island. Their life is changed forever when they discover a baby in a boat that has drifted onto their island.
5	1351987200	Lights between the Ocean is an excellent book for any book club.  A woman keeps a baby who washes up on the shore of her lighthouse, and this event goes unreported in the lighthouse log.  This act is in direct contrast to the character of her husband, the lighthouse keeper, who has a very difficult time reconciling this fact in his mind.  This book will elicit passionate discussion among book club members.
4	1351900800	This review contains spoilers. I read this book on a recommendation from a friend. I finished it last night and the moment I woke I couldn't stop thinking about it. To me the theme is about morals and the consequences of decisions. What is the right thing to do? I think it illustrates that the right answer is not necessarily black and white, and you can look at things from different points of view and see both sides. What is more morally correct, allowing a stranger to be in pain, a stranger who may never even know you have contributed to her pain. Or to cause pain to the person you dearly love. Would you tear your family apart and ruin your own life and the life of your loved one for "the greater good". Where does our moral compass come from? Does it make one selfish to follow your own moral compass when it hurts the ones you love? I find it fascinating to think about such concepts and to explore how ones life experience makes one act in such situations and on that criteria I give the book 5 stars. However, I did have some problems with the book. First of all I wish there was more character development of Isabelle. I thought the first half of the book was a little rushed and I would have liked it to be more fleshed out. I loved Lucy, and the relationship with her "mom and dad" I enjoyed the descriptions of the light house. After the secret was out, I didn't buy Tom's unwavering commitment to protect his wife by hiding the truth, at least for as long as it went on. I didn't think it fell in line with his moral compass. On the other side of the coin, I thought Isabelle's cold reaction to her husband was equally over the top. And when Hannah threw in the wrench, if you help send your husband to jail, I will give you Lucy back.....I did not believe that after only one day, Isabelle decided to defend her husband. I thought Isabelle's loyalty to her daughter was much stronger than that to her husband. I think she would have struggled much longer before coming to her decision. Of all the characters , I thought Hannah was the most believable. I thought her pain she went through, her frustration, her anger, and her ultimate decision of grace seemed genuine. My favorite part of the book was from the voice of Frank. "I can leave myself to rot in the past, spend my time hating people for what happened, like my father did, or I can forgive and forget........it is so much less exhausting. You only have to forgive once. "Overall I give it 4 stars, even with the few things that bothered me it ultimately really made me think about how people behave in extraordinary situations & I would definitely recommend to others.
4	1351814400	This book started out kind of hard to understand some of the wording,but as we go it became first heartwarming then heart breaking. It was well written and I will be looking for more books written by this author.
5	1351814400	I have never been so emotionally involved in a book.  Character development was exceptional!  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good read.
4	1351814400	At first I thought this would be a rather unbelievable story, but the characters were so well developed, the setting so well described, the feelings and conflicts so genuine that I was hooked. I found myself caring for all of the parents of this child and really could not decide how it should end. It made for an interesting discussion with friends who had also read this book. I will definitely look for more of the author's work in the future.
5	1351814400	This is one of the best books i have read in a long time.  A real page turner with a realistic ending.  I look forward to more books by this talented author.
5	1351641600	Light Between Oceans is a heart-wrenching account of a childless couple's struggle with conflicting emotions as they are torn between their love of a child who has miraculaously appeared in their lives and their sense of honesty, justice and duty.
4	1351641600	A very emotional read. I continued to think about this book long after I finished reading it. Great development of the characters and their moral and emotional conflicts.
5	1351641600	This story is in my top ten books I have read.  It has everything...love, suspense, tragic events, survival, deception, and justice!
4	1351641600	Enjoyed the smooth, consistant storytelling.  Been to lighthouses in the North Carolina's and I really wish I could have read this before going.  I'll be captured by the "LIGHTS" when I travel from now on.
2	1351641600	Had much potential but did not rise to the occasion.  I expected the novel to be more thought provoking, but the author set it up with too many far reaching (and unrealistic)scenarios.
5	1351641600	excellent bookeasy fast & suspenseful readyou are really not sure how it will all turn out in the end
5	1351555200	This is a great story with interesting detail.  I enjoyed it completely but may be more of a chick book.
5	1351468800	even though this is a chick book i finished it and really enjoyed it.  The author really put a nice touch on problems facing soldiers returning home from duty.  The ending was good and sad together.
5	1351468800	This powerful story of love, takes the reader to southern coastal Australia in the early 1900's.  The characters are strong and fragile, perfect and severely flawed.  I can't wait to read another novel by this author.
5	1351468800	Very good read! Early 20th century, Australia. I learned a lot about down under and the fact that no matter where or when--human emotion runs high and is a constant through out history. An endearing and intense story that kept me reading until the end.
5	1351468800	yes the book had some sad parts but i would give it a 5. A greata book for a reading club.
5	1351468800	This author wrote some terrific descriptions of key events/situations in the book: WWI, a small town in rural western Australia, what it must be like living on a small island with a light house flashing all night, every night. The story line moves along at a good pace and the suspense is maintained throughout.  A satisfying, quick read.
4	1351468800	Interesting premise made the pages of this book fly.  What could have been contrived course of action had interesting twists.  Fate and forgiveness were recurring themes.  Worthwhile read.
5	1351468800	I had never heard of this book or of the author. I just came across it in the lists of picks. I started reading the customer reviews and I wanted to read it immediately.I started recommending it to friends before I finished it. I was brought to tears by the raw emotions of the characters at certain points. I never do that while reading. There were many times that I would ask myself what I might do if put in this situation. And not just in one of the character's situation, but in many of them including the husband, the wife, the baby's birth mother, even the wife's parents.I was a little taken aback by several of the very negative reviews that portrayed the book as too sad and depressing. This was a sad book at times but the author explored such different aspects of human behavior.
5	1351296000	Wasn't to sure about it when I started into it,,, But words like "Haunting" "Tragic" "Spectacular" and "Love" found me "Sobbing" !!!  A MUST read for all mothers.
5	1351296000	Amazing cast of characters.  I felt I was present in each person's life.  Satisfied with the book's ending. What will this author write next?
5	1351296000	This book is a page turner. I love the way it was written. You could picture each person and never really know what was going to happen next! Outstanding read that you must buy!
5	1351209600	Great story that drives home the depth of love one woman has for her child & the depth of despair another feels thinking she has lost her child. I enjoyed the way their paths crossed.
4	1351209600	I really enjoyed the twists this story took. It is a fascinating tale about what is right and what is wrong and the choices we face in life.
5	1351209600	I really enjoyed this book. There are some books that our book club suggests that make me cringe and take me forever to read.Not this book. It keeps you wanting to read more.
5	1351209600	I love this book.  I selected it for my book club read of the month and received great feedback from the other book club members.  I would recommend it.
5	1351209600	I loved this book. I had never heard of it but it was recommended by the folks at Amazon/Kindle based on my recent purchases.  They were right!  Endearing characters who were full of flaws.  An unlikely love story filled with tragedy, betrayal, and redemption.  Read it!
3	1351209600	This book was recommended to me by a few women and I looked forward to it, as I spent time in Australia and was fascinated by the subject.  I thought it was just an ok read.  Maybe you'd call it a "Beach Book".
5	1351123200	This story is so compelling! You can sympathize with Isabel and Tom, but yet feel some disappointment that they didn't do the "right" thing. The moral dilemma they face would be difficult for anyone, especially after suffering the loss of 3 babies. The story is well written and keeps my attention, even when I am tired and want to go to sleep. I highly recommend this book.
4	1351123200	Read as a selection from our book club. What first got our attention was the description; sounded very romantic but also tragic. For a first time author, this is an extremely beautiful book. Made me want to live on a lighthouse in the late 1800s. ;-) As a parent there were parts that ripped my heart out; made me question what I would do in a similar situation. Without giving anything away I think I would do the same thing.Very quick read and well worth the time!
4	1351123200	I found myself struggling with who to root for in this story.  I know what's right - but when you weigh the hearts of both women (and the child in the middle) - it's harder to make a black and white decision.
4	1351036800	I really enjoyed this book as it was very well written and included several twists along the way.  An easy but fun read - one never knows what is going to happen in the next chapter.
5	1351036800	I bought this book based on a short description in a flyer I found at our local bookstore.  I typically prefer non-fiction to fiction but something about this book pulled me in.  I was spellbound from the opening pages.  The story has a nice theme of right vs wrong, love, suffering, commitment, and duty. Reading this book was a pleasant way to spend my limited free time.
4	1351036800	Great read, well written. You feel part of WW1 Australian history. The ending however is not as compelling as the rest of the book.
4	1351036800	I liked much about The Light Between Oceans, it was well told for the most part and the subject matter - Western Australia/World War I aftermath/Lighthouse life, was unique and interesting.  There are some obvious plot twists and in the end the agony of the main question in the book drags on too long. The bittersweet ending was inevitable. However, I liked the book overall, good read, worth the price, recommended.The Original SOS
4	1351036800	The Light Between Oceans is a book about love, loss, morals, and the choices we make.  Well written and with  compelling, well developed characters, the story takes us along on their life journey in such a way that we cannot help but identify with their joy and their sorrow, the difficult situations they confront, and the consequences of the choices they make.  The Light Between Oceans, set in a time and location remote enough to be slightly mysterious, puts us squarely in the middle of the most basic and familiar human emotions, allowing us to share each character's experience while passing judgment on none.  It is a very satisfying read.
2	1350950400	Loved the story and the author's style . Life choices impact us differently and shape the lives of those around us.
4	1350950400	As an American who has never visited Australia, I assumed I would miss some details due to dialect. M L Stedman wrote so clearly I felt I was present in the small community and at the Janus Lighthouse. Character development allowed me to feel the tragedy as it unfolded. I eagerly await Stedman's next novel.
5	1350950400	I've never read a book with such heart and insight into motherhood, life, loneliness, and loss. I don't even want to pick up another book for awhile because I fear it will pale in comparison to this brilliantly told story.
5	1350950400	While reading this book, I felt like the characters were real.  I hated when the book ended.  It was such a compassionate love story about the love of a mothers and a fathers have for their children.  There were many hardships with the characters but love prevailed.
5	1350950400	I thought it was a little slow at first.  But the more that I got into it the better it got.  It was suspenseful, so that I didn't want to put it down.  The end was so touching, I cried.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  It takes place in Australia in the late 1800's and gives you an idea of what that country was like, plus taking you into the lonely life of the people who managed the light houses.  A really good book.
4	1350950400	Bought it by accident. Wrong click read it anyway... I am a bookophile. Loved the story. Character development was excellent. The author really caught the wind off the light house and the starry night and the sense of desolation in the loss of a child. I would read another by this author.
5	1350950400	Couldn't stop reading once I started. Well written story about the conflict between right and wrong, morals, love, hopes and dreams. Will not disappoint.
1	1350950400	I cannot believe the accolades for this second-rate book.  Unsympathetic characters (are we supposed to feel compassion for a woman who steals someone's child?) and melodramatic writing made this a complete waste of time.
4	1350864000	Finally a good book.  Read it, I don' think you wii be disappointed..  Women and men will enjoy this one.
4	1350864000	The realism to this novel is riveting. It will engross you with the impending turmoil and conflict each character viably experiences - C. David Murphy, author of 'A Diary's House' -A Diary's House: Where True Love Endures
5	1350864000	This is one of those books that stays with you long after you have read the last page.  It was well-written, with a plot that was both heart-wrenching and thought-provoking.  The consequences of a decision and the ripple effects it has on everyone involved was so well illustrated in this book.  Could feel myself becoming attached to the characters from the very start!  A must-read...
4	1350864000	I enjoyed this book.  The characters were well developed and let the reader empathize with each point of view. I did like the ending in that all the pieces were pulled together but not in a totally obvious ending.
5	1350864000	It is a very deep story of two people leaving alone on a island. Tom and Isabel after they found a baby from a boat have to live with their conscious to report it or not to the authority. After finishing the book I cried.
5	1350864000	This book was a beautiful story of ethical love written with such compassion.  I was involved with the book from the beginning!
3	1350864000	I enjoyed the Light between the Oceans.  The story was interesting, the plot was sweet, but predictable.  An interesting story about life on a distant  island, and life in a small town.
3	1350864000	THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS was my book club's selection for October 2012.  An initially difficult read as the author spent much time setting the 'scene'.Plot tugged at my heart and there were many tears shed at the end of the story even knowing there was little else that could happen to culminate their shattered lives.GOOD GOOD FIRST NOVEL FOR THE AUTHOR....
5	1350777600	This book took me be surprise as I had never read this author before,since this is  her first published book.  Ms.Stedman did a stellar job of weaving a most interesting and heart rending story, of a  WW-1 Australian Veteran hero and the difficulty he has adjusting to a civilian life again. It is an outstanding first publishing effort. It was hard to put down, and I highly recommend this to both men and women as it is a story that contains all the necessary elements of a good read and really leaves an impact on the reader. I read it on my Kendle Fire from Amazon.
4	1350777600	I have recommended this book to my book club. It has an unusual plot that deals with strong emotions. I could hardly put it down!
5	1350777600	Wonderful book that not only examines relationships but weaves a story in which one can empathize with each character and understand why they do what they do.
4	1350777600	I really enjoyed this book. It kept me interested and wanting to come back to it. Powerful story of strong love, confusion of right and wrong, and how emotions and love can make you see things differently than someone else with each of you feeling yours is the right way. I'm glad we picked this book for our book club.
4	1350777600	i enjoyed this book; really liked learning about lighthouses and their keepers.  the characters were complex and i found the story thought-provoking, sad and happy at the same time.
5	1350777600	Beautifully written book. Sad, but reveals how the choices we make affect our lives forever. So descriptive, I feel I've visited Janus Island.
4	1350777600	Enjoyed the book. I thought the author did a great job describing the scenes, characters, and emotions.There are few books that really hold true to the title of the book. Many books I feel are titled simply to grab attention. When I completed the book I sat and reflected for quite a while on it and was surprised at how many areas of the book had the title somehow represented.Definitely recommend this book. Best I've read in 2012.
5	1350777600	This was a change from the murder/suspense books I usually read. It was a good story and well written. I have recommended it to some of my avid reader friends.
3	1350604800	Every person who writes a book deserves great credit, but, in my opinion, this one failed to live up to its  potential.  The characters were  appealing but sparse, making me want to know them better but not giving me the opportunity and material to do so.  The plot was predictable. Years ago, Ken Follett used the idea of the charm and isolation of an island to great effect but the interest generated by the unusual setting  failed engage me enough to keep me involved in the story. Despite the Realtor's mantra of "location, location, location," a site can provide only so much excitement.  A pleasant but unchallenging read that earned a three star review from me.
5	1350604800	What a wonderful way to get in touch with your emotional side and ajourney to the moral edge !! Fantastic book, well written.
5	1350604800	This was a beautiful, heartbreaking tale about love, family, forgiveness, choices, and consequences. Loved it--probably my favorite read of the year. Highly recommend.
5	1350518400	I really enjoyed reading this book! I cared about the characters. It was poignant and thought-provoking. Not a hard read but not predictable and obvious.
5	1350432000	It is a beautiful novel that covers all aspects of human nature the good the bad and the ungly. It touches all your senses. Extremely well written. It steals your heart. It is a page turner.
5	1350432000	This case was exactly what I expected it to be and I'm very happy with it. The protection it gives my phone is peace of mind for me.
5	1350432000	I just finished this book last night and really enjoyed it. Best book i have read in quite awhile. I look forward to reading more stories from this author.
4	1350432000	I would give this book the highest rating but I haven't finished reading it yet. Too many things getting in the way of my reading time.
4	1350432000	A great read, full of love and emotion, keeping the reader coming back for more.  I found myself engrossed in the characters and a series of tough decisions that change the course of their lives. Would recommend to any fiction lover.
4	1350345600	The premise of this book is quite interesting. A married couple, living alone as lighthouse keepers in the 1920s, discover a  small boat that has run aground on their island. In the boat is a dead man and a live baby. I will not tell you anything more so your imagination can run wild as to the many possible reasons to explain this mystery. Of course, what happens to everyone involved is the plot of the book. A dead man with a baby in a rowboat? Where's the mother? If the man is dead, why isn't the baby? Then, what to do, especially since the couple has experienced several miscarriages and is childless? These questions sucked me in quickly and I was very interested in how this plot would play out. However, I figured out pretty quickly what had to happen in the end, considering the personalities of each character. After that, I lost some interest in finishing, although I was glad I continued to the end. I wished for an unexpected twist in the end, but it never came. After the shock of the plot set-up and the characters' decisions about it, my interest faded.
5	1350345600	This book held my interest from the start. Towards the end I couldn't put it down!THis is a story of a lighthouse keeper and his wife who decide to keep a baby that washes ashore in a boat that also holds a dead man. Good people made a bad decision and the story is heartbreaking at times. I didn't want it to end.
4	1350345600	Read this book as our book club selection. Loved the characters and found it to be a really good read.
4	1350259200	The first part was hard to get past but once I got started, I didn't want to put it down.
4	1350259200	Any one who says they would not have kept lucy is not being honest with themselves! After you care for a child, the bond would be too strong after four years to break. They were her family in every way.
4	1350172800	I found this book to be enlightening.  The author does a wonderful job at character development and plot.  The visual the author creates of the island are romantic and mysterious.  A well developed story about the inner struggles/battles of life and how telling the truth is always the moral thing to do. I would recommend this book.
2	1350172800	A baby washes up on the shore of a remote island.  She is a metaphore for so much that has been lost by the people who find her.  She represents a gift, a fresh start, a living being when there have been so many untimely deaths, ... it's a great premise, but so clumsily handled.I am really surprised that the book is so highly recommended.  At about the half way point, I started skipping whole paragraphs and then pages, past the endless descriptions of the ocean, the sky, the horrors of war, the angst-ridden inner thoughts of even minor characters.The novel is too long by half, has many more characters than are needed, and the important characters are not fully developed. Story lines are introduced, only to be left unresolved. Some themes (children deprived of their parents, parents deprived of their children) are worked to death.  Other themes that would have added to the story are hinted at and then dropped.  The ending is just weird.There are glimpses of beauty and brilliance in the story, but unfortunately the potential that is there is never fully realized.
3	1350086400	This book starts out slow and the more that I think about it the story was undeveloped.  The characters of the main characters were undeveloped.  I felt as thought the book was written under a time deadline and page restriction or that this was the draft of a great book yet to come.
4	1350086400	I found the book to be well written but too predictable in the ending. I think a bit more time should have been spent in the aftermath of the court case...ie how the husband fared in prison. How they managed to go on with their lives without the baby Lucy....It was good but could have been lots better...probably would not recommend to a friend.
4	1350000000	THis was a very good read. I downloaded it on  my kindle and read it in 2 days. Our book club is reading this and I would highly recommend it.
4	1350000000	This was an enjoyable book with an interesting story. Although I would not say it was one of my favorite books, it did keep me reading and waiting to see how it all worked out. It would make an interesting book club read just for the discussion about each character's actions.
5	1350000000	This book was one of the best books I read in a long time. I loved it. The characters were very real, the story was very real. It's what's called unconditional love.
5	1350000000	I suspected from the beginning that I was going to love this book.  It did not let me down. Highly recommended.
5	1350000000	This is a GREAT book, written well and easy to read.  It is sensitive, keeps your interest and is not "shallow", like so many other fiction books.  This author knows how to write and shows the very human element, that so many are lacking.  I can recommend this to most anyone!!
4	1349913600	This book was a little hard to get into at the beginning but once you do its hard to put down. I understood exactly how each character acted, reacted, and felt. I understood why each one did what they did. I can see myself in every character. I have recommended this book to many people. Very good book. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little slow in the beginning.
5	1349913600	Beautifully written poignant story of a loving young couple isolated from family and friends by choice but who slowly detach from each other due to tragic circumstances. A miracle occurs bringing joy back into their lives for awhile until reality rears it's honorable head. I felt I was there on the island and in the lighthouse with them thanks to the detailsand documentation of the author's words.  The final third of this wonderful novel takes you on emotional and moral highs and lows.  Oh, did I cry at the end.
5	1349913600	I really enjoyed reading this book!  The human condition is very complicated, as we all know.  This story captured the complexities and lines between love and hate, good and bad, right and wrong.  There were nights I lost sleep from not being able to close the book.
3	1349913600	Yes, lighthouse keepers lead quiet lives, but the first 2/3 of this book was a slog. Dialog was uninspired and events moved at glacial speed toward the inevitable outcome. Throughout, too much mundane conversation.
5	1349827200	Very good read.  We read it for book club. Touching story.  Made me tear up a couple times.  Couldn't put down at the end.
4	1349827200	Well written with rich detail and appropriate character development to put the reader in the 'heads' of the main characters.  Intriguing enough to compel the reader to consider the various moral dillemas from different perspectives and question what you would do in a similar situation.A quick read and not as predictable as some reviewers make it out to be.
5	1349827200	this book was wonderful.  I could not put it down, and the characters stayed with me after I finished the book.  It was kind of haunting, but very well written.
5	1349827200	this book was hands down the best book I have read in a long time! I was so torn between what was the right thing to do and what my heart wanted.Such a sad ending, I felt like no one really ended up winning. The writer outdid herself/himself on this one!
4	1349827200	This book is a must read if you like children and family dynamics.  This author gives  very touching insight into how two very good, heroic people can make a poor choice and come through it.  If you have ever lost a child or suffered a miscarriage, you will identify with this story!
5	1349827200	really enjoyed reading this book.  Love the literary comparison of the oceans meeting and the lighthouse.  Very emotional ending and can easily see this one made into a movie.
5	1349827200	I never thought I would be interested in a story of a lighthouse keeper, but it was a real page turner and had me hooked.
5	1349827200	Great escape! wonderful story! I was drawn right in. Couldn't wait to escape back to it every night! I was sorry it ended. Highly recommend! Definitely 5 stars!
5	1349827200	This book was wonderful from beginning to end.  I felt every emotion that the main characters felt.  Heartwarming and sad story.  I consider it a must read.
5	1349827200	Couldn't put this wonderful book down! This is a gripping story about how truth can unravel a loving couple. The setting seemed so real, I actually consulted a map.
4	1349827200	I loved this book.  I really couldn't decide how I wanted it to turn out.  It kept me intrigued and it really haunted me.
4	1349740800	The Light Between Oceans by M.L. Stedman is a beautifully written novel. I loved this book from the beginning;it touched me on many levels. The author cleverly weaves the isolation of life on Janis island as a lighthouse keeper in the 1920s with the longing and frailty of the human heart and produces a powerful storyline of love, healing and forgiveness.
5	1349740800	First novel by Stedman was a riveting read and stayed with you long after you closed the cover.  A must read.
5	1349740800	I couldn't put this book down. Great characters, great story. Deep moral dilemmas, lovely portrait of rural Western Australia just after WWI, I loved this book!
5	1349740800	As a court appointed special advocate for children, I read this book with an intentional focus on what would be in the child's best interest. And yet, as a mother, I could identify with the woman who has lost three children and desperately longs for a family to love and care for.The author does a superb job of setting the stage for the complex dilemma. I was emotionally moved by each of the characters, their positions and the call of their hearts.Well written and a gripping story, The Light Between Oceans is a book I would recommend to anyone looking for a great read. More specifically, I would recommend this to anyone working in the field of child advocacy.
3	1349740800	The premise of the book-consequences of your actions-was carried out well.  The writing was quite good, but too much about the light house care and workings.  The main Characters were well rounded.Generally a good read!
5	1349740800	The Light Between Oceans was a very good read.  About halfway through, the story slowed a bit, but by then my curiosity had the best of me.  Easy reading...sad story.  UPDATE: It's been several months since I read this book and it still haunts me.  In fact I bought a hardback copy as a Christmas present for my wife (I read it on a Kindle).  She loves it...and I find myself thinking about it all over again.  You know, when someone asks you if you've read a certain book, you scratch your head and try to remember it?  Well, that will not happen with The Light Between Oceans.  You will not forget it. Read this book!
5	1349740800	Best fiction novel I have read in a long time. It's unique in story and in style of writing. There are few books, and I have read A LOT OF BOOKS, that are as well written as this one. If you are tired of reading predictable, cookie-cutter books/stories and want to read something refreshing right down to the setting, read Land Between Oceans.
3	1349740800	It is very well written, and I see all the moral dilemmas presented for consideration - but it is just so hopeless at times.  I found it hard to read without coming down with the blues.  I prefer something a little lighter I guess.
4	1349740800	Enjoyed this book very much! Different premise and the title is so appropriate for the story. Would recommend it for a quick easy read that makes you think about our basic desires of love, trust, security, and each other.
5	1349740800	This is a well written book about a lifestyle that does nof exist today.  It was hard to put down. Characters were portrayed so reader has a good insight into their being.
5	1349654400	I loved the story & found myself sympathizing with all the main characters.  What a dilemma!  What would I have done had I been in the characters' shoes??
3	1349654400	This was an OK book, meaning that when I took a break from reading it, I was not in a hurry to get back to reading it.  The ending was disappointing.
5	1349654400	I love this novel; I have not finished it yet, as I am trying to save it and not read it too fast. It is a beautiful story, and I recommend it to anyone who likes period (historical novels) pieces.
3	1349654400	This book started out with an interesting premise, but once the excessively foreshadowed event took place, it was just repetitive. The end was anticlimactic after all those chapters of redundancy. Better editing could have helped this writer make a decent story into a good one.
5	1349654400	Beautiful book.  Author brings out with compassion the emotions of each character.  Touching and hard to put down read.  Would recommend this story.
5	1349654400	I have read thousands of books, all kinds and sorts of books, and I have never read a finer book than "Light Between the Oceans".  I have not finished, and it is difficult for me to not race through to the end, and just as difficult for me to turn off my Kindle and wait.....wait for another page.  I look with much anticipation to another great novel from Ms. Stedman. Keep up the fine work!  You will surely have a great following.
5	1349654400	This is a very good book.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.  It is a very touching story. I read it for my book club.  It will bring much discussion.
5	1349654400	One of my favorite books since Laguna Coil by Barbara Kingsolver.  Rich and wonderful story about how a man builds a life after the horrors of war, and deals with stunning twists and turns that challenge his view of himself and his values.  Sure that ML stands for Mary Lou as the emotional content would be hard to believe from a man, and i am a man!
5	1349654400	Slow at first but midway through i couldnt put it down. a tear jerker especially for those that are parents.
5	1349654400	Once took a literature class wherein I read several books with the assignment of not judging the characters and their choices.  This book would really have been a great one for the assignment.  Great story and a very fast read.I highly recommend it
4	1349654400	A good relaxing read.  I normally read historical books, this was a great change of pace and a fun read.
5	1349568000	New author? You would never know it. Great story line and detail about the isolation of people in an isolated location. The emotion is strong as the ocean that surround the place.
4	1349568000	The characters were believable.  Great suspense.The book held my interset as decisions were made that were about to change lives unalterably.
5	1349568000	If you are looking for a "different" good read this is the one.  Setting and time period out of the ordinary, with some nice plot twists & turns.
3	1349568000	This stroller is everything you want in a light-weight, easy to handle stroller, Folds easily, but does have a small basket underneath.  This stroller DOES NOT stay standing on it's own when folded -you have to fold and put directly into car to avoid it laying on the ground.  It is a little bit awkward getting the infant carrier on and off of the stroller, but with a bit of practice (and long arms), it is manageable.That brings me to the infant carrier.  I HATE this carrier.  I have had two other carriers with my older children and wish I could return to one of those.  This carrier is not even that safe as the straps come unhooked in the back without the parent knowing it.  If we were ever in a wreck, it is possible that the baby may not be restrained despite us doing up her carrier straps.  The straps are a nightmare to adjust with the baby in the carrier, and even worse when the carrier is on the base. If your baby is asleep in the carrier, he or she won't be once you tighten or loosen the straps.Secondly,  it takes two hands to move the handle.  If you have the baby in your arms -good luck moving the handle to get baby in the carrier.  This is also very inconvenient when you put the carrier in the base and go to move the handle into "driving" position -you have to reach across carrier to squeeze the release to move the handle. This is much harder if your vehicle is a higher profile, or if you have your carrier base in the center seat.  Again, long arms are helpful.Great stroller.  Too bad the carrier does not live up to the performance of the stroller!
4	1349568000	This is a very engaging book, difficult to put down.  The characters are quite engaging and seem very appropriate for the setting during the time after World War II.  The story itself is sad in so many ways, but the author has captured the justice at the conclusion.
5	1349568000	To any woman who has longed to be a mother with no success, this book will stir your emotions.  As each of the characters are developed it is easy identify with them.  The emotional ending was a fitting conclusion to the story.
4	1349568000	Well written, intriguing story that held my interest throughout. Excellent character development of likeable, complex people. This deals with some controversial issues where both sides of a moral dilemma are well explained. Book groups might enjoy this as a selection as there is a lot of room for discussion.
4	1349568000	I enjoyed this book,it met all the expectations of the reviews I had read. The story line was thought provoking and I found myself taking different sides with the different characters as the story unfolded. The author is terrific the way he wove the story. You are grabbed at once and you can't let go.Looking forward to other books by this author.
5	1349568000	This is an incredibly strong first novel.  It is extremely well written and tackles the difficult subject of the ramifications of making a choice and how to correct the course if that choice turns out to be wrong for you or others.  While I skimmed a little (just a little) in the middle it was more because I was anxious to see what happened next. The characters were all well developed and, like others, I did cry at the end.  But I also found the ending uplifting in many respects.  In summary, this is a book about life and the choices we all face which in many instances are not clearly defined as right or wrong.  Life is hard, no doubt about it. The author captured that sentiment perfectly.
3	1349481600	Book was ok. Recommended by wife's friend and I think my wife will rate it higher. I recommended it for wife's book club.
4	1349481600	At the beginning stage of the book, I said to myself, 'I know how this ends, why should I continue reading?'  But I plodded on and was taken on a roller coaster ride by the author.  I'm glad I did plod on -- definitely one of the best books I've read in a couple of years.
3	1349481600	The story line is intriguing but this was not a book I couldn't put down until the last 50 pages or so.  At the end there was some beautiful prose and highlight worthy lines about forgiveness and anger.  Poignant ending.
5	1349481600	Loved it.  Grew up on an island, near lighthouses.  Also great insight into Australian history, and island life.  Would highly recommend it.
3	1349481600	This book was surprisingly good. Not what I expected. The landscape description of the island and lighthouse are so vivid, you can see them clearly in your mind.  The author placed this in a time era I would not usually read and made it intriguing.  Good Read.
5	1349481600	I love to read and I saw this book on the best sellers list. Such a great story and I could not put this down. Everyone should read this!!
5	1349481600	This book had me crying  the last two nights I readit. So moving with the moral choices to be made.  I was torn between right and wrong. You could feel the emotions from both sides and they pulled at your heart. I have recommended it to everyone.
5	1349481600	Great characterization. The story was a bit slow in the beginning, but well worth the effort. I would definitely recommend this novel.
4	1349481600	This book was wonderful, gave a vivid descrition of life in a lighthouse also the problems associated with this type of life.
4	1349481600	I enjoyed this well written story, and the mystique of it's location.i would recommend it to my friends!The tug of war between need and want, takes the characters down a very treacherous road.
5	1349481600	Enjoyable read, yet heart wrenching. I think this book does a great job at tugging at your heart strings.  also, interesting story line.
5	1349481600	This "can't put it down" book catches your attention from the beginning - you'll be reading past midnight and looking for a second best seller from this fantastic author.
5	1349481600	I loved it. Told all my friends. I love lighthouses so the concept grabbed me. A story of deep parental love and loss and redemption.
5	1349481600	Great read from the beginning to the very end!  I would highly recommend this book.  Not only was it a great story and love story, I loved learning about Australia, WWI, and lighthouses.  I think any woman with any kind of infertility issues or has had a miscarriage can relate to this story and any mother can understand how powerful the love a child can be. The author did a great job involving the reader with the relationships between characters.  The best part for me was the great cry I had at the end!!!!  Do you know how hard it is to read and cry??  I will definitely read anything by this author again.
4	1349481600	Enjoyed the characters. Could sympathize with the love of the child from all the characters.  Brought tears to my eyes.
5	1349481600	This book held me captive. The plot is original and the writing suits it perfectly. The author advances the plot seamlessly so that the reader is unaware of anything except the characters and their fascinating story. The main characters are admirable people who make understandable, yet tragic, choices. The ending is believable and fitting to both the tone of the book and its tragic plot. More, please!
5	1349481600	This is story that keeps you on board right down to the last page. A very relatable human situation that could have gone either way.
5	1349481600	I enjoyed reading "The Light between Oceans", even though the story line was quite predictable. However, it was well written, and kept my interest throughout. I purchased it after having read reviews of the book.
5	1349481600	The backdrop for this story is a time when lighthouses were a "modern" marvel of engineering and so important to any sea-going vessal.  Add to that a terrific love story of two families whose lives interwine in a heart-stopping narrative.  I couldn't put it down and I loved it.
2	1349481600	Interesting story line -- could have been historical fiction but for the shallow development of characters.  Could have been a war memoir, a comment on the status of women in that time period; developed relationships especially as defined by loss of life as a result of war and later miscarriage.  Just fell short and a little too maudlin...
4	1349395200	"The Light Between Oceans" is one that I couldn't put down.  I found myself being rude to people who called or came to the door.I am fascinated with WWI novels, so I was attracted to it because the main character was a WWI veteran.  I wasn't disappointed.The setting, i.e., location of the light house is unique--a geograpy lesson as well as an excellent read.
3	1349308800	This story had all of the ingredients for a great story but the final product just fell a little flat. At times, the story really dragged. While the subject of the book had a lot of emotional layers I never really connect with any of the character.
4	1349308800	Iteresting character development, heart felt emotions great descriptions of people and places. Good airplane book quick read.Love the isolation living in a lighthouse.
4	1349308800	I have been an Amazon customer for a number of years and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. I can only describe this book as spellbinding and anguishing. I literally could not put this book down, finished it at 2 am this morning, and held my two year old daughter in my arms and wept at the thought of being in either of the two women's positions. The tragedy of it all, the author was able to evoke feelings of sympathy for both Isabel and Hannah. The sadness I felt when all those years later it was just as the doctor predicted, that the child wouldveventually forget the first set of parents. Those two who had adored and worshipped her so much. I was angry at Tom for what he did, but then he had me thinking of what it means to do the right thing, no matter what the cost. I was sad for Isabel, because her life literally ended when she lost Lucy, happy for Hannah that she got her child back, but willing her to give her back to Isabel for all of their sakes. I would have been happier with an ending that saw Isabel reunited with Lucy before she died, but then again, how many happy endings are there in real life. This is one of the best books I have read in years, it literally had me sobbing. Kudos to the author.
4	1349308800	This novel definitely held my interest, and I was fascinated with the descriptions of life on Janus Island. In fact, I enjoyed learning about the culture and terrain of Australia in general. The love story was captivating and poignant. In particular, I was interested in the child Lucy, who spent the first years of her life with adoptive parents. A friend recommended A Light between Oceans to me and I was glad she did.
2	1349308800	I picked this book to read after seeing the overwhelming good reviews from other readers.  I am puzzled after reading this book of why so many of you thought it was so great.  I felt like the story was very predictable.  Certain parts of the plot line were over done (yes, he was in the war.  I get it.)  While others weren't quite develped enough (Izzy lost her mind a bit at the end.  Why didn't the author talk about that while they were on the island.There could have been much more development on that front.  Also, what exactly happend between Tom's mother and father?) I found that towards the end I didn't care about the characters because it just wasn't believable anymore.
5	1349222400	Best book I've read in ages!  I truly could NOT put it down....hated finishing it since I know it will be ages again before I find another book to equal it!  Bravo to the author for the compelling story and characters.
3	1349222400	The characters are not evenly developed in this novel and the pacing is erratic.  Some of the writing is pedestrian.  Overall however there is enough plot and unique and historical context (a remote part of Australia, post-WW1 angst and bigotry, an isolated lighthouse, a romance) to make this a passable read.
5	1349136000	The plot and expression of it was exquisite. I can't wait for this gifted writers next effort.The prose was so well spoken that much of it is very quotable.
4	1349136000	Lyrical prose, well-drawn characters and a central question that really makes you wonder. I flew through this passionate little book.
4	1349136000	I did like the book. I was unsure at the beginning but only a few pages in I was hooked. Good people don't always make the right decisions but in the end make right choices.
4	1349136000	Very easy reading. Different story about soldier and families which could of happened. Would Recommend this book to person who would like light reading material.
5	1349136000	When I begin reading a new book, I am looking for it to be an intriguing adventure, one in which I have no idea where it will take me.  I feel the story should hold my complete attention and that I feel what the author is expressing.  I do not enjoy a book where I know at Chapter 3 exactly where and how the story will end.  "The Light Between the Oceans" fulfilled my wishes for a wonderful read.As an extra, I learned a bit about Australia, which was another plus.If Stedman writes another book, I will surely look forward to enjoying another fine piece of literature.Definely a five star book.
5	1349136000	This book was very well written. You feel for all the characters. They had a very real quality about them. You could feel the agonizing decisions that had to made on behalf of Lucy. I highly recommend this book.
5	1349136000	This book is wonderful if you're feeling like getting in touch with your more sensitive, teary-eyed side. It is statistically likely to make you cry at at least one point -- I feel confident about this assessment because I don't have a child or any significant attachment experiences and it still really got to me. As other reviewers have stated, it develops characters well and really puts the emphasis on choices. It's a good read but its sadness really should not be underestimated.The only downside to this book is the ending -- I guess I found it predictable. I didn't take off a star because any other ending would have been disappointing and left just about every reader wanting more. I just found it to wind down rather abruptly.I might see the film if it gets made and that's not just a rumor -- but the book does such a wonderful job illustrating everything, I'm not sure I'd find much of a point in seeing it in film form. That's how good and emotive the book is.
3	1349049600	I was a little disappointed in this book. Many readers had given it great reviews but, to me, it was just mediocre. The first parts of the book were interesting; but, the progression to the ending was sad & labored.I prefer a much happier ending.
4	1349049600	I ENJOYED THIS BOOK.  I NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH WORK WENT INTO MAINTAINING A LIGHTHOUSE IN THE DAYS THEY WERE UTILIZED.  There is a lot of detail on the mechanics of operating a lighthouse in this book.  The story was bittersweet.  I found myself vascilating between two mothers and who should prevail (don't want to give the plot away so that's all I'll say).
3	1349049600	This is a very pleasant and easy read. The subject matter is a baby and deceased father washed up in a boat is found by a lighthouse keeper. The lighthouse keeper and his wife decide to keep the baby. The appearance of the birth mother creates conflict and tension between the couple. I felt that the most interesting and touching part of the book was the reaction of the child when she was returned to her birth mother.I would think that this will ultimately become a movieAmazon Purchased Book
4	1349049600	I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was hard to put it down.  The ending was not something you could anticipate before hand.
5	1348963200	I captivating story of right and wrong and the myriad of human emotions involved with confounding circumstances that are beyond control. Beautifully written to capture the beauty and pain of life-altering decisions. A great read.
5	1348963200	Frankly I was surprised I was reading a book about a light house and all it's workings. I found that part very interesting.  The love story was so sweet with longing and desire and then the added demension of a child not their own took me over the top.  A lovely story of early Austrlia and the people of that time.
4	1348963200	A delightful and unexpected surprise of a novel.  Life is quiet as a lighthouse keeper.  The ocean only gets real choppy when deep seated emotions come into play.
4	1348963200	The Light Between Oceans is written very well with just the right amount of suspense toward the end.  I like the era in which it was written and it was informative about a subject I don't know too much about, that being lighthouses.  My Kindle got a workout as I could not put it down.
5	1348876800	I could not put this book down. I will not read a book unless I can't wait to see how happens next and this book did it of me.
3	1348876800	I found this story to be heartbreaking, an emotional journey that really tests the "rights and wrongs" when it comes to love. While the journey to the end of the story was slow and sometimes gut wrenching i ended glad to have read it.The characters are well developed and will really find a place in your heart, swaying your sympathy from one end of the spectrum to the other.
5	1348876800	This book had wonderful descriptive passages and I felt as though I was on this remote island.Loved how the author drew you into these people's lives, storyline,the era and theextreme beauty of the raw landscape.I love to read historic fiction and found myself wanting read more from this same author!I think the author is a talented writter with a great style.I hope we will see more from Stedman.Thank you.
5	1348876800	Could not get this book outta my head when I finished it. It was like a movie in my head and I'm hoping somebody turns it into a movie.  Fast read, but in depth characters.
4	1348876800	What a beautiful book about love and what a man would do for the love of his life. Tuff moral issues that shatter many lives.
4	1348876800	This book is one that was hard to put down. It starts a little slow but quickly grabs hold of you. I  highly recommend it.
4	1348790400	This story takes you back in time and gives depth and insight to a light keeper's world. It takes you to the life few have experienced and many will never know. A love story and heart felt journey of a mother's love that comes from deep inside. My attraction to the story was the setting and for a deep love of the ocean and interest in Australia. Great, quick read.
5	1348790400	This book has my total attention.  I feel for Isabel as she has lost three babies.  I feel her need to keep the baby that came to them.  But I also feel for Tom as he knew what they did was so terribly wrong, and wanted to return the child to the mother.  He fell in love with the baby as she grew but deep down he knew it was wrong by keeping her.  Then he confesses, a little at a time and takes all the blame to clear his wife of wrong doing.  A good man even though he is sent to jail.  I can't wait to read the ending.
5	1348790400	This is a book I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a well constructed, plausible story about choices and consequences.It shines a light on how even with the best of intentions things can go wrong and truth will always prevail.  This is a book that will transport you to another time and another place and will involve you  in these characters lives.  I can see this as a successful movie.
5	1348790400	Really enjoyed this book - read in one day! Made me really think about what I would do in the given situation.
5	1348704000	This is a book that I will always remember.  It was written well, a really good story with very realistic characters.  It took place in Southwest Australia, in the early 20th century, when lighthouses were very necessary 24 hours a day.  This particular lighthouse was about an hour off the Australian coastline, so the lighthouse watchman was contracted to work three year stints with no vacations.  This watchman was of very good character, a decorated serviceman, and single.  Just as he was ready to leave shore for his assignment, he met a gal that he fell in love with.  After writing back and forth, they married and tried to start a family at the lighthouse rock.  After 3 miscarriages the wife was sad and depressed, when magically, a lost rowboat washed up to the lighthouse rock containing a dead man and a tiny live baby. The light house watchman was under strict orders to record any happenings, and was directed to use Morse Code in case of any emergency; But the couple ended up not reporting this finding and led people on shore to believe that it was their baby.  As this interesting story unfolds, the truth comes out, and the biological mother is located,with the whole shore town in shock.  Unfortunate repercussions result.  I highly recommend this good story with lots of insight about lighthouses and what they involve.
5	1348704000	This book is outstanding. A page turner full of introspection and hope. Beautifully written and lovingly crafted. Cannot wait for this authors sophmore offering.
5	1348704000	Light Between Oceans is an incredible read. Beautifully written, historical details and an unforgettable love story. It tugged at my heart.
5	1348617600	Intriguing and emotionally moving story in a unique setting. It makes you wonder about family, love, and fate. The characters stay with you long after you read the book.
5	1348617600	This is one of the best books I have ever read.  As I was reading the ending, I was sobbing and I have not quit thinking of this book.  I recommend it to everyone.  Very heart warming.
4	1348617600	I enjoyed this story and have recommended it to several book groups.  It begs discussion of the ramifications of emotional decisions, which we all make all the time.  It illustrates how enormous and catastrophic those decisions can become, taking on a life of their own and coloring one's world forever.  The story exposes racial prejudice, which is the underlying catalyst for the story line.  Then it takes the reader on an emotional journey that begs the question, "What if?"The four stars may be misleading.  I listened to the audio version of this book through Blue Tooth in a car full of women from my book club.  The voice of the reader is difficult to understand, as he speaks in a Australian accent.  About half way through the story, I became the reader and it was a much better experience.  That said, I felt the first half of the story, the set up, was somewhat slow.  Once reading from my Kindle, I couldn't put it down.
5	1348617600	I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end!  A poignant story of life in Australia and in a Lighthouse just after WWI and the effects of the War that plaqued its soldiers.  My love of lighthouses spurred me to pick this book up, then I couldn't put it down!  It is the October choice for our Book Club.
5	1348617600	My husband bought this novel for me. I enjoyed every aspect of this book. The characters were well-developed. The plot was not as obvious as you might think it would be. It was a sad, but realistic story, and it would be a great book for a book discussion group to read and comment on.
5	1348617600	Having just finished this book, I'm still left with the feelings of joy, sorrow, love, isolation and regret that mark the characters and story.  We meet Tom and Isabel as young lovers who marry and go to an isolated island between two oceans so Tom can be the lighthouse keeper there.  They are crazy in love and eventually conceive a child.  This little one becomes one of a successive three children that are lost to miscarriage or still birth.  Isabel is devastated, physically and emotionally, until they spot a small boat that has washed up on shore.  Inside is the body of a man and a crying, healthy baby girl.  It is at this point that the Lie begins that not only transforms Tom and Isabel, but is the main crux of the book.  Isabel is so delighted, she begs Tom not to report this incident which he is required to do.  He agrees, buries the man, and watches as Isabel becomes in all reality this child's rescuer and mother--even nursing the baby.  Tom too falls in love with Lucy and treats her as his own, with always nagging guilt about not doing the right thing and wondering about the child's mother.  As the story unfolds and we learn to love this little family, the plot turns to show us the child's true mother and the angst and depression she's experienced in the loss of her husband and child.  Tom's guilty conscience wins out, he turns them in, and spends a lot of time in jail, Lucy is ripped out of Isabel's arms screaming and a new aspect of the book begins.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story as the action and plot keep you reading for more.  There are subtle twists with very poignant outcomes.  The writing is very well done, and I'd recommend it heartily.
4	1348617600	I enjoyed learning about the intracacies of manning a lighthouse as much as I did the main plot of the story.  Interesting story line and well-written.  Kept my attention from cover to cover.
5	1348617600	This is such a wonderful book!  ML Stedman is a new author and I cannot wait for another one!The character development of Tom and Isabel was perfect; I felt as though I knew them.Tom is the "keeper of the lights" at a remote lighthouse off the coast of Australia.  They only have contact with other people once every three months, when the supply boat comes in.Heartbroken that several pregnancies have resulted in miscarriages, and the latest in a stillbirth, Tom and Isabel think they are imagining things when they hear a baby cry.  But they follow the sound and discover a boat has washed ashore with a man (deceased)in it...and a baby girl.  Immediately, Tom wants to notify the authorities, but Isabel convinces him to wait until morning.  Morning comes and Isabel, once again, convinces Tom to wait; eventually convincing him that the baby's Mother must have fallen out of the boat and drowned (there was a woman's shawl in the boat), so the baby is an orphan.  They decide to raise the baby as their own.This is such a wonderful story of love, longing, and loss.  Some reviews say the story is just too sad, but I disagree.  It's a great story!I will admit, at the end of the book, to crying my eyes out, but not (necessarily)out of saddness!I would give this book a "10" star rating!
4	1348617600	Terrific story and very well written.  Haven't read that many books written about lighthouses or this area of the world so I found it very interesting.  Great summer read.
4	1348531200	The Light Between Oceans deals with a theme that cannot end well for all concerned.  Babies immediately attach themselves to the heart.  Tom's overall goodness and high moral character is one which needs to be emulated more in our day.  The right decision is made in the end, and while life is not what Isabel hoped for, she has makes a choice that brings her peace.  This book is a little wordy, but the theme captivates the reader until the final page.
4	1348531200	This was a good read.  It was well written and thought provoking. The descriptions are terrific and I know it will make a great movie. I will recommend it to my friends.
5	1348531200	I am a prolific reader, and without a doubt, this is the best book I've read in the last 5 years.  If made into a movie, it would win an academy award for best drama.
4	1348531200	Although good from start to finish, this one was a bit slow in the beginning, but by Part two it was full steam ahead! It will tug at your heart-strings and make you reconsider "right vs. wrong." Books rarely make me cry but I cried at the end of this one, and if you already have children (I don't) the please make sure you have a FULL box of tissues handy!
5	1348444800	This book is fantastic! Very original, extremely well-written, and alternately joyful and heart-wrenchingly sad. I snuck this book with me to work and ready every chance I could! You will absolutely not be disappointed!
5	1348444800	Wonderfully written story with dynamic characters.  Really makes you consider the love between parents and children whether that be biological or otherwise.  The focus on forgiveness and moving beyond the mistakes in your life is something everyone will take away from this book.
5	1348444800	A terrific story, well written, wonderful discriptive scenes of location,  very sensitive to results of war on all,  those invloved and all connected,  cleaver resolution to a very difficult moral issue.  Cried profusely at the end.  Loved it.
4	1348444800	A good read. Really gives you a good idea of what it must be like to live in an isolated place and have great responsibility. Heart wrenching, the losses of this couple that led them to do the unthinkable. Can't say given the circumstances I wouldn't have been tempted as well. I am happy that all was made right at the end but the book still ends on a sad note. A good read and quite thought provoking.
5	1348444800	I liked this book because of the unusual problem presented to the main characters: a rowboat washed up on the shore of a remote lighthouse with a dead man and a live baby! The author gives the characters great voice-Australian accents to boot! Best of all is an ending that is not at all predicted, which I love!
4	1348444800	Talk about heartbreaking. From the start this novel breaks your heart about a man crippled from war, feeling undeserving of a woman's love and said woman's multiple miscarriges.It's hard to pick sides in this novel, is it the right thing to confess about the child's true identiy for your own peace of mind or keep silent for the sake of the child's welfare. Either way its up the readers moral values to determine if the character did the right thing or not. Where do you fall?
4	1348358400	I really enjoyed this book but I would have tweaked the ending.  If the ending were better, I would have given the book 5 stars.
5	1348358400	This is one of those books that you stay up late to read! The characters and setting are gripping, the author's descriptions are vivid-, an all- around excellent book.
4	1348358400	The remote setting of a light house creates unique conditions that unfold to paint a bittersweet story of love, loss and redemption. Old, unreconciled specters from the past surface, and each character must find his or her way into a new understanding; a new life.
4	1348358400	I chose this book for our Bookclub reading this month-I enjoyed this book-it ws interesting to hear the details of the life of a lighthouse keeper, about how the light is reflectd by the prisms and how desolate life would be without human interaction for months at a time. It was also a love story of sorts-that a man would go to such an extent to protect his wife.
4	1348358400	I liked the cover a lot so I decided to read it! I was not disappointed.  Although the beginning is uplifting, it turns into an extremely sad story. It is very well written.  I was a bit reluctant to finish it because it really pulled on the old heart strings.  The ending is very sad and somewhat unpredictable.
5	1348358400	Teally enjoyed this heart wrenching book about life in an isolated part of Australia. The book keeps a good pace, interesting and thought provoking.  A must read.
5	1348358400	The Light Between Oceans: A NovelI could not put this book down. There was always a surprise turning the page. The characters were so easy to like. This book I would tell friends to read.
5	1348358400	This was a book club pick.  Excellent read.  So much to discuss about the choices we make and the consequences of living with lies.Vivid characters and bonus new knowledge about the history of lighthouses and their keepers.Highly recommend.
4	1348272000	This book started out slowly, but the story picked up as I read, becoming quite exciting as it neared the end.  The writing and the  development of the characters was excelllent.
4	1348272000	I am really loving this book so far. I love the way the author uses such emotion when describing the character's trials, joys, and loss.A page-turning, enjoyable read.
5	1348272000	A very poignant book: a story of love, choices, and personal responsibility.Whether the reader is a parent or not,He/she will appreciate the depth of parental love portrayed in this novel and the deeply conflicted responses to an ethical dilemma. I couldn't put the book down and was sorry to finish it!
5	1348272000	This spare novel contains many worlds. The narration moves among a small group of individuals, each with a distinct voice and force. Its shifts in perspectives and details moves the story forward with sometimes incredible speed. And its moving final chapter had me in tears as I read its treatise on forgiveness. An excellent book.
4	1348272000	Good, interesting story.  Infuriating and heartbreaking at the same time.  The story is very well written, the author makes you love and hate one of the main characters, which is not a new technique but always keeps the reader trying to understand the reasons and motives as to why such characters act the way they do.
5	1348272000	This is one of the first books that I've ever read where you can feel for all the characters involved. It makes it so no part of the book is boring. You are glad to get to the next character and see how they are doing! A really good book, in fact I will read it again someday.
5	1348185600	Awesome book, which kept me hanging from the beginning. Ending was heart-wrenching but totally believable. Couldn't put it down and want to read more by this author
4	1348185600	I enjoy unusual story lines and this book does not disappoint.  So well written that I could very nearly feel the icy cold saltwater spray on my face as the main character trekked up to his lighthouse on his foreboding isolated island.  And I was completely thrilled for him when he managed to find someone to join him there.  The writing compelled me to keep turning the pages and often stay up past my bedtime just to keep reading about this fascinating character and his lonely life.  Unfortunately, things became very sad and turning the pages took more of an effort.  I would have enjoyed a more uplifting ending, but I still recommend this book.
5	1348185600	I could not put this book down!  It is sotouching . I felt so deeply about the characters. It is the type of book that should be read and studied in high school English classes. An exceptional read.
5	1348185600	Saw review for this in magazine and rushed home to order it. Not one chapter, did I feel disappointment in my choice. Excellent reading.
5	1348185600	I was captivated from the first page. The author's descriptions of the lighthouse, as well as the central characters were riveting and brought the reader into the story. I was totally caught up in the reasons behind both 'sides' of the story and felt emotions for both female main characters. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has loved a child or a mate.
5	1348185600	Beautifully written.  Compelling story that tugs at your heart strings. When a book can make me cry - it deserves 5 stars.
4	1348185600	Well written novel that caught my attention after just a few pages.  I normally do not read this type of book but  just after 15 pages I just had to keep reading and reading.  This story has many colorful characters that are weel described and I learned just what a lighthouse keeper does off on his/her lonely piece of land.The decisions the main characters make are all based on a lie and as in real life the greater the lie the greater the problems become.  Lies lead to lies and until one corrects the original the impact just grows on multiple psyches. A very good read with lessons for all!
4	1348185600	I am a beach reader and enjoyed this book very much. It kept my attention and I would recommend it to anyone. It would make a good Book Club read.
4	1348185600	The book was an easy read, making it a relaxing read for me.  I liked the characters and the details about living on an island running the lighthouse that was so important to the ships sailing the oceans.
5	1348185600	A good read, well written.  Interesting to learn about life of a keeper in that time period, but you know from early on there is no good answer to their dilemma.  So sad!
5	1348185600	I read this book for book club. Great story.Would highly recommend this book.Be prepared to learn about lighthouses and the life style of a light house keeper.
5	1348185600	This book was so well written about an area of the world that I know so  little about.  It was a compellingdilemma.. What would I do??  I was intrigued up to the very end.
3	1348185600	Well this is not a book I would recommend to friends that wanted an exciting story. Right from the beginning you know what is going to happen. Then you are taken through the agonizing parts when the discovery is made and wow, all at once everything works out and 20 years later it turns into an episode of what was lost is now found and it is o.k. To me it was so predictable and I was quite frankly bored. I finished the book because that is what I do. I read a lot on my kindle fire and am always looking for something good to read on Amazon but this book was a struggle most of the time. What else could it have been living on an island and the dayly care of a lighthouse? My fault but the title was misleanding. Sorry
4	1348185600	Very well written , interesting but sad story. Unusual setting, theme and outcome. Enjoyed the characters, story and descriptions.i enjoyed the journey this book took me on. would recommend it for a good read.
5	1348185600	Compelling story with characters that are believable. Their lives are simple but made complex by the emotional and moral decisions that confront them.A great read that will be hard to put away
4	1348185600	The emotions in this book were well written.  The author was good with descriptions, settings and capturing both visual and emotional settings.  I read A LOT and I liked this one.  It's a heartwrenching tale of what a woman would do for her child and what a husband will do for his wife in desperate circumstances.
5	1348185600	In this most unusual setting - a lighthouse - an incredible story unfolds.  I've recommended this book to all my friends.  Incredibly well written, and beautifully crafted... every word is delicious!
4	1348185600	Really enjoyed the way this book wove through the years and how small incidents from the past became relevant in the future.
4	1348185600	Great story full of interesting facts about Australia.  Loved the character studies of Tom's point of view and sense of duty and izz's need for more then just Toms love.
4	1348185600	As a mother and grandmother, I didn't know if I would be able to read this book because of the subject matter. There were times I found it emotionally wrenching, but I could empathize with all of the characters involved. What would I have done in their situation? A bonus for me was the time period and setting. I always like a book that introduces me to a new word, fact, etc.  I have already recommended this book to a few of my friends.
4	1348185600	I loved the book and have recommended it to one of my book groups for discussion.  The moral dilemma alone makes it shine above other books.  Pun intended!  A different read and well worth your reading pleasure.
5	1348185600	This was a well written and moving book.  The characters drew me in - I felt their joy and their pain.  All in all a great read!
4	1348185600	This book is quite interesting because it causes you to question your own ideas of right and wrong. The characters ring true and the story is plausible.  A very good reaf
5	1348185600	This may sound trite, but I could not put this book down!I just wanted to read and read and didn't want it everto end!  I definitely will be looking for more stories fromML Stedman.  Highly recommend.
4	1348185600	What a powerful example of how our choices, often made from emotional trauma, can affect, not only our lives, but the lives of all those around us.  This is a  story of love, loss and the struggle for restoration.  The heart of every mother is revealed as the story unfolds.  This book will make you cry, but it will also touch your heart with the power of love.
5	1348185600	This story had me and wouldn't let me go until the very end.  The turmoil and soul searching of each character as the biggest decision of their lives continues to wage a war on their daily lives is so well told that even when I wasn't reading I couldn't stop thinking about it.The author has told a compelling story and has fleshed out her characters so that they live with the reader.Well done.Peggy Lovejoy
3	1348185600	I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy this book, but I could say I was somewhat disappointed.  A bit wordy and drawn out at times.  Definitely a chick-book, which I didn't expect. Story line kept my interest; I finished it quickly, but I wasn't drawn into the plot.  Three stars feels about right for me.
5	1348185600	I adored this book.  From the first page I was involved and almost hated for the book to end because I would have to leave the characters!  It presents such an incredible human dilemma.  Such amazing characters...I felt that I knew each one inside and out. Also, I learned a lot about Australia that I didn't know.  I did not know it was a best seller when I selected this but it is most deserving.  Ranks with Sophie's Choice and Sarah's Key with me.
5	1348185600	This novel is not for the weak of heart. Tom is a memorable character who experiences love, loss, and redemption against a breathtakingly poetic landscape. My heart ached and broke for the characters in this " book of love."
4	1348185600	The book is set in Australia following World War !. The characters pulled me into the story so deeply that I also became part of the plot wanting to give advice to to both Izzy and her husband.I have recommended the book to many of my friends and was terribly saddened when it ended.
5	1348185600	This book examines the choices one couple makes. The choices may be different than the choices someone faces today, but everyone does face choices, and it is interesting to follow the choices and consequences in  this book.  How could he let her? How could he tell her no? How could he soothe his demons and hers? And what about the other woman?
5	1348185600	This was really an amazing book with a wonderful story and well-rounded characters who make decisions with the best of intentions, there's no clear winner or loser and there's not a hero or villan.
5	1348185600	Light between oceans was a different enough story line to be of tremendous interest to me.  A time, place and lifestyle very different from my own.  In addition, the plotline was unusual and well executed.  I really enjoyed this book, although it did drag for a bit in the middle, but when it picks up, it keeps rolling and kept me totally engaged.  I highly recommend this book
5	1348185600	An amazing novel that has it all. I laughed, I cried, I empathized with each of the main characters. Interesting premise, well written. The harsh yet beautiful scenery was described brilliantly.
5	1348185600	We read this book for my book group and it was so compelling and complex, everyone loved it.  I would highly recommend it.
5	1348185600	I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end!  I fell in love with all of the characters in this story and I sympathized with each and every one of them. It was hard to put this book down as I couldn't wait to find out how it would finally unravel.  I highly recommend this book!
5	1348185600	Excellent book.  Well researched.  Deeply felt.  Ms. Steadman weaves a haunting tale about the repercussions caused by just one moment's wrong decision.  She sets the scene and creates the atmosphere providing the reader's understanding of this choice and the hard realites of living with it.  I couldn't put this book down.
4	1348185600	I found this book to be a good one.  I did not expect the ending and I won't reveal it here.  I haven't read a book in a long time that made me laugh and cry in the same book but this one did.
3	1348185600	This book is well written, and deals with love, loyalty, truthfulness, duty and honor.  I also appreciated the descriptions of life on the island, settling into stronger connections with land, sea and sky. The main characters are fairly well developed and one is brought into the story not sure what choices will play out in which way. When supporting characters make surprising actions or requests, the story takes interesting turns. All this against the backdrop of a Lighthouse... steady and always true to it's function.  I would recommend this book to my friends!
5	1348185600	Couldn't put this down, I loved the lighthouse info, the remote setting, the interplay of many, many emotions, wonderful read and one of my very favourites.
4	1348099200	I loved the book, unusual and entertaining.  The characters were very believable and the circumstances were as well. One must wonder if you would do the same thing given the same set of circumstances. Highly reccomend it!
3	1348012800	Too many confusing descriptions of various subjects.  Don't recall the outcome of trial & how 2 main characters resumed their lives together.
5	1348012800	Beautiful book that should be made into a movie. I could clearly feel the depth of emotion in all of the characters and my heart went out to all of them. It was moving and thought provoking.
4	1348012800	Light Between Oceans is an absorbing read.  Hard to believe a person would be content to live in isolation on a light house island for months at a time, but I guess that was a profession a long time ago.  The isolation of the island is crucial to all the events, the choices and the development of the characters in the story. It's a love story and a tragedy...worth downloading for a long plane ride when you can just get lost in a book.
5	1348012800	Great book.  Kept me glued to the story.  Lots of twists and turns.  Havent finished yet but I cant wait to have a moment so I can get back to it.  Recommend it to anyone.
5	1348012800	This is a very well written and interesting book.  The author does a good job of developing the characters so the reader gets to know them.  I really enjoyed this book very much.
5	1348012800	The subject of this book caught my attention in the beginning, having heard tales of a lighthouse keeper and his family in Nova Scotia during my childhood.  But the beautifully developed characters, the isolation of the setting and the twisting, turning story kept me reading late into the night.  It's hard to believe this is a first novel and I hope Ms. Stedman will continue to write and publish more.  This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  It won't disappoint!
5	1347926400	Well written and builds curiosity/suspense re: "How it will work out for EVERYONE!" Characters very believable and easy to identify with; plus enjoy descriptions of life at a remote lighthouse.
4	1347926400	The Light Between Oceans is a beautifully written, sprawling story about love, guilt,  making choices, and their consequences. Not only are the characters well developed, and the story hugely compelling, but the images of 1920's Australia, land and sea, are breathtaking to read. One feels as if they can hear the crashing waves, and smell the salty air. This book is definitely one of my top 5 reads for 2012.
4	1347926400	The Light Between Oceans is a compelling story about life it's happiness and it's regrets.  The characters are very real. Tom is a man who was lied to and never felt loved. He meeets a carefree young woman who helps him open up. They live on a remote island off the coast of Australia, but cannot escape the harsh realities of life. They marry and make a decision that they have to live with disregarding the effects their decision will have on other people. Is keeping a child washed up on shore in a boat the best for everyone? Will the hurts they impart on others be worth their selfish motives? One has to read to find out.
4	1347926400	Life can throw all types of curve balls.  Coping with loss and finding joy can also bring tragedy.  It was one of those stories you want to keep reading to find out what happens.
5	1347926400	This novel brilliantly captures your heart.  It evolves around love & loss by exploring the challenges faced between husband and wife content to live a simple life surrounded by natures bounty, the sea, sun, and solitude.  The story beautifully depicts a mother's deep, innate desire to love and nurture a child.  While doing so, the story paints vivid, dramatic, heart-quickening situations many readers will find shocking.  Before you know it, empathy overtakes the shock factor and the story pulls at your heart strings so much you feel they will snap.  This novel's powerful message will speak to all; the desire to control and be in control of your life, happiness, etc.  Reading this novel will stir up your emotions and inspire acceptance of self and loved ones.  One of my favorite books, hands down.  Highly recommend.
5	1347926400	I really enjoyed this story.  And what a story it was!  It has been a long time since I've read such an intriguing, wonderful story as this one.  I can't wait for this author's next one.  I also have to add, this is the first book I've ever read on a Kindle.... I read it in a day.... and I hate to admit, being old school, I liked the experience.
5	1347926400	Sometimes you take a chance on a new author/book based on other reviews of it. I'm so glad I did. I would recommend The Light Between Oceans to anyone and am looking forward to the second book from this author. It has some intriguing plot twists that make you ponder "what would I do in this situation."
5	1347926400	The power of the love Tom had for his wife...to go against everything he believes in as right and correct.Being a Mother myself, I could feel the torment and anguish.  Well written and had lots of tears at the end.
4	1347926400	A tale of loneliness, love and tragedy peppered with morality, ethics and, perhaps misplaced blame.What would any of us do in a similar situation?
5	1347840000	I enjoyed this book and have recommended it to many friends.  The story is happy/sad and told in a page turning way. I look forward to reading more book by this author.
4	1347753600	I just finished this book last night and I loved it! It was well-written and an intriging story. Very different and original.
5	1347753600	What man would want to live alone on a tiny island as a lighthouse keeper whose only human contact is 4 times a year?  What type of woman would marry such a man and join him on the island?  To what extent will this couple go to have children join them?  The Light Between Oceans answers these questions while causing the reader to consider deeply what they would do for their own spouse, for their own child and for their own honor.Set in Australia after World War I this gripping tale holds the reader transfixed until the very unexpected ending.  Even a few pages before the end we don't know and absolutely cannot predict the finish of this well written novel.  The book raises many questions that made me think long after I finished it.A wonderful read for all the right reasons.
4	1347753600	This is a good read. The author does a very nice job of bringing out the emotional aspects of each main character's development through the story. It was frequently difficult to put down between chapters.
3	1347753600	The Light Between Oceans was not the book that I expected. It turned out to be an original story, with a plot that really makes the reader think, "What if?"I only gave it 3 stars,  but only because I reserve 4-5 stars for REALLY good books. This one was "enjoyable."
5	1347753600	This was a very good read. I liked the way it went from one time period to another in the characters lives.  It was easy to follow and developed the character at just the right time in the story.  At times the descriptions were a bit much and too involved for my taste, but it didn't happen often.  Australia is always a facinating location for a sad tale.  This was a sad tale but ultimately redeeming. I would recommend this book highly.
5	1347753600	Exciting and great writing!  Could not wait to pick up the my kindle each time  hopefully I will find Stedman in another adventure really soon
5	1347667200	A beautiful story that evokes emotion from the reader.  It was a little slow to start, but as the story unfolded I could not put it down!
4	1347667200	I downloaded this book with no info or reviews.  Loved it. And I am a prolific reader with tastes all over the map.  (i.e. not garbage like some other top rated junk on todays 'top" lists-you know what I mean).  A very enjoyable read--good decent writing and a beautiful story that will stick with you for awhile. I knew nothing re Australia and the landscape so that was a plus.
4	1347667200	Great read - very interesting setting and insite to what happened after the first world war to the fighters on the front lines
5	1347580800	This story is proof that there are consequences to every choice that we make in life, whether good or bad.  I found myself feeling many different emotions throughout, such as how could you, what were you thinking, are you crazy, I can't believe she's doing that, for Pete's sake, but also Tom had an unmistakable depth of love for Izzy that went far and beyond normal.  He really took to heart his vows of for better and worse, and in sickness and health.  I couldn't believe the many different emotions I felt while reading this novel, finding more difficulty with each page in putting the book down.  You often wonder why some people have to endure so much while it appears others never suffer a bit.  This author truly knows how to write a great, continuously flowing story that is spell-bounding throughout each chapter.  I appreciated that the story was from the 1920's however, maintained a modern dialect.  I am so privileged to  say that this is a book I've read and I will talk about it to everyone who will listen for days to come!
5	1347580800	This was an excellent story with vivid details.It kept your interest, not knowing how the story would end.Had to bring out the box of tissues in the last chapter.  Sad but just.
1	1347580800	I read all the reviews for this book and couldn't wait to read it.  It was a huge disappointment. I kept reading, thinking it would get better, but had to finally quit after 100 pages.
5	1347580800	I don't normally like historcial books, but this one was really interesting and fun to read..States how we all make decisions that may not be factor in long term consequences, would really recommend for a text book requirement in middle school english class...
5	1347580800	What a great story line.  This story centers around a husband and wife who raise, what they assume is an orphaned child as their daughter.  After a few years they discover her biological mother is still living.  What comes next is heartwrenching.  It seems to be a no-win situation for everyone involved.
5	1347494400	Beautifully written.  It stirred the depths of one's own conscience with a heart-wrenching story of the deepest loves a person is capable of giving. Different setting, thought-provoking story line, compelling read.
5	1347494400	My soul ached for this couple.  While their actions were questionable, it seemed right for her, not so much him.  I just kept reading wanting to know how this would end.
4	1347494400	Very good read - Sad story, but very heartwarming.  Ends exactly the way that it should!  I will read more by this author.
5	1347494400	Chose this book at random from a short review - so glad I did!  Enjoyed the author's descriptions and once into the story, I had to keep reading.
5	1347494400	This book was recommended by a friend.  I loved it but found the ending very sad for all involved.  It is well written and holds your interest for quick reading.  As a lover of happy endings, this one makes you cry. I would highly recommend it to others but I still cry thinking about it.
4	1347408000	The book is a pleasant change and a great way to relax for a few hours. You can picture in your mind the beautiful area  where the story takes place and enjoy a look back at the life and times just after the first world war. It has some twists and turns to keep you guessing, but all in all it is a delightful story, an enjoyable book to read and a break from who done its and shoot 'em up stories.  Highly recommend.
5	1347408000	This book was wonderful!  I haven't had a "good read" like "The Light Between Oceans" in quite some time.  It kept you captivated up until the very end.  A friend recommended the book and I am SO glad I read it. It was sad, joyful and suspenseful at times. I would truly recommend this book.
5	1347408000	I was pleasantly surprised by this book, which was my most recent book club's read.  The underlying subject - the struggle of a parent's bond with a child - was touching, but learning about lighthouses, Australia, and the time period also added to my enjoyment.  It was one of those books where I kept thinking "What would I do if I were in this situation?"  I usually use that as my measuring stick - if it makes me think what I would do, it's pretty good!
5	1347321600	This author was able to convey the deep bonds of trust and devotion that can develop between adults and children and the longing and pain that separation brings with such insight and skill I am moved to tears just thinking about the book again.  The reader feels empathy with every person involved because the writer loves and understands every one of the characters.  I recommend this book highly--it is on my mental list of most memorable reads.
5	1347235200	I loved this book. I thought it was well written.  Even though some of the words were clearly "Australian", it did not affect how much I enjoyed it. Highly recommend this book
1	1347235200	Not sure why this comes up when you search for Kindle accessories, because it does not work for the kindle Fire.  Totally useless!!!
4	1347235200	Lovely writing but VERY depressing and heavy...The characters are richly detailed and the depth of emotional pain is felt in one's heart. Definitely not a light, up-lifting beach book, but a worthwhile read.
5	1347235200	England's male population was decimated by World War II and those who returned were either physically disabled and/or suffered from what we now call PTSD.Tom Sherbourne is the exception. In his new job as a lighthouse keeper on a remote island off the southern coast of Australia he hopes to find solace from survivor's guilt.Tom and his wife Isabel are happy and at peace with their isolation until Isabel suffers yet another miscarriage resulting in a stillborn boy.  Just two weeks later a baby girl in a rowboat washes ashore.  For Isabel she's a gift from God; for Tom a recurring nightmare of right from wrong.Their decision to keep Lucy leads to a devastating denouement.What decision would you have made?For myself I confess I still don't know.And that's the test of a good novel; it keeps you thinking long after the book is closed.
5	1347235200	The Light Between Oceans is a beautifully writte book full of moral dilemma. The characters are believable, haunting and well-developed.  I highly recommend this book, along with a box of tissues!
5	1347235200	Totally engrossing.  Well developed characters in a unique historic and geographic setting.  A lovely piece of work that was difficult to put down.
4	1347235200	I enjoyed reading this story. Toward the end, I was thinking it was getting strange, but the stories end brought some redemption to the plot.Sad but good.
5	1347148800	Tom and his wife, Isabel, live on a remote island where he tends the lighthouse.  Tom is haunted by memories of the horrors of World War I, which leads him to this life of isolation.  Isabel wants a child desperately, but miscarries twice and then has a stillborn baby.  It seems to her like a gift from God when a boat washes ashore soon after with a dead man and a live baby.  They ultimately agree not to report the incident and claim the child as their own.As time goes by, Tom is torn with guilt by their decision, especially when they discover the mother of the baby is alive and on the mainland, grieving the mysterious loss of her husband and child.  Tom wants to return the child to her mother, but can't bear to break his wife's heart.This is a gripping story of deception and the emotional consequences for all concerned.
5	1347148800	Great book, I really couldn't stop reading.  Took my kindle on a trip to Amsterdam and the book was so good, the flight seemed shorter.  I highly recommend reading it!
5	1347148800	This book was one that I made time to pick up.  The characters were my friends even though they made decisions I didn't agree with. One has to think of what they would do in the shoes of the characters.
3	1347148800	The characters are well developed and endearing, with human flaws that all of us possess. The story made me think about doing right and wrong, and especially provided reflection of my values. What would I have done in a similar situation? If you want to escape real life problems, don't read this book.  The ending was sad but a good way to  complete the story of people giving and receiving love.
4	1347148800	I could not put the book down. You couldn't wait to see how the story unfolded. A tearjerker for sure!
5	1347148800	heart warming, family oriented,understanding, happiness & warmth, deceiving, frantic,captivating. Kept me coming back to the book every chance I could get. Sad  ending but life is that way.
5	1347148800	I loved this book from beginning to the end!  I found it captivating.  It was a quick read and I couldn't put it down.  The language used made it very easy to picture the scene being described!  I would highly recommend this to everyone.
5	1347148800	This is a great debut novel dealing with the question of choices and the consequences of those choices.  The setting is the very remote Janus Island off the coast of Australia where Tom Sherbourne is the keeper of the lighthouse in 1926.  Having survived World War I, he is happy to spend his life in solitary work, maintaining the lighthouse to guide ships traveling the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean.  At least, he is happy until he meets Isabel while on shore leave and nothing is ever the same.  They are truly soul mates and destined to be together; so, the vivacious and charming Isabel says goodbye to family and the life she knows to be with Tom in his almost hermit-like existence.  After two miscarriages and a traumatic still birth, Isabel is a changed and deeply grieving person.  Then, one day, a boat runs ashore on their island.  Inside are a dead man and a screaming baby.  It is here that choices begin to be made, choices that will affect everyone and change lives forever.How the man and the baby came to be in the boat, the life they left behind, the life that the baby will renew in Isabel are all told in beautiful prose that speaks to the heart of the mother/child bond.  This is a tragic story because even the best of choices often brings heartbreak to others.  And the heartbreak in this novel is palatable.  The reader will be torn between what is right and what is wrong and be sympathetic to all the characters as they fight each other.  If ever it can be said there is no right or wrong answer, then truly that applies to this story.Heart wrenching and truly sad, yet uplifting and truly joyful, this is a book for all who enjoy stories of love and heartbreak, tragedy and redemption.
5	1347148800	Wonderful story. Could not get it off my mind. Extremely well written. Characters so well formed that you can identify with each one. I cried at the end. Can't really say who was right. Should lead to a great discussion for my book group.
5	1347148800	This book is a light easy read. It will keep your interest. Set in a forgotten time. Anyone with a softspot for light houses will enjoy this book.  Give a try , you will not be sorry.
5	1347148800	At first I was fascinated by the characters' ability to enjoy the simple things in daily life and still develop layers of complexity.  As I progressed through the book, I became completely hypnotized by the layers that began to develop in each character.  I stayed up all night to finish the book. I smiled, laughed, frowned, cried and sobbed through this author's first novel. What a complete treat!
5	1347062400	I would give this book 10 stars if I could.  Couldn't read through tears at times.Can't wait to see more from this author.
5	1347062400	A beautiful story.  I dare you to read it and not be moved.  I look forward to this author's next book.
4	1347062400	I was impressed with Stegman's writing, especially as a first effort. I know that when I get emotional about a character or situation that it is a good book. She had me involved from the beginning, and I wasn't sure how it would end. The characters were believable and well drawn into the story. I have recommended this book to my "bookie" friends.
5	1347062400	Excellent read - really became absorbed in the story.  Great character development, and the writer did a great job of transporting the reader to the lighthouse island.
4	1347062400	I really enjoyed the story and the characters.  If there was one issue with the book, I felt that the characters were all playing out an inevitably sad script for everyone involved once the pivotal decision was made early on.
5	1347062400	It was hard to put this book down.  What a moving story. You could actually feel what the characters were going through each step of the way.  I look forward to more books from this author.
4	1347062400	Stedman certainly did a fine job researching the topic for this story.  It was beautifully written and it was enjoyable to read. If you are looking for a fairy tale, this book is not for you.  Stedman's descriptive writing is amazing, but the story itself is anything but uplifting.  This would make a great screen play if you like sad stories.
5	1347062400	This story about the lighthouse keeper and his wife was very thought provoking. When a baby and her dead father wash ashore on this remote island it seems a miracle has happened for the wife, Isabel, whose own attempts at having a child of her own have failed. There is a choice to be made....would you have done the same thing?
5	1346976000	This is a book that is worth reading....the circumstances that bring this couple to do what they do almost make it excusable,  Great read!
4	1346976000	This book was very well written.  The characters were interesting and I felt myself drawn to know what would happen at the end.  However, this was also, hands down, the saddest book I've ever read.  One third of the way through I had tears running down my face and I continued to be emotional off and on throughout the rest of the book.  I even had to set it aside for a bit as it was just too much for me.  But, what made me pick it up again was the story and the characters.Well worth the read.
5	1346976000	EXCELLENT!!! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  I FELT FOR ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK.  YOU WANT THEM ALL "TO WIN"
5	1346976000	I loved, loved .loved this  Author and story.  I could not stop reading.  I hope  to go back and jot down some things she wrote . Sayings, sentences  that resonated with me.  I was amazed with her understanding  of human emotions, men ,women and children.  I was especially moved by the  evocation of the trauma that child suffered.  We might not give any thought to that.  Lucy ended up with her real mother...that is right.  Stedman writes so well I could feel in my body the trauma of that separation.  Even the. change of Lucy's name made me think of how confusing it all must have been on top of the traumatic, sudden loss for this child.  I would be so disappointed if someone didn't give this story a chance feeling it was chick lit.  It is '"human condition " literature.  We all need to learn to experience the kind of empathy this author gives the opportunity to experience.  I didn't find it unbelievable at all.  One of the. Characters said something about how life feels like it can't get any worse when back it comes and grabs another chunk. This book was another learning experience for me to help me understand life and being human. I so thank MLStedman for writing it.
4	1346976000	This is a subject that is not often addressed in a book. a lighthouse keeper.  It is very interesting and has a really good plot, and an ending that is very sad but very believable
5	1346976000	I have just finished this book and I rarely take the time to write a review, but this book was so good I felt compelled to do so.  For anyone who has loved and lost someone this is a must read, but be sure to have a BOX of tissues for the end.It is a heartfelt story of broken people battered about by misfortune who manage to make a life and find happiness in the turbulent post WWI era.  The characters may seem simple and the pace a bit slow at first, but keep with it.I found the simple, descriptive prose and straigtforward storytelling refreshing.  Many of today's authors cram their sentences with so many verbs and desciptive phrases that you lose the thread of the story - not so with this book.I urge you to give it a chance.  You won't be sorry.
5	1346976000	This book is a haunting example of the consequences of our choices in life.  Isabel is a good person who makes a terrible choice, and must pay the consequences.  I read about five books a week, and this is right at the top of my best read list for the year.  A wonderful book.
5	1346976000	I thought this was an enjoyable quick book to read. Full of different emotions, it left me crying from beginning to end. I would read another one like it!
5	1346976000	I love this book! I am an avid reader and this has to be one of the best I've read in a long time. The characters are so well developed they will stay with you for a long time after you read the book. The choices made in this book and the consequences that follow will haunt you. This story is incredibly sad. I read this book weeks ago and I am still thinking about the story and the people involved. I am anxiously awaiting more from this author!
5	1346976000	Great book. Starts a bit slow but really worth the effort  to get through the first few chapters  Really captured the spirit of the lights.
5	1346976000	This is an amazingingly heart-rending story...It grabs your attention and never lets go.  The characters are well drawn and achingly human. This story begs the question: "What would you do?"...for love, for your spouse, for your child. This book delves into the human heart and it's confusing worlds of good and evil and blurs the lines between them. An excellent book for discussion.
4	1346976000	I loved the setting, an Island with a lighthouse.  That always has intrigued me.  The characters were well developed.  There was mystery and a good story to tell.
4	1346976000	The subject is compelling, but less than half way through one realizes that there is only one outcome, so therefore I found the predictability distracting.  Any other conclusion would place the book in the fantasy section.  That being said, I enjoyed the craft of M.L. Stedman steering me to that conclusion.
5	1346889600	I really liked this book a lot! It's a story about a lighthouse keeper and his wife on a remote island off the coast of Australia. It is set in the time right after WWI. A baby washes up on their shore and the decisions they make at that point affect their lives and the lives of others.  I don't want to spoil the experience by saying any more about it.  But read this book!
4	1346889600	The Book held my interest throughout.  Excellent discriptions of each character.  You felt you knew them personally.  You felt their joys and their pains.
4	1346889600	I really enjoyed this book.  It was an easy read, though the second half of the book was more interesting than the first half.  It wasn't a story that kept me up late at night plowing through chapters to see what happened next.  However, the ending was unexpected.  The author wasn't afraid to give each character flaws.  No cookie cutter plot here.
4	1346889600	I have been interested in the lives of lighthouse keepers, real or fictional.  The young man and woman in his story face the challenges of new love, marriage, loss and sorrow, and trust with mixed results.They are committed to each other, the requirements of living on a small island with only monthly supply visits, the skills necessary for survival, but their intense desire to have a family ends in sorrow and loss to the point of making a  drastic decision to keep a baby who surprisingly lands in a boat washed up on their island.  The rest of the story includes lies, discoveries, loss of trust, sorrow and difficult decisions.  I could  not put the book down neither could I anticipate the final ending. The book is well written; the reader shares the emotional highs and lows of these young people.
5	1346889600	Great story dating back to late 1800s about loyalty to a spouse which compromises their own integrity and honesty.  The characters are very real and heart warming.  From birth until death, this story follows a lighthouse keeper and his family with amazing insight.
5	1346889600	This book was so well written, kept my attention til the very end.  The characters were easy to follow and interesting.
5	1346889600	This was a wonderful book. The tragedy and heartache they went through was so difficult. Reading about the light and living there was fascinating!
4	1346889600	Enjoyed this book.  Well written.  I will recommend to my book club  - it would be a good discussion book.Can see why it was a best seller in Australia.
4	1346889600	The story moves along and is easy to follow. There aren't many characters to remember. It was easy to feel sympathy for the situation. On one hand I felt it wasn't  right to keep the baby but didn't want the secret to get discovered. I enjoyed the setting and learned about lighthouses.
4	1346889600	This was a great book - started a little slow, but I really enjoyed it. I read a lot and this is one that I would likely recommend.
4	1346889600	The choices we make will always follow us. Sometimes we make choices out of love, even against our better judment.The caracters are very real. A good read.
5	1346889600	When you first read this, you may find yourself thinking you know exactly what you would do, but as the story unfolds, your thoughts may change.  I couldn't put it down, and recommended it to my book club who are all enjoying it so far.  We will have a great discussion about choices and consequences!
5	1346889600	a must read.  one of my favorite books of the summer.  I could not read it fast enough and then of course did not want it to end.
4	1346889600	Enjoyable reading keeps you wanting to learn more about characters reactions.  A dilemma that has many sides.  Would make a good discussion for a book club.
4	1346889600	This was a really good read that kept me turning pages. The characters were so definable and the story line was excellent. I hated to see the book come to an end and it makes it hard to find the next book to enjoy as much.
4	1346889600	As many other reviewers have said, the writing is smooth and the plot moves quickly. This is not a title to begin when you only have five minutes to devote to it. I did not care for the ending, but then again, I'm rarely satisfied by an ending. Love that this title functions on many levels.
5	1346889600	Excellent read. Well written. A completely different story line that captured my interest immediately. I enjoyed the aurhor's writing style. Could not put it down!
5	1346889600	When I started this book I was a bit skeptical, but then I found that I did not want to put it down. When I did just have to stop reading I couldn't wait to get back to it.
5	1346889600	I loved reading this book and couldn't put it down until finished. It was a great story. I purchased for my Kindell and it kept me awake a couple of nights. I
2	1346889600	After all of the pre-published praise for this book I was earger to read it. I waas disapointed at the slowness of the story and had great difficulty following the Australian "slang" style of writing.The early boring descriptions of where the lighthouse was located made me skip pages and pages just to get to what the story was about.In fact I skipped pages as I tried to read the whole book. I did not enjoy this book at all.
4	1346889600	Entertaining and a real escape. Would suggest Hollywood to make a movie only the child row up to be president of the USA since u do not have to be a born citizen.
5	1346889600	This book was recommended to me.  I love it and it certainly holds my interest.  It is well written and very descriptive.  I almost feel as I am there with the characters.
5	1346889600	I loved this book.  It was a different story line.  I don't know where the book was going which kept me very interested.  I would defiantly recommend.
5	1346889600	This is one of the best books I've read this summer.  Extremely well written, very discriptive, I felt as though I was there and watching the story unravel.
5	1346889600	Great and quick read! I couldn't put the book down. I fell in love with the characters.  As a mother I got so emotional at the end. Start to finish, the book was wonderful!
5	1346889600	Looking for a good book to get lost in and this IS that book.  The book kept me reading to the end
5	1346889600	This was a well written, interesting novel. I was drawn in right away and read the whole book in two sittings. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to other readers.
3	1346889600	Interesting book with excellent information  on lighthouses and their operation.  Sad story which was a bit hard to belief at times. The first half of the book was fascinating but it slowed in the second half.
4	1346889600	In reading the book, you know right away the other side of the story so maybe I would have made the same decision. I really enjoyed this book. It made you think and feel.
5	1346889600	This is a beautifully written novel about a young childless couple in post World War I Australia.  A baby arrives in a boat, onto their shores.The husband is a lighthouse keeper, and they live alone on an island.The decision to keep the baby, and raise her as their own child has a profound impact on the couple. The novel explores the many choices that we all have in life.
4	1346889600	Loved the descriptive setting of the light house.  THe main character was always sufferiing with guilt and remore and always torn between love for his child and his sense of justice.  The relationship with his wife lacked clarification as the plot unfolded.  There were few details of their intimate conversations.  The whole descriptions of interactions (with her parents etc) just kinda fizzled.  I was disappointed in the end of the story line.  I kept reading, anxious to know how it would ever turn out and the plot was fine but the qualitiy of writting just didn't keep pace with the events.  I was disappointed.
4	1346889600	This is a gem!! Was so sad to finish it.Cant  wait for another delightful book of this quality. Lets hope something is in the pipeline!
4	1346889600	The devastation of losing a child can make a person or persons do uncharacteristic things. Sometimes the deepest love can cause you the greatest harm.
5	1346889600	What a great first novel.  I am not a "love story" fan, but this mystery/love story captured me from page one.  The images of the setting, and the emotions of the characters were brought to life by a marvelous writing style.
3	1346889600	Now this is a very different style of book. The overall story is fine but the resolution is just not right and becomes a little sucky and unlikely. There are also several things that you that just  cant believe would happen in life, not because it's not possible but by the way it's written.However, that said, the English is very good pulling you along well. It's basically the story of an ex army man running from life by going to run a light house. Then comes the romance and  a baby that is found in a stranded boat on the beach. The first half of the book is great. The authors descriptions of the 'hero's' life and what it's like on the Lighthouse Island are very good.It's sort of worth the read and I will probably buy her next book to see if she can improve on some of the things I've mentioned but I wouldn't tell people to rush out and buy it.
5	1346889600	I laughed I cried I was even surprised when I thought the book was going the typical writers way it took me in a new direction. I loved the book.
5	1346889600	A childless lighthouse keeper in a remote part of Australia agrees to let his young wife keep and raise a baby they find adrift in a boat.  He knows he should try to find the baby's mother, but he can't bear to take the child away from his wife, who has suffered two miscarriages and a stillbirth.  The couple pass the baby off as their own for years, then suffer the consequences....I loved this book.  The characters are well-written; the colloquial dialogue is charming; and I felt like I learned something about post-World War I Australia without having a history or geography lesson jammed down my throat.  The concept was compelling and would really apply to any time and place.  (After I finished the novel, I looked up the Baby Jessica and Baby Richard cases on the Internet.)I was touched by this book, and kept turning the pages because I couldn't imagine how the story would end.
5	1346889600	This book was fantastic right up to the end. I love that it wrapped up every detail. I wish there were more books like this!
4	1346889600	IT REMINDS ME OF "OH WHAT A WEB WE WEAVE WHEN WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE"!  IT WAS THOUGHT PROVOKING AND VERY SAD.
5	1346889600	The setting and the characters took me away to another time and awakened a my senses as I read - hear the ocean and smell the salt air, see the waves and brilliant light, feel the pain of loss and loneliness, rejoice in the love of family and friendship, and relief with the gift of compassion.  A wonderful, light but very interesting and informative read.  Truly enjoyed this book.
4	1346889600	This story captured my interest right away.  Could not predict the outcome of the story.  Makes you think:  What would I do.  Good writing - great characters. I would read more by this author.
4	1346889600	I enjoyed this book...it was well written and examined the dilemma of human desires and doing the right thing.....decisions that are made have lasting consequences not only on you, but on others.  Lives can be impacted dramatically even if you justify to yourself that you are doing the right thing.....
4	1346889600	I purchased this book because I was looking for something different and I love anything about the sea. I loved the beautiful descriptions of the life on this lighthouse island and felt like I was right there. I felt like I knew the characters. I'm usually not big into reading love stories because they are all so much alike. Not so with this book. The story is beautiful and unique.
5	1346889600	It was one of the best books I have ever read and should be made into a movie.  It held your interest all the way through and it was difficult to put down.  The plot was terrific.
5	1346889600	The Light Between Oceans caught my eye because I love stories about lighthouses and the lives of the lighthouse keepers.  This book was one that immediately drew me in with the first chapter when Isabel found the baby in the boat after just losing a baby of her own.  I could only imagine the emotions that the book would bring.  But I was not prepared for the depth of love and joy that Isabel and Tom felt, but also for the guilt that was never out of Tom's mind.  The heartbreak that Hannah was experiencing was also heart wrenching. Even though there were times of happiness, I knew there would not be a happy ending for everyone, and the book made me do some soul-searching over what I would do in the same situations.  The story was never boring, and the book was so hard to put down. It had several unexpected twists that wove an amazing tale.  I would recommend the book to anyone who wants a well-written and thought provoking story.  I loved it!
3	1346889600	I did enjoy this book for a fun read.  It was quite unrealistic, so you must like fiction.  The writing was good up until the end.  The ending was a little disappointing.
3	1346889600	The story is rather unusual and original. One feels that somewhere in the authors personal life she was exposed to a similar situation. Not to be sexist but the story was a bit too "touchy feely" for me. Very nice story of forgiveness and realities of life.
4	1346889600	A very interesting and thought provoking story made you think of what you would have done in same circumstances!Well written and made me kep turning the pages!
5	1346889600	It was a heart wrenching story, but a beautiful story as well.  Love can conquer all!  Would make a great movie!  I couldn't put it down once I got reading.  I cried my eyes out towards the end at 3:00 a.m.
5	1346889600	This is a page turning read...I read this book over a weekend while on vacation. I couldnt put it down and really had no ideahow the story would end.
4	1346889600	I thought this book was well written and told a different sort of story. I think the morality portion of the story was a bit simplistic at times and I thought the male protagonist was also a bit flat while the female protagonist we had a better feeling for who she was, but not what made her "tick". A decent read and a somewhat thought provoking book all in all.
5	1346889600	This was a great book.  Once I started it, I could not put it down.  I would definitely recommend it.
4	1346889600	Wasn't too sure about this purchase but my love for lighthouses and the ocean won out. Well written, factual and fabulous setting. A great read!
5	1346889600	This book was excellent.  I couldn't put it down.  What an impossible dilemma faced by these characters.  It would make for a good group discussion.
3	1346889600	While well written, it was a very unusual story and somewhat disturbing.I bought it because it takes place in Australia but there is a lot of informationabout isolation of a light house that was of little interest to me.Cannot say it is a must read.
5	1346889600	Not the type of book I would normally read but loved it. Engrossing fun and well constructed throughout. Recommended. Notjust "woman's book "
4	1346889600	Good story line, kept you interested in finding out what was going to happen. First time reading a book by this author and would definitely read more.  I enjoyed it.
5	1346889600	This story, set in post World War I Australia, was beautifully written and well paced. In present day, it's hard to imagine the difficulties faced by the characters; their surroundings, the vicitms of war, the lack of medical advancements available at the time. You couldn't help but be drawn into the setting and the characters' lives. The author did a tremendous job in developing the characters and supplying a foundation for their reasoning, their actions. The tale highlights the morality one can justify around loving a child. It was tragically sad and I'll admit it, I wept openly at the conclusion. It was a wonderful read and I found it very difficult to put down but it is a story that will stay with the reader long after they've finished the book.
5	1346889600	characters vivid and believable  story weaves to beautiful ending but not without some tears  goes quickly and easy to read
4	1346889600	A wonderful story that illustrates the consequences of the choices that we make. It also speaks to the resilience of the human spirit and what humans will do for love.
4	1346889600	The book has you wondering at how basically good intentions end up creating such a mess. A roller coaster ride, going down a lot. Great read.
5	1346889600	Great story.  Haven't cried reading a book in a long time.  A great read.  Very emotional and tender story.  Heartfelt.
5	1346889600	The cover & name of the book looked interesting.  I read the sample and it sounded interesting (knowing it would be "Bitter Sweet".  From start to finish I loved this book, it was heart breaking and well written, understanding the situation  ......I give it a 4 star.Marilynn Schnair
5	1346889600	I had seen this book advertised in several different places (magazine, email, etc.) and finally thought I have to try reading it.  It was so good.  I could not put this book down.  It reminded me of an old-fashioned classic book--Wuthering Heights, etc.  Absolutely loved this book and I have been recommending it to whoever will listen to me.
5	1346889600	I really enjoyed this audio book. I was touched by the sensitive way this story unfolded. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romance.
4	1346803200	I read constantly, but most of the time it's non-fiction.  This story, however, grabbed me.  Having been married for over 37 years, having children and grandchildren who I love deeply, puts me in a place to really appreciate the dilemna this husband had to deal with  in the face of his wife's crisis.  I loved it and was able to relate to every single character in the story.  Now that I've finished it, I miss the chance to look forward to those times I could curl up with it.  It was well-told without being too lengthy and over-indulgent.  I highly recommend it.
5	1346716800	The best I.ve read in years!  I cried and laughed, that makes a great movie or read for me.  I can.t stop thinking about it.
3	1346630400	I liked this book, although it dragged a bit in the middle and at the end, thought it could have had more connections with the daughter.
5	1346630400	I have read around 100 books since I got my Kindle at Christmas, but this is, by far, one of the most captivating books I have read yet.  It is such an original story and heartbreaking how each character deals with the situation.  Don't hesitate to give this one a try!  Five stars definitely
1	1346544000	I too fell for the reader reviews  About two-thirds of the way through I gave up. The plot plodded along, sometimes stopping altogether. Which would have been fine if the characters were developed to a point where I just enjoyed hearing about them, or if I was compelled just by the sheer beauty of the prose.  Alas, neither was the case.
4	1346457600	The storyline intrigued me.  I felt there would be a lot of mixed feelings and internal strife present in the characters and the reader in this book and it did not disappoint.  Would recommend this for sure!
5	1346284800	I almost disregarded  this book and am so happy I decided to purchase it. The characters come alive and you get pulled into their lives. The storyline leaves you unable to put the book down in anticipation. So much more than I expected!
5	1346284800	My favorite type of reading material is Historical Fiction and this book fits the catagory very well. A good read.
5	1346284800	A great story about the choices we make in life both good and bad and the consequences.  I could not put this book down because I had to know what would happen.
5	1346284800	This story is absolutely fascinating in the description of the life it describes. The characters have such depth and emotion - the perfect novel.I willread it again and again. Quite enjoyable.
5	1346198400	I love to read, but am not one to write reviews; not until I read this book.  What a sad & haunting story!  It was wonderfully written.  I felt Tom & Izzy's pain, as well as Hannah's!  It really makes you wonder what you would do if you were faced with the same situation!  This is a must-read!!  Don't forget your Kleenex!!!
5	1346112000	The Light Between Oceans is very well written and thought provoking.  I couldn't put it down!  You laugh and cry with the characters - it easy to see yourself making similar choices and finding yourself in similar quandries.  Oh, the tangled web we weave...
4	1346025600	The story of a man of honor who makes a choice against his better judgment for the sake of his wife; and can neither escape his guilt nor find the courage to do what he knows to be the right thing.  Eventually and ultimately the truth comes out, very nearly destroying all concerned.  I can't wait for this author's next work!
5	1345939200	best book i have read in a while.very well written and hard to put down.  willbe watchimg for the next addition.one
4	1345766400	Very moving story about what would you do? First i was captivated by the main character in the story. how that many fail to see the effects of war on an individual but how, even though he went a little overboard, he held on to his sense of right and wrong and his love for his wife.
5	1345680000	Wasn't sure about this one but decided to try it and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  What an amazing story of love in all it's forms.  I must admit I cried while reading it (can't remember the last time a book did that to me) but I felt all the joy and pain of these characters.  I look forward to more by this author but I know this books is going to stay with me for a very, very long time.
5	1345507200	WOW!  This gifted author transports you into the hearts/souls of the characters while doing the same for you as you reflect on your choices in life and how they may have affected others.  Phenomenal.
5	1345334400	This is a riveting story about the thin line between right and wrong that will stay with you for weeks.
5	1345248000	Great book! it even brought me to tears ,and that doesn't 't happen very often!I hope this author will write more books as I think this her first.
4	1345248000	This book was a welcome gift, and I saved it to read on vacation. Once into it, I was drawn into the author's hypnotic prose and lyrical descriptions and developed feelings for the strong, well-crafted characters. What a fabulous book, I thought. Loved the metaphors of the light house and isolated island life. Then I reached the mid-way mark and knew there was no way this book was going to end well. And I was right. The author "painted herself into a corner", so to speak, and there was no way out. I was going to stop reading, but of course, couldn't do that. For anyone with tender sensibilities, all I can say is beware. This book will break your heart, no matter which one of the characters you care for the most.
5	1345075200	I loved the book.  I kept wondering how it would all end and at the same time hoped for several ways to be the ending.  I will read more by this author.
4	1345075200	I enjoyed this book very much. First I have read by this author. I felt as if I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks at the lighthouse. You will love this book.
4	1344988800	The Light Between Oceans is a great read.  Because I work more than a full time job I am only able to read for a short time in the evenings.  This book has me thinking about the subject all day long!  Makes me wonder how I would react in a similar situation.  Being unable to biologically have children myself, I can relate to how Isabel feels (maybe not to such a degree!).  Since I'm reading on a Kindle Fire, I can tell you that I am 72% into the book, so I have the climax to go yet and have not a clue how it will end.  I do not readily recommend a book, but this story is very compelling!
5	1344988800	This book made me cry -- not necessarily out of sorrow for the characters' situation, but just how our choices really do impact not only us, but others.  It was truly a book that made you reflect on life's dilemmas and how we confront them.  I thought that the most memorable passage in the book is the one in which Frank states that forgiveness only takes up one day, but resentment has to be reinforced every day and that destroys a person.  The characters were believable and I learned a lot about life in that part of Australia. I had to look up what a "dugite" was!  As a parent and a wife, it was a novel that impacted me, but anyone who is faced with choices (and not choices between "good" and "bad," but choices in the gray areas) would find this a great read!
4	1344556800	This novel was very rich in a few different themes; grief; love; forgiveness; commitment; honor... It was quietly a great morality piece, without hitting you over the head with it. I ended up truly feeling the conflict pulling the characters back and forth between right and wrong, and the grey area in between, which turned out to be a bottomless pit of quicksand. The ability of one deception continuing to grow and engulf the characters lives, -and the ripple effect that deception sent out into the entire community- was a true and biting commentary on the weight of our decisions in life. I loved how the story wasn't told with judgment, but instead demonstrated how indeed, decisions don't always come clear-cut, but carry consequences whatever the course of action chosen. The novel also palatably described the anguish that these circumstances brought.Excellent, -very thought provoking. I highly recommend. I wasn't very sure from the description that I wanted this book, so downloaded the sample; -I am so glad I ended up getting it. (I also really appreciate the sample option..... take advantage of it!!!)
5	1344470400	I could not put this book down. I have been reading a lot of books on my Kindle this summer--I'm a teacher and have time off--and most of my purchases have been in the 2-3 dollar range. I wasn't sure about spending 11 dollars on a Kindle book. But I was intrigued by the plot line and the notion of getting to know something about Australia, a place far, far away from me. From the first chapter, I was hooked. Not only are the characters well drawn, the imagery the author uses to weave together multiple threads is astounding. The characters themselves--Tom, the war veteran turned lighthouse keeper whose past holds darkness, and Isabel, his young wife whose longing to be a mother supersedes her good judgement--fill the book, even though they live an isolated life on the small lighthouse island of Janus.It was a book that I knew at the beginning would not end well. The lies that were spun out by Isabel and supported by Tom had, at some point in time, to come to light. But, oh, how I wished that the small Sherbourne family could have just remained intact on their little island, forever guarded by the stars. I was satisfied at the end. Things were put to right, more or less, but Tom and Isabel did not lose one another. The choice that Isabel had to make was heart-rending; I was not sure, until the last, what her decision would be.Some critics have claimed that this is a "girl read." So be it. Perhaps those of us who have carried children under our hearts can understand, in a way the other gender cannot, the pull a child can have on your soul. For myself, this girl was entranced by the "beach read". The research the author did on lighthouses and the wartime made it more than just a light romance. It was, in a word, astounding.
5	1344384000	The Light Between Oceans by M. L. Stedman, is a wonderful debut novel; in fact, Ms. Stedman writes with the depth of an experienced author. The book hooked me with the first sentence! The harsh setting draws you in, and the characters are superbly developed, very persuasive in their points of view. I empathized with Isabel and her husband Tom throughout the entire book; it was hard for me to like Hannah, and she was the character for whom I should have felt the most empathy.This book is about choices--how one choice can ruin the lives of so many--how most of the characters are victims --how the most victimized character, Lucy-Grace, is also the most innocent. The amazing thing is that the line between right and wrong is blurred so much as to be erased--and you're ok with that--in fact, you embrace it!!Ms. Stedman changes verb tense in the middle of chapters and sometimes in consecutive chapters; as I became more immersed in the story, this ceased to bother me. This is the saddest book that I've read in a long time and also one of the best, but it ended with a note of hope.  I can't wait to see more of Ms. Stedman's talent.  You have to be in the mood for this, so have plenty of tissues handy--it's a really unforgettable heartbreaker!!
5	1344211200	I'm 62% of the through this book and I want to call in sick to work so I can finish it!!! WOW, excellent story!
4	1344211200	M.L. Stedman's debut novel The Light Between Oceans is a beautifully written story that is haunting, heartrending and quite thought-provoking. The line between right and wrong is blurred when Tom and Isabel Sherbourne make a fateful decision which will have long-lasting and far-reaching repercussions.Wracked by survivor's guilt and forever changed by his war experiences, Tom Sherbourne finds a measure of peace in the solitary life as a lighthouse keeper. He finds comfort in the daily routines and rigid structure that his duties demand. As he is about to begin a new post at the isolated Janus Rock lighthouse, Tom meets the much younger but utterly captivating Isabel Graysmark.Isabel is a charming and lively young woman. She is the perfect counterpart to silent, introspective Tom and she is the driving force in their relationship. Since their time together is limited, much of their courtship takes place through letters. Following their marriage, Isabel is enchanted with Janus Rock and eagerly explores her new home. She enjoys their privacy and her playfulness is a sharp counterpoint to Tom's seriousness.Isabel and Tom are both delighted to learn of Isabel's pregnancy, but their joy soon turns to sorrow as Isabel miscarries her first two pregnancies and her third ends in stillbirth. When the boat with baby and the dead man washes up on the shore of Janus Rock, for Isabel, her prayers have been answered. For Tom, a moral dilemma is born. Keep the baby and live a lie? Or turn the baby over to the authorities and destroy his wife?Over the years, the decision weighs heavily on Tom's conscience. His love for Isabel and baby Lucy is tempered by his guilt. A shocking discovery puts Tom and Isabel on an unavoidable collision course that will tear apart many lives and exposes the shockingly thin line between right and wrong.The Light Between Oceans is a complex novel that is full of strong emotion and moral ambiguity. It is sometimes utterly heartbreaking as the key players are faced with decisions that have no clear answers. M.L. Stedman takes the story in unanticipated directions and keeps the reader in suspense as she masterfully brings the story to its unexpected yet perfect conclusion. .A compelling read that will stay with long after the novel ends and the only question left unanswered is what would you do?I received a complimentary copy to review.
5	1344124800	Very well written about heart-wrenching choices. The characters are well drawn, the descriptions of Australia fascinating, and the ending was realistic in light of what everyone had experienced.
5	1344038400	After fighting in World War I and seeing more death than he can handle, Tom Sherbourne returns to Australia to become a lighthouse keeper. Ultimately he winds up becoming the keeper on Janus Rock, an isolated island where a supply boat only comes once every three months. But the hard work and the honor of being responsible for such a majestic and vital landmark is more than enough for Tom, until he meets Isabel Graysmark, a young woman whose playful spirit and zest for life awakens feelings in Tom he never thought he'd be worthy to experience.Years later, after two miscarriages and a stillborn baby, Tom and Isabel are weathering the isolation of Janus Rock and wondering how to handle the crushing emptiness they feel. One day, a boat washes up on shore, carrying the body of a man and an infant, whose cries awaken Isabel's maternal spirit. She convinces Tom, a man who pays meticulous attention to detail and the rules governing lighthouses all over Australia, to hold off reporting the ship and the baby, just for a few days. And this decision has powerful ramifications not only in their lives, but the lives of their family and friends, and those who wondered what happened to the man and the baby on that fateful day.In this haunting book, M.L. Stedman visits a familiar plot point--the split second decision that affects the futures of many--but does so in a gripping and affecting way. You know what Tom and Isabel have done is wrong, but you certainly sympathize with their choice and the guilt they feel, but then you realize just how many people this decision ultimately hurts. And Stedman is able to keep you guessing; just when you believe the story will take one direction, you find yourself surprised, but that doesn't affect the power of the story. As one character says, "Right and wrong can be like bloody snakes: so tangled up that you can't tell which is which until you've shot 'em both, and then it's too late." There is a vividness and a heart to this story that is unforgettable.
5	1343865600	A great book!! Couldn't put the book down. Heartbreaking but beautifully written story about the love between a parent and a child.
5	1338681600	I purchased these tables several months ago and am pleased with them.  I had no trouble assembling them and have received many compliments.
4	1338508800	Very pleased book arrived in less time than indicated. The book itself was very interesting. Will keep your interest. Interesting reading regarding how the females have changed in history and the advancements made in their being!!!! Good read for a book club that will lead to great discussions.
5	1337558400	I find myself falling for items soon to be discontinued so it is with gratitude that I  discovered a hidden cache.  it was as hoped with excellent service. I am sad that Ellen Tracey fragrance has been discontinued presumably to make shelf space for one more fruity bubblegum scented product.  It is hard to have grown up taste! Daphne
2	1326326400	For my purposes, this radio has been useless.  The manual tuning makes it nearly impossible to find the stations I'm looking for.  When I do find it, I spend an inordinate amount of time turning my radio around, wrapping the cord in various fashions and other little tricks to try to keep it tuned in.  I can't plug anything else into the outlet with the clock either, because that makes the station fuzz out.As far as an alarm clock, it functions properly.  The CD player works, although I rarely use it anymore.  Sound quality is decent considering it's a clock/radio.
2	1324252800	The Miele is a lovely piece of equipment. Looks like it would last a long time, however be aware that this one model is VERY hard to push on carpet. I called Miele USA and they suggested that perhaps I should buy an other power head that was height adjustable. I tried it with all the levels of vacuum strength and it was still incredibly hard to push,  but was unwilling to buy a different power head so I sent it back. I suspect that it would be great for someone stronger than I am. My husband tried it also and said it was like going to the gym. Amazon as always allowed the return.
5	1319500800	Lacrosse Projection Alarm Clock with Indoor/outdoor TempIt is hard to fine a projection clock that works as well as this.  If you like to see the weather and time from your pillow this is a must have
5	1314921600	This product successfully adhered my pearl to the stud setting of my earring. I wear them everyday and the large pearl is still intact. Great product.
4	1314662400	It is a wonderful product, especially in the summer.  Adds just enough color to go without any other makeup except mascara and lip gloss.  It is light, easy to apply and looks natural. Gives youa nice summer glow.  Would definitely recommend. It is a little pricey, but worth it.
5	1313193600	This visor was exactly what my husband wanted for the golf course.  We searched everywhere for a high crown visor and Amazon.com came through for us!
5	1310601600	All I can say is OMG. When reading the reviews for Liv I was SOOO excited.  This product sounded amazing and after getting it I realized... IT IS!!!  I've had so many orgasms because of the Liv.  If the Liv could mow the lawn I wouldn't need my boyfriend.  I decided to get the Liv after I started dating my boyfriend because he is a virgin waiting for marriage.  I respect his decision so in order not to tempt him I got the Liv so I could satisfy my needs. Buy the Liv and you will never find another product to measure up!!!!
2	1262822400	The size I ordered was not the size received.  I returned and was totally refunded the amount.  I was also told I would have a $10 credit against my next purchase.  I then purchased a t-shirt.  The $10 was not credited.  However, I am very pleased with the t-shirt and have retained it.
2	1245196800	I just got this h2o and not only does it not work it was dirty- box was ok but the product was dirty with pop all over it.It only has little puffs of steam that comes out. it is hard to get a hold of maro polo the place amazon sent order to be filled by, waiting to hear from amazon for them.(Still waiting in michigan)
3	1236470400	I was expecting more...I saw a newspaper article on Zumba fitness and the article was actually more exciting than the CD's. The spanish then english translations are hard to get used to. But it's not bad.
5	1200441600	I don't often review books online, but when I read this story, felt I needed to express how much I enjoyed it.  The characters seem very real and the town of Talking Creek (strange name...is it a real town in Georgia?) sounds like a nice place to live.  The people seem to sincerely care about each other.  While reading the story, I cried on multiple occasions.  I want to read the rest of the story and find out what made Michael so special that he made such an impact on the town. What could he have done that would upset the town even after his death?  I'm wondering...is he really not a hero or even more of a hero?  Looking forward to finding out.C. Hensley
5	1179100800	This watch is just like in the picture. Fabulous to look at and fabulous on. Delivery was speedy and in a timely fashion. Well done.
5	1111795200	these are the coolest chucks ever except the plaid christmas ones. the only thing that would make them better is if they were made in the U.S.A and converse owned itself again.
