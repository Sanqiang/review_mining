5	1404432000	I don't know what the history with ZICO is, or why it has so many 1 star reviews.  It seems like they have gone back and forth on their product quality.  But (July 2014) I bought a carton of 6 1L bottles of this from Costco.  It is the best coconut water Ive tasted since I drank out of a fresh coconut.  All good things.
4	1404432000	I've tried Vita, Vita Lemonade, Vita Orange, ONE, Naked, Zico from concentrate, and Zico tetra packs (not from concentrate). This is my favorite so far. Though coconut water can be weird. The small ones are hard to find around me, though the 1L ones I can get at Costco.
5	1404345600	Love it!
4	1404345600	Not my first choice of coconut water but it was fine.
1	1404259200	Tastes aweful. Not like real coconut
3	1404259200	This coconut water tastes good. Great value, but the packaging could be better. On 3 cartons of the 6 pack the pouring spout separated from the package when opened. The spout is not firmly sealed. Because it is a large container that makes it hard to store. It is a good value, but I have not re-ordered due to the problem with the spout.
5	1404172800	I used to have hard time falling asleep and going to the bathroom 4-6x at night.  Now...after drinking this, only once going to the bathroom and sleep much, much better.  Also, I don't care what other reviews says, but this brand has less sugar and tated closed to fresh coconut water then the other brands.
5	1404086400	I tried various coconut water product.Bluemonkey -- expensive.. taste good, sweet -- great with ice.H20 -- half the price of blue monkey, taste sweeter than bluemonkey and has  can smell. Sometime you feel like you're drinking corn water.ONE - about same price has H20, tastes ok but are my least favorites but worse in this group.The zico has the perfect balance between semi sweet and no can smell due to being tetra pack. I recommend putting these in the fridge and drink them with ice.After opening you should definitely refrigerated it try to drink it withing 2 weeks. They will go bad.The one you buy will typical have an expiration day of next year.Another tips: if you go through them fast, look for the amazon warehouse deal -- those you will get and they'll expired withing 2-3 months but they taste good before that.
1	1404000000	The &#34;from concentrate&#34; flavor makes the coconut water taste really bad and is all but undrinkable.  I've only tried the pineapple version of Zico, but I've had many other brands and this stands out as the very worst.  I bought a pack of 12 so I've let many others try it and everyone seems to agree that it is not good.  I understand that coconut water in general has a very distinct (and some might say acquired) taste, I normally like it, but this tastes like watered down coconut water with a hint of pineapple and old socks.
5	1403913600	This stuff is like gold when the package arrives at our home! Its great for re-hydrating after workouts, or just in general, when you want something with a subtle coconut flavor.
4	1403827200	1. Not the best tasting stuff on the block. ...actually, this is probably my least-favorite tasting coconut water. However, it:a) isn't from concentrateb) has 'clean' componentsc) is the cheapest option that fulfills those requirements2. I'm not drinking it to pamper myself. I am drinking it because I am sick and I am not allowed to eat bananas (among a long-list of other no-no foods/stuff), but I still need potassium so that my heart can function and I can stay hydrated. It does those things. I went from dry all the time to finally feeling better...just by adding this into my daily routine.3. Do this medicinally, but not recreationally. For yummy stuff...don't drink Zico. To get the job done...drink Zico.
5	1403827200	This stuff just hits the spot, especially when it's ice cold on a hot day.  It's refreshing and just barely sweet.
4	1403827200	I ordered this when I heard about it via Fox news one morning.Good for you, healthy.I mix it with water, tea, smoothies, so one bottle can be split in 2 or 3 drinks. the case lasts a long time.to me its not that good by itself.
4	1403827200	I like this cocoa water better compared to others, the taste is more natural. Ingredients: just Coconut water. So there is no added sugar; so all the sugar comes from the coco itself (13g of sugar and for 70 calories for this 11.2 fl oz package).
5	1403740800	i will recommend this to those who like coconut juice that likes the balance of sweetness in the juice... must be cool so you can enjoy the drink
5	1403654400	This is the best tasting coconut water I have tried.  Forget anything in the can (yuck) all natural NOT from concentrate in the tetra pack is definitely the best.  Only disappointment is it has a few more calories than I'd like but...
4	1403654400	Love pounding one of these after a night our or a long workout.  It really helps me naturally add minerals and vitamins back naturally and hydrate more than with water.Not much flavor and sometimes the tetrapack top rips off as I'm trying to unscrew it so minus one star.  Sorry guys, got to look at your QA people.
1	1403568000	I love coconut water.I don't like companies that lie and deceive.Zico was bought out by Coca Cola in 2013. Therefore with every Zico coconut water purchase, you will be funding GMO's, GMA, and all that they stand for.Purchase Vita Coco instead.
5	1403481600	If you love Coconut Water and I just LOVE PureCoconut Water.  It doesn't get purer than this, contents: CoconutWater.  The best tasting Coconut Water I've had thus far. Thank youvery much.
5	1403481600	Not bad!  I didn't know what to expect, but this tasted way better than plain coconut water.  Product tasted great and was very refreshing, especially after workouts.  Helped minimize muscle cramping.
5	1403395200	Excellent.  Pure coconut water. Nothing added. This brand of water is the closest to drinking it straight from the coconut.
1	1403136000	I noticed Jessica Alba promoting ZICO while taking credit as a well behaved, caring parent who had many health issues when she was a child and now how proud she is being part of these fine companies including ZICO (meaning she shares the profit of the sales). Let's look at some facts on ZICO;1. INGREDIENT: all natural coconut water. Ask yourself, have you ever seen a natural food item, any food item even a coconut water when you crack a fresh coconut, where the natural water of that coconut to last for months in any temperature. No it will not last more than few hours so why is it that Jessica is not disclosing the preservatives that are included inside ZICO cartons and bottles when infact you will get no preservatives when cracking a fresh coconut and drinking the coconut juice for a dollar a coconut instead of four dollars for ZICO. With fresh coconut you will even end up with fresh coconut meat as well,,2. HYDRATE: hydration requires consuming water at zero calories, not sugar. You can drink all the coconut juices in the world and it still will not hydrate unless you drink water. Sugar will force you to drink water so you will have to consume water after drinking ZICO,3. HAND HARVEST COCONUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD: meaning not a Fair Trade certified product. Meaning ZICO is the same as Coco Cola, the same as the competition without Fair Trade certification,4. AS MUCH POTASSIUM AS A SMALL BANANA: Let' compare based on NUTRITION FACTS. For a cup comparison although not the same since we are comparing liquid with solid, but regardless ZICO vs. banana in calories 50/33, potassium 360/317, sugar 10/2.4 and tall of that not considering where banana offers 3.7mg of Phytosterols in lowering cholesterol, all other vitamins and minerals from 171% vitamin C, A, K, B6, fiber, and all minerals where ZICO offers none other than sugar in a processed container.It is fine to consume a processed food or drink if one wishes to do so but for Jessica Alba is purely misleading public while acting as a caring individual. ZICO is a processed drink in a carton, which has a whopping 40gr of sugar processed just like other coconut water brands, like Coca-Cola, not a Fair Trade product which has nothing to do with hydration or banana. I drink coconut water by cracking cold coconuts that I keep in my refrigerator and understand the nutritional value of each when a fresh coconut costs me a dollar, a banana twenty five cents not four dollars for a processed coconut in container with preservative.
5	1403049600	I get my water on a monthly auto order its amazing to get it same time every time. I recommend this option very highly
2	1403049600	Of all the coconut water I've tasted this is the worst. I tried it cool cold in a variety of different drinks and food and it still has a bad taste. At first I thought it was just this case but I tried it at my sister's house and she had the same complain. If anyone should know about coconut water it is my sister and I. We grew up on this and know all about the many uses and benefits. This brand is just not good regardless of where it came from . .
5	1403049600	This is the way to buy these delicious waters!I can't get enough of these little guys. They are the perfect thirst quencher and after a workout! Whew! There is nothing better!Also, having someone else schlep this to my front door for nothing?! What's better than that?!
4	1403049600	not as tasty as Zola, Zola is the best tasting coconut water on the market right now not from concentrate
5	1403049600	I have enjoyed zico for years. bought it originally from grocery store . I also use coconut milk . I replaced Cow's milk with these products. I do not consume animal protein .
5	1402790400	Coconut water takes some getting used to, but once you do this is a very good one. Does taste better refrigerated. Really refreshing after a hot day in the sun.
3	1402531200	SODA or any other CHEMICAL LIQUID is not an option for me so this is a great alternative.Just remember that most of the coconut waters are PASTEURIZED, so nutrients are DIMINISHED, have 6-10g of SUGAR (4g=1 tsp) and it is processed.ZICO is priced higher probably because they have Jessica Alba to pay. Don't really taste quality difference for priceHARMLESS HARVEST sells 100% RAW Coconut Water, so it is UNpasteurized but more expensive and difficult to find.I would NOT buy coconut water ONLINE personally due to potential for spoilage if on a pallet in the heat.BEST alternative is a FRESH, RAW coconut, however, they are dipped in sodium metabisulfite. The coconut water is probably NOT affected. Smaller quantity of water, but you have the meat to use.Found a 33oz to run $3.60 to $4.29 retail Most grocery stores will give you a discount if you order a case Doesn't hurt to ASK.This way, if something is wrong, they take it back. It's all about putting the BEST ingredients into our bodies for the best price. If they ALL are PASTEURIZED, have SAME SUGAR grams, and ALL other criteria is EQUAL, then get lowest priced. SODA/GATORADE has NOTHING and I mean NOTHING except Price to lure us into drinking a CHEAP, laboratory made product.i
3	1402531200	A decent, consistent brand for coconut water. Not too sweet or sour.  Occasionally packaging has problems where liquid leaks out of spout ftom wrong place when pouring.
5	1402531200	Great coconut water.  I know so many people have mixed feelings about the product but I took the chance and ordered it - and I am picky with coconut water- and it is great, even warm.  Good quality product, tastes clean, without any hints of rancidity even at the very bottom, and no poor odor when you open the cap. I will definitely order again.  I am 11 weeks pregnant and having vicious morning sickness.  This soothes my stomach when I can't keep anything down and keeps me and baby hydrated.  Even with my highly sensitized sense of smell this order of Zico passes the test and smells fresh and inviting.
5	1402531200	I've sampled a lot of various brands of coconut water and I find this one to be the best in term of flavor and quality - not too sweet and very refreshing.  I get it delivered on a regular basis and try to always have some in the fridge for when I need potassium before/after a workout.  It is also a miracle cure if you are sick and/or hungover.
5	1402185600	This chocolate coconut water satisfies my sweet craving when I am trying to be good and not eat sweets.  I have several cases delivered each month via Amazon's Subscribe and Save to save a little.  I think it taste like chocolate skim milk.  My husband referes to it as like chocolate milk.  I drink one a day to help with hydration.  I like it a lot.
4	1402012800	Taste like every other coconut water to me. My only disappointment with this product is that the ingredients say &#34;natural coconut water&#34; I would like Zico to define &#34;natural&#34;.
3	1401926400	not getting anymore. has a weird taste to it for some reason, it's worth it to spend a few more bucks and get a more expensive brand.
5	1401753600	I purchased this to make coconut kefir and it's working great.. I use it at room temperature, fill a clean and sterile mason jar with it and add a packet of yogourmet kefir mix (also purchased from Amazon).. I set it in a warm place for 24 hours and it creates a delicious coconut kefir..
2	1401667200	I don't like writing bad reviews but I just did not like the taste of this coconut water.  I really haven't tried to many other coconut waters but of the 2 I have tried I didn't like either.
1	1401667200	I love the coconut water! But in this order, all six boxes the top was broken!! I just got my May order and all the tops are great!!
5	1401667200	I can't say that it makes me feel any better or gives me extra stamina. But it does taste good. One of the best tasting on the market.
5	1401580800	This is my favorite brand of coconut water, so I was glad to find them at such a reasonable price on Amazon. Can't wait for another sale.
3	1401408000	This, bottled, Coconut Water is from concentrate.  I would not have purchased it had I known.  I don't care to go through the trouble of returning some things as I had already drank one by the time I noticed.  The taste is OK, though not as good as the products that are not from concentrate.  I will be more careful in the future when I purchase coconut water and other products online.
5	1401321600	I tried all kinds of coconut drinks and found this one has the best and refreshing taste I like. Awesome product
5	1400976000	Good product that satisfies when craving something sweet.  No added sugar which is a big plus and is NOT from concentrate.  Calories are also fairly low.  The next best thing would be getting a coconut straight from the tree.
5	1400803200	I purchased these as a post workout rehydration.  Best served cold, mild taste with no off flavors.  No added ingredients
4	1400716800	The best tasting coconut water among all the brands that I have tasted.The package of the pack was all wet though upon arrival.
1	1400630400	This water is disgusting and tastes like another brand also sold at Costco. The after taste is stale bread, I ordered 2 cases of http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BN6BX9M/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 when I got this with a coupon and subscribe & save discount and now I'm choking this down.Move on to something else if you want a clean crisp coconut water, this definitely isn't it!
5	1400544000	I LOVE the chocolate ZICO so I ordered some regular. It's not terrible... if it's ice-cold. However, it's not super tasty either. I will stick with the occasional chocolate ZICO instead.
5	1400457600	At first I was not too crazy about coconut water. I do like the Zico chocolate coconut water and it is very good for your health. My potassium was very low and I drink 2 bottles a day and it raised my levels.
5	1400371200	i loooooove coconut water and this is by far the best bang for your buck!  delivers right to your door!although the top is kind of hard to open, but hey it's the cheapest one
4	1400112000	I enjoy this product, it has a good taste and it is a very reasonable price, its not very sweet but it adds a little extra vitamins and nutrients that i was looking for when I make my smoothies.
5	1399939200	i love coconut so i stock up on this item. specialy during the summer. electrolytes come in handy : )
2	1399852800	Keeps you hydrated naturally, good taste and very hygenic would buy more from Amazon,but i feel it is overpriced at Amazon,you can get this for lessor cost at Costco,we all at home except my wife experienced cold and flu after having this drink....has the manufacturer put any flu virus into it?
1	1399852800	I purchase a case of Zicos and they were bad product.  Ive always bought Zico's but this time when they came in they taste old and not like it should. Some of the Zico's had small leak and maybe that cased it to smell bad and taste awful. Look at the expiration date as well. Im surprise it tasted that bad and it had expiration date until nov 2014.
5	1399593600	My son is a runner & uses this to stay hydrated. Perfect size. I love it just to enjoy. Good price
2	1399507200	It's not as pure as the plain Zico Coconut Water. It has additives like cane sugar and etc. Therefore, I prefer the plain Zico Water from now on.
5	1399507200	My wife and I have been drinking zirconia for a long time. We don't  drink much much pop so if we want something sweet this fills the tab. Great as base for mixed drinks and overall refreshing. Well my wife recently got strep throat and has running a fever, at first I tried some Motrin and fever was not going down. I was forcing her to drink water to stay hydrated and nothing. Well next step was to go to emergency room, I forced her to drink two containers of zico on the way to the doc. We live in rural area so it's a little drive. By the time we got there the fever was basically gone once I woke her up.  We waited and waited fever did not return. About two days later a small fever came back and I immediately gave her another coconut juice and sure enough down it went. Hope this helps someone, no option for doctor so your on your own there . Just a simple observation that worked for my wife.
5	1399420800	Delicious! Great potassium Intake, hydrating and yummy ;-) All the while it's healthy! Great for on the go and especially after a great workout
5	1399420800	Like drinking an almond joy bar. Every time this product is available I purchase it! Can't get enough, very yummy drink, who knew something so go for you could taste like this!
3	1399248000	Although I got all of the nutrition of coconut water it came at a price. The blend of the latte flavor with the coconut water was not too pleasing for me. Nevertheless it is still a good product and the packaging and presentation were excellent. I'm sure other Zico flavors would be more appealing for me.
5	1399161600	good stuff!  taste like the milk at the bottom of the bowl after you ate choco puffs as a kid
5	1399161600	Unlike some of other reviews, I did not taste anything different from other ZICO Coconut Water packs I had purchased from offline stores.I'm not married to this brand but I always drink coconut water after my work-out sessions, and ZICO has been working fine for me. I would buy again especially if they are on sale.
5	1398988800	For those of you that are confused by some of these reviews, these cartons CLEARLY STATE that they are not from concentrate. End of story.Great taste too!
5	1398729600	Great product, Great Price. Wish I could get it cheaper, I'd buy more.Before my morning gets going I mix one bottle of Pineapple Coconut water to my daily powered mixes. Add some frozen fruit and a banana and I'm off to the gym. After my workout I'll have another to quench my thrust and I'm off to my work routine. Not to mention since I started  using the product I'm managing my weight loss program better
5	1398297600	I had been warned that the coconut often comes soured. This was not and is delicious. It only saves me a few dollars, but I believe I'll continue to purchase it from Amazon.
5	1398211200	We love the coconut water at our house. Zico is at least as good as the VITA brand, but they do taste differently. Great source of potassium, good price with amazon prime, arrived without issue.
4	1398211200	Great for after workouts to replace lost electrolytes.  Love it chilled.  Great for biking, hiking, camping or any outdoor activity.
5	1398211200	This coconut water is very good.  It is a nice alternative to plain water.  It does have sugar so just something to keep in mind.  It is okay as an occasional treat.
5	1398211200	That is, if you don't get a box of damaged, leaking containers. The latest shipment of the six 1 litre tetra packs had leaking containers and some of the caps had come unglued and fell off. It looked as if they had maybe been stored improperly and the coconut water penetrated cardboard in the tetra packs. Fortunately, so far none of the water seems to have spoiled, thank goodness.All that aside, I really love Zico coconut water best out of the handfull of brands I've tasted. I was buying Vita Coco but noticed Zico was a bit cheaper, so despite some of the nasty reviews, I decided to try it. After tasting, it I've switched over from Vita Coco and even started the Subscribe and Save thing here on Amazon. To me, the biggest difference between Zico and other brands is it has a much richer, coconutty flavor. At first I didn't think I liked it but the more I sipped the more I grew fond of the taste. Now, I don't want anyone to think Vita Coco is bad or anything, it's actually quite good. It just doesn't have as much of an intense flavor of coconut, which could actually be preferable to some people.
5	1398124800	Yes, they did meet all of my expectations! I love zico coconut water. This brand is the purest that I've tasted.
4	1398038400	I originally purchased this coconut water for myself, but I find I am fortunate to retrieve one bottle from the shipment after my grandsons realize the coconut water has arrived!  My grandsons are very active and drinking Zico pure coconut water can only be beneficial to their health.
5	1398038400	this tastes delish and i would definitely order more of these in the future and it was a good deal
4	1397606400	... in quantity for a short workout, and QPR from warehouse deal is also great for about 1 buck a can?!
4	1397433600	Zico is one of the better coconut water brands that I have found. It tastes great (especially on a hot day).
5	1397260800	Too bad the reviews are so negative, I try other coconut waters and I don't like the taste of them near as much as Zico. The last one I tried of a different brand I couldn't even use for my protein shakes because of the strong yucky flavor. I like Zico the best. I don't know about the politics on it. Guess I need to research huh?
2	1396569600	I should have looked at the description closer. This water is from concentrate and I don't really like coconut water from concentrate.
5	1396569600	I like to drink it straight when I am feeling hungry and dilute it with water when I am only thirsty.
2	1396310400	Zico is my favorite coconut water because it is the closest to tasting like "water" of all the brands.  Not too "coconutty."  Great for hydration before and after exercise or working/playing outdoors in the heat.  The Latte flavor does give you a little burst of energy, which is what I was hoping for, however the coffee flavor is too strong to be refreshing, even ice cold.  This is not one of my favorite Zico waters - sorry.
1	1396310400	Containers came damaged. Pour spout and cap not completely attached to body of carton. Food contamination is questionable. Very disappointed. No stars is not an option so I was forced to give one.
5	1396224000	Perfect for those who like a &#34;less earthy&#34; brand of coconut water. Definitely doesn't taste like you just cracked a coconut open, more like you may have passed it through a filter before bottling. But still refreshing and great post-workout or in cocktails or when sick.
5	1396224000	I've been getting this product via Amazon for over a year -- but for some reason this last shipment had defective glue on half the bottles (3 of 6) -- Amazon replaced the whole box immediately.  Impressive customer service response.
1	1396137600	Love Zico in the tetrapak, but I would pick almost any other brand over this product in the plastic bottles. The plastic taste combined with the "from concentrate" formula is a lose lose. Seek another brand or go with the tetrapak and you'll be much happier in my opinion.
5	1396137600	This is the best tasting Chocolate Coconut water on the market.  After suffering dehydration after a very long, hot tennis match last year, I was in search of something that was good for hydration but not full of sugar.  A good friend suggested ZICO Chocolate Coconut water and it hit the mark.  A Chiropractor also recommended it because of the nutrition value as far as electrolytes.
5	1396051200	I love this but they are a bit on the expensive side...even if buying a case :(  so I only get them on occasion.
5	1395964800	This coconut water is awesome--really takes care of the thirst after a hot yoga class. Highly recommended!  Drink it cold.
5	1395878400	I grew up drinking this stuff straight from the source and will say this is as close as it gets. It's got great flavor and awesome packaging. Highly recommended!
1	1395792000	My daughter has been in and out of the hospital for the last few years, 2 life threatening comas in the last 6 years. Part of her recovery she decided to get off soda except special ocassions. So she had to find things BESIDES SOda that she liked, and she was really dedicated to healthy liquids.So, while we were in the hospital i found Vita coco in the cafeteria with pineapple in it. She went nuts, and despite its steep price tag, she drank that, iced tea, and other juices. We had trouble finding Vita Coco when we got home from the hospital at first, and a family friend purchased ZICO for her instead. They were told it was a comparable productIT is NOT comparable, not even remotely. This product tasted like chemicals, it burned my daughters throat, she couldnt/wouldnt even finish one bottle of the stuff.Zico,no matter what the company says, is no where near comparable to some of the other coconut waters on the market. the cheap ones at asian markets in cans are better then this stuff. Steer clear, try Vita Coco instead (which FYI, has lots and lots of other flavor choices ranging from plain coconut water to coco water withL pineapple, mango and peach, tropical, acai berry, orange, as well as kids lunch box sizes that have apple, berries, etc. WAY Better product, and while you may not like all of the flavor choices, there is no question the quality of their product far surpasses ZICO.Hope this helps some folks. Stay healthy and hydrated!!
4	1395619200	Great product. A tad bit overpacked but definitely secure. A few of the cap casings came off when opening the product to drink but it didn't cause a major problem.
5	1395619200	This is great product, and the price is a little more palatable when purchased through Amazon, this is also another great example of Amazon customers service.  I had a case missing one bottle, and then sent a new case, which just confirms my faith in Amazon.
1	1395532800	Ok so I read some mix reviews and decided let me try it. If I can give Zico a negative 1 I would. This is worse then ONE Brand
1	1395273600	I have been buying Zico coconut water from my local costco for a long time...This was the first time (and most definitely last time from Amazon) I bought the item on Amazon.The contents tasted Stale...with rotten tinge...We tried the 2nd one and the 3rd one...the same problem.I called Zico customer support...the guy took my details, promised someone will call me back...they never did....I am not sure if the Coconut water became stale while being shipped from Amazon to my home or the whole batch was bad....we will never know.Thanks to this experience, I will never be able to buy nor recommend Zico from Amazon nor get over the stale taste when I see the Zico brand...luckily for us, Costco has been carrying a non-Zico brand (Vita Coco)
3	1395273600	The taste of the Zico coconut water was a little salty for my liking. For the price, I expected more from this. In fact, in my opinion the $1.29 cans from the 99c stores taste better than these.Not buying Zico again.
5	1394668800	Not sure if there really are benefits to coconut water but if there are then this is a good choice.  Good flavor, not a lot of little coconut pieces. Perfect size.
5	1394582400	I love the size of this product, so easy throw in the yoga bag and just the right size for after class refresher.....the fact that the container is tetra and totally recyclable makes me a huge fan.
5	1394582400	Fast and well packaged. My daughter loves to drink this stuff and she's 4. She did prefer the chocolate flavor better though.
3	1394496000	For the past 3 cases I received there are usually one container which the cap is lose and the juice is dripping out from . If this was purchased in the grocery store I would of never buy it.  But because this came from the manufacture I assume there is something wrong with one of the machine making the container. I probably will stop purchasing it if I continue to find this problem.
5	1394496000	I bought 2 boxes and was happy about it. My bf loves it.  Will be buying this until I find a better product.
5	1393977600	Drink this after a workout or a night out! This better for you, potassium not sodium. Will buy again in the future!
5	1393545600	Coconut water was an acquired taste for me, as was this chocolate flavor, but now it's my favorite flavor!  This brand tastes better than other brands as well.
5	1393200000	Like many others, I started hearing about the benefits of coconut water. Well, I saw it at Walmart and picked up a few bottles. I took a sip and thought the taste was mediocre at best. This is the 'natural' flavor. But I got it for workouts so in my next workout, I sipped on this throughout the hour and it is truly the best drink I've ever tried. I felt energized throughout. I haven't felt this good during a workout in a long time. So I am a believer.I tried the chocolate flavored drink and it tastes much better but I still prefer the 'natural' for workouts.I buy it locally since the prices are about 12 cents per ounce. Here, it is around 15 cents per ounce. Doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up.Don't drink it like you would a soda and expect it to be like that. This is a drink that I now crave when I'm working out because it allows me to push the boundaries of my own abilities and recover much faster. It's not a drink I would have casually.I have always been a big proponent of simple water. This has changed my mind forever.I am now a Zico fan.
3	1393113600	Its alright, not too bad. The taste was bland. Didn't feel like real coconut. I prefer now going to an asian supermarket and buy coconut drinks for 1.50 whenever they are on sale.
2	1393113600	I love ZICO and since I can't find the one liter bottle at my local supermarket, I decided to buy in bulk online.  I bought 2 cases from the ZICO website (12 bottles) and figured that would last me 3-4 months (I drink a little bit at a time after hot yoga).  I was disappointed to see that the product is going to expire in April&#8230;I would expect to be delivered a product that would be good for at least 6 months and I am certain the product is EXTREMELY OLD because the adhesive which holds the pouring spout onto the cardboard cartons has come off of two of the bottles.  When this happens, adhesive and pieces of soggy cardboard get into the beverage and yield it inedible.I honestly don't want to open the second case.  I would rather return the second case for a refund and am going to contact ZICO directly to see if this is possible.  Overall, a very disappointing experience for a product I love to drink.
5	1393027200	Expensive but really worth it.  Healthy and great taste.  10 grams of sugar per 8 oz probably fruit sugar, but not sure.
4	1392854400	Taste is not bad and no sugar added. However it goes bad quickly if not refrigerated quickly after opening. Too expensive. If the price is lowered I will continue to buy it.
3	1392854400	Tried Zico brand as well as Vita Coco to determine which I wanted to order in bulk for Subscribe & Save.  Zico brand had an "okay" taste but not near as pleasant as VitaCoco. Interestingly, Zico was cloudy and Vita Coco is quite clear.  I just researched this and read "Coconut water is the term commonly used to describe the clear liquid found in the center of a coconut when it is still young and green." If someone else has direct knowledge on coconuts because they grew up on them and lived where they were plentiful please share your opinion on that (clear vs. cloudy).  Either way, my choice to go with VitaCoco is purely on a preferred taste. Zico does seem to have a high rating so many do like it.  Coconut water seems to have short shelf life once opened so if you buy the large size you may want to make sure you plan to drink it within a couple of days.
2	1392854400	They taste very different and doesn't look pure and original at all. I tested so many fresh coconut water and it does taste good.
5	1392681600	What can I say, I love Zico coconut water! I feel revived after I drink it. If I'm having one of those days where I feel &#34;blah&#34; and just not quite right, a glass if coconut water really helps put me back on track. I've read a lot of health claims of coconut water, and I can't say any or all of them are true, but this is a sure pick-me-up for me. The packaging is great and since its not a metal can, there's no metal aftertaste. I used to drink sugary, chemical laden sports drinks for rehydration, but now I only drink natural coconut water.
5	1392249600	Many people want to compare this chocolate coconut water from concentrate drink to O.N.E coconut water and all the other brands. I even saw one brilliant young man say he was going back to real coconuts because he didn't like the taste of this. Look past these jokers--- don't discredit this one because it doesn't taste like the others.I like this drink because:-It is low sugar chocolatey goodness.-It does have coconut water in it. Drink 2 and you'll be looking for a restroom. I heard Chuck Norris drank 3 once.-I freeze it then take it out and let it thaw. it turns into a delicious drink that I think tastes like a frosty. I don't have a Wendy's around so this will do. I pack a few of these and they rock on the beachAgain,it does not taste like coconut water. When another company makes a chocolate coconut drink we'll try it but for now this is the best on the market!
4	1392249600	It is not pure coconut eatet but It is thus far, the best on the market. I hope the manufacturers continue to perfect with organic methods. No GMOs
1	1392163200	Most reviews gave this a decent score, but in reality you should probably stay away from Zico. I've had Vita Coco prior to this.So, what does Zico taste like? Coconut water... and plastic. It's &#34;all natural coconut water from concentrate&#34; which has a odd taste to it. If orange juice from concentrate bothers you, this should too. It taste much sweeter than Vita Coco.On the bottle it says its gluten free and &#34;non-GMO&#34; with the disclaimer, &#34;Zico does not use ingredients that were produced using biotechnology if bio-engineered versions exist.&#34; That's a bit odd, but alright.If you're also looking for a &#34;greener&#34; bottle, this isn't it. I think it taste like plastic mostly because the entire bottle is made from an odd plastic that's unlike other bottled drinks. It's almost unbearable with overwhelming plastic. I wrote this review while drinking one, and can't help but cringe at the fact I bought two cases.
5	1392163200	Great rehydrating drink after a swim, bike, or run. Get the 1 liter (33 oz) containers; they're not from concentrate. Best taste of all the brands I've tried, and consistent from carton to carton. Great alternative to sports drinks.
5	1391990400	It is an excellent source of potassium, electrolytes and rehydration after practice of any sports or just because you need liquids !
1	1391904000	I have always been intriqued by coconut water distributers who think they can make a better tasting coconut water. Um...really people the best is straight from the coconut! But, because I didn't have a coconut to break open I decided to go against my belief on this matter and try a company's version. DISAPPOINTED. ZICO have great marketing people on their side and know how to make the product look great but they by all means DO NOT KNOW WHAT REAL COCONUTS TASTE LIKE. I realize this sounds harsh, but truthfully, marketing and the taste of the product should be equal. There goes three bucks!The taste was really horrible. Hey, if you like fake, plastic-y kind of coconut water then you'll love it. I tasted more of the plastic bottle then I ever want to taste again. Worries me a little, thinking about the reason this flavor is in it. Hmm....wonder when people will care enough about natural ingrediants like this take in consideration of the people that drink this stuff, to think about what kind of container they are putting their product into.Zico was not a home run. I will now stick with the real thing. Guess I'll have to buy a bigger lunch bag since I'll be bring coconuts and a hammer along with me to work!
1	1391817600	This is the most artificial tasting coconut water that I ever had.  And its not that cheap&#8230;.I doubt a coconut was ever part of the equation when making this water.
4	1391731200	This is next best to drinking from a coconut itself; tastes great and appears like it has no preservatives. The only thing I see if that after a day or so the water starts coloring, but the taste itself is fine. I get Amazon shopping to ship 6 of these like clockwork to me every month!
4	1391472000	It's a great product! I used to by it all the time from Costco, but for some reason Costco stopped selling it lately.So I ordered 3 cases of 6 from Amazon = total 18. Six of them were damaged on the top and one of them got even open and spilled out during the delivery. So ZICO from Amazon have some kind of defect with the cover.So be careful and check all of them when you'll receive your order.
1	1391385600	Zico is now made from concentrate and the taste is terrible compared to what it used to be. this is just a warning
1	1391299200	I have been drinking vita coco and thought I would try zico. Well, I received it a few days ago and the smell that came from the liquid was like chemicals. I took a sip to see if maybe it was only the smell but the taste was just the same! It was disgusting like rotten coconut water or plastic-like aroma. The expiration date was in April of this year (2 mo before expiring) so this must have been on shelf for a GOOD time. I dont know whether it was due to that or if ZICO just had a poor batch. Either way I am staying AWAY from this brand because of how nauseating the smell and taste was.
5	1391299200	Doesn't sound good....chocolate coconut water but it is. It tastes like chocolate milk but without the tackiness in my throat and is filled with vitamins and is gluten free! Perfect combo. I love this and will continue to order them from Amazon. Best price out there!
5	1391299200	I just recently started drinking coconut water and really like the Zico brand. The chocolate flavor tastes great on its own or in smoothies. I would highly recommend!
2	1391299200	I have no complaints with the seller, and no problems with packaging or with shipping.  I tried this product for the first time and it turns out no matter the brand, I find the taste of plain coconut water revolting.  I gave these away to a very happy co-worker.
5	1391126400	Nothing like the natural coconut water when you have the opportunity to grab a real coconut and drink the water straight from it.But drinking water from the coconut is almost impossible in New England.This coconut water has a very similar taste of the one we drink from the coconut.
1	1390953600	The ingredient is just coconut water. But there is a strong artificial pineapple favor. The coconut refreshing taste that you are familiar when drinking the water from a fresh coconut is only a light aftertaste. In half hour, I only drunk half bottle. Very hard ...
5	1390867200	The coconut water replenishes the potassium and you feel better if you have a headache or are dehydrated.  Love it
4	1390867200	great product and love it, which it was in smaller bottles instead of the big 33.8oz bottles, would make it easier to take with me.  A little bit on the pricey side.  Better when you can find it on sale.
5	1390867200	I have tried soo many brands of coconut water and soo many different flavors. I have never found one as delicious as this one! I usually have problems with a slightly sour flavor that coconut water has, some brands are worse then others. But this one didn't have the sour flavor at all! I would compare the flavor of this to chocolate soy milk, but a little thinner. I still got a delicious creamy coconut flavor along with the rich chocolate. I get all the benefits of coconut water with a delicious flavor. This stuff is truly great!!
1	1390521600	I find this ZICO to be quite tasty, but thats because pepsi took over, concentrated it, added sugar and sodium to make it taste better. If you drink this often you will feel the negative effects within days.
5	1390089600	great taste arrived a little late because of weather yes it a great heath product but the most important fact is that coconut water goes great with johnny walker back label
5	1390089600	Amazon has the best price on this brand that I've found, especially when you do the &#34;subscribe and save&#34; feature.It's smooth and refreshing. Sometimes, other coconut waters taste... different. I almost want to say sweeter. This one is, however, the most flavorful without being sweet.
5	1390003200	Love this product! Tastes so natural just like the real coconut water. My order also arrived earlier than expected so I'm super satisfied.
5	1390003200	Zico coconut water is the next best thing to plopping a straw right into a nice sweet young coconut. I love it!
3	1389398400	I subscribed to this product because this is the only coconut water that i can actually like drinking.  other brands have really bad flavors in my opinion, and getting this much coconut water lasts me the month before i get a new shipment.  first time getting the shipment was great.  but this second time, 5/6 of the caps were already falling off.  now the box specifically says not to lift by the caps and I don't.  the drink is still sealed underneath the caps because when you twist off the cap it breaks that seal.  but now every time i open one of these from this recent shipment, i have to immediately put it in a water bottle to save it.  minor inconvenience.
5	1389312000	We like this coconut water very much. Great price. Yes we would recommended it to everyone. Healthy, refreshing and good for you!!!
5	1389139200	this is better than any other  chocolate flavored i have ever tasted. just be sure to serve it very cold,
5	1389139200	I have been all over the world and drank real coconut water many times.  I have tried all the waters available on the market, ZICO is the best!  It arrives packaged very well and I have never had a bad case.  No dirty, dusty, leaking bottles like other brands.  The price is a little more expensive.  When you figure you are ordering 6 large bottles it doesn't make that much of a difference.  I will not sacrifice the quality of the coconut water for a couple bucks a month.  I don't want flavored disguised waters.  ZICO is pure delicious coconut water.  It is not made from concentrate and it does not have any added sugar.  Read the labels of the others before you buy.  Beware.  ZICO tastes just like you drank the water right out of the coconut.  That is the point right?  That is what you are paying for, right?  Well ZICO is exactly that.  I love to drink it cold over ice.  Fantastic!  Why take a chance on an inferior product or a damaged shipment, let alone one that doesn't taste fresh.  ZICO is the best!
4	1389052800	I think the Zico brand coconut water taste better than the other brands I've tried, so I was excited to find this six pack of 33 oz bottles for $19.99.  I came back to reorder another case and see that the price has increased $10 in just a few weeks.  Good product, just a disappointment to see the higher price.
5	1389052800	This coconut water is excellent, great taste and quality.  Delivery is quick and without incident.  Highly recommend for post workout recovery.
1	1389052800	Ordered 2 cases 1 expires in 2 1/2 months the other in 10 months. Need to rotate stock!!!! Very dissatisfied.
3	1388966400	I dont know why but some of the zico doesnt taste good and other tastes great.  Sometimes this occurs even in the same shipment.  Its as if they mix stale older boxes of the drink with a few fresh ones.
1	1388880000	I used to love Zico - in the cardboard tetra-pak. The coconut water out of the plastic bottles tastes just like, well...plastic. Their customer service team (3 different people) refused to listen to me and told me &#34;it's just the younger Thai coconuts&#34; I was tasting. I was pretty insulted. I know what coconut water is supposed to taste like, and this is definitely not it. If you look at their facebook page - several other people have made the same comment and they refuse to listen each time. I'm sorry, but if many people are telling you that the plastic bottle is leaving an aftertaste...maybe you should listen? It's insulting to one's intelligence to have a customer service rep repeatedly tell you that coconuts are supposed to taste like plastic.Due to the poor customer service and their refusal to do what's right (or healthy) for their consumers - I have since taken my business elsewhere. Badia makes an amazing coconut water (with pulp) that tastes great! Would highly recommend!
5	1388880000	I really enjoy this.  I find it perfect for a morning wake up and get going as well as during the day when I am feeling a little dry.  It does need to be very cold.
5	1388707200	It taste raw and authenticate, even though not consistent, which you should expect in a real coconut.  In comparison, the other brand, even with just 1% sugar, taste consistent but artificial.  Like Zico better for sure.
5	1388707200	Coconut water is absolutely a must have for every one, it helps your health and replenishes your body's nutrients and gives you vast amounts of energy!
4	1388707200	Would've been 5 stars but I do not prefer coconut water after trying this. Oops. I'm sure this tastes like how coconut water should.
5	1388620800	I love this coconut water. I use subscribe and save and have a case delivered each month. It's great for after yoga.
5	1388448000	This is an excellent coconut product and is not from concentrate.  My wife and I use it after our workouts.  I recommend it.
5	1388448000	Closest thing to fresh coconut water there is. A little bit too pricey. I only ordered once online. I now wait for it to go on sale at the local grocery store.
5	1388361600	This product was a very good deal.  I would recommend it to any and all people who enjoy coconut water.
5	1388275200	I used Zico as a meal replacement while at work to help me lose weight!The dark chocolate simply ROCKS!
5	1388188800	I've had the Zico brand of coconut water for some time now, have tried many others but strongly prefer Zico.
2	1388188800	Flavor tastes fake and nasty but it does have a small taste of coconut. Over all I have had way better from other brands.
3	1388102400	I couldn't hack the taste of this, and half of it went to waste (which is truly sad). I have tried the chocolate flavored version of this, however, and it is super delicious. I would definitely get the chocolate flavored version of this product again, but not this one.
2	1388016000	I buy Coconut Water for as my hydration drink because of its Potassium contents (nutrient good for the muscles) after workout. But I found a different brand that has more Potassium. This brand has less Potassium content per serving.
4	1387929600	This coconut water is good but like most other health foods to expensive!  We have since bought it on sale locally or purchased a less expensive brand that is the same from a health food store.
5	1387843200	this is the one to buy.  the others might have a somewhat better deal but this by far tastes the best. YUM!
5	1387756800	Great Taste  & no added sugar. People that tend to drink little water would benefit from drinking the Zico, it does not taste like water.
5	1387584000	Good deal on coconut water! It's at least a dollar more in the grocery store. We use this all the time in green smoothies .
5	1387584000	Taste great for a cold coffee on the go with a healthy twist.  You can also buy regular cocunut water and add a shot of expresso.
1	1387411200	I'm usually happy with the product but this time the seal was broken on one of the containers and coconut water leaked out into the entire package. I was disappointed and am not happy. Feel like my money was wasted with this shipment since I had to throw it out.
5	1387411200	hi i just wanted to say i drink one everyday at least i try to sometimes i,m in a rush i feel invigorated and refreshed it taste so good and my wives a dietician she says wow look at you drinking something very good for you then proceeded to show me in the new england journal of medicine the benefits ,thanks so much for our God and our wives ,wwjd
3	1387324800	TRIED IT, CAN'T STAND THE CARD BOARD TASTE IN THE DRINK.  I USED TO GET FRESH COCONUT JUICE, AND GOING FROM FRESH JUICE TO CARD BOARD JUICE, I CAN TASTE THE DIFFERENCE.  DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR IT, BUT REASON I ORDERED IT, IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY A PEDIATRIAN THAT WROTE A BOOK ABOUT HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN, AND COCONUT JUICE ARE RECOMMENDED TO TREAT DEHYDTRATION, AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ADDITIVES OR HIGH SUGAR CONTENTS LIKE OTHER SPORTS DRINK DOES.
5	1387238400	This stuff is really delicious and healthy for you! Be cautious though, it may be addicting! I am drinking this stuff almost every day. It's quite replenishing and tastes almost as good as fresh coconuts.
5	1387152000	I love this coconut water - I have tried them all - and this is the best! Next to real fresh coconuts of course.
1	1387065600	Saw Zico recommended in &#34;the Flat Belly Cookbook for Dummies&#34; (Palinski-Wade, et. al).  Was going to order this 12 pack but decided to test it with a bottle from a local store.  I got exactly this specific product, same size, bottle type, same description on the bottle, expiration date of March 2014.  Wanted it to work because I need the potassium.  The taste is revolting.  The label says:  &#34;There was a time not long ago when you had to shinny up a tree and machete-open a coconut to experience this miracle. Not any more.  We climbed the tree for you.&#34;  As far as I'm concerned, ZICO should have stayed up the tree.
5	1387065600	If you like Coconut Water, this one is in my opinion, the best on the market. Good, clean flavor without the mustiness or pungent flavor that a lot of brands have. The price is right, especially with the subscribe and save (which has been netting me an average $0.60 savings per container). Outside of that, not sure what to tell ya', but I'll be happy to answer any questions as best I can.
1	1386979200	As a fan of Vita Coco's tetra paks, I am thoroughly and utterly disgusted with this ZICO variety. I decided to try it after hearing how much &#34;better&#34; it was. But yeah. Ew. Nasty. Sickening. Tastes like ocean water. I'll stick with Vita Coco.
3	1386892800	I bought like 7-8 of these- that is around 48 bottles. Some of the coconut water tasted a little stale. I would probably buy again if there is a great deal, but the opinion was regarding the taste.
5	1386547200	We love Zico coconut water. We like it better than the flavored kinds and we like that it is 100% coconut water.
4	1386460800	I've only tried two brands of coconut water - VitaCoco, and Zico.  Zico wins it for me, it has a smoother taste, at a lower price.  It's not perfect.  On a couple of occasions, the water did not taste fresh - some batches are probably worse than others.
5	1386288000	This is good stuff and delicious! Very refreshing and great for pregnant women. We got this when my wife was in her first trimester and it helped a lot.
5	1386288000	My husband drinks  this daily.  He started drinking it when he felt dehydrated after mowing the yard in the summertime.  It satiated his thirst better than anything else.  That was 2 or 3 years ago, and now he drinks it year round.  We never let it run out at our house.  This size/bottle is his favorite.  He prefers it to the the paper cartons and the larger sizes.  Great for coolers and trips.
5	1386201600	Its like drinking chocolate milk. I love this drink, it is a little addictive at times, and just the right amount of chocolate. Its refreshing and sweet.
5	1386201600	So delicious, but so expensive. Why are you so expensive, Zico? Give me your delicious nectar without mauling my finances, and I will order you over and over and over and over. Forever.
3	1385596800	I've had mixed experiences with ZICO's coconut water. In some of the cases I've bought, they taste great, but in other cases, there's an odd aftertaste in them that I just can't pin down. This aftertaste pretty much ruins the taste of the coconut water. Unfortunately, I am not interested in continuing to play an aftertaste lottery with my coconut water cases, so I will be switching to other brands.
1	1385510400	Absolutely horrid.  I love Zico in the tetra paks.  It's the best packaged coconut water I've tasted.  However this product in the bottle had the worst plastic taste imaginable.  I can't believe Zico would put out a product that tastes this bad.  Maybe it was stored under poor conditions, but I will never buy Zico in this format ever again.
2	1385510400	I have been receiving this item monthly as a subscription item and previously have been very pleased. This order was shipped with product that expires in Dec 2013. Every other order has had expiration dates at least 6 months later than my receipt of the item. If this happens again, I will return the product.
5	1385510400	This stuff is awesome, my new gotta have! Healthy and tastes just like chocolate milk! No wonder it's always sold out!
5	1385337600	Yes, it is from concentrate. I'm not that familiar with the benefits/drawbacks to concentrate vs unconcentrated coconut water, so I can't speak much on that, but I can tell you that this is one of my favorite coconut waters I've tried. I order this through the subscribe and save program and always keep a bottle or two in the fridge. I mix it up with a shot of espresso, a scoop of PB2 Peanut Butter Powder, and some chocolate protein powder after a workout and it really helps me bounce back. I'll drink a bottle after a long bike ride and my muscles don't get nearly as sore as they used to. The chocolate flavor is so good and complements the coconut very nicely, and I love the fact that I can use half a bottle at a time since it keeps up to 3 days after being opened. The 12 ounce size is very convenient for me as well!
5	1385164800	The Zico coconut water arrived as expected & tastes wonderful.  Nicest thing of all, I didn't have to lug the box around the store.  Very convenient!
5	1385164800	This coconut water has an excellent taste and texture!  I actually prefer it over chocolate milk, plus it's better for you nutritionally.
4	1384992000	This is a good quality product.  However, I'm not crazy about the peel off cover.  I don't care for sipping on cardboard.
5	1384819200	I hate coconut water. It's nasty and foul tasting.Zico latte and chocolate are fabulous.More potassium than a banana, low calories. It has nearly stopped my crushing leg cramps.
4	1384646400	Of all the coconut waters I enjoy ZICO the most. It has the cleanest taste. More fulling than plain water.
5	1384560000	We have been drinking coconut water for years and Zico is the best. If it continues to go up in price we may have to give it up.
5	1384473600	It appears that three brands of coconut water predominate--Zico, Vita, and ONE. I had an opportunity to procure both Zico and Vita from a local Costco (currently priced lower there), not Amazon. I was surprised to find Vita sweeter than Zico. However, when I poured them both into separate transparent glasses, Zico was more turbid (cloudy); although less sweet, it seemed to have more &#34;substance.&#34;The answer to this apparent paradox was supplied by the Vita carton: note in the ingredients section that &#34;less than 1% natural fruit sugar&#34; has been added. In contrast, the Zico ingredients section lists only &#34;pure coconut water.&#34; Further (supplementary but not direct) evidence that sugar may well be an additive in Vita comes from the caloric counts--Vita has a higher calorie per ml value.Finally (and perhaps what matter most), Zico just plain tastes better--there is an authentic &#34;flavor&#34; to it. As someone who has tasted real coconuts, there are no two ways about it, and I suspect most blind-tasters would conclude likewise. Nevertheless, you can't really go wrong with either choice.
5	1384300800	I  was looking for a cheaper price for Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water which I found on Amazon! Our family takes it every day.
5	1384041600	Great price on  coco water! This coco water tastes great after a long run and I find it revives me better than those sugar and CS loaded sports drinks. With Amazon Prime the cost per container comes out less than most places I can buy locally.
5	1383782400	Yummy, has more potassium per ounce than any other coconut water I could find and convenient small single serving size make this my new favorite coconut water. This is a potassium replacement for intense workouts or any time you are sweating excessively. We believe that we feel better after drinking this. Usually we have to drink extreme amounts of water after a workout but one of these and a liter of water and we feel great.
5	1383523200	Love the new packaging, the opening raised off the carton is a major improvement.  I do like this brand of coconut water, not all are good quality.
5	1383350400	Good hungover drink to get some caffeine and electrolytes after a night of drinking and sleeping less than you would like
5	1382745600	luv this stuff it goes great or alone for my workouts. this is my fave kind of coconut water out in the market today. I plan on getting more.
2	1382745600	I LOVE Zico, but this batch has to be old bottles, It expires Feb 2014 and all my monthly orders are at least listing an expiration of June/July 2014 and they are the new packaging with no tear off seals
5	1382572800	I am not a fan of coconut water but this is my husband's favorite brand by far.  We subscribed and saved because we couldn't find it anywhere near our home.  Excellent value and very convenient.
3	1382313600	oh this product i orderted when big packs with 1 ltr bottles are not availble.. this is ok but pack is not good and felt like wasted a lot
5	1382313600	I use this coconut water to make shakes and in my scrabbled eggs.  It is not sweet, which is the reason I picked it to begin with.I like the six-pack.  I always have some on the shelf.  I would recommend this to everyone.
5	1382313600	My daughter loves this stuff! She lives on the other side of the country and I decided that it would be a great ongoing gift instead of shopping for individual gifts and shipping them at different times during the year. It's been well received and greatly appreciated. I added it to my subscribe and save and never have to worry about forgetting an occasion again!
5	1382313600	I love Zico coconut water. Not so fond of the plain, but have a mild addiction to the chocolate one. However this one wins hands down. I bought it because it was cheaper, and I'm broke right now.  So glad I did.This will now be my morning coffee. Super awesome.
5	1382140800	I have tried all the brands of coconut water available in my area, and Zico is definitely the best. The flavor is always fresh, lightly sweet, and never has a funny after taste, as does many of its competitors.
3	1382140800	I love coconut water for it's potassium and low sodium so This product is perfect when sent in this package, but for some reason they sent me this product in another package and this package has less Potassium and more sodium so I'm not too happy with that. I have ordered this a few times and have always gotten the package I have ordered with the box where you pull the tab off not the ones where you twist the cap off. The pull tab box which is pictured gives you 20% Potassium about 690mg and 54 mg of Sodium. The box I was sent give me 15% potassium about 490mg and 85mg of Sodium.  So you might not be sent the one your looking at here and when someone is buying it for the Potassium then you will not be happy if they send you the twist cap
5	1382054400	Love this product. Is the best coconut  water I have ever had. I've tried several different brands and this one is the best tasting. Try it!!
5	1381968000	ZICO brand is the best brand of coconut water out there. They are hard to find in stores. We always receive them in time.
5	1381881600	I drink one of these each time I exercise to rehydrate me.  I really enjoy it and it works great!
4	1381190400	Had coconut trees and loved the coconut water. Then whiteflies got them, but Zico is a good substitute and easier to get out of the container then the nut.
5	1381190400	I've been getting these on subscription for I don't know how long.  I don't like it when companies put added sugar into a drink made of natural sugar.  Zico seems to have the best tasting natural coconut water for my taste. I use it after exercise to rehydrate and get a boost (much better than the Coke I used to drink).In my latest shipment the shiny metal flap seal has been replaced by a plastic screwtop. I don't know which is worse. At least the screwtop is more likely to make it into the trash/recycle while the shiny flaps seal seems to get released into the wild 50% of the time.  Maybe I should get a larger container and share with my wife but I worry that she will take more than her fair share...
3	1381104000	I had been awaiting this for some time and I love Zico's pineapple flavor, but this one is a little disappointing. This is a pretty good coffee + coconut water effort, but it's sweeter than I'd like and also is not 100% coconut water (only 85% juice). There are some other coconut water options out there that better satisfy one's latte + caffeine craving.
5	1381017600	This order is for my baby. He loves it a ton. It helped me get him off milk. Love it
1	1380931200	Fresh coconut water is the most refreshing drink in the world. It has a trace of sweetness and light fragrance to it that it is so refreshing. This stuff is no where near that taste. It tastes somewhat like coconut water but stale and old. The color is more yellowish than the real thing as if it is more concentrated.Even though on the package it says the stuff is not from concentrate, I highly doubt it. If you have ever tasted the real coconut water from a green coconut freshly cut up, you would know what I am talking about.
3	1380931200	This coconut water has a very mild coconut taste and is not very sweet (unlike a couple other brands that have tried) I would continue to buy it if it weren't for the fact that it is packaged in Tetra Paks that allegedly contain a layer of polyethylene that is attributed to increased estrogen production in women AND men and is linked to some forms of breast cancer in women AND men.  What a shame that this company that is touting such a clean and wonderful product is using such a horrible (and rarely recycled) container to put it in.
2	1380844800	really bad stuff, but only a little better than vita coco which is the horrible foul stench of the underworld's most unkempt Gas station bathroom.
5	1380758400	I've used other coconut water product but this tastes best. I have been using it for several months and find myself drinking an adequate amount of fluid because of the great taste.
5	1380672000	One of the better tasting coconut water products, I have tried others like Vita Coco which does not compare in my opinion to this quality product. It cost a little more but to me it seems worth it so I will continue to keep this on my subscribe list.
3	1380672000	There is no better natural rejuvenating drink than coconut water. So after trying out different brands of coconut water I settled on this. The product is really good, very natural. This brand doesn't have added sugars like other coconut water brands. This was huge win for me.Completely satisfied with it.Have been using it for 6 months now. I have a monthly subscription :)Saves me money.PS:Once opened the coconut water goes bad if not consumed within 24 hrs, especially during summers.Would have been nice if the product came with a label saying&#34;Once opened consume within 24hrs&#34;
4	1380585600	good price but still costly. wish coconut was not so expensive but this was a good deal for buying bulk
5	1379980800	Perfect for during-the-day refreshment.  Tasty and nutritious, with minerals and electrolytes.  I am consuming one each day and it goes down very easily.
5	1379808000	I have tasted these first time at a friends place came to know he got it from costco, since i dont have membership i searched on amazon and bingo! here they are, one of the best coconut water out there
5	1379721600	I had my doubts about the pleasure of drinking cocnut water until a friend offerred Zico chocolate.  It is so good and nourashing.
1	1379635200	It tastes horrible! Taste like pool water! It's just gross! I love coconut water and tried this one... I couldn't return the package so I ended up dumping half of the pack. I tried to consume them cuz I hate to wast anything but It was giving me headache! I stopped drinking it my headaches stopped too. Awful taste, poor quality!!!!
5	1379462400	Not as good as the real stuff, but the very next best thing you can get is the zico coconut water.
5	1379462400	I bought this because I read on the internet that coconut water was good for a dogs bad breath. Well I have a Daschund that needed help. It is very hard to brush his teeth and the chew things did not seem to help. I thought well let me give this a try. After one day of giving him a small amount of this in a bowl  twice it was like magic. He loves it  and NO MORE DOG BREATH.....Did I like it myself, not so much but perhaps I will buy some more and sell it as a dog breath cure. :o)Update: Yep it is still working
5	1379462400	Buying these in bulk is just WAY convenient. I love keeping my fridge stocked for deliciousness! The natural flavor is great too when i throw it in my smoothies!
1	1379116800	It comes in a very lovely box and attractive packaging, but is totally funky tasting, like sour milk mixed with stagnant water. I am a big coconut water fan and would barely recognize this as coconut water when compared to other things I have tasted.
5	1379030400	I'm not a fan of coconut water unless it's the chocolate. It's refreshing, hydrating and tastes more like chocolate milk than coconut water. Love the taste!
5	1378684800	I scoffed when I first learned about this item...chocolate coconut water sounded gross!  Honestly, this is the only coconut water I drink now.  It's just like watery chocolate milk.  I would definitely purchase again, my 4 year old loves it too!
3	1378598400	Zico - Original - This product taste was way too water down; it did not give me that `kick' I was looking for and was quite disappointed actually; as the packaging was better than the substance itself. The problem is you can't taste the coconut, then why call it `coconut water'?Chocolate - Is just okay (if you close your eyes you really can't tell the difference between the chocolate and the original; I'm just not sure what the coloring is doing to your insides); you want to make sure to shake the container well before drinking or you will have these tiny chocolate-covered pieces of coconut on the bottom which then becomes over-powering with artifical chocolate flavoring.Pineapple - NO WAY/SUCKIE!! - The problem here as well it taste too artificial, this is definitely not what you want in a product that is supposed to be all-natural.I'm now starting to come across all sorts of ads and endorsements to promote `ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural' but I think this product is way over-rated in my opinion; but all-in-all I am a advocate of drinking coconut water vs. soda or high fructose drink juices.Some of their other flavors you might want to consider (mango, passion fruit, pom-berry, strawberry banana, tropical and latte).This Review has been brought to you by 'Awakened1'.** See all my reviews:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview
2	1378512000	I consider myself a &#34;coconut water specialist&#34; not only because I am a native from Brazil, but also because I have tasted and compared many packaged coconut waters. I was not expecting the ZICO product to taste as good as an &#34;in-natura&#34; coconut water, but it was disappointing. Its taste is very below the average of all the packaged coconut water I have tried so far and have little resemblance to the wonderful real taste of drinking the water directly from a fresh coconut. However still it is much healthier than any sports drink and I got a decent deal (Amazon coupon $12 per 12 packs). Unless you get a decent price, don't buy ZICO, look for VITA, which is not very good but still better than ZICO.
4	1378512000	I love coconut water and Zico is definitely one of my go-to coconut water fix. Only thing I don't like about it is that it only tastes good when chilled.
5	1378512000	since I love this water (and no other type of coconut water), and it isn't available at my local store, I love that Amazon sells it.  I love the product for the light taste, zero added sugar, electrolytes and hydration which I need for my health, and finally the potassium since I don't like banana's.
5	1378425600	I use Zico coconut water instead of skim milk for the added potassium and no fat no lactose qualities.  I have bought this product at Costco for a year and then they started carrying only the small packaging usually found in grocery stores by the other &#34;no soda&#34; drinks.  That packaging is three times more expensive than the liter bottles!  I usually add a splash of nondairy creamer and pour it on the rocks for a very refreshing summer drink!  (Try International Delight coconut). I'm so glad I found a reliable new source.  I am on the auto order system, getting them every 2-3 months,  with No Shipping!  If you love coconut and would like a change, I recommend this!
1	1378252800	this is not 100% coconut water. this is from concentrate and added natural flavors and tastes really bad. i would not recommend this
5	1378252800	I use it daily for one thing : to keep up my electrolytes to: help keep my hyatial hernia in balance and just to keep my digestive system in balance in general.  I would not want to be without it.
4	1378166400	I love this refreshing drink for the electrolyte replenishing properties. Coconut water is much better for you than artificially manufactured sports drinks like Gatorade.
4	1378166400	Very good product. Wish it was more readily available. Priced good. Delivered as promised. Love using coconut water to re-hydrate.
5	1378166400	i keep a couple of these stocked in my fridge and nothing tastes better after a 2 hour run or 4 hour bike in the summer.I also put these in my water bottles on long bikes and mix carbo-pro with them - it doesn't alter the taste at all.
5	1378166400	I needed extra potassium and this has more than supplements do.The taste is light and is much better than eating a kazillion bananas!
5	1378080000	I love this coconut water so much!!! It is way better than most other price comparible brands. The price was great, fast shipping & mouth watering. I will def order Zico from Amazon again real soon!!!
4	1378080000	Love the water but find the tetra oaks inconvenient. Eden when it comes to opening it I would rather have the plastic bottles.
5	1377993600	This is the only brand I really enjoy drinking. I'll drink others my wife buys because they are good for me, but I only buy Zico for work.
5	1377907200	Love this stuff! Super hydrating and mild/mellow taste. Just found a new brand that flavors the water with pineapple or orange and now prefer that. Coconut water has so many positive attributes -- 1. Prevents dehydration. 2. Fuel for brain and muscles. 3. Heart and kidney healthy. 4. Anti-aging. 5. Digestive Aid. 6. Supports immune function.
3	1377907200	My fiance loves it, I got it to try and he is more than welcome to the rest. Health benefits or not (and I'm skeptical) I'd rather eat spinach. It doesn't taste strongly of anything in its defense, its just odd.
5	1377907200	i been drinking coconut water for a very long time since i was in the Philippines and this is the closes to the one i drink back home. For those who do not know there are many kind of coconut tree and they are not all the same so the taste also vary accordingly. Anyway this is almost the same as the one i drink back home.
5	1377820800	I like this product. I use it in smoothies :) I can't stand the taste of coconut water by itself,but this isn't too bad. It's great to mix with other stuff so you can get the benefits without the odd taste. The price is good too. I would recommend to a friend.
4	1377820800	I'm not sure what it is, but when drinking coconut water take one sip and allow your taste buds to adjust.  Your second sip will be more flavorful and you probably will love the drink.  I find that it pares well with pineapple.  I've never honestly had tha plain coconut juice.  According to claims, it is much better for you than sports drinks which have added chemicals, sodium, and sugars.
1	1377734400	This is perhaps the most disgusting thing I've ever had to drink. It is really really bad. I can't emphasize that enough. IT IS BAD.I bought the 6 pack, my friend and I each had one, and neither of us could finish them, no matter how slowly we tried or what painful faces we made as we did so.I'm throwing away the remaining 4 bottles.
5	1377734400	My wife and I like this flavor. It tastes like a Starbuck's coffee in a bottle but not as heavy. The caffeine content is very small. We also recommend the Chocolate version as well.
5	1377648000	This brand of coconut water was very good.  I used this coconut water in my smoothies.  The size of a container is good if you want to carry one with you.
5	1377561600	By the taste, you'll know this coconut water comes from Young/baby coconuts, so its high in nutrients, & low in sugar.
5	1377388800	To me, this tastes like the old Yoo-Hoo chocolate drink, but this has some 600+ mg of potassium and is very refreshing.  I'm glad to have the opportunity to buy it in 12-packs, because it sells out at my local grocery and health food stores.
5	1377216000	Zico coconut water tastes great, it's awesome in mixed drinks, fruit smoothies, and protein shakes.  And I love the convenience of ordering these multiple, resealable cartons.
5	1377216000	This stuff works wonders for post workout, preworkout, hangovers...you name it its awesome!!!!  Its hydrates you better and quicker than regular water!!!!
5	1377043200	Real fruit beverages made outside the U.S. (when traveling) taste delightful WITHOUT added sugars, sweeteners, or syrups.Have you EVER MADE fresh fruit juice WITHOUT adding any kind of favor enhancement?  Really? I don't think you have!SOOOO many People have trained their pallet to enjoy MAN MADE additives.  They can't seem to relish what grows from the ground, and/or trees without changing natures lovely fragrant flavors, and uncomplicated tastes.How awful it is that folks forgot light, cool (real) refreshing sips.Oh well, MORE FOR ME.
5	1377043200	Box was a little to large and was damaged slightly.  ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 33.8 Ounce Container (Pack of 6) was OK.
1	1376956800	Ordered this after seeing all the hype. I cant even drink it. Try one before you order a case. It seems very diluted.
3	1376956800	I was fooled by the product description. I did not read the fine print. This thing is made from concentrate unlike Vita Coco. I travel a lot to Asia and have had water from actual coconut many times and I somehow found the taste of this little artificial.
5	1376956800	I just love your chocolate coconut water is so refreshing & hydrates you too , Great drink especially good in summer!
5	1376870400	This stuff is delicious and more refreshing and hydrating than having a cup of coffee in the morning. Perfect if you're trying to cut back on caffeine. Price is comparable to buying a cup of coffee every morning.
5	1376611200	I've bought this product often & each time I run out I reorder. I love the taste & nothing hits the spot when I'm feeling really parched.
5	1376524800	Great price, excellent healthy product. I use it in my smoothies instead of milk. It blends with everything.I would recommend this product.
5	1376352000	I love it! Much better than others that I have tried.I may order this again. Like the container too.Taste great cold.
5	1376265600	Zico+coffee=PERFECTION!!!  I did not thin that Zico could get any better...but then they added coffee to it. Absolutely the sweetest combo.
2	1376265600	I'm disappointed with the taste. It was stale; either they took water from old coconuts or the product was near expiry date. I would not buy this again. If I could get tender coconut water anywhere, that would have been amazing because the water from young coconuts are 100 times tastier than the water from old coconuts.
5	1376265600	this brand is awesome, I will order it in the future, too! the price is reasonable, the product is high quality
5	1376265600	People complain about coco water so it seems to be an acquired taste but it kept me hydrated during fasting so i think its a great product.
4	1376179200	This was my first ever coconut water experience.  I read multiple reviews before placing my order.  I wanted something as natural as possible.  My first impression was that it tasted like a dirty sock.  Then it grew it on me and I can't get enough.  I feel totally hydrated and refreshed after drinking this after a workout or during a 12 hour shift.
5	1376179200	Love these coconut water drinks. I've tried a few options and settled on Zico based on pureness, i.e. no addition of sugar or any other adulterants. These are refreshing, good alternative for 'engineered' sports drinks that are definitely overkill for 1 to 2 hour moderate activities. Highly recommend if you like coconut water in general.
5	1376092800	Flavorful and light.  Very tasty. I tried it with my protein powder and found the coconut water made the shake too sweet.  By itself I love it!
5	1376006400	I really love this brand of coconut water. The others aren't as tasty. Coco Cola distributes (not produces) this one, and it is the &#34;Real One.&#34; hahaha
5	1375920000	I LOVE THIS COCONUT WATER. this is the best on the market if you ask me and it s so much healthier than drinking gatorade or any of these fake drink. This will rehydrate you in no time even after a real tough workout. GUARANTEE :)
2	1375574400	It is much cheaper than Cafe Coco, and I like the other flavors, such as chocolate cream. But this one just tastes funny. Not like a latte, not like coconut water. Just... weird. Maybe it's that this one's vegan (no dairy) and Cafe Coco contains some real milk. But if you want a real latte flavor with the health benefits of coconut water, stick to Cafe Coco.
4	1375401600	some bottles would taste very good while others would be a little sour, never undrinkable though. i'd buy them again.
5	1375315200	Even better when you  freeze the bottle for the next day. For some reason it tastes sweeter but at only 70 calories? That is a sweet deal!!!
2	1375315200	Sorry but it does not make it, very very very ( that's three very's) weak taste.  Basically water with a hint of Coconut.
5	1375315200	I love coconut water. and Zico Pure Premium is the best. Get the big jugs and fill up a glass in the morning!
5	1375142400	Coconut water was cheaper than bought in the store. Taste is fine. For sure I'll buy more when this one is finished.
5	1375056000	Sometimes I get a craving that only coconut water can satisfy.  I prefer it plain and this stuff is very good.  I prefer it really chilled and often put it in the freezer.
5	1375056000	I absolutely love Zico coconut water. It's a great change from just plain water. I also prefer this brand to others I've tried like VitaCoco.
3	1375056000	I make a smoothie nearly every morning and I've been using orange juice as the base. I bought the coconut water to try in order to cut down on sugar (orange juice is very VERY high in sugar at 22 grams per 8 oz.). I was surprised to find that this &#34;water&#34; with &#34;no added sugars&#34; has so much sugar... 10 grams in 8 oz serving.  Interesting. The flavor is neither good or bad to me. I don't know if I would buy it again.
4	1374969600	Got a free sample of this product after participating in a 5k and it was really good!  The taste is similar to a chocolate protein shake.  A healthier option for those chocolate cravings!
5	1374969600	I love the health benefits of coconut water, but not all of it tastes good enough to drink. The Zico chocolate flavored coconut water is my absolute favorite. Tastes great!
5	1374969600	This came up on super special one day when I was craving one, so it was an instant BUY! One of the better coconut waters on the market I believe.
1	1374883200	Wow, ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Mango has a horrible taste. I love the plain ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water.I love Mango and thought this would be a nice combo. Boy was I wrong. Either the product received was bad, or I was just wrong about the combo flavor of Coconut water and Mango together.  Either way I would not recommend this combo flavor.
5	1374883200	zico taste great and is refreshing in the morning when its ice cold. great cure for a hang over too.
5	1374796800	I drink it daily and it's quite refreshing.  I have been told about good things of coconut water. This is pure coconut water which I like.
1	1374710400	Not as disgusting as Vita Coco, but a very close second. Don't let the shiny packaging fool you. Tastes like a corn flour tortilla. Just add beef and cheese.  Gross.
5	1374624000	We love Zico coconut water and get such a great deal with the &#34;subscribe and save&#34;! Look forward to it every month!
3	1374624000	I like Zico coconut water, but it turns out there is a difference in the taste between the refrigerated bottles and the tetrapacks.  It is not a deal-breaker since I like to have some around if I am feeling sick or dehydrated, but, the bottled is better, for sure.
5	1374537600	I love Zico (unconcentrated in the carton, unflavored). It's delicious and refreshing. The 11.2 oz is the perfect serving size and doesn't take too long to get cold.
5	1374451200	The store shelves need more products like this, pure, no additives, no sweeteners and the packaging is recyclable!  Never disappointed with ZICO!
1	1374278400	I drink coconut water on the regular, especially before and after the gym. I saw this product on sale at my local store and decided to try it. It was horrendous. More specifically it did not taste like fresh coconut water. The flavor was strange, and the after taste was sour. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water and can recognize the taste. If i was blindfolded, i'm confident i would not have been able to recognize the flavor of this beverage.
5	1374105600	I've tried several brands and zirconium is easily the tastiest. Not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. I sometimes use cheaper brands for smoothies, but for plain drinking, this is always the winner. No weird aftertaste as in another popular brand.
5	1374019200	A great tasting coconut water option. Especially great when I got it on a lightning deal! Want to try the flavored ones, but I like the regular too much.
5	1374019200	I had heard about all the benefits of coconut water but had not tried it.  It is great tasting and refreshing.
5	1374019200	One of the better tasting coconut water carriers, speedy delivery really nothing to complain about!I would recommend this brand if you haven't already experienced its' awesomeness! Perfect for a hot summer day or after a workout.
4	1374019200	Thank you Amazon for keeping this very distinctive Zico Chocolate Coco water in stock.  Deliciously refreshing AND  nutritious.  Some say it works great for hangovers?  I wouldn't know . . .
5	1373932800	This is the best brand of coconut water that I have tried.  It has a much subtler coconut taste than other brands.
5	1373846400	I like using coconut water for cooking and to dehydrate. It's very tasty and its has the fresh original taste from the young coconut water. It's the best one I've ever taste it. It has only 10 gram of sugar and its pure coconut waterI would strongly recommend this drink to everybody.Good stuff!
1	1373760000	really from concentrate.  You've got ot be kidding me.  If it's 100% coconut water then why does it list natural flavors.  If it's a 100% coconut water then there shouldn't be other natural flavor except coconut water.....question is, what's the natural flavors?There are plenty of brands that are not from concentrate.  My money will now go to them
1	1373673600	I bought a case of this stuff after Amazon offered a 20% discount. I love coconut water, a few weeks back, Amazon offered a similar deal on Amy & Brian's brand, which I bought and was delighted with. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this name brand. I was WRONG! This stuff is made from concentrate, and has added &#34;natural&#34; flavors, NOT the PURE goodness I was expecting! I don't know if it is the additives or the plastic bottle it comes in, but it gives me an unpleasant after-taste that lasts WAY too long. At least it doesn't have the fermented flavor some of the really cheap brands do. Stick with the best, in my opinion, it's Amy & Brian's.
5	1373673600	I've tried several and this one tastes clean and refreshing when served really cold.  It's a little more expensive, but worth the price.
5	1373587200	I've always liked the taste of this coconut water and what better to have than have it delivered directly to your house for a competitive price!
5	1373500800	I love coconut water.  It is especially great as a change of pace from regular water since I try not to consume soft drinks.  Most of the other brands on the market either have a funky after-taste, or gritty particles.  Zico is always smooth and refreshing.Like: Smooth, crisp taste.  Doesn't have a lingering after-taste. Perfect for hangovers, or dehydration in general.Dislike: The packaging isn't as convenient as some of the bottled competitors.
5	1373500800	For some reason, Zico Natural tastes better in these 14 oz bottles (as opposed to the &#34;carton&#34; type of container).  This shipped quickly and cost much less than buying individually. LOVE, love, love, ZICO! I've tried a lot of the others. Zico is still the best!!!!  (and the chocolate flavored one is also amazingly delicious!).
4	1373500800	I like the water, but for me, ordering a pack of 6 is problematic because I cannot drink them all in two months which is when they expire.
4	1373414400	Don't care much for the taste, but makes a great filler for Juicing Fruits and Veggies.  Has tons of Potassium!
1	1373414400	Blindly, I haven't been checking containers of Zico... they now are made from concentrate and add 'enhanced flavoring'. Yuck.And I bought 6 cases of 12 ...of those juice box containers ...at Whole Foods. No wonder they were on sale. From concentrate??? Please. You use to be Zico. Now you're just another disappointment.
5	1373328000	This is the most refreshing drink and it hydrates one well. Tastes great.  I have bought this before many times at Trader Joe's.
5	1373241600	I have chronic kidney stones. It's not if it's when I'll pass another. I drink 2-3 coconut waters a week and have noticed a decrease in my stones size. I'm not saying that I no longer have stones or make stones but something about the coconut water helps to make the stone smaller or something.
5	1372982400	I became addicted to agua de coco when I lived in Mexico. This is the closest i have ever come to drinking from a freshly opened green coconut.
5	1372896000	We've tried a lot of different coconut waters.  This stuff is great.  Not too sweet, very refreshing.  This is a really good price
5	1372896000	Drinking ZICO is the ONLY way I hydrate after all my cycling training and races.Try it you'll know the difference.
5	1372636800	Love this product... So nice to be able to get it by the case.  Saves over buying them individually in the store.
5	1372636800	Note: drink only when chilled, otherwise does not taste good. this is by far one of the best coconut waters I've tried. Keep these in a fridge during summer and chug down every time i feel thirsty. Quenches the thirst great and also good for the body. be warned though, this is somewhat diuretic, so you'll be running to the bathroom more often then used to. I also give this product to my 19m old daughter who also loves it.
1	1372550400	I purchased a bottle of the pineapple flavor yesterday and it was horrible!  The consistency was odd - it was like drinking a thick water - and I actually felt sick after tasting it.  I, stupidly, drank the entire bottle (even though I found it to be quite disgusting) with the idea that coconut water is full of electrolytes and I would feel better after consuming it.  In reality I felt ill for the next 1-2 hours and at one point thought that I might vomit.  Thankfully it passed but I will not be making the same mistake again.  And unless it is medicine I won't be drinking something that tastes horrible in the hopes that I will feel better after.
5	1372550400	Product arrives well-packaged and tastes much better than other leading coconut water brands that I've purchased from Amazon.  Yes it costs a bit more, though it's well worth the extra $2/case.
4	1372550400	The is my daily treat. I drink one bottle (Ice Cold) every night as a treat to myself. I've also noticed that I've had no leg cramps since starting with my treat. The only downside I've noted is the cost, but Amazon has the lowest price I've found and by having shipments made each month, I always have it on hand.
5	1372464000	I'm really bad about drinking water b/c there's no taste.. this is the next best thing for me... just enough flavor to get me to drink
5	1372377600	I personally do a set of workout routines daily, in order to maintain my weight objectives, and afterwards, I pour myself a cupful of this cocoanut water to reenergize myself when IM resting .... no need for those sweet-toothed drinks, this one can handle your glucose needs and minimize your sweet tooth, in the same breath.The taste of coconut is in there, ...seems to me, its &#34;just right&#34;, though I personally would have preferred a stronger hint of cocoanut, but that's just me, not the product speaking.
5	1372377600	Having lived in the Caribbean I used to get fresh coconut wafer all the time. I've really missed and was excited when it became popular here. Zico is the best coconut water around.
4	1372118400	Chocolate is my favorite flavor, but if you are a mocha person, this flavor is good.  Very mild-and not enough caffeine to get you shaking.
5	1372032000	This particular item  is for Mother (87 yrs. old)  this give's her all the essential things that she needs.  My mother likes it because it is chocolate flavor.
4	1372032000	The taste is decent not sweet but I expect it not to be sweet since it very rare to get a sweet batch. The only consistent refreshing sweet coco taste is the SPROUT brand in a can..seem the CO2 help reserve the taste better which cost about 1.70 for 16 oz .Sometime it on sale for $1.But for Zico in plactic container just sprinkle a little raw sugar cane and it will taste refreshing sweet .
4	1371945600	delicious, great large size, lid makes it so you can re-seal and fridge. helps with muscle recovery, reduces soreness when consumed during/after a workout.
5	1371945600	It came well packed! tasted sooo refreshing. it wasn't spoiled at all. I was surprised because the weather has been really hot
5	1371859200	I purchased this product for my daughter who is nursing right now, we read somewhere that coconut water was a good hydrating product for nursing mothers and this one had great reviews. It was also the only natural one I could find that comes in such a large container, that was a huge plus for her.
1	1371686400	I bought 14 ounce bottles pack of 12, natural flavor. I expect it tastes like regular coconut water but it is not. I must say it is horrible. I cannot explain it but it tastes like expired water, no coconut taste, no sweetness. My wife and my son have the same taste. I don't know what to do with the rest of 11 bottles. I will never try it again.
5	1371600000	This coconut water is very refreshing. It's so much better than the artificial stuff. In fact, it is body slimming.
1	1371513600	Maybe it's just me, but I hated this. Then again, I am not exactly a huge coconut fan, but... I thought this was awful. As did my husband, who loves coconut, and even my kid, who really wanted to try this. Just not for us at all. According to my husband, it does not even remotely taste of coconut, and has the worst aftertaste ever.This had the taste and consistency of, well; I don't even know how to describe this.  Kind of salty.  The only thing I could compare it to might be mucus.  I don't even understand how this could be considered a "superfood."I actually came back to edit this, after seeing someone else's review that they used this to make oatmeal, I tried that. (Amazingly, we hadn't chucked the whole bottle yet, not sure why not.) While it didn't destroy the whole bowl of oatmeal, it didn't add anything either. So, I guess in theory if you HAD to drink/use coconut water because you bought into the whole fad thing, you might be able to get away with using this stuff as an ingredient in other things...Even still, this is not a replacement for milk. In fact, it is not a replacement for water either, as it manages to have the texture of neither, and taste unbelievably worse than both. Ugh, shudder, blech.Off to dispose of the remains now...
5	1371513600	Great hydration the best ~ besides water & love to add it to many drinks as juices cuts the sugar & helps not be so sweet. add it to my smoothies too~! as well as put some in my yogurt & granola too.
5	1371427200	First, let me say I'm from the Caribbean, and finding packaged coconut water that actually tastes like coconut water has been difficult.  I've gotten both the regular (Natural) and chocolate flavored Zico, and they are both great.  The natural doesn't have that sour dirty laundry water taste that others have (33.8oz).When I first tried the chocolate (14oz), I drank it pretty close to room temperature and I wasn't that impressed.  Icy cold straight from the fridge, however, the chocolate is amazing!  It is like a good for you Yoohoo (is that spelled right?) drink without all the sugar.  Add a littleOmega Nutrition Pumpkin Seed Protein Powder, 21-Ounceprotein powder to the 14oz bottle, shake up and you're good for a breakfast on the run.As a side note, I also like the taste of theTaste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)andCoCo Libre Organic Coconut Water, 11-Ounce (Pack of 12).Absolutely HATE the taste of either plain or flavored Vita Coco.
5	1371427200	This is the best one! I tried several, this one is pure enjoyment in each sip! Now I am growing wheat grass and will blend this coconut juice with wheat grass juice and see how that tastes. I saw somebody was doing it on YouTube.
5	1371427200	The delivery is on time and packaged well. I like the bigger containers because they last through the month, so I never run out. I put it in my smoothie every day.
5	1371340800	I love this brand and am glad it is available on Amazon.  I got hooked on it and then local stores started dropping it.  Some only carry the plain.
5	1371340800	I drink this! One a day, I always eat a piece of fruit with it, OMG totally enhances the taste, I'm now hooked on it.
4	1371340800	i like it very much. it is very healthy  for me.me and my husband both drank it daily keep up the good work.
2	1371340800	First let me say, I love ZICO coconut water!  BUT I need to say as well, at this point, I would not order it again through Amazon.  Out of two cases (six one liter bottles each) three were damaged in shipping causing leakage and spoiled contents.  The first one I discovered was fairly noticeable since it actually had mold growing around the leak.  I notified the seller right away and have resubmitted my concern a few different times but have never heard back from them.  The other two were less noticable since they were hairline cracks along the lid and I only discovered them today.  Unless I can be assured that I will not have to eat the cost of damage done in shipping, I will not be ordering my coconut water through Amazon.
4	1371340800	What can I say, it's coconut water...  The delivery is nice, not that it's too heavy, but at least once per month, it's cheaper to buy it at the grocery store (stock up and save).  So, the convenience of buying it on here comes at a cost, one which I'll simply deal with from time to time.
3	1371340800	Ads and review conveyed that this has the real taste of fresh tender coconut water. In reality the taste is more of premature tender coconut water, picked before its prime. I like the fact that no sugar was added to it, thus can be called natural. There is no canned,bottled or packed coconut water that comes anywhere near the refreshing taste of tender coconut picked at its prime and consumed without delay.
5	1371254400	The size of this package makes it easy to take to the gym or hiking to provide healthy coconut water for hydration.  I would recommend this great tasting product to health conscious people.
1	1371254400	Terrible taste. Pales in comparison to other brands. Someone said it tasted like feet. Not too far off. But arrived in time and as promised.
5	1371254400	The best way to hydrate naturally. I thought a 6-pack would last me a month but they were gone in two weeks. One sip makes you want a whole glass, which makes you want the whole container.
3	1371168000	I'm sure it's good for nutrition, but I wasn't enthralled by the taste. I stopped drinking it. You may like it better than I did.
4	1371168000	I have ordered natural and chocolate from Amazon plenty of times and the taste of these is very good. Being a big fan of Zico, I saw a new flavor "Tropical" at my local Trader Joe's. STAY AWAY! It is a "blend" of pineapple, passion fruit, guava and other natural flavors from concentrate.....it tastes like unripe pinapple and guava amongst other things. It's new so I'm not sure if Amazon will carry it but just be cautious with TROPICAL. I'd definitely try before buying a pack of 6-1Ls.
5	1370995200	We cant live without coconut water, like this brand as there are no other added ingredients than just the coconut water.
5	1370908800	I was using the Zico Coconut Water in my daily a.m. fruit 'shakes' and it is very good - I increased the amount I was using and ordered enough for every day use...however, I started to have loose bowels, and since it was latest 'new' addition to shakes w/increase (I did try decreasing some), I stopped using until I figure out just what is causing the problem (may not be the coconut water).  As to the product, I give it 5 stars, and the delivery is right on time etc...NO complaints about Zico coconut water.  :)
2	1370822400	I like coconut water but this flavor was awful.  I was really disappointed.  It was cloying on the palette.  We will not be purchasing this again.
5	1370822400	I prefer Zico pineapple coconut water to other brands.  It has the right amount of sweetness for me, and I find it very refreshing.
5	1370736000	This is by far the best-tasting coconut water ... just like out of a real coconut. Naked and O.N.E. have too little flavor but are still drinkable and refreshing. Vita-Coco is the absolute worst no matter what flavor!! It is just way too sweet and doesn't even taste like coconut water. It's like some bad sugary-flavored drink.
1	1370649600	This is a sad representation of what coconut water really tastes like and what it can do for your health.  It may be a bit more expensive but drinking fresh coconut water straight out of a coconut is a delicious and wonderfully healthful experience.  This stuff is just processed, pasteurized, wanna-be coconut water.
4	1370649600	The only problem I have with coconut water is that the growers don't make very much of the huge profits that the bottling company charges and that the product is almost all water and is being shipped everywhere. Make this a powder drink and charge 1/5 the price and I would have this delivered on a monthly basis.
3	1370476800	While I love my strong, robust coffee flavors, with a hint of sweetness added, I realized I was drinking way too many sugary coffees packed up to the wazoo with artificial ingredients, (most of which I can't even pronounce). I'd been drinking the more popular flavors found in the supermarkets, like Mango & Chocolate, (which I love, by the way), & I saw that Zico has way more flavors than I thought. My first choice, of course, was the latte, and although, it isn't as strong as I like my coffee flavor, a bit watery, & has a slightly sour taste when you take the first sip, (hence the 3 stars), it's still very refreshing, and best of all, it has a very short list of ingredients that you can pronounce. Meaning your body can recognize most of them, and find them easier to break down. So, if you like coffee, and want a refreshing way to drink it during a workout, add it to a smoothie, or sip it throughout the day, I say give this a try.
5	1370476800	I love this flavor and brand of coconut water, but I cannot always find it in the store, so I order it from Amazon. When they do have it, it is cheaper to buy individually at the store.
3	1370476800	I guess it's good for coconut water. Was better than a different brand I tried. I just don't like the taste of it.
5	1370390400	I love this product.  I was able to get it on sale on Amazon which makes it better!  The sale only lasted for a couple of days so jump on it if you find it cheap!
3	1370390400	I found this product to be OK. This was the first time I had ever ordered Coconut Water and the taste was OK; Not something I would order again.I'm sure it is a good product, with all the benefits of coconut water, but healthy or not, I afraid I could never get use to the taste..However, I have since tried the Cocolife Coconut Water in the 'glass bottles' and it is absolutely 'delicious'! Not sure why the taste is so different, unless it's the plastic bottle or the age of the coconut from which the water is extracted. All I can say, if you get it in the glass bottles, you will never go back to the plastic.S. Claxton
5	1370304000	Now at first I will admit I was expecting maybe these would taste like coconut. I wonder if I would like it or not. Well as it turned out they do not have ANY coconut flavor in my honest opinion. They have a refreshing taste like nothing else. These are still espensive but they are cheaper than any others I have found. I would recommend them to anyone, but just don't be thinking they will taste like coconuts because they will not have coconut flavor. Just a unique flavor of their own.
5	1370217600	I have tried the Natural and the Chocolate flavors in the 33.8 oz tetra packs and really like both.They have a smooth flavor and very refreshing.Thirst quenching so its great if you are doing activity such as yard work etc.I did have a couple of issues with the containers.The glue holding the cap in place on some of the chocolate flavor cartons had loosened just enough to allow a small drip thus the water ruined.I notified amazon and it was credited back to me.I did order those from the warehouse deals.I only ordered the Natural flavor once and it was also from the warehouse deals and there no issue at all with those.This was not an amazon problem but defective packaging that wasn't caught by quality control during packaging.Overall this brand is about as good as it gets for coconut water.I did buy a plastic bottle at the local grocery store and didn't really care for it.I think the tetra packs retain the flavor much better and you tend to get a slight plastic taste from the plastic bottle.
5	1370131200	Fantastic source of potassium that works wonderfully with my recover protein shake. I will only use coconut water for all my recovery drinks.
5	1370044800	Tastes like chocolate milk, got the husband to drink this when he had one of his cravings. Does the trick :) I drink it bc I like it and its healthy. Really nice for a post workout beverage. Great pricing here as in comparison to our local grocery store. Zico is hands down my fav brand.
4	1370044800	Its good; but, I prefer the bottle version of Zico.  I also prefer the natural version over the flavored.  I like the convenience of the bottle over the Tetra.  Both good products though.  These are personal preferences.
2	1369872000	I've had fresh coconut water, taste nirvana and a few other coconut waters that were very delicious. This one is not one of them, maybe because it's from concentrate? That probably doesn't help.Anyways, don't buy this. There are several better alternatives
1	1369872000	I bought Vita through Lightning deal and love it. Regular price for Vita is a bit high. I was delighted to find a Zico coupon in Amazon.Then I bought a 6 large Zico. What a mistake I made. Its taste is super bad: overwhelmingly  plastic.  I almost spilled it out. The people who created the taste should be fired. Now, I am  stuck with 6 undrinkable coconut water.
1	1369785600	taste is most inferior compared to other products I've tried such as Vita , ONE and then this. Knowing taste can differ lot-lot notwithstanding, this one was the WORST. Tasted like medicine-water. I would not buy again. Sticking with ONE or VITA (depending on the sale price , watch out for good deals through the S&S option)
5	1369699200	This is the best size and the best bottle for coconut water. I don't know why, but it just tastes better in this bottle.ZICO is not extra sugary or sweet like some canned coconut waters. It is very smooth and pure tasting.
4	1369699200	Me and my husband love Zico. This is the best flavored coconut water out there. I would have given a 5 star rating but it's the seller that made me remove a star from the rating.We started a subscription on a monthly basis (5 per month) in January and back then the retail price was $18.50 and subscribed price was a dollar less. The more we kept getting, the higher the price became and now the retail price is more than $20.00. This is just outrageous as I now have to pay $10.00 more for the same stuff I have been getting !!I wish Amazon has some control measures over such sellers !!Would never buy anything from the seller again!
5	1369612800	I'm not picky eater or drinker for this matter.. and this coconut water tastes as good as any other.. or maybe better than some.they always get delivered on time.... what more can I ask for? :)
3	1369612800	I can not say that Im enjoying the taste of Zico coconut water. I will still drnk it due to its potassium, etc. Vita coconut water has a much better taste but again it must be all personal.The delivery was fast and the price was very reasonable though! The date was a couple months away from the expiry and may be that's why Zico was on a big sale.Overall, I'd suggest first tasting Zico coconut water before buying.
5	1369612800	I bought this through amazon warehouse. I love this brand of coconut water. Tastes delicious and its such a great deal compared to what you pay in the store.
5	1369526400	I don't write reviews very often unless I am truly impressed with a product and Zico Coconut Water, Latte impressed me! I tried it for the first time over the weekend when someone happened to have a bottle (it is not yet being sold in any stores in Ohio). The flavor was a full latte taste and totally refreshing! Their chocolate flavor has always been one of my favorites but I think the latte has surpassed it for my preference. Now it just has to become available in local stores!Well done Zico on another delightful flavor!
4	1369526400	This is the best pre-packaged young coconut water I have tried. It's great for upset stomachs.It tastes fresh, pure and delicious. It's slightly sweet, and slightly umami.It's kinda expensive tho...
5	1369526400	The best coconut water hands down! Clean and refreshing taste, reminds me of my trip to Thailand. Not too sweet and best served ice cold!
5	1369526400	I use this coconut water as the base for my green and fruit smoothies. I've also started mixing it (1:1) with orange juice for a nice creamsicle-ish morning drink.
5	1369440000	You know the leftover milk you have in the bowl after eating all of the Cocoa Krispies kernels? Well, this is essentially that milk pre bottled for you, and it is amazing.
5	1369353600	This is very delicious and very hydrating. I add it to smoothies or just drink it alone. I like this brand better than others I've tried since it doesn't have any additives but it of from concentrate
5	1369353600	I drink Zico as an electrolyte replacement when I work out. It is magic. I love it! Tastes best when drank cold, so make sure to keep it refrigerated.
5	1369267200	Coconut water is an acquired taste and I like the other zico products with the fruit flavors added.  Keeps the leg cramps down and is easy on the pocketbook.
5	1369180800	I love the chocolate coconut water-tastes like chocolate milk! It is pricey but I look at it as something similar to Gatorade.
5	1369180800	Top quality coconut water from a top-notch seller. I subscribe and save, getting one box a month-NEVER an issue! I highly suggest using this seller!
5	1369094400	This is by far the best tasting coconut water on the market today. It's the closest thing to drinking it right out of the coconut. I love the home delivery, it's reasonably priced and I don't have to cart it home.
5	1369094400	my dr recommended it for hydration and muscle cramps, feel refreshed after drinking it and take it to gym and yoga with me
1	1369008000	I'm from the islands so I love coconut water fresh the coconut tree. Why ruin a natural taste by making it choc. flavored. What's next Bacon flavored coconut water?! lmao!!!
5	1368921600	Before I start I have tried regular coconut water and I was kind of grossed out. When I friend recommended this I was beyond skeptical but her magic words were it taste just like chocolate milk. So on a whim I bought one and chilled it. Well I closed my  eyes and took a swig. The end result was and eye opening jaw dropping experience. This does taste like chocolate milk. The plus side is the lack of calories and potassium. Although pricey individually when bought by the case it is cheap.
4	1368921600	I been trying all 3 the last 2 weeks and personal preference Vita and Zico tasted nearly identical and O.N.E tasted closer to natural coconut.  Here are the comparisons in the Listings of the nutritional information for each which is critical if you are watching your sodium, carbs, sugar and caloric intake. Also included what juice from a 100% coconut nutritional information is for comparison purposes.----------PER 11.1 ounces------------ZICO-----  O.N.E.-----Vita ----- 100% Pure Coconut water60 --------  60 -------- 60 --------  62 Calories180mg*----  60mg ----- 45mg ----  344.6 Sodium16g*------  14g ------ 14g -------  12 Carbohydrates610mg----  660mg------ 620mg------  820.6 Potassium15g*------  11g ------- 15g -------  8 Sugars10%------  25mg------- 4%------  82 Magnesium0 ----------  0 --------- 100% ---  7.9 mg Vitamin C0 ----------  0 ---------  0 ---------  2.7 ProteinZico has the most sodium  and sugar content. Vita 16.9 ounce bottles show 11g of sugar but the 11.1 ounce bottles show 15g.My 2 favorites are O.N.E. and Vita, Zico also is very good I just do not like the high sodium count.  O.N.E. has a less sugar taste but more sodium but Vita has less sodium content but also tastes great both are EXCELLENT! Hope this helps out anyone who favors statistics and great taste Vita has a great taste and lower sodium. Loved the taste of Zico but I just do not like that high of sodium count for something I would enjoy that much it would be counter productive to my training. I still give it 4 stars it tastes that good.* Highest count
5	1368921600	Look forward to receiving it each month. I have been subscribed to this product for the past five years and devour it each time I receive it on autoship.
2	1368748800	When I received this item - all shipping boxes were ripped, torn, opened up, and beat up (including the box the water was in) .. awful shipping state.  I was so surprised that it did not taste too good.  Then, I saw "chocolate" on the bottle.  When ordering it, I did not realize it would be chocolate .. I guess I did not read further down (won't make that mistake again).  I will have to try other brands to compare .. I am not fond of this item - but need it for potassium.
5	1368748800	Zico is the best tasting coconut water in this price range around! I've tried every other brand and this one beats them all.
1	1368748800	Don't be fooled.  Zico is nothing like the coconut water its founder drank as a Peace Corp volunteer.  Zico is bottled cheap and dirty, reconstituted undoubtedly with local tap water - probably floridated, at that - and pumped full of  neurotoxins euphemistically cloaked as 'natural flavor.'  It's anything but 'natural.' If you haven't searched out the latest news on this dangerous, brain-damaging additive, brace yourself for some really bad news.  There's one simple reason why the FDA allows manufacturers to hide such poisins - duping the public makes money! Personally, I am looking for a quality CW product, at my doctor's urging.  One thing for sure, Zico is not it.
5	1368662400	Loved the taste and refreshed after a hard workout.Most Def recommend and will be purchasing again and trying the other flavors.
5	1368489600	What can you say, it's coconut water.  It's pure and natural.We drink it right from the container out of the fridge and also use it for a tasty cocktail mixer with Coconut flavored vodka.
2	1368230400	I love coconut water, but I was disappointed in this product. Everyone has their own taste, butthis coconut water didn't taste good (to me). Something was off.  It was several months before theexpiration date, but it still tasted odd. I will not purchase this brand again. I gave it 2 stars only becauseit is "100% coconut water" (no sugar added), otherwise, I'd have given it less.I prefer Vita Coco, which has a cleaner fresher taste.
2	1368144000	Received product which was going to expire in 2 months and the taste was not good. I tried the same product from Costco which had 6 months validity which taste way close to natural coconut water.
5	1367971200	After reading all these reviews, it is obvious that everyone likes something different.  I personally enjoy drinking Zico the best and I really don't like any other brand, but it seems that different brands get their coconut water from young coconuts and some from mature coconuts.  So, depending what you're looking for, and what you enjoy drinking, that's what you should buy.  The exception to this is that many brands claim to have water full of electrolytes for hydration.  It has been tested and shown that Zico actually stands up to what it claims on the bottle, while many other brands don't.  So if you care about this, I recommend Zico!
5	1367884800	Zico is by far the best tasting coconut water I've tried so far. I love ordering it by the case and the price is excellent.  This was my second case and I will order a third tomorrow.
3	1367884800	Zico is pretty average coconut water to me.  Co2 and Taste Nirvana are the best in my opinion.  If you like average, go for Zico!
3	1367798400	I have grown to love coconut water, and while nothing will beat water straight from the coconut, there are some brands that are close to replicating that flavor. Like the title says this has less of a coconut taste and more of a processed flavor and taste to it. It isn't disgusting or un drinkable, its just doesn't taste like it came from a coconut.I do love the resealable bottles. Other coco water distributors have a open one-and-done container. I really like the fact that I can sip it and close the bottle and have some in a few minutes. Maybe this is why it tastes different?3 stars for packaging, and a good effort on flavor.
5	1367798400	Really love the combo of coconut water and coffee that is dairy free. Being lactose intolerant usually makes coffee off limits but not with this one. The taste is awesome too and for 120 calories its kind of like a treat but nothing crazy. Will definitely have to put on subscription
5	1367798400	When it is kept cold it becomes creamier, more the sensation of feeling like drinking milk.  I gave up milk years ago.  This stuff ROCKS, I could drink it every day!  And it is good for my health!  Win-Win all around.
3	1367712000	I loved this coconut water because it's all natural and doesn't have any ingredients added to it.  I didn't like the bottle design because about the last 1 Tbsp of the water isn't able to come out due to the cap.  I had to cut the side in order to get it all out.  Other than the packaging I was very happy with the ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water
5	1367712000	Once I discovered the magic of coconut water, you should experience the same. Zico coconut water quickly rehydrates your body, either from being outside, playing sports or a bit too much alcohol.
4	1367625600	Zico chocolate coconut water tastes great. so we thought to try other flavors. Great for after workouts. Cheaper than going in store.

5	1367625600	Love the drink and this is the best price Ihave found! Glad you have the automatic monthly subscribe, makes it easier for me.
1	1367366400	I originally bought a case of this at a local warehouse store and was very pleased.I bought 2 more cases through Amazon and was NOT happy.1) The product was OLD. The case I had purchased several months previous at a local warehouse store had an expiration date of 10/2013. The stuff just shipped from Amazon has an expiration of 8/2013, two months earlier. I probably cannot use it all before then.2) One of the containers is not sealed properly and leaked. I cannot use the product from that container. Into the garbage.
5	1367366400	If you're the type of person who generally does NOT like coconut water (that's me), you should still try the Zico Chocolate Coconut Waters! I do high intensity cardio workouts, and after drinking one of these after a practice I felt my energy levels increase a little. My hands were less shaky and it was refreshing. To boot, it tastes like YOOHOO! Imagine that, healthy and yummy! Definitely try it, even if you are hesitant.
5	1367280000	ZICO is one of my favorite coconut water brands. All the right ingredients - coconut water. Got a couple of these six packs with great coupon and have been enjoying ever since. I use it in my protein shakes and smoothies or just to cut the sugar level in most juices for the kiddos while still getting them their potassium.Shipping was fast and free. Gotta love Amazon.
5	1367280000	So delicious. & LOVE these little packages. Perfect for the lunch box.  SO much healthier than chocolate milk, too.  Less sugar, less calories. win/win!
5	1367193600	I enjoy the flavor and there is not artificial ingredients or preservatives making it a perfect alternative to water, and neither have to worry about drinking sweet heavy drinks because it is also a great replacement for them.
5	1367020800	I only paid $19.7 for this , and it arrived in week and half, free shipping. And coconut water, as you know it, is nice. Also i was worried about its expiration but again, they last for next 4 months. I will be done drinking these in a month or less. Just loved it!!!
1	1367020800	there is something terribly wrong with this, it is super cloudy and it makes me naseated. I had finished a store bought tetra pack of coco libre a day before this came so I know i am not allergic to coconut water- there is something off with this Zico .
4	1366934400	This is my absolute FAVORITE flavored coconut water. It's perfect post workout and even as a snack or dessert when I'm wanting something sweet.
3	1366848000	Zico is pretty good coconut water.  I wasn't as impressed with the pineapple as I thought I'd be.  I will definitely try the other flavors like the mango.
4	1366848000	I enjoy the taste of this product, especially when well chilled. It satisfies a craving for sweet in a refreshing way and low in calories.  Bought the 12 pack which is cheaper per bottle than purchasing locally. Shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.
1	1366761600	I am thinking... &#34;wow... this is really sweet for just coconut water.&#34; Online it says it is PURE COCONUT WATER and that is all that is in the bottle. Well, when you get it, the label says it is from concentrate WITH &#34;natural flavor&#34;. Obviously they put SUGAR IN IT! What a fricking hoax!! The whole idea is to avoid sugar drinks!!! And from concentrate??? TERRIBLE! I hate companies like this that LIE to sell their product.
5	1366675200	As everyone knows, ZICO coconut water is already considered the most amazing form of beverage consumed by humans daily. Quite literally a refreshing wave sweeps through your internal organs with each and every sip. NOW, imagine this god-like beverage with a little KICK in it to get your day started, and you have quite possibly the most powerful all natural liquid known to man, right in your hands. THAT is what ZICO Latte is. Refreshing. Healthy.  Energy.Enjoy.
5	1366502400	From the places that have it to places where it hits the spot. Love drinking this version of coconut water. I otherwise will have to move near the tree itself.
1	1366502400	If you like Zico but have only purchased it in the cardboard cartons, don't expect these to taste the same.  Very plastic tasting.  Wonder if the packaging of these bottles resulted in plastic melting into the water.  I bought the pack of 12, but won't be drinking the rest.
5	1366329600	I enjoy this coconut water because it doesn't seem to be as sweet as some of the other brands. It's also a bit cheaper.
1	1366329600	The advertised &#34;pack of 6&#34; was not delivered. What I received was a brown cardboard box containing FIVE individual containers with lots of brown paper packing around them. I have purchased the six pack from Costco, so know what it looks like. I would very much like to know what happened to the sixth container and why the six pack was broken up and only five delivered in the larger box with paper packing.  I learned to love coconut water from my having lived in Southeast Asia and Hawaii, and was delighted to see it now available in such generous quantities. I would like to have an explanation as to what happened with this order. I don't hate the product, but I do hate this transaction.
1	1366329600	I hardly ever write reviews but feel the need to this time. I've been buying Zico coconut water in the 33.8 ounce containers at Costco whenever they have them and they tasted great. I figured the 14 ounce bottles would be the same so I ordered 3 cases from Amazon.  Unfortunately I was wrong and these seem totally different and taste terrible. On top of that, they are from concentrate and have a an additional ingredient named &#34;natural flavor&#34;.  I'm so pissed right now because I got 3 cases of this cr@p and have only managed to drink one bottle.  I was contemplating throwing them away but that would be a waste. Why can't you stay consistent Zico!?  Why change a formula that many people loved and produce something that people hate? Thankfully there are many choices available to consumers like me. I think it's time to find another company that makes better coconut juice and is more consistent with their product.
5	1366243200	This is my favorite flavor and I'm so glad you can get monthly shipments now. It tastes so similar to chocolate milk and it's a great treat after yoga. I have to limit myself to one a day.
5	1366243200	I am from Costa Rica. I grew up drinking coconut water (straight from the coconut) Since I moved to the US  I was not able to find a coconut drink that tasted natural. after trying a lot of brands i finally found the one that tastes more natural. now if i crave coconut water I always reach for ZICO!
5	1366156800	excellent product that tastes great refreshes and contributes to reenergizing one before and after exercise. Good anytime not just for exercise. A good alternative to sugary drinks for children too
5	1366070400	Always fresh tasting, just like drinking it out of the coconut!  Having grown up drinking coconut water right out of the coconut, I love the stuff.  But the coconut is not as easy to carry around as this is.  Same taste but much more convenient.  I like it so much I have a subscription from Amazon so I never run out.
3	1365811200	I ordered both the 33.8 oz Tetra Pack and the bottle 12 pack, thinking I can drink the big Tetra pack at home and bring a small bottle with me when I go to school. Bad decision. After I got my 14oz plastic bottles, I realize a difference between the labels on the plastic bottle and the tetra pack. The bottles labels "Coconut water FROM CONCENTRATE", and this really explains why I taste such a huuuuge difference in the two. I grew up drinking coconut water in asia, and I can tell right away whether the coconut water really taste like fresh from a green coconut. So, stay away from the bottle, get the tetra pack !!!
5	1365811200	Sure, it's from concentrate, but I find Zico in the plastic bottle tastes just like the real thing: a fresh Thai coconut.  The only caveat is that Zico needs to be chilled to as close to zero degrees Celcius as possible, or else it wouldn't taste as good.
5	1365724800	Being a golf professional I am outdoors and in the sun a large part of my day.  Zico has always been a part of my hydration regimen.  With the new latte it makes it easy to hydrate early as it provides a great substitute for coffee and get me on my way.  Great Job Zico!
5	1365638400	This product was delicious and easy to use but i prefer to use the coconut powder just for the packaging space.
1	1365638400	I ordered the Zico natural pack of 12 and liked just the packing of the bottles and nothing else. It has a very bad plastic taste, is made from concentrate and is no way near natural coconut water.
5	1365552000	I usually drink Zico a few times per week, mostly after a long weekend, rigorous activity, or when I'm just plain worn out.  I love the original natural Zico flavor, and usually get the big box version, which lasts in the fridge for a couple of days.  I have also tried their Zico Chocolate flavor, which is VERY delicious, and is sometimes my special treat, especially when I am having a chocolate craving.  I thoroughly enjoy the Zico coconut water beverage, and prefer it to many of the other 'imitation' coconut beverages out there.After trying the new Zico Latte flavor I was absolutely amazed!!! It is a healthy and refreshing alternative to a sugary flavored latte from your favorite espresso bar!  It's simply delicious!Try Zico and you'll really see the benefits of this healthy beverage!!![...]
5	1365552000	I love my latte's but after tasting ZICO latte flavor I was highly impressed. It was refreshing and delicious- its quenched my taste buds for a coffee drinks and is MUCH better for me! I have gotten all my friends hooked on it too! 5 thumbs ups...
1	1365465600	1 star for terrible taste, misleading photos of nutrition facts and of item.Probably the worst tasting coconut water I have ever had. All pictures show cartons but the actual products are bottles, which are apparently of inferior quality compared to the carton. Should have listened to the reviews!
5	1365379200	My husband has diabetes, and gets dehydrated a lot. You can tell if you're getting that way because you don't feel right; sort of surreal? He drinks this and it restores his bodies systems. Its great stuff and buying it this way is cheaper than in the store!
5	1365379200	A friend turned me onto coconut water about a year ago.  I was having really bad cramping during and after my long runs and bicycle rides.  I was at my wits end and about to go see a doctor to figure out what was wrong with my body.  My friend told me to try drinking coconut water after each workout.  I did and the cramping stopped within a day.  I was drinking all the potassium I needed and all the electrolytes my body needs.  I was sweating all the electrolytes out during my workout and not replenishing them, water is not enough.I discovered Zico chocolate and it has been my favorite ever since.  At $2.50 per bottle in the grocery store, if you can find it, that starts to add up.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it by the case and ordered 2!
4	1365292800	I have lived in Jamaica, so I know the delight of drinking fresh "jelly" water right out of the coconut early in the morning when it is still cool from the night. We have constantly looked for a suitable bottled/box version here in the United States. Most of the alternatives are nothing short of horrible, but we do like this Zico version. We order two cases a month through Amazon. While it will not taste exactly as it does right out of the coconut shell, Zico is the best alternative when that is not possible.
1	1365292800	tasted like dog feces, is the best way to describe it and could not feel my tongue afterward.. it felt missing
5	1365292800	I love coconut water and was quite pleased with my old brand (98% coconut water, no pulp, no sugar added) but when I tasted this, I was immediately hooked.  Because it's 100% coconut water, no sugar added and not from concentrate (tetra packs), it tastes so good.  I don't mind pulp, but I like the ease of not having to strain the water to give to my finicky toddler.  There is no pulp in this particular Zico Natural Coconut Water 6 pack.The 2% does make a difference.  I didn't even know my old brand was not 100% until I tasted how good and better Zico was.  I then grabbed a container of my old brand and read the ingredients.  I was surprised that I was paying for 2% water in each container.I periodically buy coconuts from a local, natural food store so I am familiar with what virgin coconut water should taste like.  I appreciate that processing of Zico Natural flavor seems minimal.  It feels like it's hydrating the moment I swallow it, whether room temperature or cold, just like the coconuts I 'tap' myself.Zico Natural flavor tastes so good, expensive though.  I search for sales at Amazon and my local grocery stores, then stock up!Hope this helps.
5	1365206400	I am not much for the hype of these things, I just like them for the electrolytes without the extra sugar. I don't like drinking sugary drinks, but I get bored with just water so these do the trick. All the major brands taste about the same when it comes to pure coconut flavor as far as I am concerned.
3	1365120000	I grew up in Southeast Asia and I remember the coconut water I used to drink tasted much sweeter and had a fragrant taste. Zico tasted pretty bland. I had Vita Coco and it isn't any better.Well if you can afford it, it's probably a lot healthier serving this to your kids than soda. I'd rather drink water or OJ.
5	1365120000	I bought this because it was a better price than the other coconut waters and I'm not disappointed in my purchase at all.
1	1364947200	I only received 5 out of 6 containers! To say the least I am very disappointed with this purchase! I will never order this product again on here!
5	1364774400	I tried many different ones: they either not tasty or loaded with sugar. This water has 5% of your daily sugars (15 grams). I drink it once a day as a treat after exercise.
5	1364688000	The following should not be construed as medical advice, nor is this a "paid political announcement".  This regimen just works for me.  I've been on blood pressure medication for years, although I'm not sure that what I take is "safe and effective", due to any long term toxic effects upon my excretory organs.  I've spent a considerable amount of web-time reading about blood pressure reducing foods and other things that should reduce my B.P. readings.  I prefer to reduce my B.P. through foods and activities, not drugs.  When I take my B.P. readings at home, I look for "trends" and not at individual readings.Drinking coconut water, along with my other activities, has significantly reduced my B.P. readings.  For me, probably the single most important nutrient is potassium (from food, not supplements).  Coconut water, potatoes, orange juice, and bananas are all great sources of this element.  Lately, some of my systolic/diastolic readings on my machine have been in the "green" zone (equal to or less than 120/80).Besides drinking coconut water, I'll briefly describe what I do, since this regimen lowers my B.P. better than any single isolated item listed in this review.  I work out almost every day at the gym.  I consume foods and drinks containing diuretics and I eat foods that naturally reduce B.P.  I've never liked to take drugs (unless required by my Internist), although I've found the following foods helpful to my cause:  green tea, dried cranberries, high fiber foods (the high fiber diet "pushes" everything through the G.I. tract faster, so less of the "bad stuff" is absorbed in the lower intestine), the U.S. D.A.S.H. diet and higher levels of potassium (coconut water, etc.) with a concomitant reduction in sodium.  Note: many processed foods are very high in sodium chloride (salt).I only rate items on Amazon, which invoke a passion within me.  Foods high in potassium (an 8 oz. serving of "Zico" has 14% of an individuals' R.D.A. (% daily value - according to the nutritional label) are one of those passions.Update:  As a scientist, I was trained to report facts and to disregard my personal opinions, since in my position, I could always be subjected to legal action on products that I analyzed, even years after my analysis was performed.  Consequently, my career was based upon facts, that could be introduced into a court room setting.Fact:  My sister is dying from the effects of high pressure:  high pressure followed by kidney failure followed by kidney dialysis two to three times a week.  Yes, family genetics are often a contributing factor to high blood pressure.  Yet, of all of the factors a person can control, diet and exercise are at the top of the list.  I continue to consume Zico Water, although I've discovered that two other foods sold by Amazon are just as important: orange juice (not orange drink) and low sodium V-8 juice.  Both of these juices are high in potassium.Why am I spending my time writing this review?  My blood pressure numbers (systolic and diastolic) have been significantly reduced, all without the use of blood pressure reducing drugs.  I truly believe that diet is one variable, where an individual can control their own destiny.  Drugs may do the above, although drugs have long term side effects.  Lastly, your Internist may suggest drug usage (take the drug that your Internist recommends), but remember that your overall health and well-being is of paramount importance to you, not to other people.  Thanks for reading my review, as the above concerns come from my heart (no pun intended).
5	1364688000	I love mixing the chocolate coconut water with Pure Protein and a little bit of black coffee...great for after a workout!
1	1364515200	I couldn't even chug this down. To be completely honest, it tastes like urine. Not anywhere near any coconut flavor. I bought these to hydrate with when drinking alcohol, but I don't even think I could drink it while being highly intoxicated!
5	1364342400	I love coconut water and have no problems with this brand ever.  Except when it comes in the plastic bottle, then it tastes bad, but the tetra packs are always fine and this is the best price anywhere.  I've tried others but this is my go-to option when I want coconut water that's worth my money.
5	1364256000	Bought this for myself, but only got 3 bottles, because my wife took the other 3 for herself, guess I'll have to buy 2 cases next time.
5	1364256000	I tried both brands, but I like the taste of zico.  Fells more fresh.  It used to be quite expensive than others.
1	1364169600	This is the most disgusting coconut water I've ever had. It is brown, and tastes rotted. I buy the &#34;ONE&#34; brand as well, and that one comes out of the package a clear color with very slightly white tint. If you pour a glass of this next to the other one, the difference is shocking. Zico's is a very noticeable brown color and tastes of rotting plant material.I called amazon about the first package I received, and they sent me a new one - also brown and disgusting. I will not buy any more of this. EVER.
5	1364083200	Spoke with the founder in California. Great idea, great product, great taste! Ordered on subscription so it shows up once a month. Perfect.
4	1364083200	I'm no coconut water connoisseur, but I've had a few different brands and find they all taste pretty much the same.  I enjoyed these and will reorder if they go on sale again.
5	1363996800	I love this coconut water! It tastes great and makes me feel great! It's a must have if you're into health. I like the tetra packs as they are quick and easy.
5	1363564800	Received item on time as described. This is my first Zico water and will definitely be ordering more. I recommend!
2	1363564800	it has too much sugar.  .  . . . . . .. . . . ........... . ............. . .
4	1363478400	so far it is meeting expectations and making my 80+ year old dad feel better from some of his aches and pains
4	1363305600	Zico is a great coconut water but, it has 14 grams of sugar not mentioned in the advertisement.  So, beware if you think this one is better than the others brands.  To me it taste the same and not any superior than the other brands, except this one is a higher price.
5	1363305600	This was a GREAT bargain for this product, versus retail and versus other online order offers.With Prime, I had this here the next day (and it was only supposed to come 2-day)for no charge.This, to my family, is not a refreshment but a medicinal aid: Both my father and I suffer severe (and all too often, debilitating) potassium depletions, and this is the fastest way to get the most potassium replacement loaded into your system when you feel the onset (or when you're in the throes of an attack).Regardless of your need or favor for this product, if you like it and want it, this is the way to buy it.
4	1363305600	A tasty option if you don't want plain water. Great for hydration without a bad aftertaste. Best if taken when chilled.
1	1363219200	You're lying down on a beach staring at the fluffy clouds in the bright blue sky.  You can feel the sand form around you a little, like a comfortable warm bed.  You can hear the ocean as it splashes the shore and smell the fresh sea air while the sounds of sea gull flying overhead help soothe and calm you...THEN OUTTA FREAKING NOWHERE SOME JACKASS WITH A MOUTH FULL OF PINEAPPLE STANDS OVER YOU AND STARTS DROOLING IN YOUR FREAKING MOUTH!!That's what this Pineapple Zico is like.
5	1362960000	I'm so glad I found this on Warehouse Deals! The cost came out to be cheaper than what we pay at Trader Joe's (our usual source for Zico), plus free shipping to our door! Nice :)Zico definitely tastes better chilled. It has a mild flavor with a tinge of sweetness, but bear in mind it does not have any added sweetener. It is all natural! It's very different than those ones you can usually find at the asian markets that have added sweeteners.  We've tried other all natural coconut water brands (o.n.e., Naked, etc.), and to be honest, I don't notice a HUGE difference. I usually buy whichever brand happens to be on sale or less expensive.Coco water, as I like to call it, is such an excellent hydrator for your body that we brought some with us to the hospital when I was in labor. Rather than drinking plain water I had coconut water to replenish lost fluids and to give me a small energy boost. I also brought some to my mom when she was recovering from surgery. You can even add it to baby food purees or your own smoothies!
5	1362873600	I recently lost 91 lbs juicing after watching Fat Sick and nearly Dead and Zico coconut water played an important part in my weight loss. Not only is the taste great in these tera packs (strangely better than the plastic bottles!) but the electrolytes enabled me to work out in the gym while only drinking juicing. I've got a few of my friends hooked on them now as well!
5	1362873600	To me, this is the best alternative Tim Gatorade and other drinks,  I drink it all summer to stay hydrated,
5	1362700800	We keep coconut water in our house for a couple reasons.1. We have young kids in the house so stomach bugs happen - coconut water is a great healthy way to get electrolytes back without all the yucky artificial flavors and dyes that are in pedialyte.2. It is sweet without added sugars - kids love it so it is very hydrating in the summer and on long road trips.I have never tried the other flavors, but I have tried several different brands of plain coconut water. This one does not have pulp in it, which my kids prefer as the pulp can be a little slimy. This is also shelf stable, so it is a nice alternative to plastic water bottles for use in a pinch.
5	1362700800	This coconut water tastes pretty good. I like it a lot. I did want to try another brand and pretty much what I did was spit it out! I tried &#34;Vita Coco&#34; and it was just gross. Zico to me is refreshing and tasty after it's been refrigerated. I can drink a lot of it and I know it's good for me. I'm sticking with this brand from now on.
1	1362441600	I REALLY disliked this coconut water.  The pineapple flavor was sweet and dull and amplified the effect that I still am trying to get used to about coconut water: that it tastes warm even when it's cold.  Plus, for some reason, I felt like it all tasted like the bottle it came in.  I will never order this brand again.
5	1362441600	Has zero sugar and I like coconut water with zero sugar. Most of the coconut water out there are loaded with sugar. They may taste good but benefit of coconut water is ruined with sugar. I wish it would cost less.
5	1362355200	This brand, so far, is the only brand I can find that makes chocolate flavor.  When chilled, it tastes just like chocolate milk.
5	1362009600	ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water is great. It tastes just like fresh coconut that I've had in the Caribbean. The 14oz bottle is a great size.
5	1362009600	I love coconut water and this product tasted just like fresh coconut water. I read some of the negative reviews and most seem to be around 2010. I don't know if this company had a different product then. From what I read it looks like they tried to package a product made from concentrate. The case of 1 litre paks that I got show the only ingredient as  100% natural coconut water and to me it tastes like fresh coconut water. On the box, there is an expiration date and it is also printed on the top of each tetra Pak. I wonder if some people have gotten expired products and and hence the negative reviews. I did not detect any off-flavors or after-tastes as some people have reported, just the taste I remember from my visits to Acapulco. My only problem is that I cannot drink only 8 oz at a time. Before I know it, I've finished the full 1 litre Tetra Pak and they are not cheap.
5	1362009600	My Mom has Alzheimer's and she doesn't want water.  So when her doctor said she wasn't getting enough liquid I wanted to find an alternative.  I tried sports drinks but she didn't seem to care much for them either and I was worried about the amount of sugar.  A friend gave her some coconut water while we were visiting and she seemed to drink all of it.  She has been drinking it almost every day and I feel like she is getting nutrition she was low on because she doesn't like to eat much.  I feel this has been a life saver for her and me.
2	1361664000	Really the chocolate flavor is kind of gross and there are little particles of stuff floating around in the liquid. Gross
4	1361664000	This has good flavor, is a good value for the money and is so very healthy.  I love coconut water and have tried many brands.  This one is great.
5	1361664000	just what i wanted .  arrived quickly. packed well . great flavor and great price. will order more. Chocolate is awesome.
1	1361664000	I've tried vita coco and o.n.e. and zico is by far the least tasty of the 3; it has an odd after taste that had me dumping out the rest.  I was quite dissapointedOf the 3... Vita Coco and O.N.E. are the best and pretty comparable... no weird after taste and very refreshing!
5	1361404800	Perfect size for hydrating during a tennis match. I generally get a lot of leg cramps but drinking the coconut water helps to prevent that.
4	1361318400	I'm sure this has been a reoccurring problem but the seller hasn't fixed it yet. When I received my product, the box was wet. And since the coconut water was shipping with another item I purchased, the other item got wet too. One of the coconut water bottles broke by the lip of the bottle. The part where you pour was broken off completely. Seriously, this isn't the UPS guy's problem, it's the packaging problem. The poor guy doesn't even know what's in there so it's up to the seller to put more padding in the box before shipping it off.Other than that, the coconut water is great. I choose this brand over Vita Coco because Vita Coco has added ingredients in there. I'm anti-added-sugars so I am very picky about drinks and food. I recommend drinking it cold with a straw :) and imagining you are on a beach. To me, it really tastes better when you drink it through a straw rather than sipping it straight from the cup
5	1361232000	i love this product! now i can buy this from my hometown local store. i buy this about 40 of them at once only last a month for me! love the taste! pure! love it!!!!
5	1361145600	My sister turned me on to these and I love it! Tastes so much better than other brands I've tried.
5	1361145600	I got addicted to coconut water a couple of months ago after I had some issues with my legs and feet cramping up during workouts.  The potassium from this has helped a lot and the taste is really refreshing, once you get used to it.  Zico has been my favorite so far and I have successfully converted several others to start drinking it.  Try the chocolate flavor when you're ready for something different, it tastes just like yohoo!
3	1361145600	Love zico coconut water (chocolate) I do prefer it in the tetra packs, the bottles have an odd plastic after-taste.  I have switch to the tetra's exclusively now that it is at my local Target and Cub foods.
5	1360972800	Bought this after all the good reviews. Can't stop drinking it. Thank goodness that it comes to my door step every month.
1	1360800000	i bought a case of these thinking that it was 100% FRESH coconut water, as i had known it to be, but once i received it and tried it, i noticed it tasted different.  i looked on the ingredients and what do i see?  it reads &#34;FROM CONCENTRATE&#34; and &#34;NATURAL FLAVOR&#34; ADDED!  WTF???  this is not the same zico i'd been used to and had fallen in love with.  then i read the reviews others had posted and, yep, the company got sold and now the new owner (probably some scumbag multinational) decided to eff with the ingredients.  now the zico that i had loved all this time is no more..  sucks.
1	1360713600	4 of the 6 bottles were ruptured.  How do you get a refund for a problem like this?  Apparently the caps on top of the bottles rip off quite easily.  Might be a good product, just not safe for shipping.
5	1360713600	I was first impressed because I received my order so quickly; and I must say the Zico was off the chain!  I really loved it and I am preparing to order more and will become a regular customer.  I believe anyone who orders this product will not be disappointed; congrats to Zico, we have a winner!
3	1360627200	I realized I prefer the taste of Vita Coco.  It might be because Zico is from concentrate and Vita Coco isn't.
1	1360627200	this was busted and showed up to my door in a soaking wet box and busted open, no option to return
1	1360281600	WOW - this stuff tastes really bad, almost to the point of being undrinkable.For anyone thinking would have the flavor of coconut juice, but not as thick - WRONG!  It has an unpleasant odor when you open the bottle, tastes bad and leaves an unwanted aftertaste.  Drink it ice cold and it's marginally better, but still nasty.
5	1360281600	I understand that coconut water is not for everyone.  For me, the taste is amazing, and it's the most drinkable liquid I know - I can chug a quart.  But I know that some people don't like the taste.All I can say is that as someone who does love coconut water, I think Zico is SO MUCH BETTER than vita coco.  I really love Zico and would drink it more if it were just a bit less expensive.  Amazon pricing helps.  As it is, I drink a about a liter per day.
4	1360195200	Tastes nuttier than Vita Coco. I usually drink it before I go to bed after a night of boozing and drink one in the morning.  No hang overs.
5	1360195200	this product quenches your thirst  it also seems to lessen the appetite or snacking desire.  Test is hard to explain but is easy to accept.  This is worth the try
5	1360108800	Great product and experience. One of the best coconut waters that exists. Great refreshing taste. Perfect balance of hydration and flavor!!
5	1359936000	Great new flavor from Zico! Good coffee flavor but not overpowering the coconut water! The creaminess of the coconut cream balances the coffee and coconut water! Energy boost too!!! WOW
4	1359849600	It is probably just nuts from a different country, but it is just naturally a bit sweet for my taste.
5	1359417600	Our daughter told us about this water. She said it was especially good after a night of drinking because it is very hydrating. The chocolate one is the best one. I definitely recommend this in the chocolate.
1	1359331200	i would not recommend this product to anyone. i thought the taste was horrible. my question is does all coconut water taste like this or is it this brand?
5	1359331200	I love this coconut water......however the shipping is hrrible, i never received my order 2 months in a row, the first month you gave me a refund and the second month you shipped out a complimentary order via fed-ex overnight.  The original shipping was fed-ex smart post and my post office has had many issues with this shipping arrangement.  I cancelled my subscibe and save because of the shipping which is a shame because I really like counting on getting my coconut water. Very dissatisfied with the shipping option!!!!
1	1359331200	I HATE THE TASTE OF ZICO COCONUT WATER. ITS VERY NASTY TASTE . I DONT  LIKE TO ORDER THAT  ANYMORE !!
1	1359244800	Regular Zico coconut water usually tastes great, but this Latte flavor simply has a horrible taste and this is honestly the worst purchase I've made on Amazon in a while, even with a discount coupon. I don't even know how to describe the taste past that it's not something that I feel anyone would enjoy. I'm never buying this stuff again and I don't recommend it to anyone.
5	1359072000	I enjoy this product for not only the reasonable cost compared to other coconut waters on the market currently but also that they DO NOT pasteurize it! Keeping the product in its natural state saves & imbibes the purchaser with all the lovely compounds that make coconut water so nutritious!
1	1359072000	I don't write many product reviews, but this one struck a nerve.  I love coconut water.  And I've lived in Thailand for many years where it's a common drink so I'm pretty familiar with it.I was fooled by the fancy packaging of 'Zico'.  This product is horrible.  It has a distinctive plastic taste.  I am not kidding.  Further, it uses plastic #7, which means it is full of harmful BPA's. I ordered about 48 different bottles in 4 different flavors.  I have to throw it out.Beyond the plastic, this stuff isn't even pure coconut water.  It's from concentrate, then they add more stuff to it.Horrible horrible stuff.  I'd recommend only buying 100% coconut water, period.  There's plenty of options.
5	1358899200	Wish it was less expensive, I would buy it by the case!  Healthy & tasty. Hoping they will bring the price per case down because this drink is addictive :-)
5	1358899200	I have tested the O.N.E, Vita Coco and this ZICO. I prefer this product over the others for price and taste.The O.N.E tasted salty to me. So far I have received two shipments of 33.8os 6 packs and have no issues to report. They were very well packed. I have learned that a good price for coconut water is about 14cents an ounce as of January 2013.
5	1358899200	I'd been looking for an affordable way to obtain coconut water. I like the environmental friendly packaging. Maybe it's not as friendly as a coconut but it is way more convenient.
5	1358726400	Tastes good and I feel replenished when drinking it after a workout.  I have tasted 2 other brands and Zico tastes the best.
4	1358640000	Zico uses old coconuts instead of the young ones. The young coconut has a more aromatic and sweeter taste. I prefer drinking from a young coconut but Zico coconut water is fine since I do not enjoy cracking coconuts. Do not drink a lot, otherwise you will get diarrhea.
1	1358553600	This stuff is just plain nasty and disgusting. I dont know what else to say about it. It's not coconut water... It tastes like liquified corn tortillas mixed with plastic.
5	1358380800	This is pure coconut water. I can't stress how much different it is compared to other brands. I ONLY BUY zico cocnut waters.I tried this one knock off brand call vita coco and it tasted like water from the toilet which i never tasted before obviously
1	1358294400	I ordered this 6 pack a few weeks ago and received it 2 weeks ago. The expiration date is may 2013 so i thought it would be fine but once we opened up the first bottle it had an odd taste and smell. We passed it off as nothing but my boyfriend and I have had the runs since  then because he's been drinking it thinking it was nothing....I went to my friend's house and tried her bottle from Trader's Joes and it had an expiration date September 2013 but didn't have the same taste or smell. I wish I can get a refund, I'm telling my boyfriend not to drink anymore and tossing the rest. I hope the other packages aren't similar to what I got and to think I was going to purchase monthly. Sad....
5	1358294400	FIrst off, I HATE coconut water. It gags me. It is nasty and terrible. BUT it is good for you. This one is nothing like coconut water to me. It is actually delicious. Drink it ice cold and it is amazing. A lot like soy chocolate milk but it has tons of potassium so its great for me. I order this by the case when its in stock because it saves me money and makes my tummy happy.
5	1357603200	This is the best tasting coconut water on the market, I could drink gallons of it. It is reasonably priced, you actually save money ordering it online. I highly recommend this product. I love it!!
4	1357516800	This coconut water is one of my favorites.  The taste is sweet and clean.  I'd recommend it to any coconut water lover.
4	1357516800	Have not tasted other brands but this was sweet but not overly sweet. Tastes nice chilled and is healthy. For the right price, I will buy more.
4	1357430400	Since I give it to my dog, I'm not sure how I would like it.  The dogs love it.  I give it because one dog has a heart problem and must take lasix.  The coconut water replaces the vital minerals that lasix removes from her body.
5	1357257600	trader joe's sells them individually for slightly less - if there is one around your area... head on over there!
4	1356825600	If you like coconut water, then this is really good. It's as delicious as coconut water always is. If coconut water is not your thing, then you won't like it. IMO, it's a little expensive and I'd rather get the coconut water fresh from the source, but considering what a pain it is to try and open a coconut every time, this is not a bad alternative.
5	1356739200	I've tried all of the coco waters, and I like this one the best and it's all natural.  Good price for the size as well.
5	1356652800	This is one of the most amazing products it's 100% natural is great for your skin and hair and it also tastes good as well.
1	1356566400	I guess I should have tried a bottle locally before buying a case. The consistency and flavor were awful. Not sure if this is what they all taste like but I will stick to my drink packets...
5	1356134400	I love Zico coconut water- it's delicious and it definitely helps me rehydrate after a workout or a night out.
3	1355788800	Earlier in the year we received a few shipments of the Zico coconut water because we loved it! Then suddenly, the chocolate was not available anywhere. I sent an email to the company asking what had happened and no reply. Then a few months later, it is back on the shelves. We were so happy! I got a new bottle and brought it home to compare it to the old bottle. This is not the same product that they first sold. The new product tastes good but the old one was SO much better. My husband and I tasted both and agreed that we liked the old one more.  I have one bottle of each and will put the new nutrition facts first/ then the old so you can see how the new one doesn't have as many vitamins and minerals as the old. All in grams or mg.Calories 120/110fat 2/2sodium 140/160Carbs 24/23sugars 20/18protein 1/1vitamin A 0/8calcium 4/6phosphorus 2/7iron 6/13magnesium 10/16potassium 600/680So, as you can see, some of the numbers are close but they did change. The new one is still good but I don't think we will be buying it very often. The old one had more of a chocolate milk taste (less sugar, more taste!) and since I don't drink dairy, I loved it. The new one has a slight aftertaste of coconut water so if you don't mind that, I am sure you will like it.
4	1355788800	I feel that O.N.E. coconut water is the better product. Mango is the best flavored coconut water in my opinion beating out the pink guava
5	1355616000	Amazing as always. Just make sure you buy this kind over the watered down concentrate version zico has put out there.
5	1355529600	I love getting great coconut water at a discount and on time every month! Subscribe and Save rocks! Zico water is tasty and the containers are environmentally friendly.
5	1355529600	Very light flavor.  Great drink for replenishing while exercising.  I have this one on subscribe and save because I use it with every workout.
5	1355529600	I had a pack. If you drink it all the time, it's so convenient to buy it on-line. jj j
5	1355443200	Coconut water was an acquired taste for me.  My daughter likes these too.  They are expensive so I only buy them when they are on sale.  I've packed these on hiking and kayak trips instead of regular water.  I like the bottles they are packaged in.  They do take a little bit of extra effort to open though.  After tearing off the plastic around the cap and removing the cap....there is another seal under the cap that needs removed.  Once the bottle has been opened, it needs to be stored upright or it will leak - the caps don't seal very well on the open bottles.
5	1355443200	I'm not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews, but I found the taste of this product to be excellent.  About the same as the other coconut water drinks.Packaging was good, and there was no leakage or other problems.
5	1355443200	This is really delicious.  They are wonderful to drink, easy to carry around, and very fulfilling to having after a good workout.
5	1355356800	Love the taste...love this product. Reorder over and over.It is refreshing...and curbs your appetite when you are really thirsty and not hungry.Different taste in the box...UGH!Get the bottle.
3	1355097600	I really like the other brand better - Vita Coco.  This I had to try because it was cheaper, but I didn't like the taste as much as Vita Coco.  Not sure why, its supposed to just be Coco Water only...  shouldn't it all taste the same?
5	1355011200	A ton of coconut water, fo so cheap. One of my favorite bands, came well packaged in this shipment! Get it.
5	1354838400	I was a champion of pineapple-fused versions when I drank another brand, but I learned that brand didn't have the potassium levels it claimed.  Switching to Zico, I didn't like their pineapple blend.  I then ran down all the others until I landed reluctantly at chocolate.  What a fun drink it is.  It doesn't have much of a coconut flavor, and instead may be the healthiest chocolate milk out there.EDIT: One fault I have is actually with Amazon and not Zico.  I have gotten shipments where the box looks like it rolled down a hill.  What they have done sometimes is just throw 2-3 of these packs into a large box and tossed in a air pack.  The Zico boxes end up rolling around in the larger box like some sort of cardboard rock-tumbler.  I'm ordering two boxes now, and expect them to arrive looking like they were air-dropped like a UN care package.It would probably be better to put them in smaller boxes, or better (and maybe environmentally smarter), just put plain brown (recycled) wrapping around the Zico box, which by itself is pretty sturdy.UPDATE: Just got my two boxes, and they arrived in a single, appropriately-sized box, and not looking like they were launched from a trebuchet at my front door.  Looks like Amazon may be getting the hang of this grocery thing.PRO-TIP: If you like and drink a few bottles a week, it's worth ordering two boxes at a time.  I can't gurentee this, but so far my expire dates have been at least 4-6mos out.  This gives you plenty on hand and free shipping.
5	1354492800	ZICO Coconut water tasted very good.It has no preservatives or other chemicals in it, which is important.It also is not in an aluminum container (because if ingested, aluminum causes Alzheimer's) which is safer because there is no aluminum to seep into the coconut as can happen if was an aluminum container.I called ZICO (they have their number on the bottles), and they answered all my questions very well.I would recommend ZICO Coconut water  to everyone.
5	1354406400	I add this product to my smoothies, makes them taste great and gives additional nutrients. Tastes refreshing when cold as a drink as well.
5	1354406400	I'm a huge fan of coconut water. I really love the natural coconut water taste the most, but I love trying new things. I saw this at my local cvs, seeing that there was a note posted that they were about to rid of this from their store, I bought one. I have tried metromint chocolate water which I thought that was good, BUT this was even better. Chocolate Zico Coconut water is really good. I wish that the product was a little more inexpensive, but it's definitely a great once in a while treat for me. :)
3	1354233600	Most of the bottles I received had broken stems and had leaked into the box (the bottom actually broke when I picked it up). Amazon needs to ship these in stronger boxes, for one. Also, there was only one little bubble wrap and it popped from the weight of the package.That said, I got a new package and the water is okay. It has a distinct chemical smell in my opinion, especially when you smell it in the Tetrapak. Taste is okay, much more similar to a coconut. The smell is definitely off-putting though.
5	1353974400	I drink this before and after a workout. It keeps me fueled and energized in a healthy way. Also, if I ever feel a headache coming on this is the best way to stop it without taking any meds. Worth every penny. Tastes great!
5	1353888000	The best this actually keeps you so hydrated for a long period of time. I love this brand of coconut water and its so good for you!
2	1353801600	Bought the ZICO Coconut Water 33.8oz(pack of 6) while it was on-sale for $17.52(was about 2 months from expiry date).ZICO does not taste like real coconut water and am disappointed with it. I have tried ZICO in the past and it was alright but lately it seems to leave an odd taste in the mouth.Buy if its on sale and if the expiry date is more than 6 months otherwise give this a pass.
5	1353283200	I am addicted to coconut water. I particularly like this brand in this package because it's pure, unadulterated coconut water and the subscribe and save price on Amazon is very reasonable. I've seen Zico in these exact packages in stores for a lot more. You may find it for a penny or two less per ounce at a certain specialty grocery chain, but it's a pain to buy and lug home since it's so heavy. You can subscribe and save on Amazon and get it delivered for free with Prime, so it's really a great deal and very convenient.
1	1353110400	Zico is made from concentrate & you can taste it.  It's like comparing fresh squeezed orange juice and oj from concentrate....there's no comparison.  There are other coconut waters on the market that are 100% natural not from concentrate and they taste so much better.  Do yourself a favor and pass on Zico.
5	1353110400	Not everyone will like the taste, but I like just about anything coconut and really like this product.  The flavored Zico's are even better, but of course they have added ingredients that I try to stay away from, so I stick with the unflavored.
1	1352764800	When I received the 6 pack the stem of the bottles were broken and leaked all over the box and made it smell like rotten fruit.
5	1352592000	Fresh flavor (not like canned) and great price! What more can I say? Too many words required for a simple explanation?
5	1352419200	I have waited to review this until I had worked through three or four shipments of the product. I have found the quality and taste to be excellent and of consistent quality. I also order the Vita Coco with pineapple flavor just to give me another taste option (that product is consistently good as well). Be sure to order the Tetra Pak, the plastic bottles have a very different, off-putting taste. Great hydration in these. Consider slamming one every morning when you first get up. Enjoy!
5	1352160000	Delicious. Best Coconut Water ever! Being able to get this coconut water for less than $2.50 a bottle is even better.
3	1351728000	Purchase/Shipping: Although discounted from regular MSRP, this case of Zico Coconut Water was still about 15-25 percent above local prices of the same product where I reside. Nonetheless, it is one of only a few brands of coconut water that can be shipped to APO addresses. This detail alone prompted me to purchase this product. After purchase, my one case of Zico coconut water arrived at my APO address in eight (8) days after purchase. The item was packaged in a box with appropriate air pillows for extra protection. No damage was found on the shipment upon arrival.Product: This product, in my opinion, is not the best coconut water I have tried. I prefer most brands that contain pure coconut water that contain no additives. Zico is mediocre at best.Zico is made from concentrate with "natural" flavoring added. For those who are not aware, that is a technical term for flavors that are extracted from nature and are altered in a laboratory environment in order to enhance the overall taste of the product. The flavor is continuously altered until the final product is one that stimulates the palate of the targeted consumer and is therefore acceptable. The "natural flavor" that has been added tastes quite different from other competitive brands in the market. The product, in my opinion, has a similar consistency to skim milk and leaves an aftertaste that tends to create the want to consume more.The packaging is made of a sturdy plastic bottle that containes both an external plastic seal and one located at the mouth of the bottle once the lid has been unscrewed. I do prefer Zico's packaging compared to other coconut water brands that are bottled in tetra-paks and aluminum cans. The 14-ounce bottles can take more abuse if carried around during excursions outdoors.Overall, Zico is a mediocre coconut water brand that is neither terrible nor terrific. Since it is one of only a few brands that ship to APO addresses this is what I am forced to consume. However, if you reside somewhere where a variety of the industry's products are available, go with another brand.
1	1351641600	I don't particularly like the taste of coconut water, but I use it in my protein shakes for extra hydration and minerals instead of water.  If you want to take these individual servings with you, beware...  There were NO STRAWS attached to the drinks, nor were they in the box.  Not sure how you are expected to drink from it.  Heads up!
1	1351468800	I have been drinking vita coco for the last few years and after reading several 5 star reviews on this zico product, I decided to give this brand a try..)I grew up in the Dominic Republic, and have lived in the Philippines, so I know what good coconut water tastes like. I am also a fan of south east Asian coconut water, which has a subtly different more mature taste - not as sweet as Brazilian or Dominican republic nuts coconuts, which I actually like (I prefer less beverages that are less sweet)).I took one sip of the zico and that was all i could take (actually I had to spit out that one sip!) I found that it was watered down, sour, and had an off color. And produced in Thailand where all the other sugary coconut waters are produced. I investigated and found out that coca cola owns zico (and when was the last time coca cola produced a high quality natural fruit juice?) I also found that half of zico's products are from concentrate, so perhaps this one is too, but just not correctly labeled?Now, back to the "5 star reviews" I had read on this product. When I click on all those 5 star reviews, the positive zico review is usually the ONLY review of the reviewer! This leads me to believe that they are all totally bogus and shameless ploys of zico to promote their product. If it's a poor product, consumers should know. And only consumers should vote on products. Take a look and see for yourselves. If you deduct all those 5 star reviews, you are left with a 1 star review, which is what I am giving this product.
5	1351123200	The best coconut water...it is much better in the bottle than the paper box. I would recommend it. It even tastes great at room temperature.
5	1350950400	This is the one product that helps my Sjogrens.  Highly recommend it.  Helps me when I am so dehydrated and like an instant IV for myself.  Good taste and all natural.
5	1350950400	I'm not religious, but bless you Zico. Being able to buy in bulk is the only way to go. Will order again. I do prefer the tetra packs but the bottles were convenient.
4	1350172800	Pretty good flavor, but a little yellowish.the only reason I bought these is because they are not from concentrate.  I generally buy Coco Libre, but it is from concentrate.Coco Libre has a much better taste, and it's organic.  I think I'll stick with Coco Libre.
5	1350000000	The product always arrives on time and is well packaged to prevent damage.  I am set up on automatic shipments to save additional money.ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 33.8-Ounce Container (Pack of 6)
5	1350000000	I've been drinking water out of coconuts since I was a kid. We'd always go to the flea market and buy a bunch then crack them open and put a straw through them. I have tried all of the coconut waters on the market and the Zico water (in carton) comes closest to the real thing.
5	1349827200	I use to have natural coconut water from  the fruit in Brazil and also tried a lot of brands here in US, finally found Zico chocolate flavored and it is really good.
1	1349654400	I've been drinking ZICO brand coconut water after yoga for a few years.  My favorite flavor disappeared after ZICO sold out to Big Business, and my next favorite flavor since the sell out never seems to be available.  So I tried pineapple because it was available and I like another brand of coconut water with pineapple, but ZICO definitely did not nail this flavor!  I will choke down the rest of the nasty pineapple case and switch to something else...have lost faith in ZICO since they sold out.
3	1349654400	Had leaking from 4 of 6 containers.  the top caps seems to be weak part that it easily breaks.. amazon did refund the leaky ones.. but I won't order these..again..  Don't want to take another chance on leaks.. although these taste better than the plastic resealable ones at 11oz.
3	1349654400	Just got my order.. good thing.. nothing leaked like the Zico 33.8 Oz (6pack).I've had about 5 so far.. have to say.. Vita Coco taste alot better. I do like the resealable packaging.. but, taste not so good.. as some reviewers said.. taste plasticy... I think I will stick with vita Coco.
4	1349395200	Knowing well that my wife and I have taken to this refreshing drink, our son regularlysends us (through amazon.com) Zico- pure premium coconut water (natural). It is a veryconvenient and economic way to order and receive the product at our doorsteps.  Mywife especially likes the drink and enjoys it almost daily.The taste is not quite the same as that of fresh coconut water, but it comes pretty close.If one feels really thirsty or dehydrated and looks for something other than plain water,this product could be very satisfying.
1	1349222400	Have purchased this product in different cities from different stores.  The consistent thing?  It tastes like plastic.  Nasty.  I will not be buying this product ever again.
5	1349222400	I've been drinking coconut water for the last 8 years and have gone through the tasting cycle. I find myself coming back to ZICO to get my taste buds back. I also like the container and the size (11.2-ounce), very tasty and the amount is enough (for me) before/during my workout(s). I also like the idea of having my pack of 12 ZICO delivered to me each month-- save time and money...  I have recommended ZICO and AMAZON to friends and we love it... Cheers everybody....ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)
5	1349049600	Many popular sports drinks have a lot of sodium and glucose as well as other electrolytes and stuff. Their flavoring frequently is nasty.ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks.
5	1348790400	I love ZICO. I have Sjogrens and can get dehydrated very quickly. Since I have been drinking ZICO every morning I have not had to go into the hospital. My doctor was the one who had suggested to buy it. I really love your money saving offer. Plus it is delivered at the door. Who could ask for anything better.Aggie
3	1348531200	The first batch I got was fairly good, the second batch had a plastic sort of taste.  I didn't realize how bad it was until I tried some side-by-side with some Taste Nirvana brand.So my recommendation so far is Taste Nirvana, I just ordered some Amy and Brian's I will update here once I get it and compare.Update:The Amy and Brians young coconut water/juice is really good. Expect something a bit different than you are used to as it is a young coconut water. Very sweet but not overpowering, needs to be drinken cold for best flavor.
1	1348444800	Absolutely terrible and I tried 2 flavors. I had a plastic screw top container and all I could taste was PLASTIC. My son's flavor was the same flavor. ick ick ick I love ONE
4	1348358400	I have subscribed to this product and have been getting it every month for a year. This is definitely better than the other 2 products and yes I tried those before settling on Zico. For a person who has been drinking coconut water since childhood I am not sure this tastes exactly like that. But its good enough and very refreshing especially after a long bike ride or long walk.
1	1348272000	Overall decent taste, but not what I expected.  Also did not expect this to be coconut water from CONCENTRATE. I will read the fine print better next time.  100% pure coconut water is always better IMHO.The added sugar would not really be necessary if it's pure coconut water, not from concentrate.
1	1348272000	I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me.
5	1348185600	I grab one a day to school, they are great, sometimes I got home after basketball and will down one of these. just make sure you keep them at the fridge. (I prefer them over other sport-drinks)
5	1348185600	During and after every daily workout,I am completley satisfied with the best way to hydrate. I've tried many different products but, this one is like healthy medicine for me. I not only can feel the difference, but I am confident and secure knowing I am giving my body exactly what it needs. I also know, through my own personal experiences and research (which I always do first before I use any product) that ZICO is what it claims ~ pure and premium! That is important when you want to experience the results you are looking for. I suffer from Auto-Immune,so the purest and healthiest products are imperative. I'm a happy survivor who WILL NOT use anything but the best,safest and healthiest. Thanks to Amazon, again for supporting my needs ~ ZICO is #1
1	1348099200	There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water.  There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking.  Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in.  I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.
5	1348012800	Like many of the other reviews, I have tried coconut water and hated the taste. I do love chocolate and had a free sample of this and was hooked. Since these sell in NY for about $3 a bottle I decided to buy the cases. As soon as I saw that amazon only had a few left I bought 4 boxes. Hopefully they get more in stock when I am ready.Side note: I used to get really bad headaches at work and now that I drink one with my lunch I feel much better (refreshed). I highly recommend giving it a try.
5	1347926400	This pure coconut water is my favorite and to be able to get it delivered to the door is awesome. The bottle size is perfect - just enough for refreshment with no waste. The drink chills quickly in the refridgerator and tastes great.
2	1347840000	Doesn't taste like real coconut water.  They may have used extremely young coconuts (that are are not desirable) or some second-rate coconut crop.
5	1347840000	ZICO Coconut Water is great stuff.  I wish I could find it somewhere where it wasnt soo expensvie.  It is a bit expensive!
5	1347840000	With a mild smooth taste of coconut and water this stuff is REFRESHING. its not too sweet and its just super refreshing when you pull it out of the fridgeone great way to serve it is on crushed ice in a slushee style thingy
5	1347667200	I used to love the chocolate drink "Yoo-Hoo" growing up as a kid. I tried this because I love coconut water now but was intrigued by the chocolate. I was pleasantly surprized!!! I no longer have to act like I'm buying Yoo-Hoo for a child I don't have and can confidently drink ZICO CHOCOLATE in public!!! LOL
3	1347580800	Not bad coconut water but doesn't come close to Nirvana (in bottles). They both originate from Thai coconuts but Nirvana has a much deeper, richer taste.
1	1347148800	I found the taste to be really awful compared to what I have had out of REAL coconuts straight from the tree. It tastes like frosted flake milk: artificially sweet. Would not recommend if you like natural tastes.
5	1347062400	This stuff is absolutely amazing!  It tastes the best when it is really cold and goes down super smooth!  Anyone who works on on a regular basis should at least give it a try.
5	1346976000	I really like this product. It is always fresh and taste great.  I especially like the lid which is easy to use and secure.  Not like other brands with a flip lid that tears easily and can leak.
2	1346889600	I am a coconut water fiend! I have been drinking coconut water since a child and think this is the most tasteless one I have tried! Try 'One' or Vita coco, IF you like real coconut water!
5	1346889600	I have been an advocate of coconut water (not coconut milk, a different product all together!) for many years.I am not a professional athlete, these are just my personal experiences/opinions.Coconut water (CW) is the best hydration drink I have found; far better than just water and without all the additives of the many 'sports drinks' on the market. I played Ice Hockey for 3 different rec teams, trained 4 nights a week plus games.  Now I play roller derby.  I also play softball, snowboard, mountain bike, geocache, and am an Assistant Scout Master.I don't drink just CW, I used it as a supplement. Before sport or a big game I keep myself hydrated with water a good 24-48 hours beforehand. I will have a CW an hour - half hour before the game. I keep hydrated during activity with regular water.  If I ever 'feel thirsty' during the game then I'll reach for one because I know it works fast.I always have a CW afterw a hard game too (if I didn't grab one during) to make sure my electrolyte levels get back to normal.There's no need to overdo it - it's a supplement, not a replacement for water.But there are many coconut water products out there.... Personally I prefer the natural taste, although there are now flavored products out there.  Make sure you check the ingredients.  You do not want coconut water "from concentrate" - defeats the object!This product is totally natural. It is not from concentrate.  The ingredients listed are:"100% natural coconut water".No additives, no flavors, no preservatives.  Convenient package size too for the way I use it.It's a handy size to fit in a cargo pant pocket or side pocket on a backpack when out hiking in hot climates.If you are not familiar with the benefits of coconut water just use google!  As with ay product, you will find all sorts of wild and wonderful claims, but at the end of the day it is very high in potassium and contains 5 essential electrolytes. CW is from the young green coconuts and is sterile inside the nut.  In developing countries it has even been used as an intravenous hydration fluid where medical saline was unavailable!Coconut water is primarily marketed as a sports drink because of it's hydrating properties, but those same properties have other uses!I have personally found CW hugely beneficial (and better than just water) in each of the following circumstances too:* Been outdoors in the sun too long, developed a headache and realized I hadn't drunk enough.* I enjoy a glass of wine but it doesn't agree with me; I get really bad hangovers!.  A CW before bed has almost eliminated my hangovers.  Sometimes and extra CW in the morning is needed.* Upset stomach, sickness and diarrhea are dehydrating: I find CW gentle on my stomach with a mild taste so easy for me to digest when this need arises.I usually take one backpacking too.  For ounce-watchers once carton is 12.5 oz (11.2 floz). I do pack them carefully and I'm 'wary' of the peel back foil but it's made of tough stuff, well sealed, yet easy-open and I've never had one burst or leak.Just pack with care. Once drunk, the carton flattens easily to hike out with or can be burned in a camp fire (unlike plastic water bottles).After research, these Zico cartons were the best and most cost-effective "100% natural" version of CW.  This size carton best suited my needs. I have an Amazon monthly subscription for delivery of this product.
5	1346889600	I like having Zico with dinner, it really quenches my thirst.  I also like taking it to watch my son playing sports, everyone else is drinking coffee which I never drink.
1	1346630400	I love the product itself, but I do not like the container at all.I have a garage with a large refridgerator in it, I fill it withcoconut water, so while working  around the yard, I get refreshedwith a cold drink . I opened the last case and the top looked funny,but i poured a drink and took a drink , it tasted funny , not like theothers.later that day got real sick. Looking at the other tops, i sawthey were not in tack. and poured out the products in that case, asthey were all alike, (I have the 6 containers still and if I could sendthem back I would for a refund.  I would not purchase this type of containeragain.
1	1346630400	I purchased this coconut water expecting it to at least be passable.  What I got was a 12-pack that was 2 months away from expiration and tasted terrible.  With so many other solid brands out there, I'm moving away from ZICO.
5	1346544000	ZICO is wonderful.  What a difference this great tasting coconut water has make in my dailyroutines. All Senior's could benefit in their daily life from this product.  Highly recommended!
1	1346371200	I like the product but it is too much trouble to open it now. I sent this email to Zico but, strangely, they didn't replyHi Folks,I like the product and I buy a couple cases per month of the 11oz units. I do have a complaint though: Why do you bother to put that silver tab on the top? I thought it was to open the box, but I guess it must just be there to protect the plastic membrane underneath. At any rate, I always have to have a knife around to cut the plastic out. You can't just punch a hole in it because the plastic then prevents the liquid from coming out smoothly. It has to be cut out. And that is almost impossible to do without spilling some. And it's a pain in the ass.Come on, guys. It's 2012 and I know there are some companies manufacturing containers that are easy to open. For what you are charging, shouldn't it be a little easier to enjoy your product?
5	1346112000	I am training for a marathon and was having trouble with cramping. In the past i had only used gatoraid and that was not stopping the cramps.I had tried Zico in other flavors but chocolate is the only one I can tolerate. I actually love the chocolate. Since using it after runs over 90mins. I no longer get cramps. It is best cold. I also mix it into my smoothie as a recovery drink. I order it by the case now since my grocery store does not always have it and I don't want to run out.
4	1345593600	This isn't going to be as good as some of the other products on amazon, but it is a good compromise between price and taste.
5	1345075200	I love this water!!  I am a health care provider and suggest to all my patients to drink at least one a day for good hydration and good for the skin.  and the best place to purchase is Amazon.com!!!!
4	1344643200	I have tried various brands of packaged coconut water but ZICO comes the closest to the real thing. It used to be procured from Brazil but now they put a sticker covering that and now its from Thailand (i think)
5	1344556800	This is the best tasting coconut water out there!I have tried many but Zico tastes like it was just poured from a freshly plucked coconut.
1	1344297600	This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified "natural flavor" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.
5	1344211200	ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)This is the best tasting coconut water out there.  So refreshing.  When my friends complain about the taste of coconut water I refer them to this brand.  Makes all the difference.
5	1344211200	I grew up in the tropics where the best shade at the beach is from a palm tree. Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)
5	1343692800	I love the taste and feel great after drinking this powerful liquid. Best drank straight out of the container. If I ever get off this island I will know who to thank for keeping me well hydrated.
1	1343606400	I was expecting this to taste as good as some of the other coconut waters and what an unpleasant surprise!!!!  I cannot even finish one bottle  UGH!
5	1343347200	Delicious! Still light and refreshing enough for a pre or post-work drink!  This drink has more flavor that plain coco water and isn't too sweet.
1	1343174400	The one star I have given to Zico coconut water is actually a negative star. This stuff tastes absolutely awful. Plain and simple. Wouldn't take it home again if they were giving it away.
4	1342915200	What this is:  coconut water - not coconut milk - flavored with chocolate.Coconut water is taken from green coconuts - they haven't had the time to form the meat or milk yet.  Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts.  It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories.  I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.This chocolate flavor is excellent imho.  It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.About me:  I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give "5"-star reviews.
5	1342915200	No need to read reviews and search any more..the best coconut water is definitely from Zico! I am not surprised that this product is always on back order at Amazon. After all, it is so fresh, tastes purely natural, and is extremely refreshing, that anyone who tries it once will love it. We have been using it since last 4 months and have been so used to it that I had to use the "Subscribe n Save" option which beats the price of this product from everywhere else.It comes well packaged and the containers are very easy to store, carry, and drink directly from the bottle. Love this product and highly recommend it!
4	1342828800	actually surprisingly refreshing taste.  served best when chilled.  i like the Zico coconut water better than Vita, which tastes somewhat stale.
5	1341532800	I love this coconut water. It tastes great and is healthy. I mix 2 tablespoons of pure cherry concentrate in 6-8 ounces and get double benefits, and the more I drink it, the more I love it.
3	1341532800	Zico is a very mild green coconut water that lacks the sweetness of the Vita Coco brand. I mostly drink coconut water for the benefits so the specific taste range is broad for me. I don't like the floating prices on this site because when I purchased it, it was a good deal (especially coupled with free shipping). I've since seen the prices rise to almost double at times PLUS shipping sometimes which is severely unfair. I can find this at the supermarket so if it's not cheap enough here I'm not buying it. Bottom line!
4	1341446400	I purchase this product because it is an excellent source of potassium.  My 98yo mother takes Lasix to relieve her of excesssive fluid accumulation and edema.  As a result she needs to add Potassium to her diet to replace the potassium lost through urination.  In addition to ripe Bananas, we use the Zico coconut water as an excellent sources of potassium which prevents her prom having to take  potassium pills.  This is a relief as she is already taking enough pills and the Zico is so refreshing.  She totally enjoys and looks forward to her monthly Zico delivery.
5	1340841600	If you like coconut water this is the stuff for you.  I think that Zico's product tastes as good as any other bottled coconut water, of course not as good as getting it straight from the coconut but a lot more convenient>
5	1340496000	I used to not like Coconut water.  When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.  Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.  If I could afford it, I would only need this one drink for life and I'd be happy.
1	1340323200	I sooo wish Zico would read this and take back their company. It was such a good product why zico why did you change it??? Now I have to find anouther coconut drink. Oh well that is what you get when you sell your company to people who just want money and not care about a good product.
5	1340323200	Zico is very good, but not better than the other ones I gave 5 stars.  I've tried 5 brands: "Zico","Real Coconut Water", "O.N.E", "Coco Libre" and "Vita Coco". 5 stars to the 4 first names and 4 stars to "Vita Coco". The first ones taste equally great, so, just compare the prices! "Vita Coco" is less sweet and doesn't taste as good; but it's usually much cheaper, and not bad at all!!!
1	1340236800	LOVE this coconut water.  After a workout (or a night out a bit too late) this stuff is like magic.  Rehydrates you immediately, even stops the headache you can get from being dried out.  My first shipment was Subscribe and Save for $18.28.  They apparently cancelled that program and are now asking $54.40.  INCREDIBLY diappointed, loved the product but that kind of a price jump is ridiculous.  Over 200%.
1	1340064000	I bought a case of this at Costco. I read about all the sugar in Vitamin Water and have been thinking on replacing my workout replenishing drink with coconut water. After trying it today, I couldn't even force myself to finish the bottle. One more sip and felt so disgusted. I had plenty of fresh coconut water, and this taste nothing like it. I have never returned anything to Costco, but I will return this one.
5	1339545600	My first time experience Coconut Water. I heard it is good for inflammation. I am very happy with my choice of choosing ZICO.
4	1339200000	I have tried a bunch of coconut waters. This one is in the top three for strait coconut water. Its so refreshing that my body craves it after a good workout or a long night of drinking.  I recommend this to all my friends.If ts your first time drinking any coconut water, the flavor will grow on you. I wasn't big on it at first but now it's one of my favorite drinks.You'll be happy when you read the ingredience list. It's refreshing that it's all words you can pronounce.
5	1339200000	Fantastic and delicious after a workout! This is probably the best electrolyte replenishing drink on the market! Coconut water is even better than intravenous fluids per some medical literature I have read.
5	1339200000	This is the best water after a hard work out!  You recover a lot quicker & it makes you feel good.  I love coconut so this water was made for me!
5	1338940800	Enjoy drinking this brand.  Tastes as good as other coconut waters.  Bottle great for taking to work or wherever.  Recycle the bottle when done!
5	1338854400	I use this stuff most days during my workouts since it's a natural electrolyte replacement. It tastes good and keeps my energy up.
4	1338768000	I have tried several different brands I can assure you that this product will fulfill your coconut water-based desires. No unpleasant surprises here!In addition, I found the price-point quite fair, especially when you use the subscribe and save feature. My wife and I are happy with one twelve-pack a month but may even considering going up to two. It certainly beats buying them individually at the grocery store.
5	1338681600	I've been very happy with the ZICO 11oz Tetra Pak from Thailand and decided to give the bottles a try. While it contains a blend of coconuts, I found the taste to be great and the bottle very convenient to use/carry. It's great knowing the quality was not lessened in anyway. Thanks again to Dr.OZ for making a great recommendation!
1	1338422400	Very bad taste, like rotten/stale drink. I had read pretty good reviews about ZICO coconut water, but on trying it totally disapointed. VITA COCO is way better than this.
1	1338422400	Very bad taste, like rotten/stale drink. I had read pretty good reviews about ZICO coconut water, but on trying it totally disapointed. VITA COCO is way better than this.
2	1338422400	Unfortunate that Zico natural coconut water was reformulated when this bottle was introduced. I like the convenience of the bottle, and find it easy to believe that the bottle is environmentally friendlier than the tetra pak, but the flavor of the coconut water is unpleasant--the kindest characterization I can come up with is "flat". Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging. A look at the nutrition information on the label makes it clear that there is a difference in the two products, though I haven't analyzed the changes. Will not be purchasing any more of this product.
5	1338336000	This new flavor of Zico is delicious - silky and chocolate-y without the gag-inducing traits of some of the other fruity flavors.  Great as a post-workout substitute for chocolate milk or a banana.  My little case ran out quickly as my husband discovered it and loves it, too.  However, I went to re-order the same exact item and was shocked to see that the price of a 12 pack jumped from $21.51 to $53.95!Come on, Amazon, really?  This is obviously a hot item at the moment, but you're letting your sellers get away with blatant thievery!  What a disappointment.
4	1338249600	I bought this exact product previously for under $22 and now it is nearly $54.  What happened?  The natural and the mango didn't sky rocket.  Was is a successful product and now they plan to take advantage of their customers?  I can do without it at that price.
5	1338249600	I love this drink! Tastes just like Yoohoo. Sadly, I saw the price jump and figured I should just buy it at my local Whole Foods...until I realized I can't find it there anymore either!! I don't know if it's being discontinued or what happened but I hope to find it again soon (and not for almost $60 a box).
4	1337990400	It has a natural fresh test. I can't say that I noticed any boost in energy or condition from drinking on a 17-mile run.
5	1337990400	The family takes daily as the product tastes great. I've found that taking the young coconut water has a real calming effect on the stomach and helps with my digestion.The price & value is super!
5	1337990400	I purchase this for my husband who loves the chocolate.  I have one place we can purchase this in my area and it is much more expensive than gettng online, so when it's time for more, ordering it from Amazon is quick and easy!
5	1337904000	Excellent coconut water. I have tried other brands, but ZICO stands out. Bikram Yoga teacher recommended me this brand. Give it a try.
1	1337644800	Didn't taste anything like Pineapple to me, you could taste the plastic from the bottle! I'd stick to other coconut water brands like Vita Coco and One Natural Experience for a product that tastes like what the fresh ones on vacation taste like.
2	1337558400	I drink Coconut water all the time, and I remember in the past liking Zico, so I placed it on my subscribe and save since it was the cheaper brand offered...after receiving my first case and trying out my first pack, I immediately removed it from my subscription.  This does NOT taste right, it has an almost soy-sauce flavor to it.  I thought maybe it was that individual pack, NOPE! I've drank three of them and they all tasted this way.  This past weekend I went to a music festival and packed some O.N.E. coconut water instead, much MUCH BETTER.  My Boyfriend also tried some of the Zico, but out of trying not to be rude didn't say anything...this past weekend when he drank the O.N.E. he finally spoke up and said, no offense, but this is WAY better than that stuff you gave me last week...
1	1337385600	My taste buds must be very different because believe me this does not taste like a yahoo......What a waste of money....
5	1337385600	Zico is my favorite drink!  I purchase the 33.8 oz on subscription and love this brand!  When you open a coconut - this is what the milk tastes like!  buy it you will like it!JanSimpson
5	1337299200	I purchase both Zico and Vita, like both of it, but I think Vita is better in taste, zica kinda water down on taste
5	1337299200	I have to say that this is the best deal I found yet.  I drink coconut for the flavor and for the hydration and with shipping, this is cheaper than any of the big box warehouse deals!  Go Amazon!!
5	1337299200	lots of coconut flavor and only a few grams of carbs.  make a lot more sense than paying $2.50 per bottle at the gym.  jen aniston is never wrong, right?
5	1337126400	I love coconut water in all its raw incarnations: Brazilian, Thai, Indian. I'm hit or miss with the fruit juice blended beverages of any brand. Along comes chocolate Zico. It doesn't seem right given the consistency and flavor of coconut water. Well, it is creamier in appearance than any other water or blend -- as it, well, should be. You wouldn't mistake this in a glass beside the plain variety. The flavor is rich, very cocoa and in surprising harmony with the coconut core of it all. I enjoy it because it tastes more like a treat than the regular and goes down smooth just in case I really need the hydrating lift! You've done juice blended coconut waters. Now try this. Be careful of price they really shouldn't be more than twenty dollars per case!
2	1337126400	I am not impressed by this one compare to other coconut water products I tried, but taste is a subjective thing, you may like it so try it once.
5	1336953600	I am amazed to see so may negative reviews. Best I can guess is that the bottles the negative reviewers tastes were mishandled somehow. Maybe they got too warm or something during shipping.I buy Zico Natural in the plastic bottle from my local grocery store all the time, and they are the closest thing to actual fresh coconut water I have found. I love fresh coconut water, and I absolutely hate anything that tastes like plastic or metal.In fact, I dislike most bottled or canned coconut water because of the off tastes, but I simply don't taste anything wrong with the Zico Natural in plastic bottes.Accuse me of working for Zico if you like, but as you can see I am a long time Amazon user and reviewer.
5	1336780800	I love this stuff...that being said, I love most coconut waters.  I chose this one for auto delivery because ounce for ounce, it was the cheapest out of the options offered. I go through the twelve tetra packs way before my next shipment is due.  I put one of these in the bottle of water I use to workout with then fill it up the rest of the way with water.  I know it is way diluted this way, but it gives me a hint of flavor that I just love when I am on the elliptical machine or ski machine.
1	1336780800	Tried the Tetra pack for the first time.  Nasty bitter tasting...I had to mask it with a dash of MIO just to get it down.(Perhaps if I use it in cooking I will find a way to finish the case.)
4	1336694400	Had come across a number of comments mentioning that the taste isn't the same as it used to be.I don't know how it tasted previously, but the contents of this packaging are perfectly fine in taste. I found that cooling the contents a bit tasted much better than consuming them at room temperature or chilling them.Also, the contents contain more sodium than water but, then again, you derive maximum benefit from coconut water if you use it as protection against dehydration or for replenishment, and not as a substitute for regular water. Also, drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade seemed to make me feel more bloated - so far, I have experienced nothing of that sort with Zico. Admittedly, carrying a Powerade bottle to the gym looks much more normal than carrying a Zico coconut water bottle :-)For what it's worth, my mom-in-law suffers from hyperacidity and has found the Natural variant of ZICO to be a blessing.I didn't give this 5 stars because I haven't been consuming it for long to know what side effects there might be, and nothing beats real coconut water, right out of a tropical coconut.
3	1336694400	I have tried several and Vita is still my favorite! I did the subscription service on this one as a trial run and it worked out well. I'll do again but will go with Vita.
5	1336608000	I won a case of the ZICO natural coconut water and absolutely love it!! I hydrate with it before and after my workouts and can really feel the difference in my recovery time after hard training.
5	1336608000	This product is absolutely delicious. I purchased a case and received it in 2 days thanks to amazon prime. Its been less than 24 hours since I've had the Zico and I've already drank around 5 or 6 bottles. Its an excellent cure for dry mouth and is great for quick hydration. It is basically chocolate milk except not horrible for you. It may actually be better tasting than chocolate milk. There is some sugar which could be a concern for some people, but for people who consume it moderately and don't have health problems its hardly a concern.This beverage is best served cold, if not slightly frozen.
1	1336521600	Coconut is my favorite anything. So i was excited to finally try for the first time cocnut water. To my dismay and utter disappointment. It was truly disgusting. I thought it was actually taste like cocnut, but alas it does not. It taste like sour milk mixed with tap water. Take it from a cocnut lover...find a different product!
4	1336521600	I've been on the search for palatable coconut water for the last month or two and I finally found it in Zico's Dark Chocolate coconut water.  Every week, I would drive over to my local Whole Foods, pick up a few boxes of any brands I could find comparable flavors for and I always made sure to buy two or three at once to compare flavors.  Nothing ever really stuck taste-wise until I found this and it's absolutely delicious.  If you remember drinking Yoohoo as a kid, you'll recognize this taste immediately.  I don't know how Zico did it but this tastes identical to that chocolately smooth goodness of my youth but, you know, much healthier.  I will say though, it tastes much better cold -- as the bottle says -- but that doesn't mean it's bad when it's warm, it's just better cold, that's all.I also carry these to the gym and when I run obstacle course races, especially if I'm unsure of what the post-race rehydration drink will be (typically Powerade or Gatorade).  I honestly didn't think much to Zico's claims on their site and the bottle that it supports "rapid hydration", whatever that is, but I do know that its huge amounts of potassium have kept me from bonking after a race to maintaining my perk.  I typically pound one of these and one to two bananas or Larabars post-race and I've certainly jump started the recovery process better than I ever did with sports drinks or water alone.  After I'm done in the gym, I chug some Zico to cool off and wash the taste of electrolyte-flavored water out of my mouth.  I can definitely tell a difference in my moods after racing or lifting when I drink some coconut water versus when I'm just drinking water alone.For me, no brand can touch Zico in the taste department on this one.
1	1336348800	I just received a box with the Zico Coconut water in it from Amazon.I chilled a pakdrank 1/2 of itand it made me sick.I drink coconut water all the time.This is horrible tasting.Contacted Amazon and they areissueing a refundI thank them....
5	1336262400	This is my "go-to" drink after the gym. I always hated the calories and was weary of the unnatural additives in Gatorade and other sports drinks. I always carry one of these 11.2-ouncers in my gym bag and drink it immediately after a good run, spinning, kickboxing, or other workout. I do prefer it colder, but even at room temp, the natural potassium and electrolytes always leave me feeling refreshed and rehydrated. I'm not sure how they do it, but they have lower calories and more nutrients than the other brands and taste way better without added sugar.
3	1336089600	I bought a case of these gems on sale.  They really seem to pack some vitamins.  The taste is simlar to licking up the side of a bulls ball sack on a hot muggy texas day.
2	1335830400	This is a review for the non-flavored zico.  Plain and simple it tastes gross nothing like real coconut water.  Take it from me, I had a coconut tree in my backyard growing up.  Drinking it straight up is gross, it tastes synthetic and I don't know how people rave about it.  Though, i did try mixing it in with my protein shakes and that was tolerable.ConclusionBuy another brand
2	1335657600	Yes, it says "Made from 100% Natural from concentrate and added chemicals". Taste like combined un-natural stuff (chemicals), not even close to "Foco Coconut Juice, Jugo de coco", which is cheaper and more natural and better taste. Though I gave 2 stars because of the packaging. Decent and looks nice.
2	1335657600	Doesn't taste like coconut water at all, I don't recommend this item. you can get another product with great taste.
1	1335657600	Skewing reviews by having reps put out a string of 5 star ratings is a great way to guarantee I will never buy your product again.
4	1335571200	I got the pineapple, mango and choco. My family liked the latter 2 the most. Yummy coconut water if you are not looking for one that is not too sugary IMO.
5	1335398400	I was so hesitant to try coconut water because so many of my friends have hated it. But I decided that I'd try the chocolate in hopes that it would be better. Wow! This stuff tastes just like a Yoohoo and has a similar consistency. Absolutely delicious. Had to come to Amazon to buy it in cases right away!
5	1335225600	The Pineapple coconut water was delicious.  I like it ice cold.  It was very benificial in bringing my 90 year old mother back from dehydration.  Shared it with a couple of my friends who have had some health issues.  Not saying it is a cure--no, but it has certainly helped with not having enough intake of fluids.  It rates a 5 star from me.  Thanks ZICO & Amazon for making my purchase affortable & easy to purchase.
5	1335139200	I have been drinking the regular and fruit flavored Zico Coconut waters for a few years, and they are good, but the chocolate is wicked awesome!
4	1335139200	After trying a number of Tender Coconut water, Zico is the closest to what you get from a freshly chopped tender coconut.  Delicious too.
5	1335052800	My boyfriend and I both love coconut water and have been trying different brands for a while. We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!
3	1334966400	I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.
5	1334966400	The taste is really good - I do love coconut, but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower. It helps with my heartburn as well.
5	1334793600	I am an avid runner and train heavily daily for my runs...zico gets me through my workouts and chocolate zico is the perfect end to a workout. my body craves it. lucky to have found it as its an essential part of my life!
5	1334620800	I have found that ZICO has the most consistently great tasting coconut water out there! Other companies can have good batches and not so good batches. ZICO has never let me down.
3	1334620800	I noticed the Zico Coconut Water at my nearby grocery store and I tried a couple varieties of it. The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.Gary Peterson
3	1334534400	In my family's three way taste test between Zico (from Thailand), Vita Coco (from Brazil) and Taste Nirvana (from Thailand), two of us ranked this #2 and one of us ranked it #3.  It had a slight tart taste, not nearly as strong as Vita Coco's.  Not nearly as...smooth and tasty as Taste Nirvana. We just don't like the "bite" that some coconut waters seem to have.
5	1334448000	So good, so filling, and hydrating. I'm not a fan of plain coconut water, so this is a good substitute. I signed up for subscribe and save and just love it. It's a great addition to any household, dairy free, and all the benefits of coconut water. I can't wait to try it in a smoothie!
5	1334448000	Love Zico coconut water!  I order 2 cases a month and have been extremely please with both the quality of this product and the service.  No complaints here!
1	1334016000	I am from Malaysia and I have lived in Texas for 11 of my 15 years.  Back in Malaysia I drank and ate coconut on a weekly basis.  I rode my bike to CVS yesterday and bought this drink.  After I took one sip, I was like, WTF?! It tastes aweful!There is little to no coconut in there.  Notice consumers, that it is only "100% natural coconut WATER FROM CONCENTRATE" and includes natural flavors.  It tastes in my opinion more like barley water that coconut.  The drink is very diluted and just fake overall.  Now dont get me wrong, the average American may buy this product to make get a tropical feel or something, but they would only be wasting their money.
5	1334016000	I once bought a 12 pack at GNC. Buying them this way is certainly cheaper than stocking up on them individually.  Well, GNC no longer sold them in 12 packs.  I even went to Vitamin Shoppe.  NOPE.  So finally, I do a search on-line and find I can get them through Amazon.  SCORE.This is an acquired taste and boy have I acquired it!  You'll see all these ads for drinks "containing" only traces of coconut water.  It makes me mad that they're falsely marketing products as coconut water.  This is the REAL DEAL.  This is as natural as it SHOULD taste.  Zico is my FAVE coconut water brand.  It's the best drink to hydrate with and beats those gatorades with their food coloring and added artificial sweeteners.  You naturalists can't go wrong with this.  Sample one first and it may be strange, but the taste will grow on you especially when this drink is served icy COLD.
1	1333929600	I've bought Zico many times before from Whole Foods, and I don't remember it being yellow! I started a subscription of this as well as the larger bottles of Zico. The larger bottles came with clear water as I'm used to; however, every single one of these 11.2oz ones poured out yellow water. NOT NORMAL. I know they had a recall of many of shipments, but that is long over and this is not a recall item. It should be! I would say, stay away from Zico, or if you must drink, buy individually from the store instead of these cases! I am cancelling immediately...and would return this order too if I could!!! (Now I just get jokes in my office about how they'd rather not be 'healthy' like me if this is what it entails!!!)
1	1333843200	They source from many locations, partly owned by PepsiCo, from concentrate.  The result is a bland drink that tastes like a bit like grass and dirt.
5	1333756800	This coconut water is nice and straight forward.  No juice added, so just plain coconut flavor.  It tastes natural, not chemical enhanced, not too salty, not too sweet.  No aftertaste like some others.
4	1333756800	This is good Coconut Water, but it's much cheaper at the store! It's better than ONE or Vita Coco, but not as good as some other brands (see below).Zico can be had at Trader Joes (if it's in your area) for $1.49 for the 11.2oz which is only $17.88 for 12. Beyond that, Whole Foods and Trader Joes both carry the 33.8oz carton for $3.49 (sometimes Whole Foods can be as much as $3.69), which is even MUCH cheaper. .103/oz vs .133/oz or 22% cheaper. Basically, get the big ones there and it's ridiculously cheaper than Amazon and is by far the cheapest of the brands. O.N.E is usually $5 for the 33.8oz carton at most stores (same w/ Zico at places like Safeway) and Vita Coco is basically sold at places that have no other options lol.Now, it's also important to factor in the brands that come in cans such as Amy & Brian's, c2o, Blue Monkey Blue Monkey 100% Natural Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce (Pack of 24) , etc.A lot of these are made in Thailand, and I find them to be better overall than Zico, ONE, and Vita. Basically c2o I find to be the most "refreshing" of all coconut water. It is less sweet than Zico and most other coconut waters, so feels the best to literally chug after running or things like that. Also a good choice if you're not also drinking some regular water. Amy&Brian;'s used to be my very favorite by far until Blue Monkey came along, and I think they are just as good, but different. As far as pure taste and amazingness, Amy&Brian;'s is the best! But it can be a little too sweet for me sometimes. If I want something less strong, I'll go with Blue Monkey. Note: Amy&Brian;'s cans say "Coconut Juice" but don't worry, it's still just 100% coconut water.I switch it up depending on what stores are around, but basically get Zico 33.8oz cartons OR A mix of the 3 canned brands I mentioned (Blue Monkey being pretty new to me). The cans come in 17oz for about $2 - $2.69. Often Whole Foods or similar stores will have many of them on sale for $2 or even $1.50 (in which case I'll just buy like 8 right there) and both of these are a very good deal compared to the prices mentioned by the original poster.
5	1333670400	AWESOME: Having the most delicious thing ever, delivered to your door in less than 24 hours on Prime, for half the price of what you can get it for in the stores.NOT AWESOME: TWO layers of tamper-proofing between the awesomeness inside the bottle, and your zico hole.
5	1333411200	I used this for my after work outs. It tastes amazing! i used the subscribe option and they send it to me on time! The packaging is great too! i never got a damaged coconut water box.
5	1333324800	I've tried many coconut waters and agree with Dr. Oz, ZICO tastes the best! Product shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. It's great knowing that something that taste so good is also naturally healthy. Will order again. Thanks, Amazon!
5	1333065600	Quick and easy! Buying on here is so much easier than going to the store, not to mention more convenient.
5	1332979200	BEING A GOLF PROFESSIONAL AND BEING OUTDOORS AS MUCH AS I AM, HYDRATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN MY LIFE.  COCONUT WATER HAS LONG BEEN NOTED TO BE THE BEST FOR HYDRATION, AND AFTER EXHAUSTIVELY TRYING EVERY BRAND ON THE MARKET, ZICO HAS STOOD OUT TO ME AS THE FINEST.  ITS FRESHNESS OF INGREDIENTS, ALONG WITH THE VARIETY OF FLAVORS HAS BEEN A PLUS FOR ME.  IT OFTEN MAY BE A FEW CENTS MORE THAT THE OTHERS, BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND THE RESULTS ARE WORTH IT.
5	1332979200	First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water.  I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.Highly recommended.  Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add.
5	1332979200	I purchased a few boxes of Zico natural and they are by far my favorite.  I love the taste of this pure coconut water, hot or cold .  I was surprised to find out they have so much potassium, no added sugars and how hydrating the little 11.2 ounce drink is. Thank you Zico for making a product people can really count on.ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)
5	1332892800	Absolutely the hottest drink out there......Delicious and healthy....Don't know how I ever lived without it!!!???!!!  Zico is the premiere coconut drink out there.  The tetra packs a compact and affordable.  Well worth every penny.
5	1332892800	Zico Coconut Water in chocolate is my absolute favorite! It's 100% natural and soooo delicious. It's super powered water, that's good for you AND tastes like dessert! For a really healthy snack or smoothie, make ice cubes of the Zico chocolate water and blend with frozen bananas. For a little more of an energy burst, add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter. SO GOOD! :)
5	1332892800	Zico Coconut Water Mango is my absolute favorite! It's 100% natural and delicious. It's super powered water! It has a sweet, mellow, mango flavor that's really wonderful.
5	1332892800	Zico Coconut Water is my absolute favorite! It's 100% natural and delicious. It's super powered water! It's what your body needs when you're thirsty, it's so refreshing!
5	1332806400	I feel healthy and refreshed after drinking ZICO.  It tastes great and is priced well compared to other coconut water drinks.
5	1332720000	I started drinking Zico because we carried it at my work and I instantly loved it. The taste is unique but great. I did a marathon in January and the chocolate Zico was my best friend during my training. Not only was it refreshing after my long runs, but I instantly felt rehydrated. I have told anyone that I meet to try it after long runs and they always come back and tell me how I was right. I have probably gotten at least 5 other runner's to be Zico drinkers :)
3	1332374400	Was getting VitaCoco, decided to try this brand. First impression was that it tasted weird, maybe a little spoiled. Subsequent tastings elicit an "OK" but not much more. I still prefer VitaCoco at this point.I have a couple more of these, so I'll update this review if I change my mind.
1	1332288000	I used to buy ZICO by the case. It was just like sticking a straw into a fresh coconut on a Caribbean island. Then the company sold to a conglomerate. First decision was to switch from fresh to from concentrate. The result was a disaster. Undrinkable funky tasting and horrible. Then the scandalous self promotion. Despite that every consumer was trashing it a string of 5 star reviews appear, every single one from a 'reviewer' with no history of any prior reviews on Amazon. One reviewer accidentally outed himself by posting a comment as a ZICO rep using the same username as his glowing review. Now fast forward they bring back the tetra packs not from concentrate. Thank goodness, right? WRONG! Stuff tastes artificial and basically only useful for making a smoothie. Old ZICO was miles above any other coconut water on the market and this stuff is miles below the worst of the bunch. And lo and behold, another slew of glowing 5 star reviews for the tetra packs and almost every single one of these from someone with no history on Amazon or only prior review was their bogus review of the from concentrate product. Shame on you for ruining a once fantastic product and shame on you for fraudulent self promoting reviews!
5	1332028800	Great value & taste!!I love coconut water and we drink a lot in my household.It's great (actually the perfect thing) for rehydration after a night of drinking, long weekend, or after hard work.It has potassium, a few vitamins, and a weakly flavored but pleasant taste that really grows on you.I've tasted a lot of brands and Zico has probably the best taste of them all.And I've shopped around on Amazon, which is already much cheaper than your grocery store or gas station.And this item, with it's larger volumes (which stay fresh), and low pricehas proven to be the lowest priced (cheapest) price per ounce -- definitely the greatest value you can find!So I highly recommend this item, especially if you like coconut water and want the cheapest for the best product.
5	1331942400	I love coconut water for its refreshing and rehidrating qualities. I've always loved fresh coconut water from the coconut palm, but it is not always available nor easy to carry. With ZICO coconut water I always carry a couple of packs with me and have it on hand. It restores my energy level fast,it refreshes me quickly without any loss of pace, whether I am on a trail or gym or home. I absolutely love the convenience and the benefits of ZICO packs. Try them you will never drink anything else!
1	1331942400	I grew up drinking real coconut water.  This product doesn't even come close.  I will not buy it ever again.  Read the product description - it's "produced domestically from concentrate."  IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE LIKE REAL COCOCNUT WATER.
5	1331856000	Zico is by far my favorite brand of all the coconut waters! I prefer the natural tetra pack to the bottle, because it tastes slightly nuttier and sweeter. This stuff saves my life when I workout! I run, spin, and do crossit, and this stuff does the trick to prevent cramping and rehydrate me. I also love using it in my smooties in substitution on dairy. Not gonna lie, its also a great hangover remedy!
5	1331856000	I love this coconut water.  I use post exercising, since I would always get a headache no matter how much water I drank.  I live in Florida and I dread the heat and being outside, but Zico has been my rescue drink.  I Cant recommend it enough.And my 2 year old loves it too, which is always a plus, since he feels like he gets to drink a "fun" drink, something I never let in the house.  Wait until I let him try the chocolate!
5	1331596800	My boyfriend loves this stuff and since we live an hour's drive apart I surprise him with cases of Chocolate ZICO when I can't surprise him with my own company. There's no shipping, it only takes a couple days to get there AND if you have some foresight, you can preorder a handful of cases at a lower rate and have them sent periodically. The only downside - having to stop yourself from downing a whole case of ZICO.
5	1331510400	This stuff is amazing! Seriously, huge sweaty workout left you so thirsty you can't drink enough water? Here's your fix.  Massive hangover, it can fix that too.  This is one of the few things that actually leaves me feeling totally hydrated.  I even make soup with it, substituting for coconut milk to make for a lighter healthier soup.  Also, ZICO is the only brand I buy, as other major brands have a strange manufactured taste.
5	1331424000	Having drank coconut water straight out of the coconut countless times on trips to Mexico, this is the next best thing.  By far the closest in taste to what I grew to love.  I've tried the others, and they don't compare... this is the best and freshest tasting.  I drink it at the gym or really whenever I can... Not to mention it helps a hangover!
5	1331164800	Zico not only tastes great, but it is great at replenishing electrolytes and potassium after a workout, without the processed sugar.
5	1331078400	Amazing brand! Love the taste of the Thai coconut water. Delicious and great for you!! Highly recommend it!! I have to say, this is by far my favorite coconut water.
5	1331078400	i drink it all the time. love the taste and the amount of electrolytes. you should try the chocolate one too, it's so yummy
5	1331078400	I had heard all about coconut water from friends and tried a can (I forgot the brand) but I wasn't a fan. I didn't think I liked it until I was introduced to zico when I got a free bottle at a marathon - ever since then I've been hooked! I've tried and enjoyed all the flavors now but I'd have to say chocolate is my favorite :)....it tastes very similar to a chocolate milk. The pineapple and berry are also very refreshing and tasty. I was also shocked to see the calorie content...I think it's only about 110 calories for the whole bottle? Much less then most sport drinks I've tried. If you've tried coconut water and thought you didn't like it PLEASE try zico because it will change your mind.
1	1331078400	So, what happens when Coca-Cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste? It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying "I told you so" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure...
5	1330560000	I love this coconut water, (I also purchase VitaCoco cases at least 1-2 times a month). This coconut water is my husband's favorite, so we always have it in the refrigerator. Our family doesn't purchase soda, and now with the coconut water, we don't buy sports drinks, either! It's great to rehydrate, take to the gym, etc. And a liter is the perfect size-- I always found myself drinking at least 2 of the smaller ones so this is a more economic option.The items shipped fine, arrived in great shape. I'm on autoship for this product, so I don't even have to get it from the grocery store anymore.
1	1330387200	I don't know if it's the plastic bottle or the fact that it's made from concerntrate, but something doesn't taste right about Zico.  I ordered many different brands and most, if not all of them were not made from concentrate.  This tastes diluted, re-constituted and plastic-y.  There are many other brands, I recommend any one of them over Zico.
4	1330300800	I went to Hawaii last Fall to see a friend who introduced me to fresh, young, coconut water. Once I returned to the mainland I craved the flavor of coconut water. It is yummy and so refreshing. So I found some at the local grocery store, but it wasn't very good. Then I found this brand on sale at the store and tried it and fell in love. It is SO close to the same refreshing coconut juice I had in HI and I love it so much I have it ordered via the Amazon subscription service so that I can save a little $$$ too. Definitely recommend.
5	1330128000	I tried the original Zico coconut water on recommendation from a friend, and really like it. When I saw the chocolate flavor I was skeptical but intrigued. I'm a huge "chocolate lover" but chocolate and water in the same sentence sounded kind of weird. I tried it anyway and I am so glad that I did! WOW! This stuff tastes amazing and doesn't taste "watery" or "watered down" at all. It's has a rich chocolate flavor and is basically a dairy-free way to enjoy chocolate milk. Plus it has all of those good electrolytes :)Definitely worth a try!
5	1330041600	Zico 33.8 Ounce tastes so good, crisp and pure.  It tastes way better than vitacoco which has an odd after taste.  My packs were fresh with an expiration of 9 months after I ordered.  Shipping was super fast and absolutely no damage to the containers.  You have to try out how delicious this brand is!
1	1329523200	I usually buyVita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12), and was going to buy Zico (the name of a famous brazilian soccer player).The information on the product reads "from Brazilian coconuts", but if you take a look at the label (in the pictures) it clearly states "imported from Thailand".They are clearly trying to position themselves againstVita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12), by pretending to be from Brasil (using the soccer players name, and stating they use Brazilian coconuts) but in reality they are a Thay product.Nothing wrong with that, but they should not mislead people...
5	1329436800	I saw the chocolate zico at a healthfood store. I order the regular water on amazon and decided to give the chocolate water a try. I was amazed at how good the water was!!! It tastes like low fat chocolate milk.......Yummy. Chocolate is my favorite flavor. My only problem will be trying not to drink more than one a day!!!
4	1329177600	I agree that the flavor has changed and it does have a more um... plastic-y taste now but I still think it tastes good (although I have always liked artificial flavors...I know that's kind of weird).  Anyway I liked the previous formula better, but I thought I should share my honest opinion that the new flavor is not that bad.
2	1328572800	Anyone who says this tastes like choc milk or Yoo Hoo is nuts. I had it over ice and could hardly get it down. I wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting. Delivery was not what I expected either. It came in a box with many other items, it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds. I think the UPS guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out. I guess the good news is it came quickly, along with the disappointment.
1	1328572800	I am new to the coconut water scene, so trying a bunch of brands. I just tried this brand and found it way too salty...obnoxiously.  I don't get it.  We are drinking coconut water for the health benefits and I potassium, great for lowering blood pressure, and they go ahead and add 160mg of salt into the drink.  It's gross.
5	1328486400	And I gotta say......I like it!  I did a lot of research on coconut water before I purchased.  Zinco brand seemed to get better reviews, and people saying it actually has ALOT more electrolytes etc.  I have heard the benefits of drinking this versus Gatorade etc and wanted one that didn't taste like crap.  This is chocolate flavored.  Well , anything chocolate in my book is a winner.  the product arrived fast, and was packaged very well. I put a few in the refrigerator and in a couple hours, I tried one.  It didn't gag, or spit it out. It actually has a once taste to it.  Kinda like watered down chocolate milk.  Didn't taste any coconut flavor, just chocolate.  It filled me up, and seemed to make me have a little energy,  I plan on using these as after workout drinks, or even after too much  indulging in the wine, I think these would help!  Lol.  So I am pleased with the price, the packaging ( recycle) and the taste.  Also happy that this brand has been rated the best out of the top 3, for it's "quality".
1	1328054400	Maybe I just got unlucky, but the water I got is yellow (is it supposed to be?), smells a bit funny and tastes bitter.  Took one sip and spat it out.  Maybe it got spoiled.  Sucks that I cant return it, $25 wasted.  I'd suggest you try Nirvana or other brands instead, so far every shipment I got from Nirvana coconut water was good, and its actually cheaper per oz (also Thai coconuts)
5	1327968000	Wow.  This drink is awesome. So awesome that I picked up the phone and called the friend who recommended it to me immediately after my first sip of it to thank him.  Everyone else who I've introduced it to is equally hooked.  The best ways to describe the taste are 1) the leftover milk in a bowl of cocoa puffs cereal or 2) upgraded yoohoo.  Also worth noting is that several people who do not like the taste of plain coconut water are in love with this chocolate version.
2	1327795200	It does not taste like pure coconut water,Its taste like some drink with coconut flavour. I wouldn't prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs. they taste better than these bottled drink.
4	1327622400	I have been receiving Zico coconut water for the past several months . I totally enjoy the product, a good source of potassium and electrolytes,a good value and the convenience of home delivery.
2	1327622400	I based my purchase entirely upon user feedback.  It may be the packaging (non-hermetic) that is impacting the taste, but this product was simply bland.  I reviewed the ingredients and is is reconstituted.  Perhaps coconut looses flavor during the dehydration process.  Nonetheless, I will struggle through the remaining 10 bottles and cancel my Amazon subscription for it.  Off to the next brand...
3	1327536000	I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with "natural mango flavor" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again.
5	1327017600	Chocolate Zico is great!! Though I should start with the fact that we don't really enjoy Coconut Water as a whole.  The regular (non-flavored) is great mixed with OJ or in a smoothie, but the flavor is not that appealing.  I know people love the stuff, we just have not developed a taste for it yet.The Chocolate however, is not like typical coconut water as it also has some coconut cream and yummy dark chocolate.  The flavor is reminicent to Yoohoo, but without that milky taste or concerns of lactose digestability.  It is rich tasting, but not heavy.  We often drink it after a Bikram Yoga class and it hits the spot.  Not knowing much about cocounut water and it's benefits, we are learning quickly, there are many.
5	1327017600	Doctor Oz best coconut water, delivers what it says. Love the taste! Takes me back home when I drink directly from coconut! I purchase the liters and taste great! Packaging is perfect no leaks! This is the only brand I have tried so cannot comment on the other brands out there.
5	1326931200	Loved the drink.  Just wish it did not cost as much as it does.  However, love the drink.  Tastes like an Almond Joy.
4	1326499200	I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised?  Does the value justify the cost?  Does it improve my life?  I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONDelicious, healthy, effective.  I recommend this to anyone doing long cardio sessions, or to anyone who regularly consumes protein powder.FUNCTIONALITYCoconut water is best used as a recovery drink in my opinion.  I mix up my protein powder with equal parts water, coconut water, and sometimes hemp milk for some extra substance.  It's more important to get your sugars back in line after a workout than it is to get the protein ingested immediately.  I've also tried using coconut water during my workouts, but I got mild stomach cramps so I gave up on that idea.VALUEAs a disclaimer, I don't really pay attention to what my food costs.  I like this stuff, and it's a great recovery drink, so I just buy it by the case.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?I like feeling good about what I'm eating/drinking, and I like understanding where it comes from.  Coconut water scratches both those itches, and it tastes good.
5	1326412800	It's the first time I've tried this brand and I love it! I've tried Vita Coco and some other brands and they were just "ok" for taste. In fact, they tasted flat and stale. This brand is very fresh and delicious, I am enjoying it so much! I've also tried O.N.E brand, and the taste is very similar. I'd buy both Zico and O.N.E. again..but Zico was a little cheaper! great deal!
5	1326326400	I love this water, its good for your body and great tasting... also it was mentioned to be one of the best on Dr.OZ.
5	1326240000	I am a personal trainer and always looking for alternative supplements and unique products that can be effective for hydration and recovery.  This product is great for hydration during and after a hard workout.  It taste great and should not adversely affect blood sugar in those that have reasons for concern.
5	1325721600	We saw a comparison of coconut water brands on Dr. Oz. At the time, we were subscribing to Vita Coco.Zico has the fresh taste and consistency of real natural coconut water, whereas Vita Coco has a taste that suggests it is not as fresh or not as pure. Zico is more like fresh-squeezed.The only reason we had purchased the Vita Coco brand initially was that it seemed more available in local stores (as a backup, we love you Amazon and would never ever go to the store if we didn't have to).Zico packaging was the same as VC in my opinion and has no issues. We ordered the 33.8-ounce 6-pack to make the cost much less comparable to VC's 12-pack of 11.1-ounce cartons, and that seems to have been a happy accident as a space-saver (for us) in the refrigerator. Now one container looks right instead of 3 or 4 of the other.
5	1325635200	This is a great product.  My whole family (including my 20 month old) loves it!  This coconut water is not as sweet as some of the others I have tried.  Would highly recommend this product.
2	1325548800	I subscribed to this product after reading the reviews and deciding this was the best bang for my buck. The first shipment tasted fine, I was pleased with my decision. The last two shipments though have tasted off. They taste kind of like bread or cardboardy I guess. I don't know what happened but I just cancelled my subscription. I thought maybe it was just a bad batch, so I waited for the next shipment but it was bad too.Perhaps my first shipment was the bad batch :-s it's a shame, I really liked the first shipment and I'm trying to use coconut water to wean myself off soda. Oh well.
5	1325376000	Only 60 calories. Higher potassium than a banana. Slightly sweet but only 12g of sugars.I prefer the bottle taste to the carton flavor. This is my new pickup after pickup soccer.
5	1325289600	This is a wonderful beverage to enjoy daily while pregnant!  I am 6 months preg and started feeling dizzy/lightheaded.  OB said to drink more liquids but I still have morning sickness and liquids before 10 AM dont stay down.  I tried several different coconut waters and found this Zico chocolate, ONE with guava and Naked plain to be the three I prefer.  This Zico chocolate is my favorite!  It is good in the morning when milk is too heavy and fruit juice is unappealing.  I feel much better after a couple of weeks drinking 1-2 coconut waters a day in addition to as much regular water I can stomach.  It is an expensive habit, but prescription anti nausea pills or going to the ER from dehydration is more expensive.
1	1325203200	worst coconut water ever, period.I saw them in my local BJs and thought of trying it, the taste was horrible, had an artificial flavor to it which remains in ur breath for some time. I thought of trying after my 6 mile run, and even then I couldnt drink it. had to return it and then bought some good coconut water from a local asian store (realcocowater) and it tastes much better and doesnt have any artificial flavor like this.I would not even give it a one star if possible.Dont buy this, its a waste of money
2	1325116800	Taste is highly subjective but I'll add my opinion here.  I usually buy fresh coconuts from Asian supermarkets or grocery stores.  I've also had fresh coconut water while traveling to Hawaii, Bali, Thailand and Malaysia.This is the first time I have tried RTD coconut water. While the packaging is attractive, the flavor just doesn't work for me.  In fact, it tastes sour and slightly artificial to me, like it is a chemical mixture of some sort.  I prefer coconut water that is sweeter and more aromatic.I stopped my subscription after two deliveries and have tried a few other brands.  I am pleased to have found another brand that I like more.  I think the only way to find one that tastes good is to try them all until you find one you like.  Good luck!
5	1324944000	I love coconut water, but usually stay away from the flavored options. Tried this on a fluke, while in an airport, and thought it was delicious. It tastes very similar to a Yoohoo, if you're familiar with that drink. Not quite the "refreshing" taste that I think the plain coconut water has, but definitely a tasty beverage that I find enjoyable. If you like chocolate, this is a good beverage.
5	1324857600	Flavourful coconut taste and in a sturdy-package...difficult to damage cardboard carton....however, every two or three shipments brought a plastic top with damage or the collar where the plastic meets the cardboard separated and leaking.  Amazon is wonderful about replacements, but it's a shame the container isn't a bit more dependable.  I do recommend Zico as my second best choice....Amy and Brian being first, but talk about damaged containers!!  Had to cancel my purchases from Amy and Brian due to so many cans being dented and mangled.
2	1324598400	Coconut water tastes ok as far as bottled coconut water goes. The real thing is what I have grown up on, so I have to settle. But I don't like this bottle, the packets should be better. When you open the wrapper, you have to be careful because there are plastic pieces as sharp as a knife still hanging around and you can cut your finger or lip on it...I have!
1	1324598400	I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of "natural flavors", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons:ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12).These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks.
5	1324339200	This mango Zico I've only had for the first time.  It issooooo delicious. and if it's all what it says (more potassium than a banana,zero sugar, better than sports drinks, etc), then that's FANTASTIC. Also it arrived quickly and in great condition. I will definately order again and will try other flavors as well. YUM!!!!!
1	1324252800	This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut.  The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and it's not bad but it's better than this Zico.  Zico does not taste fresh at all.  If you don't breath, you can drink it down.  I'm going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom; I hope she likes it!  Ewww!
4	1324252800	Delicious product; on par with the other brands. Really there's no difference between ONE/ZICO/VITA. I just get whatever's on sale.
5	1323907200	I love this coconut water and it has all the nutrients it says it has. Great for hydrating while working out!
1	1323907200	Each pak is sealed well. But the liquid is cloudy yellow and very bitter, with no coconut flavor or odor at all, so I don't know if it tastes the way it's supposed to. Please let me know if this is normal for this brand or not. I'm tempted to throw them all out.
5	1323734400	I bought two 12 packs of ZICO coconut water for preparing an Ayurvedic medicine. I thought of buying the less expensive items but since this is for a medicine for kidney Stone i decided on the natural stuff.  Coming from a place in India, called Kerala ( which translates to land of Coconut), and surrounded with coconut trees, I was skeptic about the quality of bottled Coconut water. I don't say this is as tasty and pure as real coconut water right from the tree, but ZICO did exceptionally good in this case.It is tasty, it is pure coconut water....
2	1323648000	Coconut water not for me, but will keep it in my emergency kit...just in case we get any more of those earthquakes and it nocks out power for awhile....lol!
5	1323648000	Luv this drink.  Hot yoga classes turned me onto it & now I am addicted after every workout!  Chocolate is hands down the best flavor!
1	1323475200	With regular coconut water I feel calm when drinking it. This doesn't have it. Plus the taste is weird. Stay away!
5	1323475200	I haven't tried every brand, but I've tried ONE and Vita Coco and found that I prefer the taste of ZICO. I can't provide a very complex comparison as I've been drinking ZICO for a while, but the one word that comes to my mind as far as the taste, compared to the other brands is "cleaner." It just tastes more refreshing and I use it as a substitute for Gatorade or Powerade after workouts and athletic activities. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good-tasting coconut water that is not from concentrate. Also worth noting is that the Amazon price is a bit better than the prices at local supermarkets: I've been happily subscribing and saving to it for over a year now :).
4	1323388800	I have tried Vita Coca and Zico. First,  I like the taste of Zico better. Also, saw a review of 3 coconut drink products on TV and Zico was the only product that met their claims. The others fell short. So now it's Zico !
4	1323216000	The coconut water tastes good, it's like most other coconut waters on the market. Good coconut flavor, a little salty from the electrolytes, but overall pretty good.The pineapple "flavor" however, ruins it. At the price I bought it for, $6 on Amazon Warehouse, I'd buy it again, because coconut water is usually fairly expensive and the stuff is still decent, but the pineapple is like a bad afterthought, like your in-laws staying over for a week and then telling you they'll be here 2 more nights.
4	1323129600	MY SON PREFERS ZICO AND I PREFER VITACOCO.  Both are delicious and extremely healthy for you.When I order I get both.  My family thinks Zico is less sweet than Vitacoco and like it a tad better.  It is a very close second to Vitacoco in my book.  By the way, each family member drinks at least two a day.  These drinks have replaced soda.
5	1323043200	It was all I had expected from this drink. come to find out it's also available in a variety of other flavors.  I would recommend it to all.  I bought a case and now know its also available locally at Target!! Yeah  just not in bulk.  A def. good buy!
4	1323043200	I don't think I would want to drink it daily as it's a little on the sweeter side. If I keep it room temperature and then pour over crushed ice it tastes just like chocolate milk which is novel as I don't consume any dairy. I don't think I would like it without being over ice, though. My kids use coconut water for workout recovery drink. Thought they might like this for a change but both find it too sweet to drink straight from the bottle.
5	1322870400	I work as a swim instructor during the summer and this really helps keep me hydrated and it taste great!! My cousin told me about it, I tried it and have been hooked ever since! It also helped me get back to normal after a day or two stomach virus!!I recommend this to all my friends and coworkers.
1	1322697600	I love coconut water, but I was gagging when I drank this. It just tasted yucky.  I wouldn't buy it again.
5	1322524800	I received my case of Zico Coconut Water within the two days advertised by "Amazon Prime".  It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any "hidden" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.
5	1321833600	When I told her I was a distance runner, my Naturapathic Doctor recommended that I drink coconut water after my runs as a good recovery drink.  I bought several brands and flavors and tried them.  I found the Zico to be the best tasting, and I really like the chocolate.  This stuff has great electrolytes and way more potassium than a banana ([...]).I keep them in the refrigerator and chug one after my runs.  If I run a race or drive to my runs, I often stick a couple in a small cooler to drink afterward.The price here is less than my local grocery store, and you can't beat Amazon Prime shipping.
4	1321315200	I guess I started drinking this water after they changed something, because I think Zico is great. A lot of the reviews on here claim they changed the formula which affected the taste, which is definitely possible, but I started drinking the water in July of 2010. I have an auto-subscription on Amazon buying two cases a month and I drink them all before my next batch arrives. I'd love to taste the old formula, one reviewer claimed Zico was putting the original Brazilian coconut water back on the market, but that was back in September. I will continue to buy the bottled version of Zico until I am convinced there is a better product. If you know of the new formula please comment on this review. I am very satisfied with the taste of "Natural" flavored Zico water. I do not care for the Pineapple or Chocolate versions. I have not tried the others.
5	1321315200	The taste is incredible!!! I was nervous because it was chocolate flavored but I have yet to find someone in my office who doesn't like it!! I am a HUGE fan!! Ordered 3 more cases!!
1	1320969600	This is the first time I have tried this product.  I have never had the original formula so I can't compare it to what was a highly rated product.  At first the taste is somewhat pleasant but not very natural tasting and then there is a lingering aftertaste.  I will not buy this again and do not recommend it.  I want to try other brands. I think I will enjoy it because coconut water is not very sweet, low calorie and high in potassium.
1	1320883200	The Onion News Network skit on Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water is right on the money!This product tastes like rancid ball-sweat.  How anyone could enjoy it is completely beyond me.
5	1320883200	Tastes like a YooHoo- but so much healtier. I'm on my second case. I will continuethe monthly auto ship!!
5	1320710400	I was very skeptical when I ordered these, but have made a great find! I don't love regular chocolate milk because it is much too thick and sweet for me. The Zico Chocolate is not thick at all, not overly sweet and NOT at all as coconut tasting as I feared it would be. I also found this drink to be a great energy booster between my mid-afternoon teaching schedule. I have to skip lunch and am running low on energy, but these electrolytes really help get me through to 6PM!
4	1320537600	I saw this on sale and decided to try it out. It is very refreshing, yet tastes like watered down coconut juice. That's not a bad thing, just not used to that at all.All in all a good alternative to soda pop!
5	1320451200	I love coconut juice and though nothing beats getting fresh coconut juice out of a fresh young coconut, that's usually available fresh only in tropical locations. If I'm buying it from a supermarket, the freshness factor is gone anyway, so I figured I might as well go for the tetra-pack version.I have tried several brands at local stores, and frankly can't tell if one is really way better than the others, but since Amazon started selling Zico on Subscribe-n-Save, I started ordering these.The 12-pack is convenient. The first week I was hooked and had one every day (kinda expensive I must say). Now, I relish one every once in a while, and keep one along when I go for tennis. Bottle would have been better for drinking during a game, but then tetra pack is probably better for the environment.The natural sugars and minerals found in coconut water (including a healthy dose of potassium, which tennis players are usually recommended to get from bananas) definitely make it an excellent sports hydrator.Overall a great alternative to sports drinks as well as soda/juice/beer for the times when you want more than just water.
5	1320451200	So healthy and good for you, and it tastes great. I know that's a personal view, but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters I have tried. No added sugar, and so not too sweet.The pack of six x 33.8oz cartons are great value too.
4	1320364800	I got this item on sale.  A good deal! This was just plain coconut water. Don't expect the highly sweetened coconut flavor you find as a flavor in drinks. I don't think I'll get it again. How much coconut water can one person drink?
5	1320105600	This product is very refreshing and is a great natural alternative to things like sports drinks.  Natural electrolytes.  In Brazil they give people coconut water after they have had surgery because they believe it promotes healing.  I have tried several brands and this one is my favorite.
5	1320019200	Zico coconut water takes me to the sandy beaches of the Dominican Republic where they pick the coconut right off the tree, cut it open and hand you a straw to drink the milk.  Zico is the next best thing to being there!
5	1320019200	Delicious drink without being sugary.  Healthy and nutritious.  My family drinks it like water.No problem since  it's better than what we used to drink.  Tastes like its right out of the coconut.
1	1320019200	It's not at all what I expected. I was hoping for a real coconut flavor but what I got was a washed out very bland tasting flavor! I will keep looking for another product!
5	1319673600	A great replacement for the expensive stuff in the grocery store. Just not the most potent Potassiun content as other waters.
5	1319587200	I bought 4 cases of these back in June based on all the 5 star reviews. I'm now about to order 4 more. I have lost 35+ pounds since mid-June and this drink has been a small part of that. The taste is so good that I haven't craved (or missed) regular chocolate milk at all. Typically I make one bottle last for 2-3 servings. You don't need a lot to satisfy your chocolate craving. Just give it a shake, open and enjoy. I hope they never change the recipe for this. I'm hooked.
5	1319587200	First and foremost I received my order right away. The plain doesn't have a pleasant taste but I mix it with other stuff and use it for the benefits of coconut water. I recommend this seller.
5	1319587200	First and foremost I received my order right away. This doesn't taste icky like plain coconut water but rather like a chocolate milk using water instead of milk. There's nothing creamy about the taste. It does taste very clean and light. I'm on monthly delivery. I recommend this seller.
5	1319587200	I am currently 9 months pregnant and have been hooked on this stuff for the past two months (since I heard about it).  It is extremely thirst quenching, and has a great dark chocolate flavor.  It's also nice to know that it's very healthy for me to get my chocolate fix!  LOVE IT!  I just wish it wasn't so expensive, but the best price I'm finding is on Amazon compared to local stores around me.
3	1319500800	I have ordered 4 or 5 times from Amazon and brought 2 times from local grocery stores. My experience with Amazons 30% deal has been odd. Every time i ordered on a special 15% off (amazon coupon) the taste has been really bad. I had vita coco and zico both. every time i order using regular rate , the taste is good. the taste from grocery was good both the times especially vita coco. i am not sure if this is true with others.
5	1319500800	I have tried numerous brands of Coconut Water and this is one of the best.  The container really comes in handy, because you don't always want to drink an entire container in one sitting.  This bottle allows you to finish later or even another day.  I highly recommend this product and I suggest replacing your sugary sports drinks with this product.  Try it!
5	1319414400	I drink coconut water after - working out, a long day or really for any reason at all. Zico has the best tasting coconut water. Most other brands have the aftertaste of the container they are in but not Zico. Even my 18 month old loves drinking it.
4	1319328000	I love this water.  It does not taste good unless it is very, very cold, but when it is cold, especially if slushy, it's fantastic!  I don't care for other brands of coconut water, or the ones in the cardboard package, but I really like the bottles!
5	1319328000	The Coconut water I received was exactly as expected. Packaging could have been a little bit better as the bottles were all loose in the box.
1	1319241600	I purchased several of these the other day after all of the hype I've heard surrounding them.Long story short, they taste awful. I can't quite place the taste, but it just reminds me of something that's very stale and expired tasting. Very unpleasant, to the point where I threw out the bottle after a few sips.
5	1319241600	I took a few sips of this stuff, and couldn't help but wonder what all the 5* reviews were for. To me, the taste kind of reminds me of those chocolatey breakfast shakes.However, by the end of the bottle my opinion was completely changed. It has a very good, sweet chocolate taste. Even better, this stuff is killer for hangovers. I was walking around with a headache and general malaise all day - picked up one of these, drank it, and within an hour or two my headache and general unease was completely gone. I'm sold on this product.
5	1319155200	I've had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me. It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands. This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There's also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth!
1	1318896000	I have eight of these bottles sitting in my cupbard and unfortunately I cannot get myself to drink them. Awful after taste in the plastic bottle. Will not buy this product again. The boxed version tastes much better.
1	1318723200	I have bought Zico Coconut Water from this buyer twice. The first shipment was fast and tasted great! On the second shipment, all of the tetra paks I've opened were bad. The water was not clear or sweet but a yellow and sour. I feel very mixed on this product from this seller since I've had mixed results in product. I'm not sure if there is anything they can do to ensure the quality of the product (maybe the 2nd shipment quality was due to lack of proper storing conditions?).
5	1318550400	I think this is one of the best brands of the best juice you can buy. I have had a couple of lids come off but have not expierenced any leaking. Please bring them back.
1	1318550400	After having had Zico in bottled form, we were excited to find this product on Amazon for a great price.  We even chose the option that reships you automatically at our chosen interval and ordered 4 cases.  I was looking forward to a refreshing coconut water upon my return home, but instead I got a rancid disappointment.  Every single case had gone bad.  All yellow in color, not clear, and rancid tasting.  Talk about being bummed-out.The one positive experience regarding this purchase was the Amazon customer service agent who assisted us when we called to notify them.  She was very professional and understanding, and resolved the situation without difficulty for us.
5	1318464000	Starting off- I hate the taste of coconut water. I like coconuts, coconut milk and things that are flavored with coconut, but the water is aweful! I have been only drinking the chocoloate coconut water (which is mixed w/a little coconut cream), but at 110 calories and sugars added I decided that I need to expand my horizons. I did hesitate b/c I read many of the reviews and some people received bad batches (if I were this person, I would have definately contacted the company)- however my batch was good! And while this doesn't taste like the chocolate coconut water (which tastes like slightly watery chocolate milk), this is pretty decent and I will continue my subscription.
2	1318464000	I ordered 4 count of 12 packs ..and one pack was so good and pure..and some of them are spoiled..may be they are from spoiled coconuts..Zico should take care of these issuesZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)
1	1318377600	Been using ONE for almost two months.. I really like it.. It has subtle sweetness like coconut water does and tastes fresh and natural.. Always makes me feel fresh..Saw that Costco start selling Zico. Compared to 17$ that I have been paying for ONE through amazon, 14$ from Costco for Zico sounded a deal as I will use two 12-packs per month and bought a 12-pack.First impression: Does not taste natural. It has distinct made-from-concentrate taste..  Not sure why when it says it is natural.. No sweetness like ONE does... infact no taste at all.. Does not leave that refreshing feel... Even my 5 year old daughter said the same thing after taking a sip. Not impressed..I will stick with 17$ ONE.
5	1318291200	I have been drinking coconut water regularly for the last six months or so. I tested pretty much every brand out there and found that Zico has the best product available. The water is fresh and free of any weird additives.  The container used by Zico is solid and fits perfectly in any refrigerator.I recommend this product to anyone who want to enjoy the health benefits of coconut water.
5	1318204800	After tasting several different brands of coconut water, I have found Zico to have the best taste and consistency of flavor. It's the perfect post-workout drink. Not to mention it helps with recuperation after a night out. It truly is amazing stuff!Buying the 12 pack from Amazon is great because I have only been able to find it for single bottle purchase at organic groceries and health stores, where you pay a premium. It's been far cheaper to buy a case at a time and, if you set up automatic purchasing, you not only receive a new box without having to get online every few weeks, but you get a 15% discount off their regular price (which is already cheaper than buying at the local stores).
3	1318204800	Dr. Oz recommended this brand of coconut water.  I bought a bottle at Target.  They charged me $2, which is less than the Amazon price.
5	1318204800	Love chocolate coconut water (even though I hate the taste of plain coconut water.) This is great for the day after too much wine, when you have a cold or any other time that you need some serious hydration.
5	1318204800	I started hearing about coconut water several years ago, but it generally struck me as dirty dish water when I would try to drink it. Then Zico came along. I've been a Zico convert now for about four months, and I can literally feel the difference this product makes in my body chemistry. There are indeed other coconut water products out there that are similar, but Zico hits the sweet spot with price, size, and quality of product.
2	1318118400	Maybe because I grew up in the tropics and know real taste of coconut water. I bought from a local grocery store. Tasted like the older coconuts with the thicker white meat, where the water is beginning to ferment. Subtle vinegar taste. But I guess it's not the real thing (direct from the young coconut). Maybe closest to the real thing? I don't know if there's a better one out there. But have tasted sweet coconut water from those asian markets that sell the whole shell but then again there is the debate of the shell being treated with chemicals so they don't brown. The inside itself is not affected so I heard, and that what matters is how you open and pour it. The real deal is the natural organic coconut direct from the coconut tree. If you can find one. Good luck.
2	1318118400	The taste of Zico was growing on me and I really liked it but feel like I have been misled.  Zico is now made from concentrate.  I'm sure they mix it with filtered water and it's fine but it is not straight from a coconut as some of the other brands are.  ie; I'm not going to buy orange juice from concentrate when I can get fresh squeezed for less!
4	1318032000	I ordered this looking at one show on TV which said this product has lot more vitamins and minerals as compared to other brands. I drink a lot of coconut water after exercising. When I tasted it for the first time, the taste of zico was weird; it tastes like plastic mixed with coconut water- but it does not actually have any plastic. It is just that the coconut water has a different taste. It is not sweet and tastes very bland. But after trying out 12 bottles, I found my older brand to be very sweet. My husband likes Zico better so I guess I am going to alternate the subscription between Zico and the other brand.
1	1318032000	I've tried Zico, O.N.E.  and Vita Coco. They are all mass marketed and have long shelf lives.Zico has really sold out by filling shelves with chocolate, pineapple and whatever else artificial flavors to make their drinks taste better. Personally, I think they all taste like crap compared to Harmless Harvest' Raw Coconut Water. It is the real stuff and hasn't been in a warehouse for months. They use a heatless, high pressure system to pasteurize which is the way the market is trending.Guess Zico made a ton of money while on top so this stuff will still sell by sheer volume. Harmless Harvest is available in whole foods in the tri-state area and then nationally whenever this winter. Hopefully Amazon will get it!
2	1317945600	I love drinking Zico's coconut water.  In camparison to all others, I find ZICO's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as I'm from an Island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage.  HOWEVER, their packaging certainly makes a difference DO NOT purchase ZICO's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience "PLASTIC".  ZICO's carton packing is much, much better!!!  ENJOY
5	1317772800	the price is not bad on amazon..BUT it is cheeper at Trader joe's if there one near you. it's just $2.00 / bottle
1	1317772800	I bought two cases of ZICO in the plastic bottles, they were SO gross. =[ Every sip tasted like plastic. I tried one from each case, same result. I've had a couple ZICOs in a plastic bottle before and they were fine but these two cases I got were really bad. The one in the tetras taste a lot better.
2	1317686400	I didn't like this brand of coconut water it has a strange after taste.  There are other brands out there that are a lot better.
5	1317600000	Not sure where all the bad reviews are comming from, I bought two cases to take camping with me. The first bottle tasted just as good as the last.
1	1317513600	I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as "Pure Premium Coconut Water" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is "Plastic".I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for "Vita Coco".I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is "vent it out" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me.
5	1317427200	I come from a tropical country, Malaysia, so I know how coconut water straight from the tree tastes. I missed the taste ever since coming Stateside 6 years ago, and so I bought a 6 pack of Zico.I gotta say, it's the closest thing to fresh coconut water I've tasted thus far. I heard that the liter bottles are from Thailand, while their Tetra bottles are from Brazil. Glad I bought the liter ones.In fact, right after writing this review, I'll be buying a dozen bottles.As for some people's comments on packaging issues, it says on the cardboard box NOT to lift the bottles by the cap. All six of mine came in perfect shape.
3	1317427200	ehhhhh!  Just got back from Jamaica and enjoyed fresh from the tree.  this stuff tastes a bit sour.  Make sure you've tasted this before and that you like it before buying a whole case...  I'd stick w/ a tiny bit of sugar added to those other brands that really makes it taste fantastic.
1	1317427200	I hate to say this but I've been enjoying automatic shipments of zico since the beginning, and yesterday when I received my 5 box order I noticed the packaging is a bit different. Well, I chilled the water as per usual and this morning it tasted disgusting!!! Unfortunately I dont think its a bad case, I think zico adjusted their recipe and it is sooooooo bad. Has a sourish taste to it now where before you could tell it was just plain coconut water. This is very disappointing to me being that I am a runner and drink 2 cartons a day, I will have to check out other coconut waters now...I always preferred zico over vita coco and ONE but not anymore. My expiration on all 5 cases is april 2012 and its a shame they adjusted their recipe!! I couldn't even choke it down!! Well zico, I think you are going to lose some customers because of this...very unfortunate!!
5	1317254400	I LOVE Coconut Water so when they came out with Chocolate Flavored Coconut Water, I was excited!This tastes to me a lot like nonfat chocolate milk but you get the added benefits of Coconut Water.I've been trying to lose a couple of extra pounds and whenever I get the urge for a late night snack or my sweet tooth sneaks up on me, I drink my Chocolate Coconut Water and it ALWAYS satisfies my craving for sweets!What a lifesaver!
1	1317254400	Product arrived this morning. Put it in fridge all day. Just took a couple sips. This stuff is absolutely gross. They have done something to ruin this product.Someone has been stealing food from the fridge at work, so I'm going to put the remaining ones there.If you get a batch with an APR 21, 2012 expiration, spare yourself and throw it out. (Or poison your enemy.)
1	1317254400	This is a terrible product. It just tastes like cocoa and water, no coconut water flavor/taste. Plus at the bottom of the bottle there are chunks of undissolved cocoa. Beware chocolate lovers you will be disappointed.
5	1317254400	I've never been a big "health nut" and but when a "health nut" friend of mine had me try a Zico coconut water drink (plain) I was under the continued opinion that stuff that's "healthy" for us isn't healthy for the tongue (i.e. taste).  It wasn't until I was at the local supermarket and tried the Zico Chocolate Coconut Water and fell in love with my first "health drink".I would strongly recommend that you try this great drink before supplies run out!  It's a very popular drink and according to the agriculture website coconuts are becoming harder to get because of the broadened use of coconut water and milk.  So as I said TRY it before they run out.
3	1317168000	This coconut water's taste is pretty bad, I couldn't even finish the whole thing, hopefully its really as good as they say it is or this drink is not really worth it
1	1317168000	I would never buy this again. Tastes like a bad medicine. The chocolate does not help. I suggest to buy the coconut water without the chocolate flavor.
1	1317168000	The product description says that 11OZ contains Brazil coconut water. The one I received says "Product of Thailand". Be aware of the false information.The taste was ok. I ordered 34OZ before and I didn't liked the taste. I ordered these to see if Brazil coconut water makes any difference. No use. It has same taste as 34OZ one.
4	1317168000	I love coconut water... and I love chocolate and putting them together only seemed like a match made in heaven. The first time I tried it I became hooked but once you are 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through the 12pk I felt like I may have had enough of it and wanted just plain coconut water. I definitely like the chocolate flavor but it is more of "I need to be in the mood" type of thing rather than being able to drink it daily like I can with plain.
1	1317081600	This is made from concentrate with added coconut flavor.not nearly as good as fresh cocounut juice, or coconout water that is not reconstituted.
4	1317081600	boo hiss!  Ok, the nutritional values are ok. If that is your goal, then go for it. Coconut water is packed with electrolytes. Very hydrating.  If you are wondering if it will taste like your beloved coconut water........not so much. It is not bad, just not what I was hoping for.  If you are not a person that regularly consumes fresh coconuts, this may not mean much to you.  I am rating a 4 because I can appreciate the strive for something healthy.  On the other hand, the taste just did not do it for me.  Back to going ninja on the coconuts with the cleaver.....
5	1316822400	This is the taste I've been looking for since I'm an Asian who grew up around the coconut trees. Nothing but coconut water! No Vit. C, no sugar just pure coconut water.
5	1316736000	This is the only coconut water that I really like. I have tried others but they almost made me sick. This has a fresh clean taste that I really like. I hope all the batches stay the same.
5	1316563200	This is a great  coconut water.I personally prefer flavors( which zico makes wonderfully)Also, love the soft box packaging.
5	1316563200	This is a great tasting coconut water.My son likes gatorade and he also likesthis and it is much better for him.Great for him after football practice.
5	1316563200	This is a really great tasting coconut water.i prefer the flavored compared to regular andthis is a real sweet treat.I also love the bottle because it is easyto take with you.
5	1316476800	Quite possibly the best coconut water int he market today. Dont believe me, try it. Zico has the best young coconuts. THe tetra-pack ensures that the water stays fresh and tastes great. I had a pack sitting in for 6 months and just 3 days prior to my expiration date, I opened it up. Was still perfect!
4	1316476800	I've been drinking this brand for years now cause it was available at my local grocery store. Recently I switched to another brand and that switch was so cool. Anyway, ZiCO is good, but needs to have better flavors available. Plain coconut flavor is good too. but I like mine flavored.
5	1316390400	The most refreshing drink you can buy.(MHO)Wish the trees would grow here in Colorado so I could get the coconut jelly too.
1	1316304000	HATE it, it tastes like dirt, and it is not returnable. Would anyone like to buy an unopened case from me?
5	1316304000	This is an outstanding product!  But Amazon's price is too high, even their Subscribe & Save price.  You can buy it cheaper at Trader Joe's.
5	1316304000	But I did, so I drank all the coconut water myself and didn't have to share.  These were a good price compared to the ones in stores.
5	1316304000	I really liked this coconut water and got to drink all of them myself without hiding any in back of the old bottles of salad dressing because the rest of the family didn't care for them.
1	1316217600	this product WAS good enough that i had a 'subscribe and save' order set up to receive regular shipments...but the flavor has been getting progressively worse, and i've finally given up. no idea what happened, but the latest order tasted like bad dishwater (perhaps slightly coconut flavored) and there's really no point in drinking it. i cancelled my recurring order and got a refund for the last batch--kudos to amazon.used to recommend it highly and drink it daily, but no longer. bummer.
5	1316131200	Although some compare this flavor to chocolate milk, it goes down much smoother (less creamy, more refreshing like coconut water). Bonus, it has less fat and sugar than chocolate milk!
5	1316131200	Hi everyone I am Thai and I have not yet tried this product.I saw the ad and just want to stop by to share you guys about my experience.I am just amazed how pricey coconut water could be.In Thailand, you can buy fresh coconut with water inside for $ 1-2 only !!However, I admit that the packaging looks attractive and makes the product valuable
1	1316131200	I have been drinking Zico coconut water for sometime. One day I saw Zico Chocolate Coconut water. So gave it a try. well, to me it was chocolate drink but my expectation of a coconut water was not there.I threw rest of the bottle and kept my distance from this drink.Agreed that Zico coconut water is not the best coconut water but it is close enough to enjoy without any other ingredient in it and definitely not chocolate.
5	1316044800	This my friends is perfection among coconut water. I love all of Zico varieties  but this one is the best.
5	1316044800	There are other brands of coconut water available but ZICO has the best taste by far.  I'm not sure why this is because all the other brands claim to be "pure coconut water" but they are not as refreshing as ZICO coconut water.  I wish ZICO was more readily available locally.  My BJ's club was carrying the natural flavor (which I favor) on a trial basis but now it has sold out and not available......how does that work?  They have a product which sells out because people like it and they don't reorder?????  My advice? Buy ZICO brand coconut water on the internet.
5	1316044800	While I love chocolate, I normally do not like chocolate flavored things. You know, things that aren't chocolate but are meant to taste like chocolate, such as chocolate Bonne Bell Lip Smackers, chocolate flavored Skittles, and cheap "chocolate" easter candy. I thought this would taste like super-watery chocolate milk and kept the first bottle I bought in the fridge for a month because I was too scared to try it, but I was completely wrong. It's delicious!!! If I had to describe the taste, it would be like melted dark chocolate gelato with a hint of coconut. I work at a small, outrageously overpriced local grocery store and we are selling it there for 2 dollars over the price of the per unit adjustment of a case here on Amazon (though I bought my bottle at one of those trendy chain health food stores for 1 dollar more over Amazon's price). So buy one bottle to see if you like it, and order the rest on Amazon. These prices can't be beat.
5	1315958400	Love this product, we used to drink real green Coconut water in India, and it was very close to that test. I never had any can or packed coconut water this much close to real test. LOVE it and advise others to try.
1	1315958400	This tastes like its been watered down a lot. Way more watery then any other brands I have tried. Stay away.
1	1315958400	I've recently started consuming Coconut water daily.  We live in Bahrain, and I was buying Taste Nirvana brand on the military base, but they sell out as soon as they come in. I'm also spending close to $9 sometimes on the fresh young coconuts from the grocery, but realized that was quickly adding up! So, I thought I'd save money, and keep my supply filled with an automated monthly shipment.BAD IDEA.Since, my shipment of 24 came, I am disgusted everytime I try and drink one.  Thinking that maybe they were just "bad" sour coconuts, I've kept trying.  After 6, from different packages... I've come to the conclusion, it is NOT just a fluke, and Zico's coconut water is horrible!  It tastes SOUR and filthy! I wondered why Zico and other companies sell the coconut waters flavored with other so called "juices", because coconut water in and of itself, is refreshing, & simply delish! Taste Nirvana is comparable to fresh!  (Sidenote: I bought the plain "Pure Premium Coconut Water")So, with that said, I wanted to make sure I put a review out there for everyone to read.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It tastes as if it could be dangerous, or toxic if consumed.AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! I think the coconut water was expired prior to bottling.  YUCK!!!!P.S. The positive reviews obviously came from either people who don't have tastebuds, or DO NOT know what FRESH COCONUT WATER should taste like.  THIS IS NOT COCONUT WATER!!!!Danielle H.
5	1315958400	This stuff is amazing.  Somewhat healthy and tastes like a chocolate shake.  Recommend buying if you like coconut.  Shake it up good, though.
5	1315699200	This coconut water taste far superior than any coconut water i have ever tasted. Compare to a fresh coconut it is better because once chilled its taste enhances by two folds. I got this on promotion for $13 per case, I definitely will have to buy more once I finish mine.
1	1315699200	Maybe it's the fact that Amazon's stock is (apparently) bad, or maybe I don't like Coconut as much as I thought I did (and I like Coconut, so I assume it's the former) but this stuff tastes terrible... I took one sip and poured the rest down the sink.Amazon was kind enough to issue a refund on this order, but until Zico fixes their shipments I'd stay away from this product!
1	1315612800	The coconut water smelled and tasted pretty bad. Amazon folks were gracious enough to issue a refund. I ended up throwing away all the 12 packets. Would not buy this brand again....
5	1315612800	Love this drink for hydrating following a workout. Quenches my thirst like nothing other. I've tried other brands of Coconut H2O, and nothing tastes quite as smooth as this.
1	1315612800	Received the order from Amazon yesterday. I tried it this morning but could not get beyond the awful smell and taste. This must be a bad quality control because I had tried Zico at a local grocery store and the taste was pretty good to me, although I have to admit it was not as good as fresh coconut juice. Just tried the second bottle - same disgusting taste. Gave one to friends to try,they all agreed the taste was really bad. Glad I ordered only one pack (of 12); will not buy this brand again.
1	1315526400	Received my package today and then tried drinking and the first one was bad.. tried second and third they were bad too.. it literally stinks very bad and cant even drink a single drop.. I felt cheated by Zico.. Never should have bought this and should have bought the brand that i always buy. I wasted 16$ on this and i am not going to get it back am i?? since Amazon doesnt let me return this item as per their return policy.
4	1315440000	One of the 6 one liter bottles was damaged at the seam and leaking (not sealed) therefore not safe to consume.  Also these bottles are somewhat short-dated compared to what you can buy in the store right now.  The store expiration dates tend to be around mid-2012 whereas these bottles expire Jan 2012.
1	1315440000	Wow, this batch taste awful!  I had one pack left over that I bought from amazon during June, and it tasted fine.  This new batch tastes totally different.  It's tastes awful, like something went bad.  The expiration date says apr 2012, so I don't know what's going on.  Wonder if I can get a refund for this, just don't think I can bring myself to drinking the rest of the packs.  It's just that bad!
2	1315353600	I started with Vita a week ago, and decided to try all three top brands. Zico is my second try. Although I don't like Vita that much, Zico is definitely worse.Zico coconut water is not sweet at all, which usually is a plus for soft drinks, except this time. It has a sour after taste and your tongue feels dull, NOT refreshing at all.Stay away from this brand.
1	1315353600	i am a huge fan of coconut juice. Living in florida for almost 20 years. i tasted the best source of coconut juice which is directly from the tree. But it's hard to climb the freaking trees. I love Vitacoco, because the taste is the closest to the real taste of coconut. Not recommend zico at all because they have bad quality control, taste horrible.
1	1315267200	This product is really good for you healthy wise. But if you cant swallow it, its a waste of fricken money!! it tastes like a tangy spoiled milk to me. I bought this for my sister. She and I have heard its really good for you and did the research to follow it up. I know not everything good for you tastes/smells pleasant, so you just put it down the hatch because you know its what your body needs to run at a optimal level. But I cant do it with this. And Ive drank all sorts of nasty smelling health stuff. I just cant get over the connection to spoiling milk. My sister is drinking the rest of our package. But Ive noticed that shes been drinking hers with lots of ice and she doesnt do it every day because its so awful. We will not be buying this again. I hope this helps some of the customers looking at this product (even if my opinion is of the miniority).
1	1315267200	I recently purchased a pack of Zico (so call) premium coconut water. In the past I purchased it at a local health food store and because of the price for a 6 oz container I decided to buy it bulk through Amazon. I was so disappointed.  The taste was awful.  I check the expiration date just to make sure that it was not expired but it was not (apr 2012).  The water tasted spoiled and the color was a dark gold (i don't know if that had anything to do with it.
5	1315267200	sounds weird, but it's really good.  It becomes addicting after a while, and it does taste like milk left from chocolate cereal.  When it's really cold it's refreshing.  I tried the pineapple and it is disgusting.  I was unsure and wanted to try coconut water, and this was great.  I can't wait to get more on autoship!
1	1315267200	This is so gross.  Zico should be ashamed!My reflex pulled the bottle back before too much got in my mouth after it hit my tongue.We gave the rest to my sister to put in her work fridge with a sign that said, "Healthy but gross"
5	1315180800	Living in Florida in the summer time is great but, it also dehydrating so, I have learned through friends and then internet information how good coconut water is for you to replenish what your body needs, (I am not a Gatorade fan), I needed to find something that I liked.  I tried other coconut waters and then read how Zico was the best to do what it said it would.  I searched and found the chocolate coconut water and tried it.  Now, I am addicted, it is absolutely delicious.  Great chocolate taste, REAL chocolate taste and not too sweet. It is great just as a pick-me-up chocolate need, that is good for you.  I have both the regular coconut water and the chocolate.  It is a treat!
5	1315180800	Alot of people are trashing this product.  I love it!  It is my breakfast drink each and every day.  And when I skip a day, I can tell.  But Amazon will not want to hear this, but a case at Costco is only $17.99.
1	1315094400	Coconut water is delicious but this is by far the worst tasting coconut water I've ever had. I tried it as it was less expensive then the other brands on the shelf (Naked, Blue Monkey, Amy & Brian, etc.). Similar to other reviewers it tastes as if it has gone bad, not even sure if coconut water can go bad. The expiration date was for next year. I ended up dumping the remaining content as it just did not taste good at all.I have had other brands and by far my favorite is c20, it's amazing. Blue Monkey is also really good. Never tried any others but c20 is always out at the store, I'm guessing because it's so good. It's naturally sweet, tastes fresh and hard to drink just one especially if it is really cold. Tried it on a whim and now I'm hooked. Tried Blue Monkey when c2o was out and it was really good.This is a long review for coconut water but the bad taste of this brand made me want to write about the good brands that are out there.  Next time you are at the store try c20 or if they don't have that then Blue Monkey and you will notice a huge difference between those and this brand. It's worth it. Blue Monkey and c20 are also well priced compared to the expensive Amy & Brian and other brands.
5	1315008000	I love the pure, clean taste of the non-flavored Zico.  After a run, nothing satisfies my thirst better.  Sometimes I might drink one of my son's gatorades (he is allergic to coconut)and it just isn't the same - plus - the dye in the drink always stains my lips!  Zico all the way baby!
5	1314835200	Somehow, by a miracle, I found ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water and it has become my preferred drink.  I have Intercystial Cyctitis, which is inflammation of the bladder, and since I started drinking ZICO, my symptoms have vanished.  I absolutely LOVE the chocolate flavor...coconut and chocolate are the BEST combination.  I drink about 4 bottles a day and it keeps me feeling wonderful.  I've shopped around, and Amazon.com has the lowest price I've found, which enables me to buy more, which is GREAT!
5	1314835200	I was skeptical, hadn't found a flavored coconut water I liked. Well, I've become addicted to this one. I dig through the fridge looking for one when I'm out. Hate having to wait for the next delivery. No Prime shipping on subscribe & save. I feel deprived when it's just plain coconut water now. Try it!
5	1314835200	There are quite a few coconut water products out there these days but this one is by far the best-tasting one I have tried.  Great balance of chocolate and coconut to be refreshing.  I add it to me post workout recovery after a strenuous long distance run or heavy weight lifting sessions.  Placebo effect or potassium effect, my recovery has been faster and I mentally feel better.  Great product!
1	1314748800	I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle, though the best before date was way in the future. But my god. This is honestly the worst drink I have ever tasted, hands down. Tastes absolutely nothing like coconut. Or water. It tastes more like Satan's salty butt hole. Ok, I'm trying to be funny with the last comment, but I'm mostly serious. Saltiness was the only thing I could taste. It literally made me gag.
1	1314748800	This case was spoiled. It tasted so bad. I tried to drink one and it made my stomach soooo sick. I opened the rest of the ones in the case and they all even SMELLED bad. Threw them all out. This is the second case I had to throw out. I usually drink vita-coco. Switching back to that. I have been drinking coconut water for about three years. Zico is the worst brand. I hope this review helps others!
4	1314662400	Family loves having a case of the chocolate flavor coconut water delivered each month. The chocolate taste really isn't overwhelming. Tastes kind of like a Fudgsicle with the coconut flavor offering a good balance to the chocolate taste, muting some of the sweetness. Quenches your thirst, too.
5	1314662400	My husband takes this in his lunch for work.  It's great in the hot weather for those who work outdoors and need hydration.
5	1314489600	I absolutely love this coconut water. Amazing taste 100% pure. I've read food critics reviewing the labels description on Zico Pure Premium Coconut water compared to other coconut water products and it ranked highest a far as vitamins and everything listed on the labels were actually true. Other products were overstated. Great after work out.
5	1314403200	I highly recommend this for anyone doing anything sporty. It not only has the water content you need, but it's chalk full of electrolytes. Those looking solely for the coconut water might be surprised at the taste of this (very chocolate-y), but it still tastes great and has all the benefits you'd want. It also blends fantastically with chocolate or vanilla protein powders for those seeking a nice mixer for protein shakes.
5	1314230400	Having heard many people express their undying love for coconut water, last year I decided to try some. After about the first sip of the plain unadulterated coconut water I got at the grocery store I knew it and I were not going to be friends. I couldn't even force myself to finish the carton. I could not figure out why everyone was so excited about it and decided it just wasn't for me. Then, one day earlier this month I saw Zico Chocolate in the cold case at a convenience store, sandwiched between juices and sports drinks. I was hesitant to buy it considering my previous experience with coconut water but the lure of chocolate was too much. I am so glad that I decided to go for it! Zico Chocolate could not be more different from plain coconut water. The weird (almost like bad molasses) flavor I found so unappealing in the plain was missing completely from the Zico Chocolate. Because they added some coconut cream it is ever so mildly creamy and the chocolate is nice and rich like semisweet dark chocolate. Just like plain coconut water it has an enticing naturally occurring nutrient content including some calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and phosphorus. The only nutritional downside is that there is some added sugar, bringing the total sugar for one 14 oz bottle up to 18 grams. However, for me drinking a Zico Chocolate is often a replacement for either a dessert or a sweetened iced tea so I'm not really ingesting any more sugar than I normally would be. If you don't mind the added sugar and/or haven't been pleased with the taste of other coconut water I highly recommend trying Zico Chocolate.This last bit is about buying from Amazon and not about the product itself. This is the first time I've bought this particular product from Amazon and I am very happy with the purchase. It cost me significantly less per bottle to have it shipped by the case from Amazon using subscribe & save than it costs to buy in any store near me ($.75 - $1.00 less per bottle). Although buying it this way made it ineligible for Prime 2-day shipping, the box still arrived here the day after I ordered it and in perfect condition; that is good customer service!!!
5	1314230400	I absolutely love Zico coconut water. This stuff is amazing and totally hydrates you. I have it every morning in a smoothie. Great way to flavor a smoothie without adding too much sugar or having to add milk. Best recipe: 1/4 cup vanilla greek yogurt, 1 banana, 1/2 cup frozen mango chunks and 1/2 cup of Zico coconut water, 7 ice cubes.
1	1314144000	Must admit the taste of O.N.E. coconut water is better.  Took a long time to get through the supply of coconut water.
1	1313971200	I have purchased Zico and Vita-Coco multiple times from Amazon. I love Coconut Water and specially this 100% pure ones. But lately I have realized quality of Zico brand is not as good as it was before. I have had at least 100-110 individual packs so far but now I am feeling like watery taste (Am I saying they add water? ;) ) than coconut water.The only change I noticed, it was made it Brazil before and now its somewhere else ..My suggestion, stay away from Zico brand for now.
5	1313884800	I love this stuff!  Perfect blend of dark choc and coconut water.  I really like how smooth and refreshing this stuff is.  I am lactose intolerant so I can't drink choc milk but I think this stuff comes really close and it is better for you than cow's milk.  I look forward to buying case after case (=.
4	1313798400	we drink plain coconut water instead of soft drinkswe've tried various brandssome are sweeter than others (without additives)i also make kefired or yogurt coconut waterzyto plain coconut water is refreshing
4	1313798400	This is probably one of the best flavored coconut waters out there.  It tastes like skinny chocolate milk.  If you are concerned about the level of sugar, though, you should stay away.  It is has 18 grams per serving whereas most plain only has about 12. Although, if you drink it before or after a grueling Bikram practice, I think you deserve a little extra sugar.
2	1313625600	friend told me about product so i tried it like and did not like it so i gave it away  just have to have the taste for it and i didnt  wont be ordering this product in the future unless its for somebody else
4	1313452800	Really like this during exercise although probably will buy flavored next time. I play lots on senior softball in hot weather & have converted guys on my team to drink this for electrolytes. Give it a try!!
1	1313280000	After reading all of the reviews on this product I decided to give it a chance and I was so disappointed.  Everyone said that the taste is the best out of any other brand that they have tried, and I'm scared to know what those taste like because this product tastes HORRIBLE.  It honestly tastes like spoiled milk and chalk.  I'm am extremely disappointed.  Don't waster your money, unless you plan on plugging you nose to drink this stuff.
2	1313193600	I understand this is a natural product and can have seasonal shifts.. however, there must be a way to test for sugar, salt, and element content to determine it's taste and flavor.I find the product to have HUGE quality swings from carton to carton.  Some sweet, some bitter...I actually got food poisoning last summer from a zico bottle and it was well within the expiration date.  This wasn't pleasant...I will no longer be purchasing the zico 1 liter thai coconut water... I may give the brazilian coconut water 1 more chance. Otherwise it's VitaCoco 100%
3	1313020800	I have been purchasing the Zico tetrapack for a couple of years now and was their biggest advocate.  It was as close to good, fresh coconut as you get.  The taste was so fresh, that I could honestly say that I could not distinguish between it and what I would buy back home.  About 4-5 months ago, they changed something that affected their end product.  It now tastes like all the other stale tasting coconut water.  I don't know if it was a change in the way they produce the water, or if they changed where they got their produce from.  In either case, I am sure that whatever they did saved them money.  I am back to searching for a fresh tasting coconut water.
2	1313020800	I love Coconut water. I drink Naked brand all the time. I figured I'd try Zico but I realy didn't like the taste. Leaves a bad after taste. Try Naked, it tastes pure and natural.
5	1313020800	I've tried many cocunt waters (Vita Coco, O.N.E., Goya, etc), and I find this to be the cleanest, most refreshing taste (especially when chilled).  Apparently ZICO uses different combinations of coconuts depending on the size of the packaging.  I can't speak for the other sizes, but the 33.8 oz is delicious!
5	1312934400	I like drinking something other than sports drinks to get my electrolytes in after a workout, so I don't mind that this is higher in sugar and calories (110, I believe) than the other Zico waters.Even if you don't like the taste of regular coconut water, you should try this! It makes for a great dairy-free milk (in fact, I would compare the taste to chocolate almond milk).
2	1312848000	Never - coconuts never taste the same. so how do these brands maintain a consistent taste. think about it. I read a review that this one is better than O.N.E and Vita. I would say none of them are better substitute than a natural coconut's water.
5	1312588800	I read reports of this being more beneficial for you after a workout when compared to other sports drinks. Well I can attest to feeling much better after drinking this. It is much smoother and more refreshing than Gatorade or the like.  I have not tried other brands of coconut water so I cannot compare to others. .. but I am happy with this purchase.
1	1312329600	Hello friends.SO in frustration I tried a new-for-me brand, Zico PURE PREMIUM (haha) i guess it's called, could not however determine the source of the drink, unlike the Vita brand these particular containers made no mention of the actual source of the water.Hum.In the local description the claim is "Brazilian coconuts" but they dont stand behind it as others do and print "Produced in xxxxxx" on the tetra pak.Of course you know what I think-- where *I* think this sewer water came from.Let me give you a hint: probably not mainland Asia, nor South or Central America.Darn it, dont they grow coconut trees in southern USA or Mexico?Where do they send that water, north to Canada and west to Japan!!!(along with nearly all the best sushi)WTF
5	1312156800	Tastes just like a slightly off version of YooHoo.  I agree with the other reviewers in saying that it is not refreshing and thirst quenching like the plain or fruit versions but it definitely hits the spot in place of my mid-afternoon chocolate bar.
5	1312070400	This is the closest product to real coconut water I've found to date.  I grew up on the real coconut water, and this is much easier to get and transport.  It doesn't have any added sugar or other ingredients so it is very natural.
1	1312070400	Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting "it" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on "coconut water laxative" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you "run", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p
3	1311984000	i love coconut water & zico is the best one in my opinion. the problem i have with it is the taste is not consistent from case to case. this urks me, one case tasted so gross i had to contact amazon about it. zico needs to do some kind of quality control! other than that, i love it & am willing to suffer through this quirk.
2	1311811200	First off, when I got my 6 pack of this stuff, it was VERY warm in my hand. I don't know if it was ruined in shipment, or whatever, but it smells hella funky. I asked my mom why it smells so off, but she says that's how it's supposed to smell, which is funny because I remember when I used to drink coconut water out of the coconut it didn't smell so weird.Second, I don't know if I ruined my taste buds by drinking ginger ale, but this does NOT taste like coconut water! I'll update my review in another, but honestly, I don't think I'm gonna grow to like this. I'm truly disappointed :/
5	1311724800	This is a great product. Don't expect sweet sugar coconut tasting water. Expect something completely different. Totally revitalizes your body, especially living in the midwest this summer.  Every other time we reach for something to drink in this non stop 100 + degree weather in OK, we are getting one of these out of the fridge. In fact, I am online right now to increase my shipment number. Excellent product.
1	1311724800	I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water, having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst.
4	1311552000	This Zico product taste very nice as discrib but the only thing let this product down in my eyes is the packing. the packing is very sloppy. from the top where company put white whole for pour there is the seal between white plastic and blue cover, from there water is coming out actually it leaked little bit in my box too. so thats not good at all I checked my all 6 container and all have same problem all are leaking from same place.
1	1311552000	We bought two packs of Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water Natural, 11.2 Ounce Tetra Paks, when significantly discounted, and found both packs to have a weird taste completely unlike the sweet normal coconut water taste. Be wary of this product.
1	1311465600	First, I agree with the other reviewers about the "off" flavor and I am confused about why they decided to add "natural flavors" to coconut water that already tastes great by itself.  We are big fans of coconut water and have replaced all other drinks with it at family and other social gatherings.  But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type #7 (unidentified plastics created after 1987, including the plastic type BPA!) and even more puzzling, the bottle lists another plastic type next to it saying its also a #2 plastic type but its HDPE compatible.  Its so frustrating (and embarassing that I didn't catch it before putting in the coolers)!
5	1311465600	Very tasty and filling if you are watching your diet.  It has a lot of flavor and satisfies that craving for chocolate....
3	1311206400	I have had tried other coconut water before. Zico was introduced to me when I was training for Marathon. So I wanted to give it a try. Having come from a country where fresh coconut is abundant, Zico's taste does not quite taste like a real coconut. Having said that its not bad. But other similar product "Vita Coco" tasted more close to the real ones.
4	1311120000	This coconut drink don't taste so bad and very refreshing. Not a lot of sugar, which I like. Not sure why other reviewer said it taste like plastic. Had it chill cold, before consuming. Have more proteins then a banana as it listed. Compare to Vita and Naked brand this the better tasting and lighter then the other two. Naked is the worst of the three tasting coconut drink. It don't taste like a real coconut and I'm glad it don't. Real coconut taste is not as sweet and it a bit bitter. Wish price would be better.
2	1311033600	I don't know what happened, ZICO was good at first but after awhile it started to taste syrupy.  Also, we received one order that had a couple of bad packs.  The bad packs had this mysterious black liquid in them that gave a foul smell.  That was the last straw and I will never purchase ZICO again.
4	1311033600	The coconut water is fresh and tasty! I love it a lot! However, my husband, who lived in South Aisa for 5 years, loves most coconut flavored food but this water. Also, 60 calories per pack. Not a very "lean" water.
1	1310947200	The contents just taste like plastic. Not even a little bit of coconut taste. Just plastic. Luckily for me, unlike some reviewers, I only bought 3 bottles. I got through the first one by chugging it, because I hate being wasteful. I left the second and third in the refrigerator at work until someone stole them. I'm sure they regret it.
5	1310947200	The coconut water was a supreme hit to all my workout buddies.  Not only does it taste great with a protein powder but also the other flavors are a discussion builder.  I used mine immediately after my workout mixed with a vanilla protein powder and OMG....it was so good that I had to spread the news!  ZICO coconut water rules!
4	1310947200	This tastes just like the milk left after a bowl of cocoa puffs....which, if you ask me, is a good thing.It would get 5 stars if it weren't for the added sugar.If I had the choice, I'd give it a 4.5 b/c at least they used cane sugar.
1	1310947200	I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is "supposedly" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.
5	1310860800	I love Amazon for bringing Zico Coconut Water to my home every month at the lowest price in the country.  I've already lost 5 lbs within one week of working out, drinking zico coconut water (before during and after work out), and proper nutrition. Thank you, Amazon!!! And, thank you, ZICO!!!
1	1310688000	I decided to order these instead of my normal Vita Coco or O.N.E. because of a S&S;  special.  It was nothing short of disgusting with a horrible after taste.  Beware.  I contacted at Amazon regarding my sincere displeasure after ordering 2 cases and they would not take it back, but nicely offered a refund.Stay away from this and go with Vita Coco or O.N.E.
5	1310601600	This coconut water bought from Amazon is fabulous. It is refreshing with a real chocolate flavor. It will help one get more fluid into their body.
1	1310601600	It really tasted good and I subscribed for it (pack of 12 per month). I then upgraded the subscription to 2 units per month recently. Both the units that arrived after I made changes to the subscription were completely spoiled and left a bitter taste in the mouth. I am cancelling the subscription with immediate effect.
5	1310601600	I've tried several different coconut waters and the ZICO tastes the best to me. Use this in my smoothies daily. I was getting this product in the smaller tetra pak, but after opening the package you couldn't shake it up without spilling it. This works much better and I've taken as long as a week to use the 33.8 size with no degradation in taste.
1	1310428800	I'm not entirely sure whether to blame Zico or the store where I bought it -- a Trader Joe's in Westfield, NJ -- but this tastes foul! It tastes like funky dishwater. I'm having trouble getting the taste out of my mouth and enjoying the rest of my lunch. I've had coconut water before and taking a sip of this was a really, really awful surprise. I wish I had bought one of the "good" cartons.
1	1310256000	I've been ordering Zico for over 3 years.  I participate in the Subscribe and Save so I receive 1-2 boxes every month.  I am so disappointed in my last 4 shipments.  Every time Zico tastes spoiled.  What is going on?  I keep thinking it may just be that particular shipment, but I feel like it is the product.  I'm going to have to find a new coconut water because I can barely tolerate the taste anymore.
5	1310169600	I have looked far and wide for years for an alternative to fresh coconuts, and FINALLY I found a product worthy of my devotion! I'm convinced that no matter how badly we wish for it, nothing other than the real deal is ever going to taste exactly the same.  That being said, Zico comes VERY close.  No aftertaste of can or packaging that you invariably get with other brands, and absolutely nothing added to it. Pop it in the fridge and there is nothing out there more satisfying on a hot day. You absolutely will not regret buying Zico. Cheers!
5	1309996800	Have tried zico and one both. I do not think there's much different in these two brands. None of them is as fresh as the fresh coco water, but I still liked both of them. Zico felt slightly better than one in taste.
1	1309996800	I grew up in the Caribbeans and I love drinking coconut water.  I missed it after moving to the states. But one day a year ago I saw a box of  Vita Coco for sale at Costco and I bought it and enjoyed it, but I had to stop buying it because they got expensive.  Today at Costco I saw Zico coconut water and I bought it because I was craving coconut water.  Got home and took a taste and all I can say is WTF.  I am not kidding, this drink taste like dish water.  There is zero taste of coconut water in this product. It doesn't taste like coconut water from any continent I am familiar with.  To give you an idea of how bad this is, I gave it to my 2 year old son who will drink anything and he took on sip and pushed my hand away.  I gave some to my 6 year old daughter and she (no joke) went straight to the trash and spit it out and asked me what in the world I just gave her.Someone who has never had coconut water may think this is the greatest thing ever, but trust me this product is not fit for dogs.  Zico should be ashamed of themselves.  If you taste this product and thinks it's a great taste, I don't know what to say other than your taste buds have magic power to turn crap into gold. You should be studied to find out your tongue's secret.In other word, DON'T BUY THIS, unless you like throwing money out.  I am grateful I got mine from Costco because I am returning this abomination back ASAP.
2	1309824000	I am a big fan of coconut water and use it instead of other sports drinks when I cycle. This package showed up quickly but some of the containers had leaked and the outside packaging had molded in spots. I will not being buying this brand again.
4	1309824000	This is a really good product, the flavor is not overwhelmingly sweet and it's very refreshing and light. It's perfect for a really hot day when other soft drinks feel like too much. I feel more hydrated and I think my skin looks better when I drink a serving every day. The case price is really a good value versus buying it at the store, check it out for yourself.
5	1309737600	This product (1) tastes better than Vita Coco; (2) tab is tighter sealed for flavor protection; (2) the price is also better.  All-in-all, this makes putting natural potassium into the old bod a distinct pleasure. where the liquid is distributed throughout the GI tract versus taking "ONE MORE PILL" taking its good old time to dissolve.
3	1309737600	I have been drinking coconut water for years.  Since I live in Miami I used to get my coconut water fresh from a guy who had a truck full of coconuts.  This was by far the best.  Since the person who provided me with the fresh coconut water did not continue this business I had to opt for the coconut water that is sold in stores.  I have tried all of the major brands.  Zico, One, Vita Coco and Naked.  Naked was the worst tasting by far.  Although I still buy Vita Coco once and a while and consider it quite good, I had been ordering Zico which I considered the best.  Lately, however, I got my regular order of Zico and found that it tasted kind of strange.  I called the company to speak with them and they did not have a good explanation for me.  I understand that since this is a natural product there may be some variation in flavor but not to the extent that I experienced.  They did mention to me that some of the coconut water is sourced from Brazil while some is sourced from the Philipines.  I find that I prefer the one from Brazil over the one from the Philipines.  Don't ask me why but they taste differently.  I had been ordering this item so that it is delivered monthly to my home but if I do not know in advance whether it is coming from Brazil or Philipines I will not continue to buy this way any longer.
1	1309737600	I ordered this about a month or so ago, and out of the 12 packs, two of them were spoiled.  I even accidentally swallowed a sip, yuck!  They smelled pretty bad with a fairly dark color (compare to the normal ones).The other 10 packs were fine, except some of them were sour.
5	1309737600	This is a feel-good water.  The coconut flavor is subtle, but packs a rejuvenating punch, without bludgeoning you like other "enhanced" waters.  Drinking adequate water was a daily chore until Zico.  Pour it over ice and you've got a refreshing cocktail.
5	1309651200	I've been a big fan of coconut water for a few years now. When I saw the chocolate flavor, I couldn't imagine how coconut water and chocolate could go together in such a way that it would be something that I would really enjoy drinking. Boy was I wrong! After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. It is sooooooooo delicious! How could they make something taste this good out of combining coconut water and dark chocolate? I don't know but I will be coming back for more as I just increased my delivery rate on my Subscribe and Save plan. This is a great way to satisfy a chocolate craving - it tastes so indulgent, get rehydrated, and it's good for you! ZICO really outdid themselves with this one. I highly recommend this product!!!
1	1309651200	I bought the 12 pack from amazon and the pack I received was spoiled and rancid. In Zico's defense though, I have purchased Zico from local stores and it is actually good, sweet and tasty. I probably got a bad batch or the case could have been spoiled during delivery. (I do live in TX, so maybe the heat played a factor) Amazon gave me a refund.
4	1309564800	I love the taste of this coconut water. To my buds, it is by far the best tasting of the three brands of coconut water that I have tried, including Vita Coco, ONE and ZICO. I only gave it four stars because the packaging could be improved. As it is now, it is difficult to drink on the go as there is no secure way to reseal the container.
3	1309478400	I'm a total ZICO loyalist and buy at least 6 liters a week. I decided to purchase from Amazon since they deliver and those bottles are heavy to shelp up my stairs. I would give this 5 stars but 3 out of my 6 bottles had cap defects. The caps were starting to separate from the bottle which resulted in leakage and possible contamination.I've seen this in grocery stores as well, so I know it's not an "Amazon" issue. :(I notified Zico online- I guess we will see what happens.On a unrelated note.. Amazon you should have a spell check option within the review section...
3	1309392000	I looked deeper into the description of these and found this:***ZICO 11 oz. tetra cartons are produced in Brazil and deliver a light, refreshing taste.One-liter cartons are produced in Thailand for a more nutty flavor profile, similar to fresh green Thai coconuts from the grocery store.And 14 oz. bottles are a nutty blend of Brazilian, Thai and Indonesian coconuts.***So you might not be liking the taste of the coconuts from Thai and Indonesia instead of it being the plastic bottle.I'll be staying with the original formula since I bought some from Trader Joe's and really like it but it is the Brazilian coconuts only.Mystery solved?  Let me know what you think.
2	1309392000	I guess you have to be lucky to get a good batch.  First batch was really good - I used it as a substitute for sports drink.  So I ordered two cartons later, and both tasted pretty bad, had to throw them all.
5	1309392000	I don't usually write reviews, but this stuff is too good to pass up! Its almost scary how much this tastes exactly like low fat chocolate milk.  I meant to order the original flavor, but boy am I glad I accidentally ordered this one!This is so good I don't think i'll order original again!!!
5	1309305600	Having lived in the Caribbean and raised on coconut water, I can attest that Zico tastes like the real thing. Refreshing and energizing! I have tried many other brands and Zico by far has the best taste. Tastes like a freshly picked coconut from the tropics!
1	1309219200	This is my third case of Zico in the last 6 months or so and it tastes completely different then the other two I've purchased.  The water has a strange smell and an awful taste.  The previous two cases I ordered (before the plastic bottles came out) tasted great.  I thought that just one of the drinks may have been bad but the entire case is the same; straight up nasty.  I won't be ordering any more of this.
1	1309132800	After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.
1	1309132800	I luv Coconut water and have been drinking coconut water real fresh. My definition of FRESH here is within 60 seconds after the coconut is plucked from the tree.I do not expect anything close with any of the packaged 'FRESH' coconut water..But, this one from Zico is real crap..Its just like sweetened water with a drizzle of vinegar. Vita Coco is much much better.
4	1309046400	Overall, good taste but still leaves an after taste.Pros: Fast hydration. New flavors (Mango is the best thus far in my opinion). Low calorie.Cons: After taste especially towards the end or if warm. Formula has changed despite what Zico says.
1	1309046400	This is the worst coconut water that we have ever tried. It tastes like the  coconut tree root and stem soaked water. I will newer recommend this not even once.
1	1308960000	This was the worst coconut water I have ever tasted. I unfortunately bought a 12 pack, which I couldn't get through the first two sips of, because of the lower price. Tasted heavy and rancid with a terrible after taste. Buy Vita instead, it's so much better.
2	1308960000	So far I am not happy with the flavor and taste of Zico coconut water. I can only compare this to the Naked brand, which I enjoy, and the Vita Coco brand that I also like.Zico has less "freshness" to its taste, and the lingering after taste reminds me of the canned coconut water with bits of coconut that you find in the Asian section of the grocery store. For whatever reason, the smell is not crisp and fresh also.I have a hard time drinking the Zico straight, though it is fine in smoothies. I give the product two stars only because I can use it in smoothies.
3	1308960000	We luved original Zico, but now its taste totally different.When introduced it was pure coconut water which was just pasteurized.  Now it says its from concentrate.Taste little different now!
1	1308960000	This tastes like plastic. And coconut water from "concentrate" and "natural flavors" is not coconut water. I'll just go back to buying mine at the grocery store that has pulp in it, and comes in a glass bottle.
1	1308873600	Bought the 12 pack thinking it is a great deal. The taste is VERY VERY BAD and BITTER. I don't know what to do with the remaining 11. There is no easy method to return such grocery items on Amazon. Bought other brand from Whole Foods and tasted delicious.
1	1308873600	Bought a 12 pack recently, once I open the pack it reeks of plastic, can't even take it near my mouth to drink.Had used Vitacoco from local grocery stores and they taste like fresh coconut water. Definitely this stuff is not natural.
5	1308873600	I am pregnant and was getting charley horses, and a friend recommended that I look into coconut water. Each bottle has more potassium then a banana--which sounded great to me since I hate bananas! I ordered a case of the chocolate flavor, since I had heard regular coconut water is not too good. I LOVE this! It's great-and keeps you hydrated while giving you some great health benefits.
2	1308787200	This is the basically the cheapest form to buy any of the three popular coconut water. I did the math and to put the cost in retrospective it comes to $10 per 2 liters of this coconut water.This may not register to some with no concept of themselves being ripped off. There are other things out there that are better quality and less expensive and more specific for what you are looking for. If your look for something to quench thirst I highly recommend Metromint water. If your looking for things for your natural lifestyle then find a fruit with more umph than coconut.
5	1308787200	I've tried several other flavors of coconut water and they're all pretty good.  As a choco-holic I had very high hopes for the Zico chocolate coconut water!  I was not disappointed...this water tastes more like liquified coco puffs cereal with just a hint of coconut.  Maybe that sounds gross, but it was really pretty good!  Very refreshing!
1	1308700800	I agree with the other most recent reviews. It has a distinct rancid flavor which doesn't appeal to the taste buds at all! Not in line with what my wife and I expect from coconut water. Needs to taste much better. We called Amazon tonight and were told that the manufacturer has stated the products aren't rancid. Probably not, but clearly there's a taste issue they need to address if so many people are complaining.
5	1308528000	My first time trying coconut water happened when a good friend had a stomach flu and need effective hydration. I went to the local coffee shop and it was among the few drinks they had on hand, and the label stated that it was excellent as a sports drink alternative and for hydration generally. We tried it, and it not only worked, but it tasted great. Since then, I've tried the major brands, and zico is the best tasting of the lot.
3	1308441600	I was brought up drinking fresh coconut water.  I was badly disappointed with this product.  Its coconut water alright but not fresh at all and tastes of water obtained from older coconuts as opposed to young or tender ones.  I started looking for this because I had tasted the competing product, "Vita Coco" (Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12))  which I had bought from a local grocery store.  I bought the Zico product because of the reviews here.  The Vita product is a helluva lot better.  Will not buy this again.
1	1308355200	This drink taste nothing like coconut water. This disgusting and i don't know how anybody can drink this crap. I wasted $2.50 on this drink that tasted like boiled water with a hint of nasty coconut.
1	1308355200	I never write reviews. This is my first out of 900+ unique products bought from Amazon. I average about 1 to 2 packages a day of various products bought from amazon.  THIS PRODUCT IS A COMPLETE FAILURE! I bought 3 cases and all 3 were RANCID/SPOILED!  It literally tastes like VOMIT!  Avoid this product, Quality Assurance is a major issue. VITACOCO is better in terms of quality (VITACOCO also adds a little extra vitamin C to avoid some spoliage while shipping).  I will NEVER BUY ZICO again, that is for certain!  I hope this helps others avoid the poorest excuse for any type of quality coconut water.
5	1308268800	the liter 33.8 oz containers, which are from Thailand coconuts, taste the best. the ones in the 11.2 oz containers, which are from Brazil coconuts, have an odd after taste. although the brazil ones arent bad, they just are not as good as the thailand ones provided from ZICO, atleast.
5	1308268800	So the first time that I had coconut water was in college.  It all started with a cold tetra pack of vita coco and I have been hooked ever since.  Vita coco is clearly a superior product as it is 100% with no concentrates; although, Zico I would put on the same scale.  It does not taste like 100% coconut water nor does it taste like plastic.  It tastes like coconut water from concentrate and I do not mean that in  a bad way.  You just have to take risks in life, check out a case when they are on sale (around $11) and give this product a try!  It is a little different but the change is nice!
5	1308182400	Title speaks it all. This water is as close as it can get to natural coconut water you can get on the beaches of Hawaii.
1	1308182400	So I love coconut water and I've tried this brand before. I bought it from safeway and was very satisfied with the flavor. Well I ordered this online and I gatta say I was VERY disappointed! 7 of the 12 boxes were rancid! I immediately canceled my subscription and sent a very angry email to the Zico company! it's too bad I cant send these spoiled ones back.. I mean really 7/12?? One or two I understand but this is unacceptable!
1	1308096000	This thing tastes like it has fermented and it was left a little bit longer it would turn into a local wine. I am surprised people who already used this product recommended this product with good things to say about the taste. Believe me if I were to choose between this one and a bitter Melon, I would go for the later one. We had guests over the day we received this product and offered it to them. They were like what the hell is this. One sip and one of them was ready to vomit. I am just wondering now if I should even look at amazon reviews because this is a second instance where i was disappointed by trusting the reviews. I would guess it was the problem with the batch i received or something had changed in this product to not to match the review I read here.
5	1307750400	Literally last night only I have tasted this decadent drink. With every sip I could not believe how good it felt. I am so impressed that I have subscribed for Amazon's monthly delivery of a case and I do not do subscription stuff. So if you love dark chocolate, coconut milk and keeping it healthy, you gotta try this.
5	1307664000	Two of the most yummy, sinful flavors in one healthy package, who knew?  Love it for the late afternoon pick me up when in fade mode! Thank you ZICO!
1	1307577600	I usually don't write reviews, but this coconut water was nowhere near the quality of their normal product.  I would not drink these if they were free.  Very disappointing.
1	1307491200	I have tried four different brnads of pure coconut water(not from concentrate or flavored). Out of the four I tried I think VitaCoco has the best fresh tasting flavour. After VitaCoco I liked the 'REAL' coconut water. I found Zico to be the worst tasting coconut water(it has a metallic after taste to it even when you drink it cold with ice). I will never buy Zico again. Going back to VitaCoco brand now. I see a lot of good reviews on Zico so I believe that it must be something wrong with the packing ? now that its soo hot in the North-east maybe something happened but I havent had this experience with other brands. All the best to anyone who is willing to try this brand.
1	1307059200	I love coconut water. To be more specific, I love GOOD coconut water. My preferred brand after trying just about every one on the market is the Taste Nirvana which is smooth, only slightly sweet and very refreshing. The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50% sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh. Goya runs a close second. I am not sure if it's the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me. Coconut water should not taste sour. Despite the rave reviews, I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya. Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first.
5	1307059200	I love the ZICO coconut water.  More refreshing than water to me and keeps me from wanting a soda.  I signed up for the monthly auto-ship.
5	1306886400	I can understand a lot of the initial bad reviews as I thought the new plastic bottle had a bad after taste.  In the last month I have been picking up bottles and liters from Trader Joe's and I can say that the taste is much improved.  I also purchased the Trader Joe's version and thought it would be great, but was so disappointed. Lady sold me on the fact that it is always refrigerated, but frankly it was nasty...my girlfriend actually threw hers away.
4	1306886400	ZICO pure coconut water is a wonderful beverage; it is refreshing and comforting to my body after strenous activity, I also drink it to calm "sweets" cravings! ZICO tastes like the real thing; I grew up in the tropics and drank coconut water regularly(out of the fruit) and ZICO taste pure and unadulterated. I don't like the packaging; it is a bit bulky,however; I still like it better than canned products (the can adds a metaliqui flavor to the drink).ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)
4	1306800000	The naturals are the best - these are great for young families, are portable but also big anough to keep your fridge stocked!!!!! kids love it give it a try!
5	1306800000	I didn't particularly care for the other flavors, so I thought I'd try the new chocolate flavor.  It's really good and I will continue to order it.  I couldn't find it anywhere except for Amazon.
5	1306800000	Zico was better than expected!!  I love it - it takes me back to the good ole days of Yoo Hoo's but without all added calories and preservatives. Perfect for a post yoga workout or early morning chocolate milk fix. Will definitely have the kids drinking this instead of the alternatives.
3	1306713600	I prefer coconut water to Gatorade or other sports drinks for re-hydration; in addition to being natural, they are packed with electrolytes and their taste is no better, no worse.Zico, however, is form concentrate.  Calling their product 'Pure Premium' seems very misleading when other products are actually pure and this one has been modified. If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One.
1	1306454400	I got hooked on coconut water while traveling in the Philippines. Since then I've been trying to find a packaged product that tastes like the real deal. There are a few decent brands out there. This particular product, however, is made from concentrate and tastes just like the plastic it is packed in. I didn't even finish the bottle.
4	1306368000	as a newly converted coconut water drinker I would have to say this is the best I have tasted...love the flavors - zico is the best
5	1306368000	Chocolate+Coconut+Hydration = HEAVEN!!  So I put this to the test after one of my triathlon training sessions yesterday.  Not only did it completely quench my thirst and hydrate me, but the taste was sensational.  Light enough to drink post-workout but also filling enough to feel refreshed.  It kept me from feeling that 3-4 hour post workout fade.  I was alert and ready to go the entire day!  What a difference from the high fructose hydration drinks that are out there.  A 10!  A true taste sensation!
4	1306368000	I like plain Zico for hydration on a hot day, but this is more like dessert.  I think Chocolate Zico is better than Yoohoo.  The Zico tastes more natural and rich.  Be sure to shake it well and drink it cold.
3	1306195200	after a lifetime of thinking I didn't like coconut or coconut water (milk) I have changed my tune - this is not what you would expect and if you and your family are trying to become more health conscious and clean up the food that you are eating try this product - this is just one mom's opinion
5	1306195200	I've been an avid ZICO drinker for over a year, sticking mainly to my fav pineapple.  I wasn't sure how Chocolate could go with a coconut water, but i am sooooo impressed and glad i tried it.  It's not necessarily the ZICO flavor i grab after a workout, as i still love pineapple (though chocolate is great in my morning recovery smoothie), but it has definitely replaced my mid-afternoon snacking habit in a much healthier way.  Best of all - i've got the whole house hooked on it, so my kids now choose healthy hydration instead of the artificial and high calorie stuff they used to drink.  i'm sold.
5	1306195200	Even though everyone talks about Natural as the most popular ZICO flavor, this is by far my favorite.  it's light, refreshing and has about 40% less sugar and calories than other flavored coconut waters because ZICO doesn't add juice and puree like the other brands.  By the way, it is also awesome as a mixer (or so i hear).
5	1306195200	Sinful ! I am a regular drinker of Zico Natural and recently tried the new chocolate. It is smooth and creamy, almost like a liquid Almond joy! Still all natural with the same electrolyte and potassium benefits, I would highly recommend. My children love it and has much less sugar than chocolate milk.
2	1306108800	On a recent trip to Jamaica, I fell in love with fresh coconut water, straight out of the baby coconut. I read a bunch of reviews about the top three brands and went with Zico since overall they seemed to get the best reviews. I ordered a case and anxiously awaited it's arrival. I was VERY disappointed to find that this coconut water has a strange scent that hits you as you go to take a sip, as well as a weird aftertaste. It's hard to describe...almost a metallic taste? Also sort of sour like others have said. Since I spent so much money on this stuff I really want to like it and want to at least be able to tolerate it, but I'm just not sure that I can force myself to do it. My husband agrees that it's not good and he won't drink it either. I've read that coconut water is good for your skin and can be used as a facial toner so if nothing else I may keep a few containers for that purpose, but chances are most if not all of this coconut water is going down the drain : (
5	1306108800	I too, was slightly skeptical, however it turns out the chocolate ZICO was a brilliant idea and very well executed.  It tastes very similar to chocolate milk, however not as heavy and certainly more hydrating plus it has all the great health benefits of coconut water.  My husband & I are addicted! We usually drink them in the morning for breakfast to jump start our day & sometimes after dinner to satisfy our sweet tooth.  I can't wait to tell my friends and family about them!  High five folks at ZICO!
5	1306108800	Just tried the new chocolate Zico....loooooove it. Even better my 23 mo old daughter loves it! Now...how do we get this by the gallon?
5	1306108800	One word--hooked!And I was really shocked that it wasn't so heavy in calories and sugar but still creamy tasting-Good addition to my morning shake or when i can't resist that damn reese cup.
3	1306108800	Although the plain coconut water has a good enough taste, there are additives.  It says with natural flavors.  And, if you read the label, you will see it is from concentrate.  Personally, I prefer 100% pure coconut water.  Nothing else. No additives.  Not from concentrate.  There is no reason for additives.  Also, even though they are recyclable, I do think that there are other brands out there with more earth-friendly packaging.Just this reader's opinion.
4	1306022400	This is a delicious drink, but it is not the refreshing beverage you would expect. The chocolate formulation has added sugar and coconut cream, so it tastes like a dairy-free version of chocolate milk. (It is slightly reminiscent of a Mounds bar.) I was hoping that this would be more like a coconut-water-with-essence-of-cocoa, but alas this is not the case. Tasty, but not anything like the other Zico products, so be aware.
5	1306022400	When I first tried the new chocolate ZICO, I loved it, but thought I was a little biased since I know all the amazing benefits of coconut water. SO the true test was with my 5 year old, the ultimate (and brutally honest) chocolate expert.  It was in the evening, so i only let him have half the bottle, but no joke - he woke me up at 2am saying "mommy, i need more of that chocolate zico"...What a great option for us fitness moms out here!  Thanks ZICO!
5	1306022400	I heard about ZICO chocolate a few months ago and was extremely skeptical. However, I was delightfully surprised by the taste... and am now hooked! I can't get enough! I literally drink it every morning for breakfast. It tastes just like chocolate milk - but has all of the health benefits of coconut water. Way to go ZICO - you knocked this one out of the water!
5	1305849600	Chocolate ZICO has it all and guilt free! I love it with protein after a workout or just sipping it on the couch as a guiltless pleasure! WAY TO GO ZICO!!
5	1305849600	I have to start with the fact that I was extremely skeptical on a chocolate coconut water.  I expected a watered down chocolate milk taste.  I was actually resistant to try it the first time for fear of ruining my coconut water experience.  Needless to say with my five star rating I was impressed. This beverage is hands down the healthiest way to get your chocolate fix and hydrate at the same time.  I have converted at least half a dozen people over to this beverage.  Everyone has that "commercial" look of being surprised on how good it is.  I highly recommend this product and think it is a home run for Zico.  I expect some of the other brands to follow soon.
5	1305849600	new zico chocolate is awesome....it's delicious and i love that its so much less sugar. i grew up on yoo-hoo but those days are over! zico chocolate is great for post workout and gets me going in the morning. love it!
2	1305849600	i don't like it it taste like to much water in it i'm from the island of Philippines i know the real taste of coconut juice inside so i canot compare the real taste of coconut juice sorry
2	1305676800	I signed up for Zico 12-pack delivery after some comparison among similar products.  It seemed liked a good deal.  The first shipment last month was great-all 12 "paks" were consistent in flavor and clarity.  This month, however, the contents have led me to cancel all future shipments.Upon opening the box, I noticed a wet spot on the top although it seemed intact and untampered.  There seemed to be no additional leakage and the expiration date was NOV '11.  The first pak I opened had brownish coconut water that I had never seen before.  The next one was paler and less acrid.  Overall, the observation is that the coconut water was probably from different batches since the individual paks were different shades and degrees of sweetness/ bitterness.Other reviews have reported that coconut water is bitter, so if you like bitter drinks (healthier?), then you should get this product.  There is not a sure way to determine if it's Zico or Amazon at fault, so use your own discretion.
4	1305590400	I've tried this brand and a couple of others, and I prefer this brand.  I don't like that it's from concentrate, but when it came down to taste I thought Zico was much better.  I'm going back to Zico.
5	1305244800	ITS AMAZING HOW YOU CAN STOP DRINKINK SODAS AND REPLACED THEM FOR SOMETHING THAT ITS NOT ONLY NATURAL IT ALSO TASTE GOOD.ITS TRULY "ONE OF A KIND"
4	1305244800	Growing up, I was used to coconut water all the time. While none of the brands selling coconut water are close to the real thing (FRESH coconut water), Zico comes the closest. It comes the closest in my book because it doesn't taste as adulterated as some of the other brands. I can't make a claim about the flavored versions of this drink but for the natural flavor Zico wins hands down compared to Vita Coco and O.N.E.
3	1305158400	I was first introduced these at my yoga studio,of course everyones gona love them after you sweat all your salt out.I then bought them at whole foods and now trader joes are selling them.I suggest not to buy the large carton unless you are gona to drink the whole thing in one day or share it.It doesnt last well after your open it and try to drink it the next day.Its  okay, not bad not the best.I give it a c
1	1304640000	It's my first tme purchasing this brand of coconut water, but I have to give it a buyer beware rating.  Myself and another family member both tried this water on multipule (ie. more than 3 occasions) and have had stomach pains immediately after drinking it.  I suspect that this bactch may have been tainted or bad.  I plan on throwing the rest out.
5	1304467200	I was very pleased with this coconut water. It tastes fresh, pure and delicious. It's excellent for re-hydration, especially after sports, while pregnant, in labor, or just during the hot summer months.The tetra bottles are large, great for stashing in the refrigerator and using throughout the day.I typically buy another brand, but I'm glad I decided to try ZICO this time. The only ingredient in this particular item is coconut water, and it's not from concentrate.
4	1304121600	Zico is one of the better coconut water in a box out there, but I prefer Vita Coco better. Actually I like Vita Coco much, much better. I grew up in Southeast Asia, and I used to drink coconut water straight out of the coconut all the time. The taste of Zico has a little bit of tartness (not much, certainly not enough to make it bother me) which I didn't remember tasting in a fresh coconut water. Vita Coco didn't have this, and it tastes exactly the way I remember fresh coconut water to taste like. In short, I'll take Zico anytime, except when there's an option to take Vita Coco.
1	1304035200	for some reason, Zico seems to be the worst of the lot when it comes to coconut waters.  Having come from a real coconut water drinking country (I mean coconuts off the trees), I know the difference in taste and Zico most definitely tastes like it is made of concentrate/extracts as opposed to being the real water!  The only thing they have going for them are the number of celebrities they've managed to get hooked onto them!
2	1303776000	After trying the O.N.E. and Vita Coco coconut waters, the Zico does not compare, it has a heavier taste, not the refreshing, light taste coconut water should have.  The plastic resealable bottle is a plus, but the taste is what it comes down to.  Until zico goes back to pure coconut water instead of concentrate, we will be purchasing the other brands.
1	1303516800	We purchased a case of this so-called "natural" coconut water, took one sip, poured the remainder of that first bottle down the drain and returned the case for a refund. It tasted that bad.This stuff is not legitimate coconut water ... it's made from concentrate and has added flavors.Definately not recommended.
1	1303430400	I grew up with fresh coconuts.  I also grew up with canned coconut juice (sweetened), frozen coconut juice, and recently bought some Naked coconut water from the supermarket, so I'm familiar with how coconut water should taste.It's hard to get fresh coconut where I am now so I thought I'd give Zico a try since it was the cheapest available on Amazon.  Big mistake!  I should've listened to the recent negative reviews posted here.The first pack of Zico was sour.  I took a sip and made a face.  Crap, I thought, I got a bad one.  I then opened another pack and that too was sour.  I have never tried Zico before and I hope that this isn't what it's SUPPOSED to taste like because it tastes nothing like coconut water.  If I had been blindfolded and somebody handed me this drink, I would never be able to guess it was supposed to be coconut water.  Packaged coconut water is supposed to taste similar to the juice you get in fresh coconut, right?I understand that it's not going to taste just like fresh coconuts but there should be a marked resemblance, as there was with the Naked brand I tried.  But the Zico I tried tasted NOTHING like coconut.  It MIGHT taste like the water that comes from a totally unripe coconut (never having had an unripe coconut, I can't say), or it could be the taste of coconut water gone rancid.  Whatever the reason, the taste is totally wrong and I am pissed because I've now got a 12-pack that's too disgusting to drink and isn't eligible for a refund through Amazon.UPDATE: Grocery items are not returnable, per Amazon policies (NOW they tell me).  However, I contacted Amazon to explain the situation to them and they generously offered to issue me a full refund.  Excellent customer service by Amazon--though the Zico still stinks!
5	1303257600	Coconut water is my favorite hot weather drink.  Refreshing and low calories.  But... it has to be cold, I think.  I like Zico's mild flavor.
5	1302825600	My husband and I are training for a half marathon and picked these up as a healthier alternative to gatorade and a more convenient alternative to eating bananas (well, buying a bunch of bananas every couple of days, at least).We typically drink ours at room temperature, though it is also delicious cold/iced. Mainly, when I get back from a run, I don't really want something super cold and this product (as others have mentioned) is just fine not-chilled.The first box came a couple months ago and was nice, though only about 4 star nice.  The flavor was a touch mild.  We cracked open the new shipment yesterday and oh man, absolutely wonderful.  The first batch was "yeah, this is coconut water" the new one is more like "oh man, just opened a coconut!"We will continue buying these since they are a great supplement to our longer distance training, but that is probably my only excuse since even with Subscribe & save they run about $1.50 each.
5	1302220800	Coconut water is such a refreshing drink. I am so glad i gave it a try. These are a great replacement of those sugar-loaded energy drinks because they have just as much electrolytes and other nutrients. And they are natural!! These are great for after workout or whenever you feel dehydrated or just need a sweet healthy treat. they also have a high amount of potassium so your body won't retain as much water weight as when you are bloated. My kids love them too! and i would rather them these than all the sodas or sweet drinks.
1	1301875200	Zico has changed this product so that it no longer tastes like coconut water.  When the company used Brazilian coconuts it was an entirely different tasty product from what it is now with coconuts from Thailand.
3	1301443200	I thought this was my favorite coconut water among Vita, O.N.E and others. I changed my mind after extensively tasting both O.N.E. and Zico. I tried it warm and cold. It is better than Vita but there is something about Zico that I do not like. I definitely prefer O.N.E. over Zico.
2	1301356800	We were quite impressed with the ZICO coconut water we bought at Whole Foods. It was a bigger carton (something like half a gallon) and it tasted quite fresh. The one we ordered from Amazon tasted different, a little stale to be honest. It could be that it has been sitting in the seller's warehouse for a long time. Nevertheless, I will prefer to buy this product from my local store.
5	1301270400	I am on direct order with this product, and receive it once a month and this one box(12 drinks) all were bad. Must have been a bad coconut! Amazon was very helpful, and is sending me a new box, free of charge. I offered to send the bad ones back including the empty ones (we tried 4 to verify it wasn't just one) but they said not to.Otherwise I have been very happy with ZICO and highly recommend it! I am very athletic and playing sports this is a great way to stay hydrated! Very healthy!
4	1301270400	Ingredients say coconut water from concentrate and natural flavor, not sure why the flavor is needed, but tastes almost nutty or toasted, probably from the heat process used to concentrate the juice. I like enough to drink it, but may decide to change brands. I ordered it because it was about half as much as it was at Whole Foods Market.
4	1300838400	Ok Ill repeat my intro one more time:)I grew with a fertile coconut tree in our backyard that bears fruit all year round.With all the other fruit trees next to the guyabano, the young coconut was my favorite.But I long left that house.I tried buying the young coconut from the Asian market but its always a gamble because you don't know exactly how long ago it has been harvested.I tried drinking the one in the cans ( about  3 kinds)and It makes me threw up and so I avoided buying those.In the advent of my indigestion problem , I need a better refreshment that doesnt have any  acid .So one afternoon, I was at my local supermarket and saw NAKED young coconut on sale. I tried it and I actually like it but I find it too expensive to buy just one .So I tried ordering a box of another brand  via Amazon . O.N.E. young coconut drink  and this one tastes better. However This one was or is on backorder and so I to tried another brand VitaCoCo. Unfortunately this one has a similar aftertaste as the canned ones but milder.. therefore I DONT like it.Since O.N.E. is still on backorder ,I went ahead and ordered ZICO , and I agree with the other reviewer , that this one is as good as O.N.E. but a bit better.Verdict:So this brand passed my taste buds the most.  I am going to stick with  ordering the ZICO  brand or O.N.E.So number 1 is ZICO.Number 2 is O.N.E.Number 3 is NakedLast is VitaCocoI only gave it 4 stars because the actual young coconut with meat or pulp  would be 5 stars ;)
2	1300752000	I have no problem with Zico...its the Coconut water that is the problem.  It tastes like sour milk water.  If you have not had it before try it some where else before committing to a whole case.  If you already know that you like Coconut water then this product is great (besides the whole coconut water thing).  The packaging is nice and everything works great except the water.  If i ever wanted to drink another coconut water then i would buy Zico again.
1	1300752000	I love the Zico coconut water in the little Tetra Pak boxes. It's my favorite drink. I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth.
3	1300579200	So far, I've loved all of the coconut water brands and flavors I've tried, including Zico. However, this was the first one I tried in a plastic bottle and was disappointed to find that there is a little bit of a plastic flavor to it. Zico's great, but I'm definitely going to stick to the box from now and on.
3	1300406400	I ordered a case each of Vita Coco, Zico, Naked, and ONE.  I like my coconut water room temperature, which none of the manufacturers suggest as the optimal way to enjoy their products. Maybe this review will be useful to others that drink thinks at room temperature. I am comparing each of the four against actual fresh coconut water extracted out of a fresh young coconut, which I've been drinking for years.Here are my rankings:1. Vita Coco has the most natural flavor, with no off tastes, and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor.2 (tie). Zico tastes slightly citrusuy and slighty "green" (like a green banana).2 (tie). ONE ends on a slightly bitter note.4. Naked has an off taste that I do not care for at all.I threw out all of the "Naked" boxes after my taste test.  Zico and ONE are drinkable, but both have flavors beyond the pure clean coconutty taste of Vita Coco.  I won't through the Zico or ONE out, but I'll drink all the Vita Coco first.
3	1300406400	I do like some coconut water, and all this later summer and fall, I drank this exact type of coconut water frequently.  I went through it so fast, I actually signed up for a subscription.I have to say, though, that right now I am disappointed and wondering what to do with a giant case I can't return. I will probably try cooking with it or adding it to smoothies.  Unfortunately, the most recent batch has a tangyness to it that makes me nauseous, even when it's cold. I know it's a natural product so there will always be some variation, but I am wondering if they switched suppliers/farmers of the coconuts or something as the taste is that different.Has anyone else has this problem/noticed this shift in taste?  It was an acquired taste, but I had grown to love the flavor of it over the last few months, and this new batch is very different.
2	1300406400	I love coconut juice but I don't love this. I should also mention that I love pina coladas too. Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice, I thought there would be some parallels.First of all, this drink has a strange salty flavor. Secondly, it's not sweet. It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y, but the flavors just don't coordinate with each other and don't match the smell.
5	1299801600	I love this product.  I always leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated and I love the subtle coconut taste.
1	1299715200	I have been buying Zico's mango flavored coconut water for several months now but last 2 packs I received did not taste the same. It tasted as if it had gone bad/expired/etc. Normally this is a great product but after receiving two bad batches, I won't be buying Zico anymore.
4	1299628800	We heard coconut water was a good sports drink for added electrolytes and potassium, so we tried this one.  My husband and I did not care for the taste, probably not brand related, we just don't like coconut water I guess.  Since we didn't want to waste it, I tried it replacing my water when making rice.  Wow, it made delicious coconut flavored rice!  I will use this up in my rice maker, and may even buy it again expressly for that purpose!  Less calories than adding coconut milk, and makes a delicious, coconutty flavored rice.  :-)
1	1299456000	I've been buying ZICO with mango in 11.2 oz. tetra-paks almost since they started offering them here on Amazon.  However, just as another reviewer explained, the most recent batch I received was horrible, it went from being the best coconut water to the worst I've ever had.  The packaging was slightly different and most alarming, the individual box no longer says anything about being from Brazil.  If this continues I will never buy this product again.  If you are having the same experience, please speak up on here so maybe we can get this fixed......
5	1299456000	I drink a lot of coconut water as a natural way to rehydrate. After trying many different brands, I like the taste of ONE and Zico best. Zico and ONE taste very similar to me, though Zico seems to be marketed as the more premium brand. VItacoco is another brand that is also from Brazilian coconuts, but it has added vit C which makes it slightly more sour.  I usually purchase ONE more often since it tends to be cheaper than Zico.
5	1299283200	Having lived in the Caribbean for 13 years one of the things I missed was fresh coconut water from the tree. This is as close to that taste as you can get.
1	1299283200	Bought this item at Safeway store in Santa Clara, CA 1 week ago and has been sitting in the refrigerator since then. Opened the container today and found black rotting algae coming out of the container in form of lumps along with the liquid which was bad tasting and unusually brown. Wish I could take it back to the store but I guess it wont help! Please stay away from this trash!!
5	1299110400	I order two packs so I don't have to pay shipping.  This is good stuff.  No sugar, provides electrolyte balance, potassium, goes down nicely when chilled.  Taste not for everyone but you can't get any purer.  Best sports drink around.
3	1299024000	I'm trying to acquire the taste because i know it's good for me.  It says to drink chilled, and it's HORRIBLE warm (my fault - I grabbed one when they first came in, yuck) when they're cold they are better, but not good.  Drink it fast, but there's no doubt it's hydrating and revitalizing.  I had to laugh at the reviews suggesting coconut water for cocktails - kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?Anyhow, I will continue to buy these, but DRINK THEM COLD!
4	1298937600	So my husband and I have been receiving Zico water with mango for several months, with subscribe and save. This month both cases taste HORRIBLE.  Expiration date is in just a few months.  In the past they were over a year away.  Also the cases were different in color.  Tasted no hint of mango, but cannot drink this batch.  What is up with that?  We love this stuff and have come to depend on it for after exercise.
1	1298505600	I didn't order this.  Last time I did order Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water was in Oct. 2010.  Kind of heavy to return.  How can I prevent this happen again?
2	1298505600	Love coconut water, really don't like this brand, kind of tastes like plastic.  Vita Coco and Naked is much better!  Will never buy it again!
2	1297814400	I have bought the version in the boxes before, but thought the plastic bottles would be more convenient.  Unfortunately it makes the drink taste like plastic.  The plastic taste is very strong, and awful.  Stick to the boxed type.
5	1297728000	I realize that people may think it's kind of expensive for coconut water, but it's at least twice the price where I live! If I had a coconut tree in my building than I wouldn't bother, but I don't! It is the best thing after a long workout or if you have forgotten to drink enough water during the day. It really saved me when I got really dehydrated. I recommend coconut water to everyone! And the light pineapple and citrus flavor is very nice. The original flavor is good too.
5	1297555200	Actually, it's my husband who uses this; he's an avid cyclist (at age 68) and subject to leg cramps during and after a tough ride.  He had tried the usual "sport drinks", but still got the cramps.  He heard about coconut water and wanted to try it, and picked up a bottle or two here and there of the various brands and liked Zico best.  I was given a coupon at another store that had it, so I ordered 2 cases.  He made short work of them (the weather was better then) and they made short work of the cramps, but I couldn't find it again at that same store.  Amazon to the rescue!This stuff really works for the cramp-prone, but people differ as to which one tastes best.  My husband likes this one.10/03/11:  Zico has recently brought out a chocolate flavor, which is so yummy even I like it.  My husband rode the last 3 days of the B.R.A.T. (Bicycle Ride Across Tennessee) and had cramps the first night, but realized that he had not kept himself well hydrated, fixed that, and completed the remaining two days without incident.  He's now 69 and rides a few thousand miles per year.
3	1297382400	I read all these great review on this brand so I decided to try it.  I think it's ok but I definitely like VitaCoco better.This one has a funny taste.  VitaCoco taste better.
1	1297036800	I bought this item loving the way it tasted in the 11.2 ounce packages but opting for more drink for your buck I went ahead and order a case of the 14 ounce plastic bottle zico. Bad Idea after my first taste I was unhappy the coconut water tasted like the plastic bottle. If you buy this product definately opt for the tetra packed 11.2 ounce product.
3	1296950400	I am a big fan of Zico coconut water. I drink them after doing Bikram yoga (hot yoga). I was excited to see Zico as a Lightning Deal last month and ordered a pack. It shipped quickly and as promised but one of the Tetra paks was bloated and one of the sides was popped up. I thought maybe just the side of the Tetra pak had become unglued, because it did not appear to have a hole in it. However, it was spoiled and was completely fermented. I understand that sometimes this happens, but coconut water is not cheap and 1 of 12 being spoiled was not acceptable. I am a little leery of ordering them again online!
1	1296777600	I've ordered Zico Mango Coconut Water three times from Amazon. The first two times, the dozen I received were fine. This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a "slightly imperfect" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution.
5	1296172800	Honestly, coconut water is not going to be for everybody.  My wife (Caucasian) thinks it tastes like "dirty water" and I can't disagree with her.  I personally enjoy the taste as I've grown up on coconut water.  I see this new coconut water trend being much like the Red Bull trend.  People from Thailand and other southeast asian cultures were drinking that stuff for years and years before it got popular in the States.So back to the coconut water, yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, it comes out sort of brownish in tint.  This is quite natural.  Anyway, I've have Zico and Vita Coco, and for me it just boils down to which is cheaper at the moment.  Anyway, to wrap up this rambling, I find coconut water quite refreshing once you get used to the taste.
1	1295913600	I am shocked that anyone would pay a whopping 2.50 a bottle for this stuff.  It tastes horrible and I cannot imagine ever reaching for it to rehydrate myself for any reason.  I know the benefits of coconut water but there must be one that tastes better than this!
1	1295395200	this stuff is from concentrate and tastes awful. labeling it "pure" or "natural" is misleading. i dont think they should be able to sell this stuff. or at least should have to make it clear what it really is.
4	1295049600	I would definitely recommend to buy this. Excellent substitute for Coke/Pepsi.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you can never get the taste of the fresh coconut water. Growing up I had lots of fresh coconut water so I know the difference in taste.Its very good but nothing like fresh coconut water. So if you are OK with that this is an excellent product to buy.I will definitely buy again.
5	1294876800	I used to drink Vita Coco. That was until I discovered Zico. It has a natural, fresh from the coconut taste. It's calming to my stomach and very hydrating. Best of all, it has the least calories and sugar of any of the brands that I've seen. It's pricey, but I've found a place I can get a 14oz bottle for $1.99 reliably. To me, it's worth it.
1	1294876800	While the plastic packaging seemed oh-so-convenient for me, when I opened the first bottle and took a sip- YUCK. Plastic is all I taste. Then I noticed that it was also from concentrate!? What!? Way to ruin your product Zico. Wish I'd read these reviews first.
3	1294617600	This has a distinctive sour taste that I'm not very fond of. I'll stick with Vita Coco, not made from concentrate and has a cleaner taste than this.
5	1294531200	This is by far the best tasting coconut water out there.I tried powered version, o.n.e. and Harvest Bay. Zico tops everyone.I use it during my workout with energy bites.  Body doesn't feel as tired after the workout.
1	1294531200	I had heard so much about this drink.  I really wanted to like it.  I was imagining it would be like the coconut waters I had tried from Thailand and the Philippines.It's like drinking cold vomit, there is no other way to describe it.  Really gross stuff, stay far far away.
5	1294358400	This is the most delicious and refreshing coconut water I have tasted so far. I love drinking it after I work out because it has as much potassium as a bananna. The flavor itself isn't too overwhelming with coconut or mango, but a perfect blend of hints of coconut and mango flavor. It's a refreshing water with very subtle flavors of coconut and mango. Not too overwheleming like some other coconut waters. I absolutely LOVE it!
2	1294099200	I did not like the taste  as compared to other brands of coconut water. The only plus was the size bottle
5	1293667200	I use this coconut water to make smoothies and am very pleased with it. The taste is good - very close to fresh. As another reviewer noted, this product does taste the best of all the packaged coconut waters. Its a tad bit more expensive than others, but the subscribe and save price is excellent! There is no straw included, which might be a problem for anyone who wants to drink it straight from the package (not a problem for me since I just use it to make smoothies.)
5	1293148800	regular Zico coconut water is my favorite but mango comes in a close second. Not a very natural flavor but still pretty good
5	1292889600	After trying Zico in a Walgreens in downtown Chicago, I've been hooked!  I love the taste of it, it is unbeatable and really quenches thirst. The other reviews I read say that it tastes plasticy, but I have never thought so.  I doesn't taste like plastic at all and it's much more convenient then the Terapack. I tried Vita Coco when I had a coconut water craving (because I couldn't find Zico) and almost puked! Vita Coco smelled like fermented lactose mixed with the scent of Original Chapstick and if someone handed it to me in a blank glass, I would have NEVER identified it as coconut water. I threw it out as soon as I got off the subway.Vita Coco is horrible! Zico Coconut water is AMAZING and is far better than Vito Coco!
5	1292284800	I've tried other coconut waters and prefer Zico. I actually prefer Zico in a carton to a can, but am not sure there's a difference. No coconut water I've tasted is AS good as the fresh stuff from a coconut, but Zico comes closest.. To my palate, others I've tried just don't cut it.
3	1292198400	Summary:This Zico is a weak shadow of its former self.Pros:  Bottle looks cool?Cons:  Price, from concentrate.  Taste.In-depth Review:I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.
2	1291852800	Taste is ok,reminds of the milk leftover in the bowl after eating your cereal.***BEWARE***My biggest issue is that its made from concentrate.(Very disappointing)Shame on them.They do not tell you that before purchase.Would not have purchased had I known.Amy and Brian's is my favorite.W/or W/out coconut pieces.I will only drink this as back-upI drink 1 glass a day.
2	1291075200	I received this package at my door today. I ordered it as part of the black friday subscription/save deal. I promptly cancelled my subscription. This arrived with the box holding the ZICO damaged within the shipping box. When I opened the box of Zico within I saw that several of my Zicos were already leaking out of their tetrapaks. Then, I tried one. They tasted like fish and sweet potatoes, but worst of all- it was sour. Yuck! Not at all like the Naked coconut juice. Go with that instead.
2	1290729600	I found the flavor variable with each box. I am very familiar with coconut water. I grew up on it in the Caribbean and the US. The Zico product was not very good. Some of the boxes were bland. One box tasted of cigarette ashes immediately after opening it. There are no smokers in my house. So, the flavor had to come from the box. There was a subtle after taste to the others I tried in the 12 pack almost like watered down apple juice. None of the flavors gave off the slight sweetness found in natural coconut water. Tried them both cold and room temperature. Room temperature was the worst. Would not buy these again. I have had canned versions that tasted better.
5	1290470400	I always use coconut water for my vegetable smoothies but grew tired of having to cut through  the coconut and dig out  the white meat then having to  pour the water out of the coconut before I could prepare the smoothie. I needed a faster approach and this works just fine. Besides, no more bits of coconut wood on my tongue!
3	1290211200	Something is missing! No longer tastes like pure coconut water, maybe its being mixed with water but the taste has deteriorated.....I will be shopping a different brand...
1	1289779200	I was fooled into getting this as BJ's because it was cheaper then the boxes, and there is a reason! It's not pure and it tastes like crap. It has a lot less Potassium in the 14 ounce bottom (569) compared to 700+ in the boxes that are 3 ounces smaller! Stick with the boxes, trust me!
1	1289779200	My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via "subscribe and save" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the "from concentrate" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying "top dollar" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the "liquid" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our "subscribe and save" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will "subscribe and save" to another brand that uses the real stuff!
4	1289606400	I really don't enjoy the taste of coconut water, but I instantly feel the benefits. So, I mix mine with fresh orange juice to mask the taste. I also buy fresh coconuts from walmart for 1.68 and drain them for the water, and this product tastes identical. However, if you buy a fresh coconut you get a lot more for the money. So, I just find these products a little pricey, but still good.
1	1288742400	I couldn't take two sips of this. Tastes like chewing on a plastic bag. I used to LOVE Zico in Tetrapak - what happened?? Now I have a case of this and don't know what to do with it!
5	1288742400	It takes an outstanding product to motivate me to write a review. November 2009, I am running south on Pacific Coast Highway as a participant in the Malibu half marathon. A smiling volunteer hands me a cup of liquid around mile 9. Wow! Refreshed, replenished and revitalized, I go on to run my best half marathon and win my age group. What was that magic stuff in the cup? ZICO coconut water! Mighty mighty good. Finally, a sports drink that is not high fructose corn syrup-based. This is the real stuff. I drink it daily. The amazon 12 pack monthly subscription is not enough. I need more ZICO!
1	1288483200	I somehow managed to drink one bottle (it was hot, I was  desperate).  It really tastes bad.  I have all the rest sitting in my cabinet, never to be sipped by me.  When I am dead, I'm sure they will be thrown away.  I know, what do I mean by "bad."  Well, I almost felt like I would get sick if I drank a whole bottle straight.  Maybe it is good for you, but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it.
5	1288310400	I like the taste of Zico coconut water over other brands I've tried. I drink these before my Bikrim yoga class, and it has made a big difference in the quality of my practice.
5	1288224000	I truly enjoyed this product!  It was my first time having it, was especially tasty cold, but not too bad room temp either, for me.  I refrigerated the case right after I received them, but drank one room temp.  The next morning, after my 2 mile run I drank one, I felt refreshed, energized, replenished and invigorated.  The feeling was totally awesome!  I shared some with my friends and family! Thanks Amazon!Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural Flavor, 11.2-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)
1	1287792000	This is the most disgusting drink I have ever tried!  Don't buy unless you know what it is!
1	1287705600	I don't like Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water. It tasted very bland and has a little sour taste to it. It tasted nothing like young sweet green coconut juice. I want to return it to Amazon for a refund.
1	1287532800	This stuff is terrible. It has that concentrated and plasticky taste as if it's not fresh.
4	1287532800	I've tried Vita Coco and Zico, but I do not taste any difference between both. Zico is just slightly cheaper than Vita Coco on Amazon.Sometimes the shipping causes slight rupture to certain beverage box(es) so be careful.
1	1286841600	The first time I had Zico was in a plastic container it was FANTASTIC!!! When I saw that Amazon was offering the same drink in a TetraPak I had to get it. I received the package and tried one and was TOTALLY SHOCKED!!! This was AWFUL!!! It did not taste like anything I had the first time. At first I thought maybe the product expired but the date printed was JUL 2011. I tried another box and it was the SAME THING!!! The drink in the box tasted SOUR!!! MADE ME UPSET!!!Maybe I got a bad batch but that's NO EXCUSE. STAY WITH THE Plastic Container 5 Stars all the way.
1	1286755200	I am from Jamaica, and I had coconuts straight from the trees and this does not taste natural at all, as a matter of fact this is the worst tasting coconut water I have ever tasted.  I was very disappointed, Zico does not come close. I have to give VITA COCO FIVE STAR and this None.
3	1286150400	I have tried zico, naked, one brand, and I disliked zico most.Naked was most fresh coconut water tasting.
3	1286150400	I have been an avid coconut water drinker for the past year and a half and I have tried almost all the brands available:  ONE, VitaCoco, Amy and Bryan, Nature Factor, original Zico, and re-release Zico Tetra Pak, and Naked coconut water.I would like to say the original Zico was the best tasting of all of them however they changed to the plastic bottles earlier this year which received a large number of negative reviews from people who loved the original Zico thus I avoided but now have brought back the Tetra pak.This version they brought back unfortunately does not taste like the original Zico.  Some of you might think that since it's been sometime, perhaps you don't remember what the original taste like.  Well, I would say that I have purchase 12 cartons of their original Tetra pak and drink 1 or 2 a day so I definitely remember what the original taste like.  The flavor is a bit more tart and now tastes closer to VitaCoco which is the most tart of all the brands something that I just do not like.I would purchase in the following order:1.  ONE - Amazon still is out of stock and hoping they come back in stock, this is best tasting one since the original Zico is no longer made.2.  Naked Juice - I like the subtle taste and though does not have quite the coconut flavor as ONE, it doesn't taste tart which is what I don't like.3.  Zico - It just tastes more tart4.  VitaCoco - Not a fan of tart coconut water5  Amy and Bryan and Nature Factor taste way too sweet for me.Zico had the best tasting coconut and that was a consensus if you look at earlier reviews.  I would have continued to purchase their product indefinitely even though they tend to cost a bit more than the other brands but they destroyed any good will they had by stopping production of the original Zico tetra pak and  thinking consumers like us would settle for that concentrate stuff, shame on them.
3	1286150400	This has a nice refreshing flavor when kept chilled but not so good when warm. For those new to coconut water , yes, it will have a flavor some call nutty and others say tastes a bit like the milk from a cereal bowl. . Either way, the nutrition is something I haven't found to be matched anywhere else, not even broccoli. And yes, I have a vegatable juicer. My mixtures taste better with coconut water added to them.  I was going to give it 4 stars, as I like the taste but prefer to drink my coconut water straight from coconuts, but the price is a bit high.
1	1285718400	I love the convenience of a bottle but the content tastes like plastic.  It might do more harm than good if the bottle has BPA in it.
5	1285718400	i've always been a fan of the mango flavor in tetra, but I tried the Zico bottle at the US Open last month.  It was very good, and kept me hydrated all afternoon.  I've been drinking it during long runs too.  New pineapple flavor tastes like a pina colada, yummm
4	1285372800	I know this coconut water is from concentrate but I still really like the taste.  Something about it really appeals to me and I can't quite figure out what, other than perhaps it's not as sweet as some other brands. Regardless of how it compares to the contents of a young coconut, this drink is tasty on its own merits. To be fair, I also get the sense that one might either love it or hate it. It's a shame it's so ridiculously expensive though, because I can chug a bottle in a few seconds.
1	1285200000	I haven't had a lot of experience with zico, but I have seen lot of reviews saying that they switched to concentrate. With little research, I found that the one in the 11.2 ounce carton thing is not from concentrate. Sure, I can agree based on sheer numbers that this coconut water sucks, but the other one does exist in case some of you still care.
1	1284854400	I've been looking for an all-natural coconut water without additives and have tried several brands. I grew up drinking the products from Thailand and liked it, but was told that sugar had been added. I've also had coconut water from the fruit itself on the beaches of Thailand and those are wonderful.This product doesn't taste like anything I've tried, it's awful. I hope it has some type of nutritional value, cause I'm going to have a hard time drinking it otherwise.
1	1284768000	This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.First off, this is "from concentrate". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.Second, they add "natural flavors". There is nothing "natural" about a "natural flavor". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it "natural".
1	1284768000	I loved zico coconut water before it was bought out. I wanted to stick with the natural products and didn't want to buy the items in the plastic containers. So when Zico started to sell the water in the cardboard boxes again, I thought "all right, back in business". I agree with the most recent reviews that this product was awful. A couple were rancid and had to be dumped down the drain. The outer shipping box was damp. I hated the taste of the rest because even though drinkable, they tasted spoiled. I'm looking for another coconut water and I'm not sure what to do because the ONE is no longer being sold and Vita is almost as bad as the last box of ZIco I ordered.
1	1284508800	My first order arrived in a box that smelled somewhat like mold. The containers inside did not but the odor of the box - from Brazil, packed in Brazil - did remind me of humid tropical locations where it is difficul to keep things from mold ... I will NOT buy it again. I would not even give it a "one star" if possible. If bought in a local store I would have taken it back - but it is a hassle by mail.  The flavor of the juice is bland and does not encourage me to buy more. I may try another brand though. And probably NOT packed in the tropics.  VM
1	1284163200	I had thought my experience was my poor luck, but it matches the last group of reviewers. 1 box was trashed, with 1 of the 12 containers exploded. It stunk like rotten bananas. I tasted a couple so far, and they taste a bit sour. I tried the 2nd box, and the first one was "RANCID" like the previous reviewer said. I've tried zico before in the stores, and they do not taste like this.I've O.N.E. coco water, and it's like night and day in terms of taste and quality.
1	1284076800	This came in rotten. I was very exited to try it out. Before I opened the package, it looked like something contaminated was inside, I could tell from the grey part where you drink from. I opened about 3 of them, all of them looked rotten. Now I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the company and say that it might have spoiled during transit due to heat or something but if there is a slight chance that could happen, I'm not personally sure it can happen, then they ought to put labels on it and advise the tracker to ship differently. If I were to drink it instead of inspect it, I would not be very happy!
5	1284076800	Discovered coconut water this summer and I love it!  It tastes great and is very refreshing.  We took some bottles with us when hiking on hot summer days and the coconut water kept us going.  It's very high in natural electrolytes (potassium, I think) and surprisingly low in calorie.
1	1284076800	Plug your nose and chug.  This stuff is disgusting.  Had to pour it into a glass and drink it all at once because once you taste this stuff, you won't be able to take another gulp until you forget about it the next day.  Get the coconut water by Naked Juice.  Way better.
5	1283558400	great way to start my day, end my day, start/end a workout... love this stuff! I lived in Brazil for 2+ years and this stuff is the closest to the real thing.  Thanks!
3	1283299200	I bought based on others positive reviews of Zico tasting like fresh young coconuts freshly shucked. Nope, tastes funny, nothing like a fresh coconut. Luckily I live in a city where I can get fresh young coconuts regularly, but my wife does not feel comfortable shucking them. She only drinks/eats them when I do it. But I am happy to have around to put in my smoothies. I wont even suggest my wife to try it.
1	1283299200	Okay, this is an update because I just got 2 more boxes in a few days ago...As you can see it went from 5 stars to 1! If I can give it 0 stars I would...Your wondering why such a dramatic change, Well let me tell you. The box I got from Amazon was sitting under the sun way to long or something, because the date said it's good until July 2011. But the whole box was spoiled!!! I drank the first one, and it tasted a little funny, a little sour in my honest opinion. I thought maybe it's just this one. So I threw it away, and drank another. It tasted ok, a bit better, but still something was off.So the next day, I tried a few more, (as I tend to drink about 4 a day) And ONE of them... I swear to god, I almost threw up right then and there... I tried puking it out because it was SOOO RANCID and bad... So end result. I AM throwing away the whole box. I will never order Zico coconut water again. In fact I just canceled my subscription right now. Go with Vita Coco instead please.Bad news is that Amazon will not take Grocery items back for return... So gross...I just got my box of Zico and Naked coconut waters today. Mind you, I never tried out Zico before, but I did try out Naked and Vita coco as well.I was very happy with the taste of Zico coconut water compared to Naked's version. I love coconut water, and drink it fresh right out of the shell from tropical islands when I travel. Zico comes the closest to the taste of fresh coconuts. While Naked's had a strange aftertaste to it.If you are a first time buyer for any kinds of coconut water because of the recent health hype about them, I must remind you that the taste of coconut water is an acquired taste... My sister tasted it for the first time and hated it just now.But let me tell you, If I was rich enough to just drink Zico coconut water instead of regular mineral water everyday, I would. But it would cost me around $2,500 a year for the luxury LoL :) (Just did the math of drinking 5 a day)
1	1283299200	I was at the corporate challenge in NYC and they gave this "coconut water" away for free. It came in a plastic bottle and was easy to carry so I took a bunch. I drank one and had to throw all the rest out. This stuff is really disgusting. It ruins the rep for coconut water.
4	1283299200	i was very happy about the  taste .This product remind me of the coconut water of the island
1	1283299200	I used to order the original Zico sold in Tetrapaks, before they introduced the plastic bottle version.  It was great... very refreshing and not too sweet.  The new re-introduced Zico in the Tetrapaks tastes nothing like the previous version.  It has a somewhat strong syrupy sweet/sour taste that leaves a weird residue on your tongue. I came back to this product thinking that it would be the same as before they messed with it, but I think I'm done with Zico.  I was getting shipments of O.N.E. (which is wonderful), but sadly they have been out of stock.  I guess I will have to wait for them to restock again...
3	1282780800	I drink a lot of coconut water.  The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico.  Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.
5	1282780800	I can't get enough of this stuff.  I'm not sure what it costs in stores because I've never seen it in a store.  After the subscribe and save it's less than $1.50 per container.  People spend much more than that at the convenience store on sodas.
2	1282608000	I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn't made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico withNaked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12). It's as good as the old Zico was if not better.
1	1282521600	frankly i don't care about the packaging, (some folks are up in arms about the new plastic bottles rather than the old tetra packs) but zico--which used to be my favorite coco water--no longer tastes as good as it once did. then i read that it's now FROM CONCENTRATE rather than being what it once was, and i don't see any reason to purchase it any longer. very disappointed.
2	1282176000	I wish I could say that I loved this.  I really do.  However, all I can taste is PLASTIC.  I have no idea if the coconut water is decent or not because the taste of plastic container is SO overwhelming.It honestly tastes like a bottle of average water that has been left in your vehicle in the 100-degree heat for four days.
1	1282176000	I was excited to find ZICO on auto delivery, but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe.  I ordered 2 boxes and they had a plastic after taste.  I thought maybe it was just this batch...so I waited for my next order. Same thing taste like plastic and made from concentrate.  It use to be so good!Cancelled my subscription today!
4	1282089600	Not the best I've tried, but still just fine, and I will continue purchasing it because the container is recyclable, unlike the "boxes" other coconut water comes in.
3	1282003200	I absolutely love the Zico Coconut Water product, especially with the discounted pricing that appeared to be available on Amazon using the Subscription options. However, it turned out that the discounts that brought the price down to $1.75/bottle rather than $2.50/bottle only applied to my first shipment...the rest of the shipments did not have the discounts applied.This product is fantastic if you can manage to find it for a good price...it's refreshing and healthy, everything I look for in a product I would drink each day.
5	1282003200	I love this stuff.  An excellent product for a fair price and exceptional customer service in having it delivered to me!
5	1281571200	I absolutely LOVE Zico!  The taste is superb and I drink it on a daily basis. It is so refreshing and makes me feel hydrated after a grueling workout.  I loved the cartons, but the new bottle is amazing because you can close it and carry it everywhere.  I have recommended it to my friends and they are now hooked too!  I just ordered another case! Thank you, Zico!
1	1281312000	This product was great in the TetraPak.  Now it is absolutely horrible.  The worst tasting coconut water compared One, Naked, and VitaCoco.  It tastes like plastic and nothing like coconut water.  This product in the plastic container is from concentrate.
1	1281312000	I have a bout of gastritis and learned that coconut water is the natural way to help relieve those issues while fasting. I tried it and it worked great but I tried two different brands, Zico and Vita Coco. I loved Vita Coco and hated Zico -  the more I drank it the more I hated it...will not buy again!
1	1281312000	How do you kill a good product ?Well, bring Coke and they know how to take nature's pure coconut water, add a bunch of flavors, destroy the taste and package them in genuine plastic.Sorry, I will go for another product..
1	1281312000	This doesn't taste anything like the old Tetra pack ZICO. It's now made from concentrate, which is not displayed prominently in Amazon description. DON'T BUY THIS NEW ZECO.
1	1281139200	I was quite excited to try the 14 ounce bottle of Zico coconut water and much to my dismay when it finally came and I got a chance to try it I was royally disappointed. The coconut water has a plastic bottle aftertaste and it is quite unpleasant. I had one and will never drink another... too bad I bought 2 twelve packs. Get your water in those aseptic containers, NOT PLASTIC!!!
3	1280534400	I love drinking coconut juice even when I was still living in the Philippines where it was sold by a street vendor and opened right in front of you where he sticks a straw for you to drink right away the goodness and freshness of it. Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands,  the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it. Maybe next time I'll try the tetra packed zico to see if I'll like it better.
3	1280534400	Man!!! I loved the previously available tetra pack ones. For some reason, I am not able to really appreciate the goodness of bottled ZICO which has ADDED FLAVOR now. The tetra packs were really refreshing and tasting real. Being from a south-asia country where freshly chopped coconut water are available, I was really impressed with the tetra packs that was available from ZICO previously. With the added flavor in these, I can feel the artificial flavor when I drink from the bottle now. ZICO has to go back and NOT add the flavor to make it REALLY natural and original. But overall I guess I could give a B+ rating on the product.
1	1280275200	I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container.  Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled.  This will be my last box of ever of Zico.  I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco.
3	1280188800	I found this coconut water to be almost tasteless.  It was more like water with a slight coconut flavor.  Coconut waters are quite expensive, and I like more coconut flavor.  No true complaints, there are just others I prefer to the Zico.
1	1280016000	Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.Natural coconut water is better than concentrate.
1	1279756800	I really like Zico in the tetra pak. When I tried the bottled formula, I didn't realize that the formula was any different...I just thought it was a new bottle. My reaction to every sip was that it tasted and smelled very plastic-y. It seemed that sitting in the plastic bottle was imparting a plastic flavor to the drink. I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back! I then did a little research and realize that this is the new flavor of this formula using a new variety of coconut and from concentrate. I really don't like this new flavor at all. I will not be buying this product in the bottle again.
4	1279497600	I've always had coconut water from the real coconuts (freshly cut right in front of me), so drinking it from a plastic bottle isn't the same. The taste feels a bit different too, but if you take it out of the bottle and drink in a glass, it doesn't remind you as much that it came from a plastic bottle :)
3	1279065600	I tried VitaCoco, O.N.E. and Zico--Zico is my least favorite.  I could barely taste any coconut flavor, it was like drinking water from the tap.  In addition, on the can of Zico it's stated that the coconut water is made 'from concentrate.' None of the others are made this way.  Zico states on the can to SHAKE WELL, obviously b/c the 'concentrate' settles and needs this extra step taken.  Other brands do not. My advice is to taste test as many brands as you see fit, as some people seem to like Zico's taste.  No matter which brand you choose, there are benefits to any kind of coconut water; but to my mind and my tastebuds, I prefer the other brands.
1	1278547200	If you like fresh coconut milk I would highly recommend you do not purchase this product. It is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product.
4	1278374400	Zico water is fantastic.  Drink only when it's chilled. The taste of Zico water taste is more consistent when coming from the bottle rather than the tetra pak.Amazon grocery suscription service. I ordered Zico ahead of the summer months on subscription ordering under the assumption that was getting the bevvy for $2 a bottle. When the refill was sent, the total cost went up by $6.  After contacting Amazon customer service, it was explained that Amazon.com charges whatever the price is on the day your order is refilled so that you really never know what you will pay.  Bummer and boo on amazon.com for not knowing what subscription pricing means. Yeah Zico!
1	1278374400	Zico is HORRIBLE NOW! COKE DESTROYED IT! From pure coconut water from trusted suppliers to Plastic bottles and from some nasty concentrate.  Buy ONE or Vita coco or any other brand of natural coconut water. Not some dried up goop, packaged, processed and re -constitued with tap water.  DAMN YOU ZIIIIICOOOOOOO!
1	1278115200	Coca Cola now partially owns Zico. So, now it's made from concentrate, has added "natural flavors" and is packaged in plastic. How to ruin nature's perfect drink for profit. This was my favorite, now I will not buy this "new formula" again...Looking to find another like Zico used to be. Don't know yet if the Zico tetra pak is still the "old formula"..also..rumor has it that Pepsi is looking to buy Vita Coco..so will be keeping my eye on this, too
3	1278028800	I had coconut water when I was in the Philippines & loved it.  So, I ordered this when I got home since I enjoyed it so much.  Zico coconut water is pretty good, but not as good as the fresh coconut water I had previously, so I was slightly disappointed.
1	1277856000	Don't get me wrong, I REALLY wanted to love this as I had read so many great things about coconut water.  I was so excited when my order came.  I had some already in the fridge so it was cold.  After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water.  I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was.  I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck!
1	1277251200	Ick! This stuff is disgusting...why anyone would subject themselves to "Nature's Sports Drink" is beyond me! If you're looking for coconut water at least choose the brand without all the added ingredients!
1	1276992000	Was so excited when I saw Zico had 14 oz containers of coconut water. This is not the original formulation. It is disgusting. It is like it has been boiled down into a concentrate and then water added. It tastes terrible & odd and has WAY too much packaging than the original style. Not thirst quenching at all.... makes me nauseous. Buy the brand "One".Stay away from this product. Total waste of money.
1	1276646400	Heloooo people do you read the ingredients?  Zico is made from concentrate!!! I drink Vitacoco because it has one ingredient NATURAL COCONUT WATER.  Zico is a no-go....
5	1276646400	I am an island girl and this is a product where I feel I JUST got my straw into the best ripe coconut ever. I now have a monthly shipment to my house. If you love real coconut water...THIS is it!
2	1276387200	I had been purchasing their boxed coconutwater and that seemed to vbe discontnued and order the lrger plasticbollted water and found the taste was diffeent. I do not know if the bttle changes the taste fr the box, but is was not the same. A little disappointed in Zico.
1	1276128000	Although Zico may claim to be natural, I disagree since it is made from concentrate. I prefer to drink Vita Coco, which is a much more flavorful brand of coconut water and is actually 100% NATURAL!
5	1275782400	Having been raised on a tropical coast, I have had tons of fresh young coconuts. Though no packaged coconut water comes close to the taste of fresh-from-a-tender-coconut water, Zico is the best one I have found so far (have tried many others sold here at Amazon and elsewhere; Vita Coco is the 2nd best in my opinion). Coconut water is awesome in terms of being nutritious and refreshing, and sodas of course don't hold a candle to it. I have tried both the Zico 'natural' (as in no added flavor) and the Zico mango flavored, and must say that the mango flavored one wins hands down. The regular one has a slightly 'cooked' or 'boiled' taste to it (as packaged coconut water is pasteurized), and maybe the mango flavor covers that in the other one. Tastes great whether cool or cold; probably better the colder it is. The mango flavor is very delicate, and does not take away from the coconut water itself, somehow enhancing it and making it even more delicious. Plus, the first time I got this the price was fantastic, 8 dollars off from the usual 24 due to a lightning deal, making this even sweeter (no pun intended, the coconut water has only a touch of sweetness, no added sugar - just the right, natural amount). Hopefully this will be back in stock soon so I can 'subscribe and save' to keep the price low.
1	1275782400	I bought this new Zico water hoping to have the good taste it had before but unfortunately it tastes horrible. I could not bear drinking half bottle. Very funky taste. I am from Brazil and I sure know what young coconut water tastes like...and what they did to the taste of it is nowhere close to real coconut water. Perhaps works for those who like aged coconut water.I wish I could return my order. Never buying it again. Back to O.N.E.
1	1275609600	I liked the idea of an unsweetened drink like this, but the taste is off, and the "texture" is creepy.
2	1275523200	I've been drinking coconut water for years and I've tried them all ONE, Vita Coco, Naked, etc.. Zico was my favorite until this recent change where they added a new ingredient called "natural flavor". It use to be be pure coco water but the new ingredient change the taste for me. This was one of the highest reviewed coco waters on Amazon before this change...what a pity...I'm dropping Zico from my auto-ship and going back to something that doesn't have artificial "natural flavor" added to what should be pure coco water.
1	1275264000	I used to LOVE the ZICO Coconut Water.I used to buy 2 boxes monthly.Until they decided to change from the Tetra-Pack to the Platic Bottles.For some reason, ZICO thinks its a better product, unfortunatly, the plastic leaches to the Coconut Water and changes the taste. It literally taste like plastic.I stopped buying ZICO and went over to O.N.E., not as tasty as the Tetra-Pack ZICO, but atleast doesnt taste like plastic!!!KEEP AWAY FROM ZICO, until they change it back to Tetra-Pack!Aparently i found out after some dabling online. Its not 100% coconut water, they changed the process where they make the coconut water out of CONCENTRATE.....honestly...concentrate??? No i am pissed off.....
5	1275177600	I didn't think they could improve on the original which has sustained me on the most hot and humid days in the mid-atlantic after a grueling soccer game. It works better that any Gatorade-type product I've ever tried. When I was in LA last month, I tried the new original flavor in the bottle and couldn't get enough of it. The only drawback is that it's in only a few stores on the Maryland area. Everyone has the Vita Coco which is always in stock--wonder why?
5	1275177600	all I can say is... I'm LOVIN' it!  so much easier and more convenient than the other packaging, and frankly, I think it's more tasty!  I used to be a passion fruit devote but now the natural is smooth and easy to drink.  I can't get enough!!!Signing up for auto-ship.  It's too bad that you can't get more than one shipment a month --- I'm signing up for all three flavors!
5	1275091200	There's absolutely nothing bad to say about ZICO in the new bottle.  It's a win-win.  It's super healthy, super delicious, convenient, and portable.  And it's environmentally friendly in at least 2 ways - the bottle and cap are recyclable, and we're not paying to ship water across the ocean!!  We have got to move in this direction for the health of the planet.  YOU have got to move in this direction for the health of your bod!!
5	1275004800	I love, I mean LOVE the new Zico bottle. The new bottle allows me to take it everywhere. The old packaging I had to use a straw cause I didn't really like having my mouth on it and had to finish it before I really did anything, but now that the bottles are out...possibilities are endless. Thank you Zico! My favorite flavor is the natural; it also tastes delicious with a little rum in it.
5	1275004800	I love the new ZICO in the bottle!! The natural is my fave!!  It is a bit nuttier than the Tetra ZICO.  The bottle makes it so much easier to take to the gym, on my bike or throw in my backpack. Plus I love that I can reseal it and don't have to drink it all at once (although once it is opened, I have a hard time NOT finishing it!!).  My kids love the new flavors since they are sweeter and I love that they drink it since it is so much healthier for them than most other beverages on the market.  Thank you ZICO!!
5	1275004800	Zico in plastic bottles is the best idea since, well, Zico.  I love that the containers are recyclable now, and they fit in my car's cup holders!
5	1275004800	The new natural is my new favorite and I love the bottles!  I can't believe it took them so long to get it out.  I'm still a slave to the Tetra Packs and love the good, old flavors, but it's great to have options and portability.The flavor tastes more like what you would expect coconut water to taste like. It's a bit nuttier and very different from the Brazilian coconut.  So many choices and options!  Keep up the good work, Zico!
1	1275004800	Zico used to be my coconut water of choice. When I first saw the new packaging I was excited that it would be easier to close and store. I was shocked when I tasted it - it is NOT the same product! The taste really turned me off. I've since switched to O.N.E. coconut water.I also determined that the new bottle size is too big of a serving. I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting.
5	1274918400	Thank you ZICO! i love the new bottles. I was a huge fan of the tetra packs but i couldnt take em anywhere. I've been taking the new bottle to gym, in my bike and just walking around. The pomberry is my fave. The natural in a bottle tastes more like coconut water straight from a coconut. Love 'em! come out with some more flavors soon!
5	1274918400	ZICO is the best thing for after a workout!  I love that it's available in a bottle now- I can throw it in my gym bag and not worry about it spilling.  Besides being good for you, it tastes great.  Definitely a new favorite.
5	1274832000	After living in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and a native of California - I've seriously become addicted to coconut water.  Hydration, Nutrition, Refreshment and Taste.Hydration and Nutrition - working as a dive instructor in the Gulf of Thailand, often times travelers would show up in not so fresh of a state from the night before. My go-to was always to make them drink coconut water. Natural electrolytes!Refreshment and Taste - not only is this stuff good for you, it tastes awesome. Feels like water and tastes like fresh sweetness but without that gross syrupy fake flavor.With so many brands out there trying to sell me the magic water in the bottle, it's hard to figure out which company is the real deal. I like ZICO for one main reason:- 100% natural COCONUT WATER.  That's it. Some other brands out there are actually "coconut juice" and contain sugar, preservatives and even stuff like sodium metabisulfite...huh? I have a bottle from another company and it's been in my fridge for like weeks.ZICO's ingredient: 100% coconut water. :) Nice job ZICO.And I like the packaging.  The blue with beach picture reminds me of far off places while sitting in my office.
5	1274745600	Finally someone figured it out to put coconut water in a bottle. Love the fact that i can walk around with and it won't spill. I never liked the Natural flavors (none of the brands, not even zico) but I've tried Natural in a bottle and it IS good.
5	1274745600	I tried other coconut water and i really love this one =Delicious and Healthy Coconut Water . If somebody did not like it then can send it to me , i will be happy to drink it for you (Mir?). I gonna order it again and again.(Oh la la ... dont care about the bad reviewes  )
4	1274745600	Pom is my favorite, but natural was much different, and better, than I expected. Different taste than the old ZICO, but there's less sugar, though it doesn't seem like it's any less sweet. Still getting used to the new natural flavor, but by the second bottle I'm starting to rather prefer it over the old.
5	1274745600	I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!Cheers!!!!P.S. ZICO is still amazing.
5	1274659200	So I haven't tried EVERY coconut water available - but I do love Zico in the reclosable bottle.  It is from concentrate, yes...it does include coconuts from more than just Brazil, yes...it does kinda taste like milk at the bottom of your cereal bowl - Yes! I love it! I know that it tastes a little different from the Zico U get in the tetra pak, so maybe they should change the name of it - still a great beverage! I have it set to autoship monthly! Yummy...I also like O.N.E. coconut water - the flavored ones are good, the plain natural flavor is still my best from them.I also like Zico in Passion Fruit & I also like the natural Zico in the tetra pak.No, I don't work for Zico!
1	1274572800	The old Zico was delightful.  This new version is so aweful as to be totally undrinkable.  I am now watering my plants with it.  How did they manage to ruin a parfeclty good product. Is Zico now owned by Pepsico?
1	1274486400	The Zico coconut juice in the old tetrapak was great the new in the bottle is the worst I ever had.Just poured 12 bottles down the toilet.
1	1274400000	I've tried a lot of brands of coconut water, and have found that I like Zico pure coconut water the best. It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long. I would advise anybody who enjoys the 11oz box to stick with that and stay away from this joke of a product. Nasty.
4	1274400000	wasn't too sure about the taste or the product being from concentrate so i asked ZICO what's up with that--i'm not about to put in anything fake or artificial in this temple!!! got a pretty detailed response from their CS team,"Thank you for taking the time to reach out to ZICO regarding your feedback below.  While I'm disappointed that you do not like the taste of the new ZICO in a bottle, I did want to please clarify a few misconceptions that I believe may exist.* Rationale - The reason for launching the bottle was pure and simply consumer demand.  Our active lifestyle consumers wanted a packaging solution that allowed them to enjoy ZICO coconut water in a way that met their needs.  For a number of reasons, tetra packaging was not that solution so we came up with the bottle as a result.* Taste - You are correct that the new ZICO taste is different from the product in the Tetra, however that is due to the fact that for the bottle, we are using a blend of coconuts from around the world, rather than simply coconuts from Brazil, as we do in the carton.  This blend was selected for its lighter taste, it's naturally lower caloric content (20% fewer calories per oz.) and it's naturally increased sodium levels to optimize hydration benefits.  The taste you are experiencing is intentionally different, but it is due to the blend of coconuts we are using rather than the packaging.  The good news is that we are continuing to manufacture ZICO in a carton so that consumers like yourself can choose which taste and nutritional profile they prefer.* Packaging - Contrary to what you would expect, the new ZICO bottle actually has a lower carbon footprint than the tetra pack:o Tetra packaging is only recyclable in 40% of the U.S. and today less than 1% is actually recycled.  To do so is extremely energy intensive, as it requires separating the multiple layers of materials that make up the carton.o The ZICO bottle is #2 recyclable, accepted in almost all curbside recycling programs nationwide and currently 40% of all HDPE bottles are recycled in the USo ZICO bottles are made domestically, which means we have reduced the impact (fuel, energy, pollution) of shipping full-strength water and packaging materials around the globeAt ZICO we take our impact on the environment very seriously, so I would like to reassure you that our decision to launch the bottle was entered into with the environment top-of-mind and this decision was embraced fully by retail partners like Whole Foods, who understand the environmental realities of tetra vs. HDPE, despite consumer misperceptions.I apologize for the long response to your inquiry, however you clearly have a passionate viewpoint on the new bottle, so I wanted to make sure that we provided you with the proper insights and facts to be able to make your decision.  And regardless of your final decision, I would like to thank you again for taking the time to write to us, as it's feedback like yours that helps us ensure we stay true to what consumers would like."Felt a lot better with a better understanding. The new natural is getting addicting. my body is craving this stuff after a workout.
2	1274313600	I'm from the Caribbean and now live in the United States.  Since I can't get fresh coconut water where I live I order it from Amazon all the time...every few weeks or so.  My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their "new" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.  Hope you don't make the same mistake that I did.
5	1274313600	I'm not one to write reviews, only when I love / hate the product and for one thing, I HATE coconuts. However, I first tried the passion fruit flavored Zico and thought, this doesn't taste like coconuts at all! I loved the taste and soon got addicted to how good I felt post workouts. I tried the other mango flavor, and liked it too, so thought I'd venture to the natural coconut one. To my surprise, it wasn't what I remembered coconuts tasted like, in fact, it was more refreshing than the other flavors!I love the new bottle Zico has come out with, it makes drinking and cooling Zico so much easier. The Lime and Pomberry additions are amazing! The bottles make traveling with it easier, and now, I don't have to drink in one sitting.Best time to drink a Zico though is after a hard night of partying. I don't know what it is, but after a night of drinking, I always reach for a Zico and the next morning, its as if nothing happened the night before. I'm a firm believer in the natural remedies of coconuts now, post workout, post drinking, post anything where you exert energy. I still won't eat a real coconut, but I will drink a Zico. I've tried the other brands out there and cannot stomach it, but for some reason, love Zico.
1	1274227200	I've spent at least a hundred bucks on the old Zico boxes.  Those were metal lined, the juice was not from concentrate.  I just got a shipment of the new bottles, took a swig and almost spit it out.  Tastes like plastic.  I gave it a few more swigs, and now my stomach hurts.I immediately logged into Amazon so I could warn others not to buy this crap.  I'm closing the bottle, putting it back in the box and sending it all back to Amazon.  I will never buy Zico again.  YUCK!
5	1274227200	Love the taste. Dont know why this drink has such bad reviews but I personally like this much more than O.N.E's coconut water.
5	1274140800	I love the new Zico in a bottle!  To me, it tastes the most like real coconut water straight from the coconut.  Even when it was in tetra, Zico was my favorite (VitaCoco tastes like pure garbage and ONE isn't so great either) but I love that it is finally in a bottle so that I can take it with me to the gym and anywhere else I'm going.Can't wait to try the other flavors!!
1	1274140800	I was sooo initially excited about pre-ordering on amazon.com before it was available.  Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came, and boy am I ssooooooo DISAPPOINTED.  Smells funny, tastes salty.  Not same formulation.  Zico should have disclosed new formulation.  Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.  That brand was very comparable to the old Zico.I was a ZICO fan, but this new formulation just is grossly disappointing.
5	1274054400	I've always been a loyal ZICO coconut water fan, and so was extremely excited to hear about the new packaging...and I have to say that I was MORE than pleased! The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go.The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too!The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials.Two thumbs up on the new packaging and the new taste profile!! Now only if they came out with more flavors...
1	1274054400	I loved the old Zico water in the square containers and couldn't wait for Amazon to get this in. I got the two cases I ordered today and it tastes terrible! It actually tastes like plastic or some sort of chemical/pesticide. Even after chilling it and pouring into a glass it is still not drinkable. Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead. It was my second favorite until now and I will never buy another bottle of ZICO.Who cares if you can recycle the bottle if the product is not fit to drink? What a waste of $60!
1	1274054400	The new price is very attractive. However, it tastes horrible. Maybe if you haven't had the old Zico, or any other of the coconut water brands you might find it acceptable.
1	1273795200	I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see "premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors."I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?
5	1273795200	Finally Zico put my favorite coconut water in a resealable and recyclable bottle! And the flavors are awesome!If you haven't tried coconut water before start with Zico, it tastes like the real deal.I've been trying to cut out refined sugar but drinking water only got boring and didn't do the trick after hard workouts and runs. I did some research and learned a few of the many benefits of coconut water-- tons of electrolytes, potassium, low acidity, etc. and Zico is hands down my favorite. Its really refreshing and more hydrating than Gatorade (which my kids even my kids have abandoned for Zico!) I've tried some other brands but Zico blows them out of the water, literally!I've told all of my spinning students about it and they agree that Zico is the best one out there because of its great taste and now its even better because its in a bottle! We try to recycle as much as we can but Ohio doesn't have centers that can take the old packaging but luckily the new Zico bottle is made from a #2 plastic - which is the same as the milk jugs you can recycle anywhere.
3	1273017600	I tried the subscription service for this. Amazon decided not to bother notifying me when they had no stock. Considering these are all advanced orders I have trouble understanding 1). why a subscription is not fulfilled, and 2). Why Amazon does not have the courtesy to notify their customers when they are not shipping a subscription. I have other vendors that would not hesitate to correct issues like this. I doubt I will bother with Amazon subscription services again.
5	1271548800	I really like this Coconut water because it has nothing added to it. It tastes just right and not too sweet like so many brands. There are several drinks that try to pass themselves off as coconut water, but all thats in the can is corn syrup with coconut chunks floating around in it. This has no artificial sweetner at all and tastes natural. This is not for people who want something sweet. If you want that go buy Goya Coconut flavored drink.Since this in not available at Amazon right now a close second is O.N.E. Coconut Water. O.N.E. kind of tastes like it has a small splash of milk in it (there isn't though) and is a little bit more tart. Zico is the best in my opinion, but I do not really want to pay close to $12 in shipping so I will have to drink O.N.E until Zico is available for Amazon Prime.
4	1271376000	I give the Zico mango flavored coconut water 4 stars because that touch of flavor does not do it for me unless I add some Splenda.  The natural flavor Zico coconut water, on the other hand, taste just right, and I give that one 5 stars!.
5	1271203200	I think Zico is the best tasting because...I cannot explain it, but it has the fresher taste. I think it is a little pricey, but so worth it.
5	1269820800	It's a great sport drink.  It's much better than all the other sports drink. Zico contains much less sugar that the other sports drink and contains more potassium than the others.
2	1269129600	If you've had Vita Coconut water before, then I doubt one would like Zico. I felt a slight artificial flavor the moment I took the first swig. Having had organic tender coconut from nature, I feel Vita Coco comes the closest to the real one. Zico is not bad save that artificial taste probably due to the addition of extra electrolytes. It was definitely a good alternative to soda or Gatorade when you return from a game of soccer or baseball but not so good when you want a drink at home. I would suggest Vita coconut water.
5	1269043200	There is coconut water, and there is Coconut Water. Zico is the King (Queen?) of Coconut Water. I've been on auto-delivery since I first tried it and am horrified that it's been out of stock ever since. The manufacturer probably wasn't expecting it to take off as quickly or as stupendously as it has, but hey, this is what happens when you bottle a fabulous product!
5	1267574400	Just wanted to quickly give my opinion...Zico is the coconut water you want!  Vita-Coco is good, but the flavor of Zico is much better.  Vita-Coco can be a tad sour compared to Zico.I had never heard of Zico before, but tried it based on other reviews.  I ordered 2 cases in order to receive free shipping.  This stuff is great and this is what I will be ordering from now on!
5	1267056000	This coconut water is great tasting!! It naturally hydrates,is a great thrist quencher and is a good source of electrolytes. This is one of my favorite drinks in the summer.
3	1265932800	I found that Zico had a strange after taste.  It is hard to describe almost a metallic tang.  I do not know what it could be since the box states that it is pure coconut water.  This taste is not in Vita Coco's product, I have not tried O.N.E as yet so I cannot say if it has an after taste.
5	1264809600	I've always bought Gatorade & G2 to help re-hydrate but neither of them have near the amount of potassium and electrolytes that ZICO does.  ZICO is a natural way to re-hydrate the body without the sugar/calories.  The original ZICO has a great taste and makes you feel like you're in the tropics.  I give ZICO an A+!!
4	1264204800	This coconut water is great and Id recommend it to anyone who can afford it. The mango flavor is subtle and it goes down smooth right after working out. This is a pricey brand of coconut water. I've seen it cheaper in Whole Foods and YES Organic Market. Only buy this if u have the money to spare or flavor is really important to you.
5	1263945600	I discovered ZICO premium coconut water at the Bikram Yoga Studio in El Cajon, California.  It was like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert!  Bikram Yoga is practiced in a hot room, and hydrating one's body is very important for this intense workout.  Additionally, it's necessary to replenish the electrolytes, and drinkng ZICO provided me with a natural way to do this.  The coconut water is assimilated easily and quickly into the body, and bouncing back from a sweaty session of yoga is fast.  My body feels good inside, and I am refreshed enough to sail through the rest of my day with the greatest of ease.  I enjoy this product so much that I now have it shipped to my home every month.  And, it's fun to share it with others.
5	1261612800	For the folks who did not like the taste, it is just because they are not used to it, poor things. Coming from a tropical island and now in the middle of America, I have missed this so much. Incidentally, back in the day, and no antibiotics available, this product was used for folks with kidney and stomach infections, as the liquid is sterile.
5	1261267200	We Love Zico coconut water. We feel its flavor is outstanding and we know coconut water as we have costa rican jungle with our own coconuts.So when we are back in the U.S. we relay on Zico.
4	1259798400	I bought this drink on a whim. While having tried coconut water when I was very young, it's not a very common beverage for someone living in the Northwestern US, So it was a bit of a shock to try it again. I was rather unimpressed when I first tried this drink, but it was just barely chilled. But I went back and tried it again to find that my fridge had frozen it to where it had slushy clumps in it and it was great! I'll probably drink the rest of the pack I got just like that.Definitely an acquired taste, but one worth trying.
1	1257897600	Earlier I had tried VitaCoco, I thought that was bad, Zico beat it to the bottom. It was worse than vita coco. If it was not for Amazon's great customer service I would have not even tried ordering Zico after my vita coco experience. I grew up drinking coconut water in our country (India) where we drink it out of coconut, I know I cannot expect the same. In fact even there depending on how old the coconut, you can taste the difference in the water but none of the packaged brands.I don't know how come Zico is having better rating than VitaCoco, which is why I ordered in first place. I always rely on Amazon customer reviews, which gives me the confidence to buy that product, in this case it failed.May be people are comparing to sports drink while reviewing rather than coconut water, or they do not have any fresh coconut water experience.I am still waiting for a good one.Five star rating for  Amazon Customer service....thank you Amazon.Ref:Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1- Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)
5	1256688000	This taste's just like real coconut water. This is the real deal, unlike sugary imitation coconut water sold in most asian stores.
4	1255305600	The best coconut water product - tastes great and very close to natural, tastes better than O.N.E.However, note that Amazon is much more expensive than other places such as Wegmans. As of this writing, Amazon sold twelve 11 oz. packs for $24 and because $24 &lt; $25 and hence no free shipping, you have to double your order for free shipping. Thus you pay $2 a piece for a minimum purchase of $48. On the other hand, at local Wegmans I could buy just one 11 oz pack for $1.79!
5	1255219200	Each of these three products has a number of reviews.  I don't have much to add to any of the individual reviews.  Coconut water is great, if you are in the market for a case of it you already know this.  But which of these three is the best?I went around town and found 5 boxes of each of the three brands (15 total) each, with no two boxes of a the same brand coming from the same supplier.  The goal was to get a wide range of product batches.  This I am happy to report was pointless.  All three brands produce an internally consistent product.I then ordered a 12 pack of all three brands from Amazon.  The only significant difference in packaging is that O.N.E. glues a little telescoping straw to each individual box, the other two brands do not.  If you are a straw person this is a feature if not this is just more trash, you decide.  The amount per container varies slightly by brand but given the price fluctuation on Amazon I don't consider the 0.1 Oz  differences an important factor.All three are made in Brazil, O.N.E. mentions that it is pasteurized the other two do not (nevertheless, I suspect all three are).On pure taste, at refrigerator temperature, I foundZicoto be the best (say 5/5), but only nominally better thanO.N.E.(4.5/5),Vitawas a distant third (3/5).  Both Zico and O.N.E. taste almost exactly like drinking right from a fresh green coconut.  Vita, on the other hand, has a grape aftertaste which I did not like.  At room temperature the order remained the same; however, the differences in taste became more obvious: Zico (5/5), O.N.E. (4/5), Vita (2/5).  Obviously all of this is subjective.I observed the price of three on Amazon over the course of a month.  Zico (~$24) was consistently more expensive than the other two (~$18-21) which traded places as the least expensive.Considering the price and quality, O.N.E. is my choice and the brand to which I now subscribe.  I consider Zico an excellent, but over priced, product and Vita an inferior product.  If, however, I preferred my coconut water at room temperature I would give strong consideration to paying the extra money for Zico.  If I used my coconut water as a mixer I would buy which ever one is cheapest at the time.All three products are better than nothing (the previous option) and I am happy to see them on the market.
5	1254787200	Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.
5	1254528000	Mark Rampolla introduced Zico in 2004 after discovering coconut water as a Peace Corp volunteer in Central America; it has been catching on ever since. Why because it is great tasting; but most importantly it is great for you. It contains more potassium than one banana and only contains 60 calories.Potassium is key and it has 15 times more than sports drinks; as those of us who have problems with muscle cramping are relieved to know. I think it is probably the best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors. All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water. It also contains a healthy complement of phosphorous, magnesium and calcium with even a gram of protein.Enjoy this drink experience after exercising and you will never feel faint and/or dehydrated again.Bentley/2009

5	1254441600	I love, love, love this product!!!  It's all I use to blend my power shakes with, it blends so well; not to mention all the minerals it provides! However, the best reason I love it, is now instead of buying bottled water and polluting the planet, I buy Zico, pour it in my eco cup and go! I'm so glad I discovered Zico, it's a great find.  Did I say I love this product?
5	1254096000	I didn't expext it to taste that good, but I tried it because I wanted something natural to boost my energy. And it has more potassium than a banana which I needed it. And it tasted really good when it was cold, but when its warm ughh!!
5	1253577600	according to my nutritionist, coconut water is much healthier for you than gatorade. I'd say Zico Mango is the best coconut water flavor choice available!
5	1252972800	This Zico coconut water, in three flavors, is absolutely sensational! Until it is available in my area, I definitely will order more of this healthy product. The best drink discovery of my life! Excellent taste, fast delivery, good for me.....what's not to like?
5	1252627200	THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST. LOW IN SUGAR  HIGH IN POTASSIUM  SET MY BODY STRAIGHT  LOVE THIS ITEM  I A DAY  AND NO NEED TO EAT BANANAS EACH DAY  EXCELLENT  HYDRATER  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
4	1252022400	When I recieved the box , one of the units was damaged.  It leaked on the box it came in.However, all others where fine.  Taste of the Mango was good, better when cold.
5	1251936000	I used to get leg and foot cramps from doing hot room yoga.  I drink one or two Zico waters after yoga, and I never get cramps!  This is the only product that has helped after exercise.  Now, even when I fast walk or run, I'll down a box of Zico water just in case!
4	1251849600	if youre thinking of using this as a substitute for sugary drinks or something, you might as well just drink water. this drink is not very sweet at all, but has 15g of carbs in it. not good if youre drinkin this to cut back on sugar. i mean, yeah, its less than a soda or whatever, but for how sweet this is, you might as well drink water and remove carbs from the picture altogether. if youre just lookin to buy this because you like coconut water, then have at it -- it tastes just like what you would expect.
5	1249257600	Excellent product.  Clean and refreshing taste and works great replacing electrolytes after Bikram Yoga!
5	1247788800	First off, a disclaimer: For those unfamiliar with coconut juice, do not expect it to taste like 'coconut milk' or a pina colada. If you've never had it, it's hard to describe the taste - it is slightly sweet, slightly umami, subtly salty.Ironically, I just hacked open a few young fresh coconuts over the weekend for the juice and pulp. I'm therefore able to compare this packaged product directly with nature's own package. I am writing this review after receiving my first case of Zico and tasting it for the first time.Occasionally, the local Vietnamese supermarkets here will have whole, young coconut for $1.25 each. It takes a butcher knife and only a little amount of finesse to chop through the green husk, get to the seed, create a small opening to prevent the juice from spilling out. Compare that to the simple peeling of the foil tab on a Zico boxed drink and I'm slightly disappointed that it isn't as much fun. That and there's no pulp.The taste of Zico is quite good. Coconut juice will vary in taste depending on the age, freshness, and source. Sometimes sweeter, sometimes a bit denser depending on the natural sugar content. Zico tastes slightly less sweet than the fresh coconut juice I enjoyed this weekend. Otherwise, fill two small glasses with each and offer me a taste test... I may not be able to tell the difference. It really surprised me that a paper carton can give me the same satisfaction.I'd say that one Zico juice box is about the same amount of juice as from one young coconut - depends on the size of the coconut, of course. I am subscribing to this through Amazon.com with the subscription discount, so it costs roughly $1.70 per. That's more expensive than having a fresh, young coconut and there's no pulp to enjoy with it. However, I can now have it year-round.Hope this was helpful. Highly recommended. Enjoy.
4	1243209600	I bought a case of this stuff, have never had coconut water before. I drank half of one unit and I think I'm going to throw the rest of the case out.I didn't know what to expect it to taste like, I thought it would be a coconut-flavored sweet juice like taste, but after drinking it, let's just say that if I didn't know it was coconut water I'd swear it was months-spoiled milk mixed with filthy tap water. (Honest.)I'm sure that those who enjoy it enjoy it indeed, but I suspect they've acquired the taste for it.UPDATE: I've acquired the taste for it! It didn't take long, only a couple more and I got hooked. I'd change my rating (to 4) if I could. I'm buying more.
5	1240790400	The first time I heard of this brand was last week.  During a my first hot yoga class, I started getting light headed and the instructor gave me a Zico to help me feel better.  Incrediblly, within 5 minutes, I started feeling its affects.  The natural sugar in the coconut water revived me rather quickly. As for taste, it's the sweeest necter when you're overheated and dry mouth.  I'm now a huge fan (having a positive association to it may have some influence =)).  Indeed, it certainly tastes better when it's chilled.  It's advertised as nature's energy drink, and I agree that it's better for you than other energy drinks b/c it has less sugar overall.  However, I only like it when it accompanies my workout, not as a regular go to drink.Some have called it bland, but I find it subtle.  Its nuances are most appreciated when it's the first thing you drink in the morning.  As the day wears and you fill your mouth with other stronger, deeper flavors, then, yes, the coconut water would seem tasteless and boring.  I would recommend it if you like coconut water.
5	1238716800	I visit Brazil a lot for business and personal reasons. Before I found ZICO, I used to buy an extra suitcase, just to bring home as much of this coconut water as I could carry. I am soooo happy now that I can find it here in the USA by a very reputable company. I just bought a case last week and now I am ordering another one. Try it, if you have never had it. It tastes great and is good for you.
4	1238112000	I have tried several brands of coconut water and this is by far the best.  It is as close to fresh as you can get.  Excellent for after a workout or when you have a tummy ache.
5	1238112000	The product is excellent . Shipping is very fast and good packaging. Price is very reasonable. Thank you.
5	1237680000	I have tried several brands of cocnut water and Zico is one of the better ones. Coconut water is not very sweet and chilling improves the overall taste. I would not recommend the flavoured varieties of the coconut water, though some people like Vanilla coke :-).
5	1235865600	I tried all the coconut waters, and they're all pretty good, but this is better. It may be an aquired taste, but I love it. If you read the label you'll see immediately how great it is for you. Low calorie but high in electrolytes. Try it, refreshing and satisfying, tastes like a "sugar" drink, without the sugar.
5	1233532800	I love this coconut water! They sell it at my bikram yoga studio, and it does wonders for you after 90 minutes in 105 degrees. The mango flavored zico is my favorite- I've had all three flavor varieties. It is a very light tasting drink- perfect for recharging your body after workouts. I would reccommend this to all! So glad I found this product on Amazon- way more affordable than buying them for $3 a pop at the studio.
5	1231977600	I started drinking Zico after Bikram yoga class and I have never had anything pull me out of a post workout rut better than this coconut water.  High in potassium, it keeps cramps at bay, as well.  Make sure it's nice and cold to maximize the mild taste and refreshing qualities.  I will never drink regular sports drinks again.
3	1231286400	Doesn't taste like a just opened coconut. Better tasting than Vita Coco though. Vita Coco is almost gross. O.N.E is the best I've tasted so far. I will be re-ordering O.N.E but not this.
5	1225756800	I started using Zico coconut water last year as an alternative to"plain"water during our hot humid FLorida summers. It is more refreshing (and less caloric) than the  sports drinks used by many to replenish electrolytes. I've started using it in place of water when blending a protein shake following a workout.
5	1224115200	NOTE:Amazon charged me $23 for this thing with free shipping. This GlobalWorx Distribution company charges $17 + S&H; and came out to $22 and some change, and I got a free case with my 11 cases, so the price came down to$20 each for 11 cases :D. My guests liked the mixed coconut orange and mango passion fruit martini's.This is one of the most original taste of Coconut Water I have found. The fact that they added additional nutrients and vitamins and electrolytes in it makes it even better than Gatorade. With the natural sugar of Coconut Water it doesnt get much better tasting than this.I like the other flavored ones too. The mango and the orange passion is awesome. Just lightly tasting fruits.DO NOT DRINK THIS THING HOT. I kept it in the fridge overnight and had some the next day. WOW!!!!I bought the 11 case's and got 1 for FREE :D. Used them all in my party with cocktails. It was perfect with Grey Goose Vodka. Made a Coconut Martini, everyone loved it.

4	1223769600	This coconut juice is a little expensive but the flavor is excellent.  It is a wonderful replacement for sport drinks.  With the "subscription" price, the product is more affordable.
5	1223510400	I've tried many brands of coconut water such as O.N.E but Zico beats them all! This has nothing but coconut water. No added sugars at all. Best of all it is not watered down like the others. So refreshing too! I am now a loyal fan and will only drink Zico coconut water
5	1222819200	I have been ordering 2 cases of the natural ZICO since June 2008. It is delicious, refreshing, and healthy!! I don't drink soda or other man made drinks.  I'm writting this review mainly to let those who read it know that it is a natural product and you may get a bad lot.  This would explain the couple of bad reviews.  I just this last month (for the first time)got a bad lot, and it was really bad.  However, Amazon was helpful in giving a partial refund. Also, if you go to the ZICO website and send them an e-mail with the lot# they will replace the product if they have had other complaints.  Great product and great service from Amazon and ZICO!!!.... who could ask for more these days.
5	1222732800	I first tried it here in our bikram studio.  They are pricey in that place.  But Sprouts sell it for much cheaper.  I love it.  It does rehydrate the body quickly after a sweaty session of yoga.
2	1221004800	I've never tried coconut water before, but heard it had a lot of potassium.  I have a chronic disease that requires I supplement a lot of potassium so I thought I would try Zico.  YUCK!  I can't describe accuately what it tastes like, but it is not something I can drink plain.  There is a taste that hits your tongue the minute you drink, but does not linger after it hits your tongue.  The taste is not strong, so I just added it to iced tea, and cannot taste it at all in that.  That's why I gave it 2 stars, for the potassium, and I can still drink it, just can't drink it without adding it to something else.  I think adding it to juice would work fine, too.
4	1220572800	I like this coconut water because it is not too high in calories and is almost pure.  It is not very sweet and it is very refreshing.  I only buy it when I can get it about half off because I do not want to spend more than at the grocery store.
5	1220054400	I love Zico after a hard workout (or before if I haven't eaten).  It immediately re-energizes me, and best of all, it tastes great!
1	1219276800	Ok I agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste.  However if one chills the coconut water and adds FRESH I repeat FRESH lime juice to it the taste is fantastic.I consider this essential to natural hydration without chemicals, colors etc.Update:O.N.E. is definitely better tasting, we switched.
5	1218844800	This is my favorite of all the coconut waters available.  Love the mango flavor.  I drink after I do Bikram yoga and it's something I look forward to  having.
5	1218412800	Zico coconut water really tastes great! I feel like I am drinking directly from the green coconut sitting on the beach in Brazil!
5	1215993600	I was skeptical as to the taste of this product because of other products I've tasted where sugar was added. Also being from the Island of Jamaica where coconut water is something I drank practically everyday this product brought me back to those days in Jamaica. I love it!!!
5	1215388800	Excellent product and the taste is heavenly! I got the Mango flavored-- I WILL be ordering more.Product arrived timely and in great shape.  Description of product was excellent!  Will use seller again!A.L. Walton
5	1213315200	My daughter and I love this stuff.  It has a mild coconut taste.  I like to put lime in it and ice.  .  My son hates this.  I'm sure he is looking for more of a sweet fruity taste.  This is very subtle.  Coconut water is very healthy, and this is a very good one.  I have also tried the pineapple flavor.  Don't like that.  Tastes like juice.
4	1213142400	I love this product. But I happen to love tender coconut more. Anyway I think this is the best it can get for a packaged product.
4	1212624000	It and the others all the same ingredients, why pay more.. Vita Coco Coconut Water is cheaper... thats why I subscribe to theirs.. as well they have flavors as well as just coconut water.. great for mixes.. thats my 2 cents.. Most likely same mfg anyways.
4	1212192000	I was expecting this to taste like what you would get if you cracked open a coconut and stuck a straw in it. It definitely does not taste like that. However, Zico has grown on me, and it is really refreshing on a hot day.
5	1210291200	I do not necessarily love the taste of this product & I have never before had coconut water....I recently read the Body Ecology Diet book & wanted to try the coconut water kefir.  I bought young green coconuts, but they were all rotten (my lack of purchasing experience..) & decided it was just about as economical & far less hassle to buy the coconut water.  After reading lots of reviews, I chose Zico.I then kefired the coconut water using the probiotics from BE & using that method..(one pkt of kefir starter to approx 1 qt coconut water, in a wide mouth Ball jar w/lid, sitting in my cupboard 3-4 days, then refrigerated & used within 1 wk.).When I drink it, I drink approx 8 oz w/a packet of Sweetleaf stevia or 2 & a little pomegrante juice & although I am not in love w/the taste, I do find it gives me lots of energy all day & I actually crave it the morning.As a stay at home homeschooling mom, I love the energy boost & general good feeling I get from it.I will purchase it again & again, happily.to update-the 2nd time I kefired the coconut water, I used 1 pkt of kefir starter & 1 of Essential duo, both from Body Ecology & 2 qts (approx) of the water & let it ferment for slightly less time & it ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD by itself, cold from the refrigerator.  ( I am still fermenting it in my cupboard, then refrigerating as above..). The pleasing taste is a welcome change of events!!
5	1210204800	Once you get over the unique taste of coconut water, this is the best way to get your energy back after a workout.  No crash!
5	1209081600	I never heard of this beverage before a co-worker brought it into work and shared it with me. Now I have to keep my fridg stocked with coconut water. I am a waitress with some leg cramping at night. I do not get enough potassium in my diet. This seems to help in my discomfort.You must try it. It tastes great!
5	1207699200	I am 49 yrs. old and in very good shape. I drink 2-3 per day to stay hydrated and to help kill my hangover pain. I love the taste and find Zico very refreshing at anytime. Cheers!
5	1207180800	Needed something better than water to restore my energy after hot yoga -- this is it!  I've always thought sports drinks are nasty (flavor-wise and in terms of what they actually contain), and I never saw the point in wasting money on them when I could eat healthy foods and drink water.  So I was delighted to discover this natural alternative that replenishes lost hydration and nutrients quickly.After an hour and a half of yoga poses in a 105-degree room (yes, that sounds like a crazy idea but it does amazing things for the body), I used to feel tired for the rest of the day.  Now, after drinking my post-class Zico, I feel like my energy level is completely restored, if not even better than before class!  Highly recommend this stuff.
4	1206489600	A great drink to quench your thirst and to hydrate after a work out or on a hot day. What I like about this drink is that it is 100% natural and tastes great without any added sweetners or artificial flavors. It is a great water replacement especially for those who don't like water.It is nature's answer to Gatorade.
5	1205107200	I like  ZICO as a thirst quencher.  It feels healthy and refreshing. I do wish it was a bit cheaper though.
5	1204848000	I haven't had a fresh coconut in about 4 years. This tastes just like it though. So if you like coconut milk then go for it. Too bad it's slightly too expensive for someone like me to buy every week. Otherwise I would. It's that good. This stuff is as refreshing as water but has a flavor that I can't get enough of. It's also apparently healthy to drink. Now that's what I call icing on the cake.
4	1204675200	I have tried all 3 flavors from this company, and I like plain the best. Somehow the flavored-varieties have a bit of an aftertaste and remind me of those children's chewable vitamins I ate growing up. The passionfruit/orange says it has natural flavors, but mango doesn't say (I am assuming it has natural mango essence and not artificial stuff, but since it doesn't say, I'd suggest contacting the company before purchasing.) But the plain is really nice with nothing added.I bought 4 cases of this product (with 12 containers per case) during a recent Amazon sale of this product, and out of the 48 containers total, 2 were spoiled. (You can tell if it's spoiled if the container is fat and swollen.) I emailed the company, and they kindly had a few more containers shipped to me to make up for the couple bad ones. So the customer service was quite helpful to me.Obviously drinking the water of a fresh coconut tastes best, but this stuff is still pretty nice.For those who have never drunk coconut water... let me give you my experience. I agree with the customer who said that this may be an acquired taste. Some people seem to like it right away, while others like myself took awhile to get used to it. I remember the first time drinking coconut water from an actual coconut-- I took a sip and then spit it out. However, the second time I tried it I liked it more, and after that coconut water became my favorite drink. It is full of electrolytes and tastes a tad like a sports drink... mildly sweet, but with a tad of a salty taste too (as it has natural sodium)-- but no added salt or sugar. Hence, I love to have it when I exercise. At 60 calories per container (15g carbs) it is not enough to feel like I'm going overboard on the calories, but just enough to keep me going during a workout. Yes it is expensive, but better than a sports drink anyday-- as there's no chemicals, preservatives, etc.As far as this product being better than other plain coconut waters (e.g. Vita Coco, O.N.E), I really can't tell the difference. They all seem good. I am now trying another brand on Amazon (which is currently having a sale), but all the plain coconut water brands seem quite nice.
4	1204502400	There are many things to like about this coconut water. It's wonderfully refreshing and full of nutrients. And it's texture is almost like water, very pure and easy to drink. My only disappointment was that I felt like they'd purified most of the flavor out of it. I bought another brand that was also 100% coconut water and tasted more like coconut. I was planning to regularly add Zico to my morning pineapple smoothies for a pina colada flavor, but I add the whole carton and still don't taste much coconut. On a positive note, I got past that and I add it anyway for the nutrition. As a bonus, I'm able to drink Zico straight or on the rocks, which I wasn't expecting.
4	1204156800	Wish these were a little less expensive, because I love the stuff.  Buying by the case through Amazon is a lot better deal than buying them individually at the local market.  There always seems to be just a little bit of an off taste when drinking the last bit out.  I think it's caused by the packaging.  Compared to Vita Coco, I think they are comparable.  (I like the ZICO packaging better, though.)
5	1204070400	Zico is said to have lots of potassium and all the electrolytes of fitness drinks; and it doesn't have a strong sweet taste, nor aftertaste. It tastes very natural.
5	1203724800	This product is incredible - it's all natural and replenishes the body.  You will NOT be disappointed!
5	1202515200	This brand coconut water is the best I have tasted by far. The only one I have come across that does not have all the extras in it. Everyone that comes to visit now asks for it as an alternative to other drinks. Excellent product that I will continue to purchase.
5	1202428800	Drink this when you are hot and sweaty in the summer. It not only tastes fantastic, but makes you feel better. I drink it and then drink water afterwards to help the K soak in. THis is a high quality product and expensive, but in my view, worth every penny. Thank goodness for Amazon free shipping!!!!
1	1202342400	Save your money. Zico Pure Coconut Water is a nasty tasting drink. You don't have to forfeit flavor for nutrition. If you can stomach this stuff my hat is off to you. I would rather drink Gatorade, Vitamin Water, Propel and other sport/replenishing drinks that offer electrolytes AND a palatable flavor.This gross drink does not offer anything more then other healthful drinks.  It smells bad too.
5	1201910400	I just returned from Rio de Janiero 2 months ago and greatly miss walking downstairs to get fresh agua de coco! This is the next best thing. Nothing will top the real deal but this is a great alternative if you can't hop on a plane and head to Brazil. It's usually about $2.00 or so in stores so if you can catch it on sale as I did, it's worth it.
5	1201132800	I have tried at least three brands of coconut water and this one is my favorite.  I have noticed that the taste does tend to vary according to the brand so if you have tried coconut water and thought it was gross, you should try more than one brand to make sure that you really don't like the flavor before giving up.  Zico (natural flavor) has a very mild, slightly coconut flavor, but it isn't sweet.  I also agree with some other reviews that it definitely tastes best cold.  Some people say that coconut water is so pure that it has been used intravenously in other countries for hydration.  I like to believe that I am doing my body a favor by drinking this pure, fat free, no sugar added product.
5	1200873600	I recently grew to love young coconut water straight from the nut--hammer a hole, and stick in a straw. I couldn't find Zico anywhere locally to try before buying, but I was a sucker for the discount going on when I ordered, so I bought two cases of the natural flavor. After ordering but before getting my order I found a single container of the vita coco brand water at Whole Foods. It is almost as well reviewed as this, so I thought it might be a good gauge/preview. It was terrible to my taste, and made me almost regret the Zico order.Today the Zico arrived, and I'm pleased that it's much more like the water that comes straight from a green coconut than vita coco or any canned version I've ever tried (and hated). It did have a slightly strange somewhat unpleasant smell (others said "garbagey" in their reviews--maybe like compost a bit?), but the flavor is pretty much right on. I can see how it would take some getting used to and isn't for everyone, but it's definitely the best I've found. I ordered January 17th, and my batch expires June 6th. I can't wait to have one post-workout.
5	1199836800	I tried this after my yoga class which takes place in a heated room, so I end up drinking a lot after it! The drink is very refreshing and instantly hydrating. I tried the mango and the passionfruit flavors, and to my taste mango wins because it's more pronounced. I'm actually not a huge fan of straight up coconut water, so maybe that's why i like the mango better than passionfruit. The pack is small size, fits great into a small bag and is good for lunch at work. At the gym it's $2/pack of this water, so the amazon deal is terrific. I haven't seen this at my grocery store. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that you should probably taste this drink before you buy it. It's not a generic taste.
4	1199318400	This is a great product.  Although I'd initially planned to buy a single box to sample the product, I realized after reading previous reviews that coconut water was probably an acquired taste, so I bought a 12-pack just to see if I'd end up liking it.  At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.  I wish it were a little cheaper (thus only 4 stars) but otherwise I like the product just the way it is and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightly flavored alternative to sodas.
5	1196640000	While I agree that if you've never tasted Coconut water before it can be a bit off putting. Having said that - I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I try to get coconut water from coconuts, but living in the Midwest, it's hard to get fresh coconuts. Sometimes the water in them is wonderful and sometimes the coconuts are just old. This product tasted so fresh it was startling. Wonderful replacement for soft drinks or artificially flavored diet drinks - and good for you. Did you know that coconut water was used (successfully)as emergency IV fluid in WWII?
5	1195430400	hate the shipping. I'm signed up for monthly and it keeps getting pushed back. Me thinks Amazon is trying to sell too much stuff.
4	1194912000	Zico coconut water is awesome - it's real refreshing, and tastes perfect everytime. Growing up in a tropical country, I've had ready access to natural coconut water, and as anybody who's had fresh coconut water can attest to, it doesn't taste perfect everytime. You could end up with a bad or not-so-ripe coconut and that ruins the taste of the water. That's one of the things I love about Zico - it tastes PERFECT...EVERYTIME.I'm not an athlete, and wouldn't know how hydrating this is, but I love the taste and love that it's a healthful substitute for soda, and drink a few 11-ounce units everyday.I would have given this product 5 stars if not for the insane price. At a pack of 12 a week, my bank account is depleting quicker with Zico coconut water purchases than with anything else.Amazon shipping is perfect as always, and I'm as happy with the service from Amazon as I am with the quality of the product.
5	1194912000	Love this yummy product!  i 1st started drinking it to help heal gastritis.  Now drink it just cause i love it and a great way to stay away from sugary processed drinks.  Highly recommend it!
5	1193270400	Just ordered this and the plain coconut milk, I really like the Mango Ziconot over sweet but just right and refreshing. As a diabetic have to be careful with my diet and read this is a very healthy for blood sugar control and has the many benefit's of coconut. A little pricey and small serving 11 oz.but is imported from Brazil so i can understand the cost. Hope Amazon put's this on sell will buy again....!
4	1193097600	Zico water has as much potassium as a banana, no added sugar, and I haven't found a better sports drink that replenishes or quenches thirst. it's light, refreshing, not too sweet or sugary - i can't imagine drinking anything else during a tennis match.
5	1191974400	This is the real deal.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for.
5	1191369600	My necessity after a Karate workout!Better than a sports drink for electrolytes..much less sugar..My favorite flavors........MANGO!in PURE COCONUT WATER.All natural, lightly flavored with pure fruit juice.Takes me back to Hawaii...mmmm.
5	1190764800	This product was recommended to me by my personal trainer. After I started drinking coconut water, I can't get enough. Now that it's shipped to me every month and free shipping. I am in love with it.Great product to keep you hydrated.
5	1190160000	I've been using coconut water as a sports drink for a while now, and just recently switched from Vita Coco to Zico. After one taste, I'm sticking with Zico!Tastes best chilled, but good any way you drink it!
4	1189382400	It came close to the real one from the tree, my friends like the taste. I will buy more
5	1188518400	My husband runs and we'd read that coconut water is a much better replenishment drink than all the artificial sports drinks, so we began our search for a good brand.  He is Latin American and I'm West Indian, so we're quite familiar with how this is supposed to taste.  The canned drinks were awful - they picked up the taste of the can and many companies chose to add in coconut pieces which didn't do anything pleasant in terms of taste.  This is by far the best brand we've tasted.  It is expensive but so is Gatorade and similar drinks, so if you work out and use those, this is much better.  It is higher in potassium by far, very important for post-workouts.  It is also great for hangovers (hah!) and for women who've recently given birth.  Essentially it does a great job of helping the body to recover and replenish essential electrolytes, so whether you go with this brand or another, coconut water is a great drink.  To us, this is the best tasting and most authentic tasting brand out there. We do wish it was cheaper, but unfortunately we live in a society where it's easier to eat crap and get obese and unhealthy than it is to eat well and stay fit.  (We have NOT tasted vitacoco yet...hoping to try soon.  Will review again if our opinion differs after tasting!)
5	1188172800	It took me a few months to really get used to the flavor of natural coconut water. On a recent visit to Brazil I tasted a different, local brand, and Zico just beats that by a wide margin. Now that I am accustomed to it (had never drank coconut water before), I love it and drink it whenever I am really dehydrated or just need a bit of the sweet taste. It's light and easy to drink, a great alternative to vitamin and distilled water.
5	1188000000	My husband is from the Caribbean and grew up on fresh young coconut water. This is the best packaged version that we have tried. There are no chunks of coconut or that preservative taste that often comes with these drinks. We buy several cases every month. It is a very healthy alternative to sugary sodas and sports drinks.It tastes best when ice cold.
5	1187740800	Both me and my husband loved this stuff.  Tastes like coconut milk but lighter.  Very refreshing.
3	1186531200	Sure it tastes like coconut water... that's been sitting uncovered in the fridge for a week.  For 85c less (for a subscription), you a far superior product with vitacoco.
5	1184716800	This coconut water from Zico is of the highest quality.  The coconut water is free of any artificial ingredients.  This coconut water is just what it claims to be, 100% coconut water.  When chilled, it is so refreshing.  It is high in Pottasium.  I bought two cases of Zico coconut water on my first order and later wished I had bought more.  When I opened each container of the Zico coconut water, I found no floating chunks, no residue at the bottom of the container, just pure coconut water, unlike the other brands that have only a small amount of real coconut water in their products.  I used to go to the store and buy three or four coconuts at a time, and put up with stares and comments from the cashiers.  Each one of these Zico coconut water containers has more inside than any coconut I ever bought, and I don't have to poke holes into them to get the coconut water out.  I highly recommend this product.
5	1183766400	Tastes really natural, refreshing, cooling.  Took a bit of getting used to because there's no sugar in it, but then it was great.  It's too expensive for me to make a habit of drinking it, but if not for that, I'd drink it all the time.
5	1183766400	This is as close to climbing the tree and picking my own coconut fresh. It is healthy, delicious and refreshing especially cold!Subscription is great idea. Takes all the repetition out of the way
1	1183248000	Some people love coconut water.  After choking down one of these, I knew I was not one of them.  I would describe the flavor as sweet sweat.  Of course, I have never drank a cup of sweat with sugar but imagine the taste would not be too far off from this product.  Kind of salty, kind of sweet yet totally gross.So, so glad I tried a single first!  Gag-o-rama.
5	1182816000	I've tried many but this is a great tasting coconut water with just a hint of mango.  Refreshing!
5	1182816000	Believe it or not this is just as good, or maybe even better then gatorade.
5	1181433600	Natural coconut water is delicious and chemical free.  Much better for you than gatorade.  Keep on hand for times of fever or other dehydration needs.
5	1180051200	Unlike most coconut drinks this stuff is clean, light and very refreshing.  One look at the ingredients list will tell you why.  It says: "Coconut Water" and nothing else.
5	1179100800	I grew up in a tropical country so I know what a coconut drink should taste. This drink is a real deal, but I find it a little too pricey.
5	1178928000	If You like mango you'll love this. It has just enough of a mango taste to give it a good flavor. If you like it could be used as is or as a mix for a great summer drink.
4	1178928000	I only wish that the packs were full 12 ozs. so that I dont have to open 2 to get the 12 ozs. I am supposed to drink.  Pretty good substitute for the real coconut.
5	1175731200	THIS ZICO COCONUT WATER IS THE MOST REFRESHING DRINKS I HAVE EVER TASTED , IT HAS TO BE ICE COLD TO GET THE FULL EFFECTS OF THIS AWESOME DRINK , BETTER THAN A CIGARETTE AFTER SEX, THIS DRINK PROVIDES A HEALTHY TOUCH TO YOUR SYSTEM. FOR ALL YOU COCONUT LOVERS OUT THERE THIS STUFF IS IT!!!!!
5	1174176000	Oh man, I love it. After any physical activity, the first thing I think about and drink is ZICO. It is so refreshing and rejuvenating. I would recommend this to anybody who is in sports or just add little good vodka to sip and relax.
5	1174176000	i love young coconut water (and flesh), and wish i could get it straight from the coconut, but unfortunately that is not possible. i think the flavor of zico is very similar to the fresh flavor-- i can't get enough of this drink and have quite a few a day. i really enjoy it and do not think it is an acquired taste at all.
5	1169078400	I love this drink. It tastes natural and not tinny like the ones packed in cans.  My favorite is the natural but I do like the flavors and try to keep all of the flavors on hand for myself and guests. One more reason is that I have tried to stay away from sodas and this is very low in calories.
5	1168646400	I ordered one case of 12 and we used it up right away.  Amazon was out of the item when I wanted to reorder and I had to wait a few days for re-stocking.  Then, I ordered two more cases. Very good taste.  Small packaging fits very nicely in refrigerator.
4	1168646400	Loving coconut more than almost anything else, I've been searching for a good bottled coconut water for many years, and found many products that didn't taste anything like coconut water at all.  Zico comes pretty close, with none of the off-flavors I've come to expect from asian-origin products.I take off one star however because occasionally one is greeted by a slightly off-odour from the box, something slightly garbagey... It's very very mild and doesn't throw off the flavor or the experience, but is a little bit unsettling.  I don't think it is due to actual decay; the skin of a husked coconut has the same sort of scent.I've also tried the Mango flavour, and enjoyed that quite a bit too, and would only complain that it masks the subtle notes of the coconut.
5	1168646400	Everyone in my family loves this drink! We use it in smoothies and health drinks. We use it as it is and we use it as a base in other blendered drinks. We think it is fantastic any way we've used it. Its flavor is very subtle and nice - not sweet, not salty, unique to itself and not at all overpowering when used with other flavors. We have only used it in "natural flavor" and really like it a lot. If the health claims for it are at all true, then it is a wonderful product. We like to use it with a little fruit juice, too, with kids so you get the health benefits but not so much of the sugar from fruit juice. It's delicious on its own but with juice or whey powder or yogurt and fruit - whatever you like - added. To those few reviewers who made such negative statements: what in the world were YOU drinking? Not this, that's for sure! It's great stuff....we're glad Zico makes this available.
2	1168387200	I appreciate the electrolytes that this provides when I am exercising.  Beyond the functional value of being liquid and providing nutrients, this drink has no redeeming characteristics that I could find.
3	1168128000	But some of them were awesome - refreshing, clean flavored, and delightfully thirst quenching in a neat, new way.  Others tasted faintly like rotting garbage - which rather ruined the experience pretty much, uh, totally...  I drank most of these anyway, and eventually went through the whole 12-pack and survived.  Could be just me, but due to the times I didn't like 'em, I doubt I'll ever be buying them again.
5	1167955200	I found this product to be high on convenience and taste. My entire family enjoys this super-hydrating drink. Zico is natural and has no extra added sugar. Great drink for people following an alkaline diet.
5	1167436800	First, do not buy this expecting the milky flavour associated with Coconut Milk. This is coconut water from young/green coconuts and is a completely different taste. Try to get one from a health food store before buying an entire case.If you are not a fan of coconut milk, try it anyhow since the taste is not the same.This is a great way to replenish your body with electrolytes after being ill or just on a daily basis. It is delcious and refreshing.Do keep in mind that if it generally does not have an odour. If your coconot water smells like something it may well be spoiled -- do not drink it in this situation. I learned this the hard way after getting a spoiled case from a local store. I thought the container merely smelled funny- perhaps from something that had been in the fridge.But aside from that, this is an all natural and tasty way to get nutrients many people are missing.Best served cold!
5	1167264000	I must be some kind of freak because I wouldn't think that this is an acquired taste at all.  It is so clean and refreshing, just the most simple taste ever!  I do prefer it ice-cold, but right off the shelf isn't insufferable.  When I was young, my siblings and I would fight to get to drink right out of the coconuts mom would bring home from the store.  Pushing the straw into this box is MUCH easier than hammering a nail into the coconut's eye!
5	1165190400	During my extensive travels in Mexico and Central America, many times I have had the opportunity to drink coconut water straight from nuts fresh off the tree (with the end chopped off using a machete and straw inserted). While clearly not as fresh as straight from a nut, when I first drank the Zico product I was pleasantly surprised how genuine the taste was. Since I can't always be in a tropical location where the nuts are right from the tree, this is the best alternative I have found. Yes, coconut water is a bit of an acquired taste, but this has become my beverage of choice when needing fluid replacement, or just a downright fine drink. Much better than many so-called 'sports drinks'.
3	1163980800	Rcv'd on 20/Nov/06 product w expiry date of 23/Jan/07. Two months is a shorter shelf life than I'd have liked. Is this the nature of the product? Or does AMZN have a slightly older stock than what would be available in retail channels like Costco? I'd appreciate if someone might please inform on the subject. ?.....PS. Cannot really max the stars mainly because the price is to me rather high for a beverage product, albeit an exotic. And anyway too, have not acquired yet a taste for this product. Just as y'all warned. It def ain't a love-at-first-sip.
4	1163808000	I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though.
5	1162771200	If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either.
5	1162512000	I first reviewed Zico (this product, this page) in Nov of 2006, as one of its earliest reviewers. I gave it four stars back then. In my mind, I was comparing it to fresh coconut water (which is available here in Miami and I drink when I can).I deleted that old review and am rereviewing it as a 5-star product. After trying  half dozen different coconut waters in cans and cartons, I keep coming back to Zico. In fact, I subscribed to it and get a case monthly (and sometimes, I order two cases).This is really the best of the lot offered on Amazon (and I have ordered O.N.E and Vita Coco when they came on sale here). I even had a taste test at one--drinking sips from all three, one by one. Zico beats the other two, easy.Here is the original review from 2006:~~The reviewers who say this is an acquired taste are correct. Most folks don't grow up drinking lovely coconut water, chilled, right out of the coconut shell. And that's a pity, because on a hot day, that does the trick better than soda or any other juice.Zico, while not being exactly like the real and unprocessed thing, is quite close. It's refreshing chilled, and it doesn't have the ton of sugar some brands add. (If you like it sweet, add your own Splenda and get sweetness without the extra calories most Americans like me don't need.) But honestly, it's good to go as is.I find it goes nicely with Thai foods, natural eats, and by itself after some sweaty work. Lovely. And good for the blood pressure.Now, can amazon get some more in stock please. I really need a couple more cases! ~~This is now a staple in my house, so I think it well-earned it's 5 Star RE-review. In fact, it's one of my pre-workout drinks, because the high Potassium content keeps cramps at bay when I'm really having a tough Pilates session with my trainer.Thanks, Zico. This is a top-notch product (and I just had a carton, too!) Please don't go out of business! I need my daily Zico fix!BTW, I don't much like the flavored varieties. In this case, original IS better.Enjoy...Mir
5	1159833600	As a breastfeeding mother, I find myself constantly feeling dehydrated.  I absolutely love this product!  It was refreshing and tasty without being cloyingly sweet.  I wish it came in larger containers, though.  Nothing I have found locally can compare.  Every other coconut drink has tons of sugar and not much flavor beyond sweet.  Buy Zico now!!
5	1159747200	Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut.  If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12.  Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised.  I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby.  It's very healthy and low in sugar.  Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices.
5	1158105600	I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.
5	1156636800	I used to confuse "coconut water" with "coconut milk," which is a creamy, sugary delight. But it's NOT coconut water, as I learned when we lived in Hawai'i and had coconuts drop out of our palm trees at the most unexpected times. My first taste of coconut WATER was three years ago when we were still on the island... it was so refreshing, so light and yet somehow much less milky than I remembered. That's when a friend pointed out the difference: coconut milk is straight from the coconut. The water is, to put it nicely, a product of chemical wizardry.If you're looking for fresh, clear and light coconut taste -- with one of natures most reliable sources of potassium -- this is the way to go. But don't expect that creamy, milky, super-thick substance you'd ordinarily find in a pina colada. THIS is pure coconut essence, and it's perfect for those who understand there's difference between being quenched by water and being drowned in chemical sugars.
5	1156464000	The very best tasting coconut water that I have ever tasted. Refreshing and an excellent hydrator. Good warm or cold.
5	1155945600	I use coconut water instead of water to make rice for a slightly sweet, nutty flavored rice.  It's also nice in mixed drinks and just as a carry along drink when I go to work.
4	1155081600	When I visted Thailand, a woman offered me a coconut. I nodded and she whacked it open with a machete with all the precision of a samuari, stuck a straw in it and handed it to me. It was decidedly different and unlike any other coconut product I had before. I enjoyed several of these while I was there, and some European tourists asked how was it as we floated by in the canal at the Rose Market. I gave them the thumbs up, but for people used to the ultra sweet and syrupy soda pop drinks and juice sweetened with high frutose corn syrup, they'll likely find the taste vile. It's very light and refreshing and if your taste buds aren't conditioned by overly sweet drinks, you'll probably enjoy this.I gave it 4 stars because the contents say the coconuts are from Brazil and I found the ones I had in Thailand a bit more tasty.
5	1154390400	this is the best coco water i have ever tasted. it was delivered quickly.
5	1154304000	If you're ever in the islands and have an opportunity to cut the top off of a fresh coconut and stick in a straw, it will taste exactly like this product.  It's great!  To me, it's a very subtle taste, but enjoyable -- like a little vacation in a box.
5	1154304000	I love everything  about coconuts, so I love this product.  I drink it after working out, and gives me the energy to keep my day going. It taste exactly like green coconut water, so if you never tasted young coconut water, I suggest you do before you buy a case.  Is an acquired taste, and people tend to think it should be sweeter than this.  I truly loved this drink!
5	1153526400	My doctor recommended that I up my potassium intake a number of years ago.  I first tried Zico when I was in Costco and there were representatives of the company giving out samples and selling it. Zico water is tasty, refreshing and most of all contains more potassium than a medium sized banana!  I've tried all the flavors, but prefer the original / plain the best!  I just wish the price would come down.  $1.75 per container when purchased in quantity (3 cases) is VERY high compared to other beverages on the market.
1	1153267200	I would have to absolutely agree with the reviewer that said to try this before you buy a case of it. It really is an awful taste, it tastes like something that has sat in the sun for way too long. Perhaps, I was under the misguided impression that coconut water would taste remotely similar to coconuts, but this is sadly not the case.
5	1152489600	Wonderful for rehydration, especially on hot days!  Not too sweet with a delicious, light taste.
5	1152057600	I drink this product after hot Yoga and immediately feel balancedagain.
5	1151971200	I read about this product in a travel magazine, and being a sucker for new products, I tried it.  Its very delicate flavor is refreshing and great for someone looking for a different drink experience.
3	1150588800	I would strongly recommend tasting one of these before order a 12-pack, as this is a very acquired taste. I bought one pack at the local health food store as a trial, and it was one of the most horrible tastes I can remember in recent memory. So just don't go blindly ordering this or you may be sorry.
5	1150416000	This is the best way to get coconut water unless you have direct access to fresh, green coconuts.  Tastes great.  I prefer to use a straw to drink from the box.  There's no jelly included, only the liquid coconut water.  They are not cheap, but I buy from Amazon since our grocery stores don't sell coconut water.  Some people don't like the taste of coconut water, but this brand is great if you do.
