5	1405036800	this suit works great!Get ready to sweat!
5	1404864000	I only return it because the size chart was off going from a 6x to 4x
5	1404604800	This suit is really great !! I use for the spinning / RPM classes. After the class, you continue sweating for about 40 min. TIP: Before use the suit for the first time: wash it, so the neoprene smell will reduce a little.
5	1404604800	Well this suit definitely makes you sweat!! I've only used it once and lost 5lbs of water weight. Of course you gain it back when you drink water. I also find it makes your workout a little harder.
5	1404604800	Great product
2	1404518400	Has a very strong rubber smell and the fit is awful.  Tight on the thighs but big throughout the waist and the legs are really not as long as the picture shows.It does make you sweat when you work out, but I would only recommend using this in the privacy of your own home, otherwise it makes you look funny and you really can't wear it under regular workout clothing to conceal it.
5	1404432000	i like it
4	1404345600	I bought a small and the fit was perfect (5'1 140 lbs that's me). I liked the suit better than the belts I've used in the pass. More comfort and I didn't have to worry about it staying in place. During workout my body heat helped to keep my muscles relaxed. Only problem was getting out of it afterwards due to sweat build up.
4	1404345600	Overall good fit. Had a bit of a challenge with the seams at the shoulder (underside of the fabric). It looks like the hard end of the fabric and sometimes chafes the shoulder. But overall, this suit feels great once you get moving and makes you SWEAT. A bit of a challenge to take off (you may need help slipping it off the shoulders). Very easy to clean (I hang it in the shower and use soap and the handheld showerhead to wash it then allow it to air dry); other times I opt for using the water hose. Be prepared, with this suit you will find yourself drenched with sweat! Happy sweating!
5	1404345600	its good but it was kinda big from the top and it a little uncomfotable but I do sweat a whole lot I should have boufgt a med but i ordered a lg i was going based on what the size chart said but in all it does make you sweat
2	1404345600	The quality of the Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit is good, but all these claims are very deceiving and using this suit is actually more risky than beneficial:"You can expect to sweat a lot, increase your metabolism, burn more calories, increase your mental and physical toughness, detoxify your immune system, and increase flexibility therefore decreasing the likelihood of injury."How did I found this out? Well, I kept hearing my exercise instructors at different locations telling me the same thing, in summary: that I need to go home asap, and drink lots of water, and that using this suit is not a good idea when exercising etc.. After not seeing fat loss after months of using the suit and exercising extensively, I decided to do further research on the subject and ultimately stopped using the suit.**By the way, if you intend to leave comments do so, but don't waste time trying to prove the opposite if you don't have real proofs with research. I'm sure you won't be able to find proofs as there is plenty of research about the risks of sauna suits and the conclusion is the same. I already saw all the negative marks (left by either seller or others who get benefits for selling these suits) and are trying to make the real low star reviews rank low in amazon, so that people continue being deceived about all these sauna suits. ** As other reviewers mentioned, do not waste money on "magic" products for weight loss which do not exist: "Quit the excuses and work hard in the gym. There are no shortcuts to losing weight. Eat healthy, do lots of exercise.So please, I am begging you. Do not waste your money on this. Losing weight is hard work, for most people. Accept that fact and get going instead of looking online for magic products which don't exist. Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. Get your priorities straight."Does a Sweat Suit Burn Fat? Can a sweat suit help you to achieve this? Quick answer: NO!When trying to burn fat and lose weight, many people decide to wear a sweat suit when exercising, or at other times, to try to increase their fat-burning. While many people feel like wearing a sweat suit is helping them burn fat faster, it may not actually help at all.Sweat Suits:Sweat suits, sometimes called sauna suits, are usually made from rubber or plastic and are designed to keep in heat. When wearing one your body temperature increases, which causes you to sweat and, theoretically, lose more weight. As sweat suits can be quite expensive, often costing up to $100, as of February 2011, many people opt to make their own by using garbage bags, which can create the same effect.Fat Loss ClaimsSweat suits are synonymous with athletes who have to drop a significant amount of weight in a short span of time. It is common for boxers, martial artists and weightlifters to wear sweat suits right before a weigh in or even during pre-contest training to lose a few extra pounds. Companies use this trend as a way to promote their suits as fat-burning aids.Do They Work?When wearing a sweat suit, you may well lose a lot of weight in a very short space of time, but this weight loss is simply water weight lost through sweat. This is not fat loss. Any weight loss results from wearing a sweat suit are temporary, and the weight will return once you are rehydrated.Fat LossThe only way to shed pounds permanently is to eat a sensible calorie-restricted diet and partake in an intensive exercise regimen. Fat loss can take time and should be seen as a long-term goal, not as a task that is suited for quick fixes. Aim to lose 1 to 2 lbs. per week from dieting and exercising.Potential DangersWhile sweat suits may have some benefit for dropping weight before a sporting contest, there are many risks involved. Sweating profusely and losing water will cause your body to become dehydrated and overheated and will lead to a mineral and electrolyte imbalance within the blood. In the past, sportsmen have even died from excessive dehydration before competitions. If you must use a sweat suit, only wear it for as long as you have to and be sure to rehydrate at the earliest opportunity.
5	1404259200	I've been using this for over 2wks and very satisfied . Fits perfectly and I sweat a lot during my work out. I trim down almost 9 lbs in two wks time.
5	1404259200	this product works like its advertised as soon as i put on the suit i immediately feel like its feeling warmer used it on p90x3 work out routine and i was surprised to say that it did work .........immediate sweeting
5	1404259200	I bought this  sauna suit about 2 weeks ago and i lOve it &#9829; I use it to go to walk at the park for two hours and then I use it for my Zumba class in the afternoons for a hour already lost 11 pounds in 2 weeks this is fantastic I really recommend this product  sauna suit just drink a lots a lots of water :)
5	1404172800	Really great item. Love the fact that the suit has vented places for armpits and crotch areas. Both my husband and I use this suit. He is an avid bike rider and I love yoga. It protects and helps you loose those extra few inches and pounds we carry from water weight
5	1404172800	Very well made sauna suit. Definitely will have you sweating.
5	1404086400	I love it. Lost 23 pounds in less than a month. Eating right & insanity did the trick for me & let's also include lots of water with lemon in it &#128076;
5	1404000000	I tried this product based on the reviews and it's awesome. So far I have noticed a difference in my workouts. You really sweat so much more with this on. Which makes you sweat out all the toxins and you feel do much better after a workout. I love it!!!!
4	1403827200	The suit is great but it's a little to big..I under estimated my size..I'm 5'7 170lbs and ordered a large when I should have got a Medium.
4	1403827200	I love this suit. It holds the moisture in and is well ventilated under the arms and between the legs. I've had this for about 2 years and use it every time I go to the gym. It's easy to wash and quick to dry. Also, it hasn't stretched out of shape during the 2 years I've had it.
1	1403740800	I'm a XS-S regular size, and the XS was too tight. I really gave up after like 5 seconds, the fabric felt so horrible and tight and i knew i was in for a bad time if i actually got it on.
5	1403568000	Excellent product. Stays fit and and sweat a lot. I have used many types of neoprene products for fat burning, but this one exceeded my expectations. Love it!!!
4	1403481600	I just ordered the kutting weight sauna suit.  I've used it a few times already. I'm a former professional athlete that has put on quite a bit of weight. I've recently taken up Muy Thai and Jiu jitsu and I was looking to add something extra to my workouts to make it more challenging this certainly does the trick. While I can't comment on its durability because I've only had it for a few weeks it seems to be holding together just fine. To give you a size comparison I'm 5'11 and 280 lbs and I ordered the 4x and it fits with a little room to spare. Its kind of difficult to get off.If you're truly working out the way you're suppose to then you're body will naturally sweat on its own.  The suit is just another tool to help you with your endeavor to lose weight but it's mainly water weight. Enjoy the sauna suit but be careful and re-hydrate after using. All in all I like the suit because it forces me to gut through my workouts.
4	1403481600	Great product. I can feel myself working harder when I wear it. Just make sure to drink plenty of water. As far as sizing, I did what everyone else suggested and ordered a size up. I'm 5'7 approximately 185pds and ordered a size XL. The arms and back area are a little big and there's a little room in the crotch area ( great for men but not so much for women) but overall it's a good fit. I wear clothes over my suit but to each it's own. I think it is we worth the money, but it's too soon to see results weight wise. I figured you are only losing water weight with the suit, but it helps me with my breathing while doing cardio.
5	1403308800	Not much to say that the 1000+ reviews haven't covered.  Hopefully, my stats might help someone with sizing.  I'm 6'2 and an athletic 235 and the 3XL fits perfectly.
4	1403222400	This is my second kutting weight sauna suit, and it works to make you sweat. I'm presently in Afghanistan, and I wore it throughout the day only to find myself soaking. It's high quality, and I recommend it for anyone trying to lose weight.
5	1403222400	Great product. Love it. Size's are matched right on chart, durable, flexible, works great and feels amazing. I'm so happy.
4	1403136000	it'll make you sweat. simple. although there is something to be said about the inner joins and stitches. those could use a little fine tuning. i need to wear a compression vest under it to keep the stitch-ends from bothering me.
5	1403136000	this product definitely deserves a five stars ! ! ! I can't say enough about it,  it's worth the money coming from someone who actually bought it has used it and should  keeps using it..lol bought the cheap material kind in the past only  lasted a week or so not worth a $15 $20 bucks going down the drain do an investment for long term ..before I purchased it I was asking myself ..i wonder if it works ?what about if I waste my money? what if this are fake reviews?
5	1403136000	Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit (XL) Will recommend to all people that want to lose weight, I  drain about 4-7 lb, every workout. I do grappling and jiu jitsu. it has not ripped anywhere yet. Will buy again!
4	1403049600	I just received item last week, it arrived in 3 days. I wore it the 1st time while doing my housework and I started sweating immediately. After my housework, I wore it inside my indoor infrared sauna for 20 minutes, I was drenched.The 2nd I wore it to the gym and did a light-moderate workout I rode the recumbent bike for 45 minutes at level 8 and did the elliptical for 25 minutes.....I was soaked. I had excellent range of motion and was surprised at the quality and durability of product. It is very well made. I did have a problem getting out it, hopefully in time this will get easier.I am busty and full figured with large thighs so, I went up a size to make sure it would fit. However, If you measure yourself it runs true to sizing chart. Product was a little pricey but you will get years of service out of it.
5	1403049600	I'm 5'10&#34; and about 205 lbs.  I ordered the XL and the fit is perfect.  I mostly wear the suit over my cycling shorts with a cycling jersey over top.  The thigh area looks essentially the same as cycling shorts and the jersey covers the compression type top.  It fits and feels good and I don't think it is obvious or strange looking while out for a ride.  It helps me keep warm on colder mornings and also leaves me dripping wet following a ride.  If you want to shed several pounds in the space of a couple of hours this suit will do it.  As an example, I weighed myself one morning before going on a 25 mile ride and following the ride I had shed about five pounds.  I can also see this suit being really useful when ski and snowboard season rolls around.  I love this suit.
5	1403049600	Having this sauna suit is a plus, just what I was looking for just a little tight in legs. Other than that I've give it 5 star!!
5	1402963200	It let's me turn daily activities  into exercises. The only,  very small,  issue I personally have with it is that I have to remove it almost completely to go to the bathroom, but that is my issue and the suit is not at fault.
5	1402876800	Really warms the body up , gives support and makes you sweat, seems of good quality. Time will tell , but I will buy another when it wears out !!!!!!!
5	1402876800	I love this suit. Lost 7 pounds in 5 days using it to exercise for 30 mins each day. It makes you sweat like crazy.
5	1402790400	Used it for a NPC bikini competition. Awesome product. Dropped much needed weight before show.  Will use this product even when not in competiton
5	1402617600	This suit was way more than I expected.  10 minutes into the first time I worked out, I was starting to feel totally sweaty.  By the time that I was done with my workout, I was totally drenched, and that was after only 30 minutes! Wow! Awesome idea!
5	1402531200	Can't wait to run ALL SUMMER in my SS (sauna suit). Been doing this for more than 14 years. I'm addicted in a healthy way.
5	1402531200	I know this is important so here it is :Ordered 5XLChest: 50 : fits firm a little loose with extra MaterialWaist about 43in : Extremely loose might have lost weight since coming overseasLegs : lose fitting , and I have tree trunk legs , I should measure will do so if someone needsArms: Very important , My arms are abnormally huge and if I had gotten a smaller size they wouldn't have fit or cut off circulation so keep this in mind , if you have to wear larger shirts to fit arms and chest that order up, sleeves are for smaller individuals.Although the suit fits loose it was a good fit because of my upper body , I just wear a set of workout clothes over everything so it keeps the extra material in tight against my body.
5	1402358400	Thanks, Great Product, i love this product, it made me sweat a lot.  It does the job. Makes you take the excess water from your body.
4	1402358400	Considering the quality and the price, I think that is a great option to loos weight, is really good in all sense
5	1402358400	I love this sauna suit!!!! I wear it when I run and I also wear it when I'm weight training.
4	1402185600	yes I  think  the material was excellent and you can use it anywhere you can use to lose Some Wight as well.
4	1402099200	I expected this to fit on me (woman) like it would on a man for the size.  Usually mens sizes fit me well, but this one ran a bit small.
5	1402012800	Great product. Will make you sweat a lot. Very happy that I ordered this suit. You will not be disappointed
5	1401926400	I love my suit! I've been losing weight and working out for 6 months now. Of course we all know about those darned plateaus. This is the miracle I needed to push past my stagnant progress.  In combination worth sweet sweat you can't beat it. I also want to comment on the excellent customer service of Kutting Weight. Jaimee went above and beyond to get me the correct fit. When Amazon failed Jaimee came to my rescue. I have already told everyone I know about the product and how great it works and will continue to sell it on my end! Thank you Kutting Weight And Jaimee!
5	1401926400	The Best Ever water weight suana suit I've ever used.  I've been using these type of suits since 1997  and this is by far the MOST comfortable one I've ever used and works as good as any I've ever used .
5	1401840000	AThe suit is very strong, and it simply works!! No rips or tears when wkg out! Had it 6wks the longest I've kept a sauna suit! Plus I lost 2 inches in my wasteline. My search for a solid productive suit ends here!
4	1401667200	This product is well made and high quality, although it is slightly more than I would have liked to pay for a neoprene suit. Great customer service!
4	1401667200	Works great. Lost 6 LBS in 1 week....highly recommended to anyone who wants to Kutt weight quickly in a few days.
5	1401667200	This is my second suit, and it was bought just because the first suit is a couple of years old.  The old suit is a back up now.This really kick starts a work out.
5	1401580800	This suit is perfect. I use this when bike riding, running, even working around the house. One piece suit is the way to go!
5	1401580800	Amazing product. Only been two weeks since I bought this and I am seeing results. Couldn't be more happy!!! I Totally recommend it
3	1401494400	hi all today is the first time trying on the suit. I can't wait to see results and hope it lives up to all it says it does. I can give it three stars because I like the way it fits and the quality is great.
5	1401408000	My husband loves all there products, runs in it all the time! Plan on buying a few more. Great gift!
5	1401321600	Wow.This is what I have been looking for a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!I used the plastic sauna suit and it would last one time only. It would always tear up after my daily walk. Which meant I spent more money.  Until I found this product.  Thank You.  I am not only losing weight, I am saving money.
4	1401321600	I have the 2 piece (top and bottom) set but decided to try the 1 piece as an extra. My only issue is getting in and out of the suit can be tricky especially when the suit is snug to the body like it is suppose to be. However, the quality is a s good as the 2 piece that I originally purchased.
4	1401235200	I have one of the black Kutting Weight tops and I love, love LOVE it! I run outdoors on a cable bridge and because of the incline, the top has a tendency to ride up a little while running and every quarter mile or so I have to pull it down (but I still love it--I sweat like crazy and have dropped quite a bit of weight with this top.) I thought if I got the all-in-one sauna suit I wouldn't have to worry about that plus the sleeves are shorter and summer's coming up and I live in the South where the heat index can get up to 110+ degrees. The sauna suit is awesome but unfortunately I am 5' 3&#34; and too short in the torso and it doesn't fit right, it bunches up around my waist. I do plan on keeping it though and giving it to a friend as a gift, she is a few inches taller than me and I'm sure it will fit her much better. And I'll probably order another top for myself.
5	1401235200	I was going to wait a while before writing a review, but I am getting asked to write one; and that is my only small complaint so far.  First time I wore it I was very sick with asthmatic bronchitis, so I only did a short workout.  Sat down exhausted and can't breathe, but very comfortable in the outfit.  So comfortable I rested for a few minutes before taking a shower.  Then I noticed the huge puddle around me.  My couch was dripping wet.  Can't believe I sweated so much while staying so comfortable.  Took it off in the shower and the amount of sweat is truly unbelievable.  My one warning is the same as everyone else's.  DRINK, DRINK, DRINK!
5	1401148800	I have tried many sauna suits over the years. This one is by far the best. It really makes you sweat. I am going to purchase another one. I will also order another Kutting weight sauna hat. They are perfectly paired together. My wife loves the way that the suit fits on me...and she can't keep her hands off of me.
5	1401148800	This sauna suit is just great, I normally wear large in most clothing and the large in this suit fit perfectly, some have suggested that you order a size larger than you normally wear but I would suggest ordering the size you normally wear. As far as the actual suit, I can tell you that this thing will make you sweat. I have never sweat so much during a workout and for at least another 30 minutes after I have stopped working out and taken the suit off. I would recommend this to anyone needing to get rid of water weight, just remember to drink lots of water during workouts.
5	1401062400	Suit works amazing, got it in the mail the other day and just went for my first run with it and i was sweating up a storm in no time!
5	1400976000	This is my second Kutting Weight suit and I am very pleased with the product. I purchased an additional weight suit in order to have one suit cleaning and drying while being able to continue the benefits of the weight suit while working out. You will definitely sweat. The updated suit offers a better fit in the underarm and crouch areas. I also have have a Kutting Weight cap which is beneficial when exercising or walking outdoors. I endorse this product and the vendor wholeheartedly; you will not be disappointed with this product.
5	1400889600	Even though I have only had this suit for a couple of weeks, I love it.  I am not a big sweater and in fact the only time I really sweat when working out is when I am doing hot yoga.  I sweat a lot wearing this suit, even around the house for a couple of hours.  I don't have wet socks or water running down my legs, but I sweat!  For sizing, I am a pear shaped woman, 5'7, 160 lbs and I ordered a medium.  When I tried to put it on the first time it would not zip up over my belly.  I did not want to send it back so I did the old tight jeans trick and laid down on the bed to get it zipped up.  It was then perfectly comfortable, it didn't feel to tight.  Now most days I can get it zipped without laying down.  I plan on buying the pants and long sleeve shirt when winter comes around, that's how happy I am with this suit.
5	1400889600	I LOVE IT!!!!! MAKES ME SWEAT LIKE CRAZY WHEN I WORK OUT!!! REALLY GOOD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO LOSE WEIGHT HAVE LOST 9LBS SO FAR
5	1400803200	Okay at first I was skeptical, but this thing make you sweat like it says it does it's no joke it will suck all of the water out of your body. Make sure that you drink plenty of water when using this product. Since I got this suit I lost a full two (2) inches in my waist.Thoe only negative I have is that it will have the neoprene smell for a few months.
5	1400803200	One of the best suits my husband has tried to date. The vents allow the body to breathe, yet allows the suit to do it's job. Because it's an all over suit, you don't have to worry about constantly tugging it into place. Great price.
1	1400803200	i emailed for help got no helpwasted so much money on this im sad waste of time and money BEWARE
5	1400716800	So I was looking for a way to up my levels in fitness. I hold on to a lot of water weight. This has enable me to start losing that water weight. My scale wasn't moving and since starting to use the sauna suit, the scale is actually moving now. I am so happy. When I am able to get out of this size I will be ordering the pants and shirt seperates. Also, drink LOTS of water, you will feel the dehydration when you have the suit on if you don't.
4	1400716800	I used it while I worked around my yard and next ill will use it when I ride my bike
5	1400630400	I have the whole outfit and I wear it every morning when I jog.  I come back soaking wet, without fail.  If you want to loose water weight, this will do it.  It will also increase your metabolism since your core body temperature is higher.
4	1400544000	I put this on and sweated so much when i took it off I smelled like glazed ham. But it definitely works. I also use it as a wet suit when I go jet skiing.
5	1400544000	I'm not one to write a 5 star rating very easily-most of the time I am happy with a purchase but the inert part of me thinks about how it usually could be better.  This product however does what it says it does and even with someone such as myself whom is disabled.  Losing weight for me was not vanity but a realistic need to keep life.  Knowing my 2 boys still need their daddy at home I strive to lose weight with bariatric surgery and of course this surgery is just a tool and something you need to work for which I was working for further surgical procedures which were easily being denied to me because I was obese.  I am 5'6&#34; and prior to 7 months ago weighed in at 300 pounds.  7 months later and a month with the kutting weight suit I now am weighing in at 161 and working toward my last few pounds of weight.  I am an odd size that doesn't fit neatly into a medium or large so I chose the medium suit.  with a chest of 42&#34; and waist of 32&#34; and 5'6 2 out of the 3 fit the medium size suit.  Infact I am very please with my decision.  The suit has some stretch to it and fits very nicely.  I exercise simple exercises-nothing like Dustin Zahursky did in the video but I still loose at minimum 3 pounds during the session.  When fat cells are broken down to be used by the body the first step is to break them down to easier to use compounds such as h20, carbon dioxide and ect.  So each fat cell has a way to escape by sweating.  You can drink water to replenish the lost water but the energy the body used to heat your body up and the energy used to sweat has been expended to burn those additional calories.  I used to use simple sauna suits that were very inexpensive--I am on disability pay with a fam of 4 so it really does not stretch very far but I forsee this investment as paying for itself because of the grand quality it is made.  The reasonable sauna suits would rip from overuse in a few months.  Would love to get the pant (M) and shirt (L) to use as like  Dustin Zahursky does in his video and ring my socks out too but alas--I cannot afford.  Anyone looking to for a sweat suit that will aid them and be a formidable tool in their arsenal of tools for weight loss-this is one investment you should say YES to.  Have a great day and good luck on your weight loss goals!
5	1400544000	I use it while I'm doing work around the house and it works great. I also use it while riding my bike, and I sweat my a** off.
4	1400544000	very good workout clothing. I wear it as is with a t-shirt and slack over and it hold the sweat perfectly. did not drip, and fit perfectly.
3	1400457600	Bought it for my friend he's a body builder and he wants to look more cut. He likes it a lot
1	1400457600	Very difficult to get on and almost imossible to get off.  It also does not perform as described.  I have the same material in shorts that work great.  It will sit in my closet growing dust  or I will simply throw it out.
5	1400371200	I love the suit, it's well made, and it works.I'm 6ft tall and 200lbs. The XL fit me almost perfect. The arms are a little loose on top, but I can't decide if my arms are too small or the rest of me is too big, either way I plan to work on that at the gym with my new suit.Also, yes, the zipper does end down under so if you're not wearing anything underneath your suit you run the risk of zipping things that weren't necessarily meant to be zipped so there's that, but as long as you're careful it's not a mistake I suspect you'll make twice.
5	1400198400	Awesome suit! When you wear clothes over the suit it looks like a simple under armor shirt. be careful the first time I wore it I kept it on for 2hours in 100degree  temperature and almost fainted. I wear it a lot with caution. I absolutely love it and reccomend it.
5	1400198400	I started using the suit a month ago and have been working out on treadmill for 40days.This really makes you sweat a lot. It's almost gross I have that much of fat I can sweat out in just one work out session.I am 5&#34;1 and 144lbs and couldn't figure out what size I should purchase so I called the CS to inquire.They advised me to go with Midium but went otherwise (so much for inquiring ;p) and got me a Small.It fits me perfectly even has a bit of wiggle room (which I am not planning on growing into).I do recommend wearing a t-shirt and leggings or some sort underneath of the suit to help absorb a ton of sweat or you'd be dripping.I also discovered this tummy trim belt by McDavid ($14.28 amazon.com) and just started using both suit and tummy trimming belt 2 days ago. Boy, I've never sweat like I do with these combination besides from Bikram Yoga. I am expecting a good outcome in no time (so far 8lbs in 40days).
5	1400198400	i love this product... i've been using it for 2 weeks and i'm starting to see the difference all over my body... normally i don't sweat a lot... but with this i do and also i do wear a t-shirt underneath it... highly recommended... 2 thumbs up....
5	1400198400	Wow what a great product I started sweating as soon as I put it on I lost 12 pounds the first month
4	1400198400	I read all the other reviews and people said they ordered too small, so i went the opposite and ordered big. As of right now I have lost 6 pounds, thats two workouts. Also i got this red scratch on my arm from the suit, i think its cause the arms are too long, other than that i love it.
5	1400112000	This clothes made in Taiwan, it is not very confortable but effective. customer service really friendly. nice experience. Good tool for lose weight.
5	1400112000	I purchased this suit to help bring up my core heat when working out.  I like that the suit moves with you during workouts, really comfortable.  It's easy to get in and out of, so you don't mind using it everytime you workout.  I have a bad hip and this suit adds support to my legs, back, and shoulders...nice snug fit.
5	1400112000	I have to cut weight a couple times a year and vinyl or pvc sauna suits are torn to shreds when I run (thighs get torn apart).  PVC or Vinyl also make a lot of noise and is distracting for longer runs.  The neoprene option works much better, but running in a wetsuit is impractical and painful after 2 miles.  Neoprene makes me sweat just as much but doesn't turn into a water balloon of foulness.  I happen to be 5'6&#34; and 178 lbs - 156 lbs (depending on where I am in training)  with a 40&#34; chest.  The front zip and the stretchy material in the armpit and crotch makes an S fit perfectly.  That it fits so well I have no problem using it almost every day.  I would recommend this Kutting Weight neoprene sauna to anyone looking to loose water weight in the short term and fat over an extended period of time.
5	1400025600	I had previously purchased the Kutting Weight long sleeve weight loss shirt a couple of months ago and knew the quality of their products, how extremely well they performed and the weight loss results they could provide.  Now that spring is here the weight loss sauna suit was a must have.  Like the long sleeve shirt, the sauna suit's outstanding construction and comfortable fit makes workouts very productive. This sauna suit will definitely be beneficial to anyone interested in cutting weight!
5	1400025600	Product is great! It fits like a glove. It makes me sweat way more than when I used one of those bands that went around my waist. I put the sauna suit on when I go to the gym and I start to sweat instantly during my workout. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to sweat the pounds away!
5	1399939200	this thing is pretty awesome, if you have tried belly wraps and dont like how they slide around after sweating, or only target 1 area, this is the suit for you! great thermogenic effect!
4	1399939200	This suit really makes you sweat and lose weight I love this suit. I am getting one for my wife also.
4	1399766400	This suit will make you sweat, which is what it is supposed to do.  Only reason for 4 not 5 stars was that it is a bit large, I'm 6'3&#34; and 260, by the size chart I should need a 5XL, it fits loose though. That being said, to repeat, you will sweat.  I plan to get another therefore it will be a 4XL.Came right away no package problems.
5	1399680000	It would have been nice to have more accurate measurements in the item description.Im 5' 7'' 225 lb male47'' chest45'' love handles36'' waistI purchased the XL size and it fits snug, I think most people would like this fit. I like it snug but wish it was a lot more snug I should have purchased the large instead. I notice my lower back doesn't hurt as much when I ware this suit. I have only used it for a week and since it has been cold outside, I have not been sweating but It has done a great job of keeping me warm
3	1399593600	Not sure why it's not working for me like it is for others, but I don't feel like I'm sweating any more than usual.
5	1399593600	I had to buy two of these because the first one got ruined and didn't  last long. I used it for working out and biking.Overall it is the best sauna suit available on the market.Just stick to the rules: hand wash it, no chemicals or soap whatsover.After a little while you will noticed a loss in body water and possibly some weight as long as you stick to the basics: exercise regularly and watch your diet.
2	1399593600	i had to send it back it was the wrong size. Im hoping they send the right size so i can start using it
5	1399507200	i use it when i do my heavy bag training and it is something that makes you work harder to maintain the same pace and if you are like me and fight through it you will benefit tremendously. it makes you sweat alot so drink much water
5	1399507200	Love love love it! Thanks and super fast delivery. Awesome!!!! I can wear this while just cleaning my house and and afterwards when I take it off feels like I stepped out of sauna.
3	1399420800	I made the mistake by following a reviewers recommendation, and ordered mine 2 sizes bigger because, &#34;they run small&#34;.  Not so.  Their size chart is pretty right on.  Ugh...
4	1399161600	I really like this sauna suit.  It makes me sweat a lot in my workout, it is made of great quality.
5	1399161600	I think I have bought everything possible to try and loose weight over the last 20 years.  This suit is the best thing I have ever used and it fits perfectly for my size.  It has a snug fit but not too tight so you can still breath and still does the job.
4	1399075200	It has a very nice feel to it and you do sweat(alot), but I don't get the buckets of sweat people were talking about. All the clothes that I wear under it are soaked with sweat. Best way I found to clean it is to put it on a hanger and hold it in front of the shower head and then let it dry.
5	1398988800	This is an awesome suit it's very discreet but this is a warning only wear it when ur going to work out because this suit makes u sweat lol. but trust me u can feel the difference it pushes ur workout by just having it on and doing ur own routine workout. And not only that but it burns calories and u can feel it detoxify ur body after  the workout. It's very comfortable and it looks sleek and doesn't stink it drys up when u hang it up and easy to wash. If ur looking to workout and get an edge this is it without the pills.
5	1398988800	I wear it whenever I workout , i don't go hard core and all just a light mile jog if I can and whenever I use it I have a tshirt under and a hoodie over . By the time I'm done and ready to shower the tshirt I have under is completely wet, my underwear as we'll, where it ends on the arms and legs there's a big like of sweat where it comes out. This think makes me sweat like 5X than expected if I didn't have it on even with a hoodie on.
4	1398988800	It really make you drop the water weight from your body and helps with the metabolism as far as enhancing it more
5	1398902400	Both my husband and I got these and they are awesome. I hate to sweat but this suit is like no other. You don't even realize how much you are sweating till you take it off. I would recommend these to anyone. I am almost 5'8 and 150lbs and I needed to send my medium back and get a small. So they do run a little big for women.
4	1398902400	At first I was going to buy LS shirt for $59.99 but saw the suit for $79.99, Yipes, that's a better deal! While I read the shirts' specs, I made all kinds of assumptions with the suit; mainly that it was a 2 piece suit and LS. After reading the other reviews on the sizing I decided to go one size bigger with the 4XL which was still tight but comfortable after a few minutes. I wore it thru out the fist morning while doing chores. While I was sweating, I didn't think that it was much of one until I removed the suit. Unlike the baggy suit where you feel the sweat rolling off of you with this one you might feel tacky.The big problem for me, as a male, is if you have to pee. The zipper needs another 2 - 3&#34; in the crotch because now  you'll find you're trying to peeling yourself out of the upper part. At home, no problem; in a public bathroom - yuck.This was the first day tryout. I'll review it again after a bike ride.
4	1398816000	Bought size bigger  was right call. Used suit to make weight for wrestling event. But can see how would help on daily weight loss/maintain
5	1398816000	Very good, love it. It makes u sweat sweat like crazy. Just what I've been looking for and in a material that won't make u extremely hot to the point of passing out. It let's you breathe and it's stretchable.
5	1398729600	Great product, will get u sweet, and keeps body warm to prevent injury when lifting heavy weights! I like it
5	1398729600	I have had this suit for about 2 weeks and believe me it works, you will sweat like you have never sweated before.  After cycling for 45 min, I am soak and wet all the way down to my socks.  Highly recommend this product.
5	1398297600	This is a great product! It fits as advertised, it works as advertised, and I am sweating & losing weight!!! : ) - thx.
5	1398297600	I recommend this suit to everybody. The first time I run 30min with the suit on and I sweat like never before. I love it!!!
5	1398297600	I love the product, I could wear them all together at one time or just wear either of them according to my comfort for the day.
5	1398297600	I've used for a few weeks now everyday.  Seems like good quality and no problems or disappointments so far.  Sizing information was accurate aswell.
5	1398211200	If you are looking to loose all that extra water weight BUY the suit! I recommend it 100%.  I do intense cardio classes with the suit on, it is very comfortable (I am 5'6 and weight 125lbs bought the XS and fits perfect may be a little loose on top, but it does the work!)
5	1398211200	I had try many different sauna suits and by far this is the best, better quality, size. Before I buy the suit I bought the shirt which is fantastic but since the summer is around the corner I decided to try the suit and it is fantastic.
5	1398211200	You get a more effective work out and it get your muscles warmer fasterI also like that its a snug fit
4	1398124800	I'm 6'2&#34; 211 and I bought the XL. It was a good fit and very comfortable. I wish I would've known that you can't wash it in a washing machine but that's not a big deal. I would buy it again. Good product.
5	1397952000	Helped me cut 8 pounds and 2 inches from my waist in a week.I wear it whenever I go running or cycling.
5	1397865600	Great product, I wear it every day. Great for working out or running around town. Fits great under my shirt and shorts , very comfortable. I liked it so much I bought another, after my work out I clean up and put on a fresh one to continue my day..
5	1397779200	Awesome stuff,  this is the best investment for anyone out there trying to get an extra help AT the gym,  feel free to email them for any size question,  they will answer quick and will help with any size doubt you may have, just send them your measurement, thanks, KW
5	1397692800	I wear this under my regular workout clothes when lifting. It makes me sweat and keeps my muscles warm during training. When doing cardio I add the pants the shirt and the hat and it's sweat city! I'm 5' 10 and was 220 when I got the suit. It fit snug (as it's supposed to) but it was comfortable. I have now cut down to 205 and it still fits perfect. Sizing chart is on point.
4	1397692800	So I received my KW suit and I love it. I get such a good sweat going in the first couple of minutes. It also improves my flexibility. I have lost two pounds and although I know it is just water weight for now, it motivates me to keep working out. I think it was very much worth my money. At first I was very concerned about the price and was thinking that I could just wear the old fashion plastic suit. It doesn't even compare to this suit. If you are considering making the purchase, don't keep mulling it over-just buy it. I promise you will enjoy the results.
5	1397692800	It definitely promotes sweating! Just make sure you pay attention to the size chart. I normally wear a 2X in everything but needed a 4X. The suit fits well and allows a lot of flexibility and range of motion. I would order again and would recommend to anyone who wants to crank up the sweat while they are working out.
5	1397692800	Great sauna suit at a great price , as soon as you put on the suit you feel your body heating up , make sure you're well hydrated cause you'll be pouring sweat . I've recommended my friends to try it. .
5	1397606400	Product met my specific requirements. Excellent product for those desiring to cut inches, this product will do it. I will recommend this to others.
5	1397606400	A little itchy but works as described.  The most sweat I have gotten on a workout.  I will use it for all my runs from now on.  Very good quality and easy to hand wash and dry.
5	1397606400	I needed a whole piece workout suit and t his was perfect !Love it!I recommend this product!5 Stars
5	1397520000	It's a great suit. I sweat alot. I'm 207. I bought an xl. It fits perfect. Slight gap in the neck. I have a problem with the arms. After I sweat it sticks to my skin so I need help with the sleeves pulling them down. I'm soooo glad I made the purchase. On my way to being a dime piece again. I'm going to be super fine this summer built like a brick.
5	1397520000	A very GOOD product And very GOOD material i World very much recommend this product to this who want to lose weight
5	1397520000	This was excellent exchange of business, the size, the fit, the quality was worth it and I will have it for years to come.  It was shipped fast and all is well. thank you
5	1397433600	its perfect !!!! sweating like crazy at the gym, and i'm not a sweater.i'm 5'7 170lbs  a large was perfect.
4	1397347200	I'm a big fan of the suit. It fits perfectly (I used the sizing chart), is comfortable, and breathes in the right areas (pits and grundle). This thing will make you sweat! Buckets of sweat! My only gripe about the product is the logos on the sleeves of the suit. They are very visible when wearing a short sleeve shirt. I wear this thing in the gym, which frowns on suits like these from being used on their premises. I have been told to remove the suit or leave the gym a few times now. I am considering cutting the logos off the suit, and have already used a black marker to cover them up. Barring the logos, everything about the suit is great. I would gladly recommend this suit to anyone.
4	1397347200	I love the way it fits. I usualky wear it around the house and when I am working out on the treadmill
5	1397260800	This is one of the best investments you could make to improve your fitness level, mental focus and overall endurance. I would recommend this product to any person looking to make a change in their lives. You can't go wrong with a Kutting Weight product. Get one and change your life !!!!
4	1397260800	make sure you order two sizes bigger than what you ware and it will fit just fine if you dont ou will be sending it back
5	1397174400	Not only do I use it for exercising, I also wear it all day while doing heavy gardening work.  Makes me feel good because it holds you together...compact feeling and keeps you warm if it's cold out.  A negative is, when you open the package it does have that new smell that other reviewers have commented on.  The smell lasted maybe one day if that.  I turn it inside out and hang it to dry after each use.  The smell is completely gone after two uses.There are two negatives, first one is, I have a hard time taking it off especially when I've been sweating in it so my husband assists me with pulling one sleeve off and from there it's easy to remove.  Love this product!  I bought an XL and the chest area is slightly big on me but I actually like the extra room.  Second thing is, every time you have to use the bathroom, you have to unzip it all the way down but, that's fine by me.  I would recommend this item and it arrived on time and packaged good.
5	1397174400	I loved this suit since it arrived and I slipped into it. It was true to size based on the size chart. It holds the body very well and boy.....the sweat!!! I have not been on the scale since I received it, but my body feels tighter since I wear it for every run or workout. I will order another as back-up incase this one ever wears out!!
4	1397174400	Great Product, I do have one small complaint.  I have a very long torso, I am 6&#8217;2, 270.  When I wear the suit I feel like my shoulders are being pulled down.  I totally blame myself as I think its my large belly being the issue.  I hope when I lose my belly weight it will relieve some pressure.  I bought the 4xl and its fits great with the shoulder exception.  Check out the size chart, it is pretty spot on.  Great product!
4	1397088000	I put this on and within 10 minutes I was sweating.  I had it for one week and I can see the difference.
5	1397001600	I Absolutely Love This Product!! I've Been Looking For One For Awhile Now...I'm Saving Money Verses The Money I've Wasted In Just The Waist Bands, Why Not Invest In The Entire Suit?! I Use It During Cross Fit, The Steam Room Working Out or Just Lounging Around The House. Its Very Comfortable.I Ordered A Large Based On Measurements...A Medium Would Have Also Worked...But I Truly Think It Depends Upon Body Makeup Composition...Easy To Care For I Place In The Rinse Cycle Once/Twice A Week Then Place In The Dryer...I'd Recommend This Suit To Anyone!!
5	1397001600	I was looking for a sauna suit and finally found a good one. It is worth every penny. I needed something to put an extra boost in my cardio workout. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys working out.
5	1396915200	Great product. Help you produce a lot of sweat. Instrumental in weight loss. I am glad I purchased it. Terrific
5	1396915200	I only had the product for 4 days. I must say, it does magic! It might feel strange the first time you put it on, but give it a shot, you won't regret it. I bought a Large, I am 190 lb 5'5. It fit great.
4	1396828800	Very satisfied with this product, it works exactly as advertised. I have lost 7lbs in 7 days after using the suit while doing my cardio. I highly recommend it
5	1396828800	Order larger than you normally would.....maybe 2 sizes up. They work very well. Drink plenty of fluids before and during workout
3	1396828800	I love it because you do sweat like crazy.....it is really hard to take off because it sticks to your body.....but, I have not seen any results yet and I use it every day at the gym so waiting to see if it is something that will benefit me in the future....
5	1396742400	just great i love it it works great u should buy it you will love it i promise you that
5	1396656000	Excellent item for a hard workout in the gym. Helps throughout the workout to slim down and helps with the muscles.
5	1396656000	I must admit that I was hesitant in ordering this suit. I have wide hips and a big behind, but I was looking for something to help me sweat more while doing cardio and wouldn't rip. I tried the suit on as soon as I received it and was surprised that it was a little big in the hips and butt. That was GREAT!!!! It's very comfortable!! I can wear it by itself or under my sweats. It moves when I move and has you sweating in no time. The sweat does cool you down fast after working out. I'm cold natured, so I take the suit off as soon as I can. The only thing I would change is the size of the suit being on the outside on the collar.The suit is reversible, so the size won't show. I LOVE IT!!!! Highly recommend it!!
4	1396569600	This is a good product. Made very well and is the first sauna suit that I have not torn within the first couple of times using it.  The but is the sizing.  I am in the middle of the height chart for the 4XL (6 feet), the upper middle on the chest size (50 inches), and the upper edge of the weight (250 ponds).  I am a power lifter so my build is different from the norm.  The torso length is good on the 4XL for my height.  I would not be able to us a 3XL because of my shoulders.  However, the waist and legs are a little loose and my waist and legs are not small.  I would recommend this product highly, but I would go to kuttingweight.com an then call with your measurements.  In order to get the best fit.  It also doesn't tell you anywhere to wear a shirt or other clothing under the suit.  Recommended wearing underclothing.  Taking the suit off afterwards doesn't require assistance if you wear something under the suit.  Although, if your shoulders fit snuggly it can still be difficult to remove.
5	1396483200	It is such as Good product . I am a femele and I purchased medium size. My regular size is medium, size 8-10. The medium size in my suit was  a little large in the middle part, about 2&#34;. My height is 5'2. Yes I am recommend Kutting Weight sauna suit.
4	1396483200	We ordered 3 suits. 2 med and 1 large. We will need to return one of the mediums, it is too large for our daughter. Wasn't clear what sizes to order. My husband and I love ours though!  Also, our daughter isn't sure she would wear something like this to the gym. She prefers shorts and t shirts.
5	1396483200	The shipping was fast and the product fits perfectly and does not make any noises while you are running. I am 6'1@ 290 I got the 3 XL.
5	1396483200	I am quite pleased with the quality of the suit received and hope it is a durable as it appears it can be.  It is well made!Mike P
5	1396396800	The bomb. It holds the least bit of sweat and I can't wait for it to warm up because the effects will triple. The cost is worth the experience. Hand wash and hang to dry you won't be disappointed
1	1396396800	It should indicate that if a person is a 3X that they need to order a 5XIt stated nothing about the fit of the suit
5	1396310400	Suit works great however it does run a little small. I'm 5'10 190+ and I got an extra large and it runs tight.
5	1396224000	Suit is what I expected and it fits great.  REALLY makes you sweat so I notice I have to curb my workouts to be a bit less intesnse because of how overheated and sweaty I get.  Timely delivery and no problems.
3	1396224000	Good product great for working out order at large should order xlarge...but soon will fit me perfectly by summer time or before
4	1396137600	I am truly enjoying the Kutting Weight suit that I purchased recently, it has proven to be very effective in the way that it allows the sweat to just pour off of the body after a brisk walk or even a good aerobic/elliptical workout. I am have enjoyed this suit so much until when my son saw me put it on and then the results, he has asked for me to purchase one for him. Therefore I will be giving him my suit and ordering a smaller size for myself.Thanks,
5	1396051200	im normally an under arnour kinda guy when it comes to the gym but this suit def blows it away. sweat like a beast in a it. awesome product recommended to a bunch of people.
4	1396051200	This is a great product. It was suggested to me that I get a size larger than what I would normally get.  This was a great suggestion since I wear a light layer underneath to soak up some of the sweat that happens when wearing the suit.  The delivery was just as they stated. In fact I received it before the schedule delivery date.  The Amazon purchase was a safe and secure means for getting this product.  I suggest if you are thinking about purchasing this suit then go to Amazon right now and order it for yourself. You will be pleased with the product as well as the quick delivery time.
4	1396051200	It does a good job of making you sweat. It's hard to tell the size that you really need. At first I ordered a XL, but I could barely move, so I returned it for the XXL. It seems like it loosens up with usage, so it's hard to know the right size, but it does what it is supposed to do. The return process was easy and it arrived on time.
5	1395964800	This suit is amazing...  after working out in this suana suit for 1 HOUR I loss 7lbs... It's a must buy.
5	1395964800	So I am a flight attendant  and I fly long hauls and trans cons.  Flying long flights has many  advantages and disadvantages.  Disadvantages include bloating.. Jet belly.  Nope,  not glamorous.  I ordered the sauna suit and  use it after a long trip with a good workout.  Wow!! I sweat but the best thing!? No jet belly.  It seems to detox my body.  Love it! It feels like I have had one of those expensive  body wraps.
5	1395964800	I love the feel of the suit, it fit great as well will be wearing it alot this spring and summer.
5	1395878400	With a lot of fitness wear you find seams that are not quite up to the wear and tear you may give the garment. This product uses seams equal to what you can put this through. They also use seam stops as connectors and crosses of seams. Use the next size up to avoid being ultra tight, some may like it that way! Reflective also! Great product, will buy more from them...in fact, I have already!!!
5	1395878400	I am a national champion boxer and ordered this to get the most out of my work outsI wear it with sweat pants and long sleeve shirts during workouts and i soak everythingWhat love the most about the perfect tight fit i got a large and im about 5"10 176lbs i will aslo apply alboline to sweat more didnt really get to lose wait but rather sweat all o can duri.g workouts doesnt bother me at all while sparring or doing mitts the best feature is that it doesnt feel nasty like the cheap plastic ,the neopreme absorbs all the sweat from your body all i do is rinse it in the tub when finished squezze and hang till next time
5	1395705600	I  wore this suit under my clothes every Day started December 19,2013 ended up losing 50Lbs by March 23,2014 Highly Recommened this Product
5	1395619200	The neoprene material works well for me. I have had it for the last two weeks. I could not fit in my size 14 clothing but this suit has changed that in just two weeks. I even can wear it under my clothing during the day. It absorbs the sweat, sweet!!! It works. I was not willing to buy any more clothes past the size of 14. It appears to share my sentiment on getting my weight down even more. I am looking forward to losing more of my weight and maybe getting down two more sizes by the summer. I recommend drinking lots of water and to relax while you are wearing it. What I mean by relax is what ever you are doing to lose weight; be happy and enjoy the experience and results will come.
5	1395619200	Exactly what I was hoping for. Fits perfectly and helps me sweat during workouts. I definitely recommend this product for reducing weight and inches.
5	1395446400	I bought the XXL due to past reviews. I would recommend ordering your true size for me that's a XL. This suite is made of quality rubber, which might be why the price is a little steep. I have been using mine for a month now and have noticed a positive difference already. This suite make your normal work out much harder. I recommend wearing a undershirt and boxers under and clothing on top. i use a wist trimmer on top and it does not look bulky.P.S. You will have to hang your cloth to dry as they will be soak and wet.
5	1395446400	I've have this for 2 weeks and already seeing results. It has you sweating like crazy but remember, it's all in the diet as well
5	1395446400	I think this product is a very great product I use this every time I'm going to exercise I have lost a lot of weight due to this product but I do recommend you to drink a lot of water because you sweat so much that it will make dehydrated if you don't drink water. I can say I have lost about ten pounds because of this product. it helps with every piece of your body. even just walking will make you sweat like crazy. I will defiantly recommend!!! Give it a try and you will see results. do engage in some physical activity for maximum results.
5	1395360000	I love it..I wear it for all my workouts and classes at the gym. when I'm done the sweat is running down my arms and legs. it's also keeps you warm during my workout. I used to wear  just the shorts and they would start to slide down during my workouts, but this new style of the whole suit I done have to worry about anything sliding down and getting uncomfortable.
5	1395360000	I must say that I'm very happy with my sauna suit. The fit was perfect for me and plus I sweat more than ever. I would recommend this product.
5	1395273600	I am 5'2, 116# and the XS is a perfect fit.  I do not exercise strenuously so the 20-30 minutes a day that I do exercise, I like to feel like I am getting the maximum benefit.  I really like this product so far, have only been using it a few days.  So far I have only used it wearing clothes underneath also.  I think it will end up being well worth the money!
3	1395273600	I would have preferred something a bit more pliable to be used under my workout clothes.  As this item stands, I could put it on and hit the waves.
5	1395187200	You sweat and become wet and it actually isn't too bad because instead of being hot it made me feel cool inside having moisture inside the suit.  Hard to explain...but you sweat and the fabric wicks it away from skin and you feel like your wearing a wet suit.  Hope that helps you understand.  The size I got was medium and I am 5'8 average build except want to lose inches around waist and back.  I could have easily fit into a small if my chest was smaller then a DD. It doesn't fit you like a glove around the torso and the crotch is a little long cause I am shorter waisted.  But all in all it feels very comfortable on me.  I can easily unzip and get out of it.I went on a bike ride in the evening after dark and it was cool out about in the 60's here and I still worked up a good sweat.  I could see wearing this to also insulate and keep warm too on evening or early morning rides...except they should make a long leg version.  I am waiting on a zip up jacket and pants that I can layer with.I am excited about sweating off some tummy inches I will repost if it happens fast!
5	1395187200	I had the pants/capris of this material before and my boyfriend and I really wanted a full suit.  These are just what we needed!! Prepare to wear thermals or something underneath them because you will sweat!! I am excited to see how much weight I will loose with this product.Good quality as well- really satisfied :)
5	1395100800	I have brought the plastic ones only to have them rip or get holes in them. Very durable material and I love the breathing panels on them. Be careful with the sizing. I probably could have used a bigger size but glad I got the size I did. Highly recommend great for most activities. Can't wait until the weather is better so I can ride my bike with it.
5	1395100800	Fit perfect, lost 5lbs in the first week of use. The only negative thing I could say about it is the strong chemical smell but even that wasnt too bad after the first machine wash.
5	1395014400	Love the sauna suit....you get that extra intense workout that I myself need. I seem to have lost 3 pounds...if I loose the last 7 this easy. I will forever wear this suit!!!!
5	1394928000	it is great and flexible, the may problem it may have is that it is a little rough from inside which make it annoying a little when wearing it
5	1394841600	I'm about 5' 9'', weigh about 173 lbs, normally wear a size medium shirt, and a size 32 waist for pants . It's recommended that you go one size above what you would normally wear so I went with the large. Fits pretty comfortably for me. Not too tight yet not too loose.Triple reinforced seams allow for a diverse workout without having to worry about rips or tears. It'll pretty much move with your body. Have worn it with regular clothing it on top. Only the neck portion of the suit is a bit visible since it tends to fit high. Other than that it's pretty much concealed if worn underneath clothing.Recommended to wear either real early in the morning or late afternoon/night for someone who is wearing it for noncompetitive wear i.e. you're not weight cutting for a competition. This, along with the Sauna Shirt will definitely dehydrate your body and cause injury if you're not careful and/or do not know the limitations of your body and/or push too much too fast in a workout.
5	1394841600	Perfect fit, using the fitting size chart, very flexible for running, and walking, so far no issues after a week of use.
5	1394755200	keeps me warm and sweating in the cold winter run of chicago. keeps me motivated going to the gym when i put it on because its comfortable and work well with my regular gym shorts and clothes.
5	1394755200	I have only been able to use the suit 4 times but I have noticed an increase in the amount of sweat I am producing compared to what I was doing before. Which is wearing thermals under sweats. Haven't seen much weight loss. But I haven't been sticking to a consistent diet routine. Once I combine a consistent low calorie diet with my usual 3 mile walk 3 to 5 times a week. I expect to see better results.
5	1394668800	From a 5X to a 1X... positive the Kutting Weight sauna suit is a working ingredient to my weight loss journey!
5	1394668800	I like the feel and look of it. Thought it would be itchy but it is not. Nice to work out in and makes me sweat more than I normally would. I like it.
5	1394668800	Just wanted to write a quick review of the Kutting Weight suit. I never write reviews but always read them before a purchase so I felt like I should give one back.I was looking to replace an old neoprene vest I had for years that I used when doing higher aerobic work. I was skeptical that I would need the full suit but wanted to give it a shot.This thing is amazing! It took me a few workouts to get used to having something on my legs and upper arms but got used to it pretty quick.I am 5' 9" and weigh somewhere in the 180 lb range. I have a 41" chest and wear a 33" waist pant. I ordered the large based on the chart and it fits perfect. The only slight issue I have is when I do any workout that requires me to lift my arms over my head. There is no issue in the arms but the lower portion of the suit tends to ride up a bit! Not that big of an issue to change size or to give 4 stars instead of 5. The suit is tight in the chest and shoulders but it feels the way I think this suit should. The vented area's work great to help with all the sweating you will be doing.It usually takes me about 20 minutes of so to get the sweat going. After that you can feel it working. My chest and waist both feel more toned as soon as the suit comes off. I am trying to slowly get down to 170lb so I haven't worried about my actual weight yet.Thanks for an awesome product!
5	1394668800	Even though it fits some what big on me because i was under the.impression it ran small so i got a 2xl wjen i could have pulled off a xl or even lg. but i love it i put it on under my gym clothes and it really make you sweat. I love the feeling it gives me after a good work out. Love it!!!
5	1394582400	I ordered this suit for my husband because he was tired of using garbage bags as sauna suit. I chose this one because it was neoprene and he knew it would make him sweat a lot and also because it went up to a 6 XL (he's a big guy). He actually could have used a 5 XL but he loves it anyway.
1	1394582400	I am 5'10&#34; tall and 220 pounds and all of my clothes are either large or extra large depending on the brand. Therefore I ordered an extra large sauna suit but it was extremely small. I checked the label to make sure they sent me the correct size which it was. If the suit is made small on purpose, then there should be something to inform those who are purchasing it. I had my wife help me to put it one to no avail. I guess it's my motivation to lose more weight...
5	1394409600	It does exactly what it says and I feel great working out in this suit. It keeps you warmed up so when you rest in the gym your muscles don't get cold. I've definitely seen an improvement in performance. Btw, I am 210 lbs and 5'10'' and the 2xl fits right, maybe just a little too big, but thats fine for me because I am able to workout without having to worry about riping the suit.
5	1394409600	Got the one piece for my girl and the first thing she said to me was "THIS S*** AUNT NO JOKE". I can honestly say her and I have become Kutting Weight Fanatics and as the pounds drop off we will decrease our sizes.
5	1394323200	This suit definitely makes you sweat harder. It feels like a sauna. But it the fit is a bit long. I am 5&#34;2 female and  I am curvy so I feel like I am wearing a box, but the material is flexible.  I have to pull it down in the crotch area but there is still a bulge. My friend also has one and wears clothes over it when training outdoors, but is difficult to do in the summer. I also like the way the sweat does not leak out of the suit while working out. I have used it many times and the material is in tact. I care for it by washing with mild soap and water. When it gets saturated with water, the suit becomes hard to wring out so I let hang it to drip dry. At first I thought the price was too expensive until I thought about how much I paid for a pair of shoes or a nice purse. Even though this us not a known brand it is otherwise a great product.
4	1394236800	Used suit while in Iraq combine with the natural heat- Suit did the trick!!! Choose a size up to fit.
4	1394150400	The product is comfortable and does the job is meant for.Like it and I really suggest to buy it
5	1394064000	I'm a avid runner and have been bored with just the same old runs over and over again.  I felt like I was not challenging myself enough. Plus I am going to Mexico at the end of April and some extra Tone + weight loss is never the worst.  I bought the Sauna Suit and dear lord, was I impressed.  I'm a basketball guy but after every work out my heart goes out to you guys/gals who have to make weight for something. I loved it so much and wanted to challenge myself more, so I order the rest of the gear i.e. pants, long sleeve shirt.  This does everything the description says it does. Plus the design is sick and I get people at the gym asking me where they can get the apparel I have.  Thanks a lot. North Dakota represent.......
5	1394064000	is the best i loved is so nice I don't have much to say  is very nice thank you .
5	1394064000	This is an amazing product to cut weight immediately...like the next hour.I measured myself  at 186.2lbs before wearing the sauna suit, shirt, cap and pants.  I put the P90X3 Triometrics in play mode and got active as much as I can.  I was not gasping for air but was trying hard to stay focus as it is warm.  In five minutes, sweat was dripping literally like at a second interval from my forehead. By the time I was done, I have to mop the floor.  After removing the suit, I measured at 183...my jaw dropped!  The more than 4.5 star rating this set of product has attained is not a joke.  Get one for yourself, and ensure to get hydrated!
5	1394064000	I bought this on a (very costly) whim, and it's been amazing so far. Even doing simple exercises with this on makes me sweat up a storm! I've dropped 6 pounds so far while using this, and I hope to see more results~!
5	1393977600	My friend recommended this since I've been running a lot more but haven't noticed a lot of results. So far I've used this only about a week and sadly there's not a drastic difference in body weight but thats just me wanting results fast. But I have noticed that I sweat 10 times more than I usually would. I wear a hoodie on top to add to it. But I definitely notice less bloating and water weight. So far its an A+
5	1393891200	I recently purchased this and have only worn it once so far, but it absolutely works! The only issue I had was figuring out what size I needed, but that was quickly resolved by going to the Kutting Weight website and contacting customer service. I emailed in my measurements and expected to hear back in a few days or weeks at best. In less than 20 minutes, I had a return email suggesting a size, as well as information about an easy return policy. FYI.....I am 5'3, 170lbs, and needed a size Large. It fits perfectly!!
4	1393891200	good does not fit perfectly but i have big belly and small butt, hope the fat comes off belly and not butt
5	1393891200	Want to sweat and have muscle support , this is the suit to buy, I jog with it and I find I get less muscle fatigue. Replace your water loss so you don't dehydrate.
5	1393804800	This product was just what i had been looking for to increase my body heat during work outs. It really keeps the heat in and makes me break a sweat. Quality product.
5	1393804800	Works well. Heart spikes fast. Higher heart rate burns more calories. Get one. Easy to clean also, jump in the shower and rinse off.
5	1393632000	I have always been one of those people who want to sweat hard during a workout as a way of losing weight but also as a sort of cleansing of the skin ( I know this sounds a bit goofy).  This suit works perfectly.  I had some questions about sizing, sent an email to the company and had a response within two hours.  The suit is snug but comfortable and generates the heat. I can't think of one drawback.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  If you're looking for something like this I strongly suggest you give this product a try.
4	1393545600	product is good but its too tight in the shoulder and arms. I would recommend a sleeveless option. Overall the product work well.
5	1393545600	Ideal suit for burning fat and sweating out impurities. I use it 3 to 4 times a week! Definitely recommend it to all!!
5	1393459200	This is a excellent product to assist you in keeping you're water weight down.Sweat toxins out of your system and feel lean. This product is very durable.I only rinse it with water and hang it up to air dry. I like it so much that I'm going to buy 1 more. I believe in having a back up plan.
5	1393459200	Have you ever had a really hard work out and you don't sweat from your problem areas? Well this  maximizes your work out!  I have lost inches off my arms,  thighs & belly! in 5 minutes you can feel the sweat! Best product ever. I cant believe I didn't find it sooner! If you have any questions concerning size please ask me!
5	1393372800	Since I bought the suite, I can't anymore exercise without it because its increasing my metabolism, helping me to have muscles ready and I have a new feeling of emptying my body from used water, which is very important.I'm doing a workout of 1 to 2 hours, 2 to 3 times per week (work load) and if I'm not loosing continuously weight, I have a good muscles strength increase.I'm even playing soccer with it :)Very important to have and I'm going to add pant to increase the temperature of my body during the exercices.I highly recommend it for any age.
5	1393200000	This is going to sound like an infomercial! Are you tired of using several Neoprene belts? Well wait no more. This awesome suit coves all those undesirable areas, with breathable spots, and it fits perfectly even on my plus size body. I recently got the Gastric Bypass, and well to say no more, I have LOTS of loose skin, even after 3 months. I been using this at least twice a week to work out, and I usually wouldn't sweat that much even working out hard. With this, I sweat A LOT!. It is great! It is comfortable and I can move and do &#34;kickboxing&#34; on it. I recommended to all my friends.
5	1393200000	Amazing super fast delivery.  The product is exactly as described and even better is that it arrived as promised.  My nephew loves it and is using it everyday.
5	1393113600	The size is good -have worn it 4 times so far and it appears to help with the sweat issue. Easy on and off. I've just wiped off inside with a damp cloth so far.
5	1392940800	I bought this as I run indoors a lot and was looking to up my weight loss. this is just great, after wearing it, it was easy to clean and hang up ready for the next day.
2	1392768000	I wish I would have ordered the extra small, the small is too big in the shoulder, chest, and the torso is really long. From the sizing chart it looks like the small should have fit but doesn't, I'm sure if I had an extra small it would work better.
5	1392768000	It does everything it says it will do. I immediately noticed how well it fit and worked.  It actually helped me do my workouts better and I strongly recommend this product and I am extremely satisfied.
2	1392681600	This product is useless without a steady workout and practical diet.  The claim to raise the core tempurature and hense the metabolism is pure bunk. As merely an accessory, the product is adequate.  Consistent exercise and practical diet results in weightloss - not the suit.  Again, the public is at the mercy of the capitalists who falsely advertise.
5	1392681600	I bought this item for my son (a college wrestler) and he loves it!  It helps him quickly get off the last few pounds of water weight before a weigh in or a match.No recommendations made.
5	1392508800	Get the suit according to the chart and prepared to sweat your butt off....I really love how great it is
5	1392508800	you will definetely sweat it out, be sure to check sizing guide and you'll be ok! good enough to run in
5	1392508800	im so happy with my sauna suit i just purchased it a couple of weeks ago and i work out with it everyday.  i sweat so much and i have lost some pounds its definitely a 5 star product cant wait to get the pants.
5	1392508800	I did a 50 minute run on the treadmill. Sweat is just pouring out of me. I wore a t-shirt underneath it and it was drenched in sweat. It's only my first day using this suit but I think it's going to really help with my weight loss.
5	1392508800	I am 5'8 225 with a 37 inch waist I purchased a 2xl ..... It fits well could have probably got a xl next time but it is snug in the shoulders.  Overall product works great makes you sweat as soon as you put it on.  Very comfortable I ran two miles with suit on no rubbing or feeling weighted down at all.  Highly recommend this suit to anyone
4	1392508800	Does what is says, will make you SWEAT !Wore under clothing for 2 snow storms, 2 days back to back. Starting weight 218lbs, down to 215lbs first day, down to 212lbs second day. Would definitely recommend.
4	1392249600	I ordered this suit couple of weeks ago. It arrived in time and looks very nice. I tried it on and it fits, a little too big but it is alright. Haven't used it in my soccer games but will when the season starts and I'm really looking forward to it. So far, it was a nice purchase, I will consider buying a second one just in case and for change if I need 2 during the week.
5	1392249600	5 star...love it fits like a glove..would recommend to all if your in to weight training or just simply loosing weight..
5	1392249600	the only thing I can see is heavier people than me having trouble getting out of the suit, I'm 5' 10&#34; and 220 lbs and the xl fits just right
5	1392249600	I really like this product.  I have a sleeveless sauna top in my locker at the gym.  The local boxing outlet that I bought it from years ago told me that they can't find anything like it any longer.  I was shopping at Amazon for something similar for home, etc., but could not find.  I decided to take a chance on this product based mostly on the other reviews.  Based on the price, it was not w/o a little apprehension.What you should know is that this suit is neoprene, not plastic, and that it is very well-crafted.  There is nothing cheap about it that I can see.It is one piece, which I really like, that may have been in the description, but I was actually expecting a top and bottom.  It has non-neoprene vented sections in the underarms and crotch.  At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this, since the goal is to sweat, but after trying the suit out, it really seemed to make sense.  I didn't miss sweating in those locations any more than I had to.My understanding is that the suit is designed and marketed by a champion wrestler.  That seems to make sense, i.e., someone who has used and gone through a lot of water-weight cutting suits.Sizing:  I am male.  I am 6'0&#34;, 190 lbs. (I'm typically 180 for the summer), 44 chest, size 33 to 34 waist slacks.  The XL size fits almost perfect.  I am guessing that I could not work out comfortably in the size L (which w/o the reviews and the sizing chart, would have been what I would have ordered).  If I could have this suit a little bit more snug in the midsection, that would be great, but I do realize that the company has to make a suit that will fit people that have more belly weight to lose than I.I do not write many reviews and would not give a 5 easily to any product.  As someone looking to cycle water weight out of my body for specific training objectives, I don't think that I could have bought a better product.  Thank you, Kutting Weight.
5	1392163200	This product fits like a glove. The shipment was very fast and the sizing table was very accurate. I would buy again in a heart beat.
5	1392163200	I wanted to really give this a try before writing a review.It does what its suppose to do and that is sweat! It does get hot. Putting it on feels like a scuba suit&#8230;which is very snug&#8230;.I have no complaints, better than the belly wraps and all of that&#8230;this was justperfect for me.
5	1392163200	Definitely helps to get Rid of Excess water....this is a great product for that. I'm pretty salty and have quite a bit of weight to loose this suit plus a vegan diet seems to be helping drop the lbs after stalling for a long period of time. Great Product I plan to order to other ones so I can wear them in the gym.
5	1392076800	I am not a 5xl in any other product xl or xxl on a bad day but the sizing chart is accurate.The product makes me sweat substantially more than without. After 45 minutes you are drenched.  I will use it more to see if it makes a huge difference but seeing that much sweat each time tells me it does what I asked.
5	1392076800	im so happy with kutting weight that I recommended it to everybody...doctors nurses almost everyone in hospital that I know...results are amazing...thanx KW...;))
5	1391990400	I previously used neophrene shorts and a waist belt but they didn't cover the underarm area (where I have flab) or the upper torso.  The sauna suit covers all my problem areas and makes me sweat like crazy!  The suit is very well made and works perfectly with the sauna hat!!  Thanks Kutting Weight for this excellent product!
4	1391990400	Looks good but works great I loved and I recommend this product if you want to lose weight. Ivan Escobar.
5	1391990400	This is perfect for a cardio workout.  So much better than using shorts or waist slimmer separately.  This is a &#34;must buy&#34;!
5	1391904000	The suit is well designed. As described in other reviews, a size larger than expected fits perfectly. Keeps body temperature regulated and provides support to muscles during exercise. Will buy again once the first one wears out.
5	1391817600	I use this in my sauna every day and I have cut 45lbs.  Very easy to clean too.  It is the most durable suit I have purchased in a while.
5	1391817600	Sizing is perfect and the suit works as it should.  Makes me sweat!!  I'm 235 and 5'7&#34;.  Alot more comfortable than walking around with a trashbag on.
5	1391731200	Thank you for this, I have been looking for something like this a long time as I use to wear something similar about 15 years when I trained.
5	1391731200	I have been able to fit in to outfits that I haven't worn in several years and I've recommended this product to my sister.  I love it and I give it 5 stars
4	1391644800	I like it! Works well and fits well. It can be a little difficult to take off because it is a front zip so it will take you a while to figure out the best way to take it off. Over all I recommend it. The item arrived within a well no problem.
5	1391644800	I loved my suit. I fits well and it does what it say it will. SWEAT. I have lost inches and I would recommend to anyone.
4	1391558400	I have been using this suit for two weeks, the sizing chart was spot on for me, I know some people said they had issues with that. As for working out it really hepls with warming up, im sweating with in the first 5 minutes. I feel like its working the way it should, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ia because I havent reached my goal yet.
5	1391472000	You should order one size larger than clothes size. It is snug. Fits under clothes. It stretchy so you do a great variety of exercises like yoga, biking or weight lifting.
5	1391385600	I liked the product a lot. I play volleyball sometimes and I wear it with no problem at all. The suit's material is strong enough to use it in many scenarios. Overall I recommend to use the suit in any physical activities. Keep it up!!
5	1391299200	Follow this size chart.  Works as says great for sweat and warmth  in winter....a. b. C. D. E. Fmw g.
4	1391212800	The suit holds up well, makes you sweat and makes your wife laugh.  What more could you ask for?  Buy at least one size larger than you think you need.
5	1391212800	I received the suit yesterday and it was perfect! Thanks so much. Sweated a lot and look forwards to losing fat with this suit. Since I still have the cold, I couldn't work out more than 20 minutes. However, I still made some sweat with the suit. I believe it's helping me get rid of all the toxins within my body. Thank you Kutting Weight!
5	1391212800	I purchased the Kutting Weight Neoprene weight loss sauna suit and I must say combined with exercise, this suit definitely makes you sweat and is very comfortable to wear.  It's too early to tell about weight loss; however, it is definitely going in the right direct as I feel much better after a workout on the treadmill.  If it helps, I have lost 5lbs in one week of using this product.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a lot of motivation thinking it's too hard to lose weight.  This item from what I've seen thus far will help you get there a lot quicker and not working too hard
2	1391126400	I'd really like to rate this higher but I currently can't do so. I ordered my size according to the chart. I'm 5'4&#34; with 36DDs and 46&#34; hips so I ordered the XL to ensure the right fit. The bottom portion fits just fine, but the top portion rubs all along my shoulders, neck and arms making it very uncomfortable to wear... even when I'm wearing a thick shirt underneath. I'm rather saddened as I was hoping to use this product on a daily basis, but I can't wear it for more than 5-10 min without it hurting me. I'd like to do something about this... but it's too much to try and buy a new one. Especially since I can't seem to get in contact with the seller.
5	1391126400	Awesome product. You can't put a price on these quality. I can't wait until I get the next upgrade up.
5	1391126400	I was somewhat skeptical about this product but I have had it for several weeks now and wear it religiously to exercise in.Now, I won't exercise without it! I feel so much better when I run in it. As s female I feel more confident when I run that &#34;everything&#34; is snug and where it is suppose to be. I'm not worried about that and I can concentrate on more important things. I have lost 5 pounds as well during these two weeks. I sweat like a pig, even my socks are wet from sweat running down my legs but that to me just means I had a killer workout. Thanks Kutting Weight!!
3	1391126400	Generally I wear a 1x to a 2x based on the designer, so I ordered a 2x to try this suit out for my workouts. I am not sure this was designed for women in the least. The crotch, arm pits, and waist are baggy, while the hips and thighs are snug, and the bust is terribly uncomfortably tight. It looks like I went from a DDD to a AA. o.O So after putting it on I gave it a test run doing DDR on expert mode. Just as a heads up, there is a slight added resistance from the suit, but you will adjust to it within 5-6 minutes. I would suggest doing some quick motor skill type warm up before doing anything too drastic that may result in problems due to a slight pull back from the suit (full contact sparing or fencing would not be suggested without testing the pull first).
5	1391040000	I purchased this for my son who needed to cut weight for wrestling. He loved it and said it's much nicer than wearing the usual 2-piece sauna suits. Easier to get on and off, more comfortable to wear while running, and easier to clean.
5	1391040000	My order arrived promptly and I really appreciate it. I was not sure about the size that I chose, however; it fit me perfectly. I love it, yet I had a hard time to take it off afterward. Something to consider when choosing the size. &#34;Maybe a size up&#34;. Ultimately, I am very satisfied with my purchase.
3	1390953600	I was excited to receive  this product and to my disappointment it fits too big on me.I ordered based on the sizing chart. It seems to be of good quality.
4	1390780800	I ordered a couple of different types of sauna suits.  I ordered both the Kutting weight neoprene suit and a fully hooded 2-piece heavy duty vinyl suit. I use the 2-piece vinyl at home (where I can look like a goof) primarily doing cardio. The Kutting weight I wear under workout attire to the gym. I am 6'1 210 and the x-large fits perfect. Nice quality suit! I like the way it helps my muscles warm up quickly and stay warm. No issue with creep or pinching. It certainly does not produce the voluminous amount of sweat the vinyl suit does but I did not want that extreme for 60 min lifting session where I would possibly leak sweat everywhere. Not too bulky but still heavy duty. I recommend.
5	1390780800	I just received my suit last week, but so far am delighted. When I dont get to the gym, I have to work out at home with treadmill and weights. The Kutting Weight suit is like the Xpresso version of a home workout. I bought plastic suits on and off for years for this extra 'shot,' of intensity for my workouts in the winter, but no matter where I bought them, or how much I paid, they always ripped within a couple of months at the most. You heat up more slowly in neoprene, but I think that is probably a better choice. I am glad I went ahead and made the investment in the more costly, longer-lasting and, I think, safer choice. I took the advice to order a size up and that was just right for me. Glad I read that in the reviews before ordering!
5	1390521600	This sauna suit is just what I needed. In the last year I have lost 90lbs by diet and exercise. I am still trying to lose 15 more lbs to get to 185lbs and needed a new motivator. I have used the belts and they were helpful but I have had this siuit for 2 weeks and have used it 8 times and have lost another 5 lbs (remember, thats a lot when you are closer to goal)I usually work out for 1.5 hrs and I am dripping crazy  sweat afterwards. It was worth the money.I wear a large shirt so I bought an extra large and it fits great. easy to move around in. If I lose another 15 lbs, I would by a smaller size if need be but I won't need to possibly until next year. Spend the money. It will be worth it!
5	1390521600	This suit is exactly what I wanted.  The fit is perfect. Not disappointed at all.  A recommended buy for others considering this item.
5	1390435200	I ordered the XL and it fits me like a glove: I'm 5'7&#34;, 185 pounds, 36 waist, DD cup.It's tight, but not too tight- just like I wanted, it's like molded to my body. I don't have to fear that it might crack (like other neoprene stuff) because there's this flexible mesh between the legs and at the armpits. I had a pair of shorts that just popped btw the legs because there was no mesh. So with this suit flexibility is awesome.I even wear it around the house while doing chores because it keeps me warm these winter days.I'm so in love with it, I'm at a loss of words!!!!No it's not cheap, but I wanted the best on the market and I'm happy I invested in it.Do yourself a favor and try it, u wont regret it!
5	1390435200	I bought this when I weighed 180 pounds. I now weigh 170 and the fit is really loose. I wish I had known that way I would have bought a smaller fit. Which I will do very soon. I lost weight and sizes so I guess I can vouch for this suit and say it works.
3	1390435200	I like the idea of having one piece suit to make me sweat and help me lose weight,  the description of the item wasn&#8217;t completely clear, delivering was extremely fast, the size was to big. Base on previous email I read, they keep saying that it run small to order one more size bigger, I&#8217;m usually a medium size in clothe, I order the large and when I open it, I try to put it on and it was huge on me, it was more like a big large man size not a female medium size (running small), as soon as I look at it I knew I couldn&#8217;t use it, one because it was too big it didn&#8217;t fit and two, because I know that I&#8217;m allergic to the fabric, if I were to put it on and just break a sweat I would have end up in the hospital with my entire body in a huge rash.. overall the delivery was very fast and nice pack seal box, to bad I had to return it&#8230;
5	1390348800	I run with this suit everyday and OMG you sweat like crazy! hands down one of the best sauna suits you can buy.
5	1390262400	I gave it this rating because the Kutting Weight suit really works. At first you may notice a slow down in your energy level or intensity, but you will still sweat. The slow down in intensity is just your body being challenged. The first week or so I noticed I was sweating alot but I wasn't keeping the elliptical on my regular pace with the same intensity. It seemed as if I was pushing harder just to maintain my pace that I had before I started wearing the suit. After a week I noticed it was the suit challenging me. Once I got pass the getting used to it I really started sweating it up.This is truly a great product.
5	1390089600	Looks better than other sauna-type suits I've seen. I especially like that it's made of neoprene and not the flimsy plastic material of most others. Short sleeves and legs make it easy to wear under workout clothes. Efficient in its purpose. I have no complaints with this product.
4	1390089600	I would recommend this product. It is far superior to the old plastic sauna suit you can buy for cheap. This product is a great fit and the added benefit was that it helps keep your posture during weight lifting. I cross train and this was just what I needed to get off the plateau I was stuck on.  I was not sure I wanted spend the money but it is worth it and I am glad I did, it is worth the price. Just a reminder to drink water because you sweat a lot wearing this. Happy weight loss.Bill
5	1390003200	Hey Amazon,I wear the suit when I go to the gym at Planet Fitness. When I didm;t have the suit after my workout I was sore and tights but with the Sauna Suit I notices that my muscles are not tight. I actually wear it now to sweat (of course) but also to avoid the muscle tension and soreness after my workout. I'm also breathing better. I feel like I'm using all of my lungs instead of part of my lungs. This suit has truly revitalized me and I am grateful that I bought it, I am thankful to the makers of this product and I am happy with my results.Best Regards,Andre Whyte
5	1389916800	Wonderful product. Great communication. Fast shipping. So far I've lost 5 pounds. For reference I am 4'11, 149 lbs, female and medium fits perfectly
5	1389830400	does what it promises to do. makes you sweat but you must get use to the feeling on your skin. it maybe itchy at first but over time it will subside and you will really enjoy the product. very comfortable to wear all day to get your sweat on. lol glad I made the purchase. will be ordering the shirt and pants soon.
5	1389744000	I've only got around to try this just now. I'm Female, 225lbs, approx 5ft 3in. I bought the 2XL which fits perfectly (just about). I used it this one time as I intended to use it, along with my TC10 for just 20 minutes. In those 20 minutes I noticed a lot more sweat all over. I wasn't drenched but a lot more sweaty all over, perhaps if I worked out more rigorously for longer than 20 minutes I would have been drenched all over. I love the fact that this suit covers my arms pretty much up to the elbow and my thighs almost up to my knees. I also liked the little cooling air that came in from those areas that were of the breathable material (ie: the crotch area) Overall I'm very satisfied and can see how this will be very beneficial with continued and more rigorous cardio workouts.The only thing I would change is the price. At $79.99 I believe it's a bit overpriced. I think even $10 off the price would make a huge difference.
4	1389571200	So far this has worked for me just how I expected it to. I only gave it four stars because I've been using it less then a month. I like that from the moment I put it on, I start to heat up. I have worn it while walking, doing cardio, and weights. I sweat 3-4 times more with it on, and it is a very comfortable fit. I feel like I have lost inches already, but I am waiting on my one month check in to verify... I am 5'6 290 & busty and the 6X is a great fit...
4	1389484800	this product dxactly as advertised.  buyer needs to review size charts however as sizes needed do NOT reflect clothing sizes.  Needs straps for easier removal.
5	1389398400	This is my 4th suit I have purchased. It works as advertised, I sweat more with it than I exercise without it.
5	1389398400	The suite was great... It fit real nice. I wear it with each work out and I lost 5 lbs first week eating right and excerising in my suite 5 days a week..... I usually only loose 1 or 2 without the suite with the same routine but the kutting weight suite has stepped it up very pleased with it
5	1389312000	Real weight loss after I received my sauna suit. My first workout I dropped 5 lbs and I was amazed. Every work out l lose more and more. The sizing chart helps a lot in choosing the right size for you.
5	1389312000	Bought this as a Christmas gift and my brother LOVES it. It doesn't have the plastic that rips like some. He likes how the suit seems to be able to move with him despite the confinement.
2	1389312000	When I bought and receive this item, zipper cover on neck was broken already.I could not use it. and if I use it, it'll come unfastened.But there is no issue to use this item as a sauna suit.I hope this issue is only my item.
5	1389139200	Title says it all. I followed the &#34;fitting guidelines&#34; and the product was just a tad loose - but close to perfect.Sturdy and as comfortable as this type of gear can be.
2	1389139200	Product run very small. I am a 2x (46&#34;-48&#34; waist) and after reading other reviews I decided to order the 4x. I could not breath once I had it on and removing it was beon believe, had to have my wife help get it off.
5	1389052800	Like many have mentioned, this product just works!  You will generate a sweat you may not be used to and really bring a workout to a new level.  You'll find you may have to develop some new habits during your workouts due to the suit working so well, such as I now typically hold on to towels during my workouts to prevent spraying sweat all across my living room.  I would suggest the first time you try the suit to take it slow so you can gauge how your body reacts, but once you do, dial it in because this product can really boost your workouts and provide amazing progress.
4	1389052800	I ordered a size up from a medium to a large after reading the advice of other reviewers.  Big mistake.  I'm 5'7&#34; and this suit was incredibley baggy in the arms and very droopy in the crotch.  From what I had read on other sites, this should be a very snug fit like a wetsuit.  I ended up giving this to my husband, and ordered a medium, which fit perfectly!  Once the sizing issue was resolved, this suit is comfortable to wear.  It does take a bit getting used to because it's not like regular work out clothes, and you will sweat a considerable amount more than wearing the typical shorts and a teeshirt.  I do like it and will definitely continue to wear it for working out.  I've already seen a difference in the smoothness of my skin, and of course, weight loss.
4	1388966400	Get you warmed and fast and you shed the sweat quickly. Pleased with my purchase and look forward to using it over time to increase metabolism also.
5	1388880000	I purchased the complete 4pc set of Kutting Weight geari am 6 ft 1 1/2 inches tall weigh 242 pounds and have a 48 inch chest and 43 inch waist.  All 4 pieces fit wonderfully.i ordered the 4xl sauna suit that works well by itself, and is easily hidden under standard shirt and shorts that people work out in.  to go along with the one piece i ordered the top and bottom.  i ordered the 4xl Shirt and the 2XL pants.  i have a 35-36 inch inseam and the pants were a perfect fit.  the 4XL shirt worn over the sauna suit compresses it and really helps hold in the heat and i even got comments on how much sweat i produced at the end of the workout.  One of the things i wasn't expecting but was pleasantly surprised about was the fact that the pants had pockets.  they are a good size and holds my phone close to my body so that i don't even notice it during my workout.  Last and not least the Neoprene Hat fit my head well and really held in the heat helping my body build up heat and produce some good sweat.Thankyou Kutting Weight for producing a Superb Set of weight loss gear. By far one of the best products i have bought and with proper care on my end plan on using for years to come.
5	1388880000	I gave this suit 5 stars because this suit will heat you up quick, You will retain  the heat throughout your workout. I would highly recommend this suit for weight loss or if you just want to maintain body heat though out your workout,  Great to use while working out even if you are NOT trying to loose weight this suit will help release the toxins in the body which is excellent for ones overall health, hair and skin. I also  purchased the Kutting Weight cap
5	1388707200	Doesn't rip.  Form fitting so it shames me into losing my gut...and butt!  What ever it takes to lose weight!
2	1388534400	I am female, 5'2&#34;, 126 pounds, ordered a size medium.  This one piece sauna suit fit my top, but was about 3 inches too long in the crotch.  I returned it.
5	1388448000	This suit will make you sweat your butt off!!!  Believe it or not, I wore this during my personal training sessions in the summer time.  A lot of people thought I was crazy but I got results.  The only minor complaint I have is that when you have to go to the bathroom, it is a huge challenge because the suit will stick to you.  It would be nice to have a zipper/flap or something making it a little easier to go to the restroom
5	1388275200	This product works as advertised. For accurate sizing go to the website. I purchased a small (I normally wear small) and it fits well. I really think it depends on your body shape, weight, and height. I found the crotch a bit low, but I have a short body. The one advantage of the low crotch is that my movement is not compromised during my workouts. The shoulder-line close to the neck is a bit big and ill-fitting but it is not a big deal to me. The customer service is excellent, I would definitely buy this product again.
5	1388275200	Extremely happy with this. It does what it says and the material is great! Awesome product I would definitely buy another one.
5	1388188800	I ordered this product based on the sizing chart provided. I'm 5'10&#34; and 225lbs. According to the chart I needed a 3XL suit. The suit was a size to large so I put on some extra clothing under the suit to get a snug fit. The suit performed as advertised as you start to sweat after a couple minutes of intense exercise. I used the suit when I would run. It works great in cold weather running. The suit did help me lose some weight. Make sure you hydrate when after intense exercise.
5	1388102400	Awesome, awesome product. I've had to start incorporating home workouts because these create a bucket of sweat at the gym. Slightly embarrassing to say the least. The size chart was accurate for me also.
5	1387843200	Definitely worth the money. This suit with regular working out and managing my calories has definetely contributed to my initial 30 pound weight loss. It does help aesthetically shed fat and water weight. It helps build an otherwise impossible full body sweat. I even bought a second one for the husband.
4	1387756800	I am happy with my purchase. The suit fits well and is well made. I use it everyday with my Insanity workouts and I sweat A TON! I followed others' advice and ordered mine one size larger. I do recommend this item.
5	1387670400	Finally! A product that works the way they say it will. I've had it for over a week now, and I'm very pleased with the results.
5	1387584000	The size I got was XXL.  I am 220 pounds female, 5 3.  I had to return this to get a XL.  I think the sizes are accurate. However, the fit was comfortable, but I feel as I lose my pregnancy weight, the XL would still fit at 190 pounds.
5	1387584000	bought a 5 XXL  the size chart was right on I weight 280 am 6 feet tall I wear t shirt underneath on my 4 mile walks its been in the 20 deg. outside my t shirt is nice and wet cant wait for warmer weather to sweat even more .
5	1387497600	I like the sauna suit very much.  I like it holds the heat in and it does not interfere with anything I do at the gym.  I ride the bike, walk, weights.  I like now that it is colder out and helps in keeping the muscles warm when leaving the gym after working out.  I would recommend this over the plastic suit
4	1387497600	Came in the mail quickly. It makings losing weight easier. I use it every time I work out, which isn't very much, but I still lose the weight.
5	1387411200	I just puchased the Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit. And I love it the water weight is coming off,100% better than the plastic suit.
2	1387411200	I wish this fit better.  I should have just gotten the shirt.  When I finally got it on and zipped up, it looked like I tried to put a coat on with the hanger still in it.  The shoulder part was up by my ears and the crotch part was, spacious.  I had to keep pulling it up at the crotch and down at the waist (to get the shoulders to fit).  That was a workout by itself.You will sweat when wearing this and that is what I wanted BUT then you have get it off.If I sized down, it would not have fit around my bust.  I have trouble zipping it as it is.I think this is a good product.  I would just do two pieces instead of a onesie.
5	1387324800	Works as well as expected. Very convenient and easy to maintain. Seems to be of very sturdy construction. Would recommend to others.
5	1387324800	I strongly recommend to buy one size up. I generally wear L  but bought XL size and it fits perfectly.
5	1387152000	I took my time to write a review on this product, if you really want to sweet and eliminate lots of water, you should buy this product, I lose 32 pounds and counting! nothing is magic, not only the product makes things happen, I combine this with the cream Sweet Sweet, 1 hour of daily cardio plus a healthy diet trying to keep it under 1600 calories per day, 9 weeks and 32 pounds less.I definetely recommend this product.a change that I would do to the design is to have neoprene under the armpit close to the chest instead of the mesh armpit feature, that would help us to burn more fat on that specific area faster.I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
5	1386979200	I am a lifelong practicing Full contact Martial Artist and as such am used to putting my body, mind and collective will to the test day in and day out. Tiered of plastics lasting maybe a workout or two before needing a replacement which was becoming costly in of itself, I began searching for a long term solution when I found Kutting Weight. I decided to take a leap of faith and ordered two body suits, for me and my wife and I tell you this&#8230; It was one of the best fitness decisions I could have made. The body suit put an added dimension to my workouts that is second to none; I have NEVER had to push this hard with plastics and or compressions. You want to drop water weight or have long term goals to burn fat this is how you get it done&#8230;For my birthday my wife surprised me with the top and pants and off to the races I went. From beginner fitness novice to Pro athlete you can&#8217;t go wrong with Kutting Weight. You will sweat more then you had ever thought possible and push through barriers which you thought you couldn&#8217;t go before.  You want to challenge yourself in your fitness journey then Kutting Weight is a Must&#8230;Angelo L. MelendezKutting Weight enthusiast
5	1386892800	Was already misty within one minute of trying it on. Returned the 4XL and got the 2XL. Fits better for a 5'3" 235lb female depending on where you carry your weight. Definitely will be using this with exercise and healthy eating. It's too soon for a proper review, but I still would definitely recommend over buying the plastics or buying the bands for arms, thighs and waist. Might as well spend a little extra and buy the suit.
5	1386806400	The best suit for work outs that i have ever used..it durable and tough for any workout fits great and is very comfortable... Really makes your sweat and makes any work out more intense... It is totally worth buying.
4	1386720000	Awesome product. I'm in training for a 10k run and it's great especially in the winter to wear under my leggings and sweatshirt. I'm a night runner so it gets into the upper 20s in the winter here so it helps keep my center warm. everytime I end up peeling the suit off and have sweat all over me and the suit is all wet. It's gross but good to know that it works. The neoprene does take some getting used to.
3	1386720000	I've used it four times so far (spinning) and I haven't really noticed a different in my sweating. I do feel hotter, just haven't noticed a bigger difference in the amount of sweating, nor in my metabolism after my workout in the suit.
2	1386633600	This suit is made for tall people. I am a female, 5'3&#34; and between 118-120lbs. When I wore this suit, from stomach area and down fits perfectly. Above that is too large. The shoulders extended up all the way to my chin. I bought a &#34;small&#34; size.I decided to test it out anyway. I wore it for five minutes while doing T25. My thighs started to feel a little uncomfortable because it rides up and it gets tight when it rides up. Actually, I felt very uncomfortable wearing the suit. I might be that type of person who doesn't like to wear such a thing when working out. I need my arms and legs to be free. Within the five minutes, I didn't even start to break a sweat anywhere within the suit. I still felt cold. I USUALLY start sweating within two minutes of T25. I also wear the McDavid Waist Trimmer when I workout normally, and that thing is way better than this sauna suit--it feels good and it makes me sweat A LOT very quickly.I ended up returning this suit and got a refund.One star for design, two stars for good material (same material as the McDavid Waist Trimmer on the inside).
4	1386633600	Very happy with the product so far.  You will definitely work up a hefty sweat. Very easy to move around in, so your workouts aren't affected.  I have been wearing it when using my rowing machine and the suit has an added bonus of offering me more padding in the butt area.
5	1386633600	It was a gift and the receiver enjoyed it! I would recommend this for anybody who loves hitting the gym and working out.
5	1386633600	Good suit and material. I'm 182 cm tall, 95 kg - size XL fit well. Not use yet in workout
5	1386547200	Works as advertised, and will get the sweat going! Perfect for wearing underneath tops/bottoms, and allows the flexibility required for any type of workout.
5	1386288000	love this item . tit's true to size. according to the chart they put up. You really do sweat a lot when working out and of course depending on the intensity of your work out. I've the reviews of people saying they sweat after a couple of minutes of having it on.. Not really true for everyone that all depends how your body reacts to heat. I my self have to have some type of  moderate movement  to start sweating. This item does keep the heat in. the different fabric in the crotch and armpit  area help you breath a little. overall . its worth the buying the item .I'm already thinking of getting the outer layer pant and long sleeve. If you eat right this will help you get results fast.
3	1386288000	First opinion of this suit is this, doesn't seem to be heating up as well as I would've liked but a benefit is that it's used as a pretty good girdle. While doing my work out I seem to sweat as much with or without the Suit on. There are 2  slight drawbacks. One is after your workout and you take it off the stickiness of your skin makes it hard to take the back of the suit off. Secondly and this is easy to correct, as soon as you get it, Turn will suit inside out. Check to stitchings at the junctions. Remove the bowls of thread that collect there so you don't get little nicks in your skin.
1	1386201600	You will sweat. But you'll sweat without it. The only reason it looks like you've accomplished more than you think you have is because none of the sweat gets to evaporate and just builds up on the shirt underneath. There are plenty of other sauna suits you can buy that are cheaper and better than this one if you really want one but I wouldn't recommend falling into the trap like I did. It is extremely uncomfortable. Do not believe the description that says &#34;it moves with you&#34; because it doesn't. If you try to move past the point the suit lets you go, it will dig into your skin and leave a cut or rash or the suit will rip(like mine did). And even though I got another one in return for the defect, it ripped again and I threw it out and gave up. Everyone who reviewed this must have left a review after their first use before they had to HANDWASH it. If you put this in the washer or dryer it will also rip. It gets more uncomfortable over time and I wish I could get my money back and spend it on something more important. Kutting Weight is an awful company and a scam.
5	1386115200	I wasnt sure what size to get, but based on the chart I needed and XL and the chart was right :) It wasnt tight at all it had some room in it still so it was very comfortable to wear and workout in. When I put the sauna suit on I was sweating within 5 minutes of doing jumping jacks! I love this suit
4	1386028800	These seem to run a little big, so if your ordering and think you need a large get a medium. These sellers need to put the sizing on amazon
5	1385942400	It is nice, lots of sweats...But the joint area needs to be improved for a more comfortable experience.Some people might be allergic to the smell or material. But I am overall satisfied.
5	1385942400	Love the product! Looking forward to purchasing the whole outfit. Love how I feel after my workout and I rest better at night.
4	1385683200	a sauna suit that does what its supposed to do ,,  works very good for me ,  good fit  good quality  of  material,..  i like it...
5	1385596800	I love this staff! It works for me! I am not sweaty person, but this one makes me sweat more then I expected:) and I don't like to be wet , so you don't feel like it, but when I take it off looks like I just from shower)
4	1385596800	kutting weight Best thing I bought from amazon so far. I bike 4days a week wearing this product.when I sweat it absorbe it.
4	1385251200	works great, a lil tight on the shoulders when i shadow box but other then that its perfect, wish i bought along time ago
5	1385251200	Great product, got here on time and been using it for Rowing on my Concept 2 D, also use it for Kettlebell sport on my LongCycle and it works great let's me move fine and it gets the job done making me sweet.
5	1385164800	I love working out with this item.  It was delivered very quickly.  Very practical.  It seems a lot more durable than what they sell in stores.
5	1385164800	Amazing suit, but future purchasers should visit the website for proper sizing info. That's what I did and ordered the perfect size. Great progress so far, 25 lbs in 2 months.
5	1385078400	love this product! works as advertised! would highly recommend it to everyone.thank you kutting weight for this great product!
5	1384992000	Great Suit! Fits perfect and is helping melt the fat away!Flexible enough to wear it when lifting and doing cardio.
1	1384819200	was excited upon receiving the product but unfortunately it didn't fit me at all so I can't really say how well it works. I am 5'3 and 120 lbs and went by the sizing guide but man was that thing way off. I'll have to return it and try maybe 2 sizes down if they have an XXS.
4	1384819200	I just got my suit in the mail and I haven't worn it yet but I plan to very soon.
4	1384732800	I've been using it for a few days now and think it's working great, can feel myself shrinking! It's definitely better than the plastic ones!
5	1384300800	I went right off sizing from the sizing chart and it fits perfectly. I am a tall female.  It works and I know I am just sweating water but I feel good for hours after I take it off. Hope this helps.
5	1384214400	Its very light weight considering it's neoprene. The size I ordered was kind of tight when I first put it on but after a week it was kind of loose a bit. Either I lost a lot of water weight or it stretch? I am wishing for water weight loss. I went snorkeling with it but not a good idea because it just feels awkward not having that buoyancy and I felt cold after about 15 minutes, so I don't know if that is relevant but just fyi.You loose water weight wearing the suit alone( working out in the privacy of your own home)but at the gym, if you put on a full hoodie and training pants as an outer layer, you can see the steam come out of your body after your workout while you remove the suit. I think it was a great buy.
5	1384214400	I got the suit a few weeks ago.I really like it alot.It is easy to get on and is comfortable.I noticed a lot more sweat when I wear it instead of my regular exercise garb.I noticed it helped with skin tightening as well.
5	1384041600	I'm the type of person that needs to work up a sweat and this suit has solved that problem. Within 2 minutes it's got me going. It's very comfortable. I am XL and took the advice from other reviewers to go 1 size up which I did and have to say I'm glad I did. Can't see how the XL would have fit me. XXL fits perfect. If your thinking of getting one I recommend it.
4	1383868800	I ordered the suit in the normal size I wear and was concerned later when I read reviews recommending to order a larger size.  It fits great, not too tight at all.  I love how easy it is to put on, the material is fantastic, it does the job perfectly.  The only thing that bothers me is the neck.  I feel it should have been cut a little lower but I just fold it in and can work out normally.  I am doing weight training and spinning and the suit does not bother me at all.  It is surprising that it does not smell bad after all that sweat.  Overall, an amazing buy.
5	1383868800	Great product. Well made and makes you sweat sweat sweat!! I am 6'2 290 and the 3xl was the right size.
5	1383868800	I love it. All your sweat comes out of the crotch and underarm areas, so make sure you're wearing the right cloths underneath.
5	1383782400	I decided to incorporate a sauna suit into my workout routine and started with purchasing one of those plastic ones from the large sporting good chains. I was amazed at the poor quality and how quickly they ripped (even though I was extremely careful). After about 3 of them I went on line and found the Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit.  I have been nothing short of amazed at its quality, comfort, and functionality.  I work out 5 to 6 times a week and wear my suit every time (even when I swim).  A low carb diet, a strong workout regiment, and this suit has been the key to my weight loss.  I highly recommend this suit, it has lived up to its name!
5	1383523200	I wore this suit to walk in and it made me feel really good after.  I believe that it really detoxifies the systems, and it definitely makes you sweat and heats up your body temperature.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking.
5	1383523200	I am 5'11".I have been trying the shotgun effect for loosing weight, by which I mean everything I can think of. I had lost 10 lbs from a max weight of 211 lbs. I was working very hard, it was very frustrating to be stuck on a plateau.The idea of the Kutting Suit seemed unhealthy to my imagination: overheating, maybe passing out, maybe getting sick, my imagination ran away with it. In the end, about 5 months ago, I overcame my apprehension and ordered a shirt and a suit.The suit is what I use 99% of the time. I bought an Xl, and it originally fit snug, perfectly.There were none of the problems I had imagined. I am fairly tough, so I am not recommending to do what I do. Just pay attention and you will learn your own limits. So, I have used the suit for over 2 hours at a time in the outdoor summer heat. I walked with some jogging (I would run, but have some leg problems). I have also used the suit indoors at the gym.I like to wear dark shorts and a short sleeve shirt over the Kutting Suit. After a workout these are sopping wet, but somehow my socks stay dry.The most uncomfortable I ever get is when it is a little chilly out, or there is a breeze, or the air conditioning at the gym.What happens is, as you are well into your workout, your sweat has built up, if you slow down too much you can quickly get cold. Normally when this happens, I workout a little harder. There have been a few times I was forced to quit.It seems to me that the suit does more than just make you sweat. It made sweat all over, including large areas where I had not formed any sweat for maybe 20yrs (I am just over 60). So, I think it opened up many pathways helping me to detox. The suit also seemed to raise my core temp some which not only helped with fat burning; but, I believe it helped my digestion.There have been a few times I meant to go to the gym, put on the suit, and did not make it out the door for a couple of hours. It surprised me that I was very comfortable and did not start sweating until I started my workout at the gym.So I have made it down to 181 lbs about 2 weeks ago. I could keep using the same suit, but I like the snug fit the suit used to have, so I am going to order a L. Not a bad problem. Love the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit.
4	1383523200	The suit works as promised.  I sweat a lot when wearing it.  My only complaint is in the sizing.  It is much to long waist for me and ends up bunching up around my neck and waist which is very uncomfortable. I do plan to continue to wear it just as long as I can tolerate it.
5	1383436800	This isn't my first time ordering something from the crew at Kutting Weight. I had ordered a shirt for myself and fianc&eacute; earlier in the year, and have nothing but good things to say about the product, and customer service.Customer Service: When I had place my original order of two shirts(one male, one female) back in July, I had received one female shirt and one pair of pants. An obvious mistake, which they took care of immediately, free of charge, and with the utmost professionalism. My fianc&eacute; emailed them and received a reply within an hour and had a shipping label ready to go. After sending the pants back, I got my shirt in the mail no more than a week later.Product: This. Thing. Works. End of story. The first time you put on one of their items you immediately feel yourself getting warmer. When working out be sure to have plenty of water with you, as you will sweat like a beast. 20 minutes of cardio with this is intense.Since buying the shirt I have purchased the singlet and can't wait to going with it.
4	1383350400	I am still in the beginning stages to see how this works.  I choose the man's suit for more room to move and I am glad I did.  Perhaps this will change results, but I still sweat in it.
2	1382918400	I'm 5'2'' and 110 lbs.Ordered an suit in XS and it didn't fit: the torso was way too long.Kutting Weight needs to come up with a petite version of it.
5	1382659200	I walk about 12-15 miles a week and this suit really does a great job. I have noticed the inches disappearing off of my waistline!
5	1382572800	I am glad I purchased this product.  It is easy to put on and take off, even when wet with sweat.  It adds a slight amount of resistance to movements.  I was looking to increase perspiration while exercising, this suit works for me.
4	1382486400	I did my research and got the correct size by going to there web site and using the sizing chart. This suit works well for me and for what I wanted it for.. to warm up and stay hot during my workouts. I am not interested in loosing a bunch of water weight only keeping my body warm during and after my weight training sessions. I feel that the heat is key to staying injury free. As for the suit quality there could be more reinforcement in the upper part where you try to pull off your shoulders.. I heard a tearing noise on my 2nd use of it and now ask for help getting it off my shoulders when I want to remove it, however if I need to use the restroom at the gym you need to slowly get it off or it will tear. Over all happy with this product.
4	1382400000	I was very pleased with the speed of the delivery as well as the quality of the products. I bought the whole system. The one piece and the pants and shirt and hat. I can tell a difference when I wear it all as opposed to only the one piece. I would recommend it and my boyfriend bougth one as well.
5	1382227200	I love this suit it is made well and durable, it has become a part of my routine. I ordered this suit through amazon the order was correct and on time , I recommend kuting weight products and using Amazon.
5	1382140800	It really really really really really makes you sweat. I'm male, 5' 10&#34; tall and 200 lbs. I bought the XL and it fits kind of tight. But hopefully, I will lose some weight soon and it will fit a bit better.
5	1381881600	Okay, I received my suit today and decided to go ahead try it on and go to the gym.  Let me first say the suit fit great!!!  No sagging, no squeezing, no tugging or pulling.  It fit perfect!!  I got on the elliptical and stayed on it for 45 minutes.  Sweat was pouring down my leg and I continued to stay hydrated.  Thereafter, I continued to sweat, to the car and into the house.  This suit is far better than any plastic bag I have ever bought. I can't wait to update in a few weeks of my overall success.  So satisfied and happy with my total purchase!!!!
4	1381795200	I recently purchased this therefore only used a few times however, I can say I'm pleased. It really helps you to sweat as you exersise so be sure to drink plently of water.I wasn't too sure about the size as I kept reading from other reviews to order two sizes up.  I decided to stick with the size chart (went by my weight).  I'm glad I did as it's a perfect fit.
5	1381795200	Good fit and quality, snug but still have great range of motion, the suit is comfortable, easy to clean.  I wear the suit under shorts and t-shirt when I go running and I'm sweating like crazy.  I also wear the Kutting Weight Hat.  Pay close attention to the sizing instructions, I'm 5'9" 185lbs and I ordered the large which is the right size for me.  I'm very happy with this purchase, and would definitely recommend to others.
5	1381708800	Great product, solid material and easily worn during workouts.  It is really worth the cost.  Also, very easy to clean.
5	1381449600	Excellent product & very we'll crafted. I have absolutely no complaints so far. A little pricey but youre definitely getting what you pay for unlike those plastic suits.
5	1381276800	I LOVE this suit! I am female about 5'6 & weighed 220 when I bought it. I am bottom heavy so I went with the 4XL and it fit (it kind of hangs low in the crotch area, but this size fits my thighs even though it's loose on top).  Let me tell you...I sweat a TON in this thing - EVERY time I workout.  I bought the pants a few months ago, but these make me sweat a lot more all over.  I've been jogging on the treadmill along with watching my diet of course and have lost about 12 lbs. in the last 3 weeks.I think this helps with weightloss directly and indirectly...1st, you lose wastes through sweat so you are detoxifying, but also it helps you workout longer by keeping your muscles warm and because you're sweating so much you feel like you are really accomplishing something which motivates you to push harder and exercise longer (it does for me anyway).  I was struggling to do 30-45 minutes on my workouts, but since using this I'm working out 45-60 min. or more...even a couple 100 min. workouts!!  Plus your muscles are less sore afterwards so you can workout more often. I use a heart rate monitor and the bodymedia armband and I do notice that I burn more calories with the suit. I have to workout at a much higher intensity without the suit on to get the same burn as when I'm wearing it....all of this adds up to INCREASED WEIGHT LOSS!You MUST stay hydrated though. I like to useScivation Xtend Intra-Workout Catalyst, Green Apple Explosion, 375 Grams.  I put some water in a blender bottle and add a scoop or 2  of the Xtend, shake it up, then pour into a gallon of water and chug it throughout my workout.  It's really good for replacing electrolytes and the natural salts lost when you sweat.  I drink about a half gallon during my longer workouts and afterwards I feel great!The only down side is that I will get a rash in the back of my knees from the moisture so I just wear a pair of spandex capris underneath and usually a shirt or tank top also, but this thing is worth every penny!  The quality is awesome, I put it in the washer every once in a while on the gentle cycle and it holds up extremely well plus it works so good...sometimes I get so hot that I have to unzip it and take my arms out of the top part so I can keep working out!!  (I use the treadmill at home so it's no big deal:)Buy it...you won't be disappointed!!
4	1381276800	Used the size chart and unlike wetsuits which run small in size this product runs large, so I exchanged it for the next smallest size. Fit is good and I am happy with the product.
5	1381190400	I was working out and not sweating enough. I bought this and it has worked as promised. A lot of sweating.It runs a Little big.
5	1381190400	Love it lose 6lbs in one week doing 30 minute cardio in the morning before work and love it without worrying about tearing like the regular sauna suit it's worth the money I spend...
4	1381104000	I put this suit on and run/jog/walk 5 miles in the AM before breakfast (fasted cardio) then have my breakfast, take on my day and in the PM after I pick up my son from school I go to the gym and hit the stair mill for 20 min. and weights (without the suit.) The result? I've been watching the fat melt off in puddles. I've gone from a size 14 to a size 8/10 in less than 2 months and am well on my way to getting back into my original size 4 (I'm 5'5" and medium frame so that's my normal size.)At 5'5" and a dress size 8/10 I wear the MED sized suit comfortably; meaning it fits nicely, not too loose and not too tight; I can run and move (squats, mountain climbers, lunges) in it without having to adjust anything. Prior to the suit I was never a big sweat ball; with this suit I'm a disgusting mess by the end of my run. What to wear under the suit? I wear underwear, a sports bra, and tank top under the suit (for support and to soak up all the sweat my body now produces.) Make sure to drink lots of water; the suit will do what it was designed to do (raise your temp thus speeding up your metabolism, hence making you sweat like crazy) it's your job to replenish your body with fluids. I will update this post again in November and again in December ... until then, if you're on the fence about this purchase ($80 is not cheap) I vote you get it. For me it changed everything, and for under $100 it may be the singe best investment you make in your health this year.
5	1381104000	Just trying it on I was sweating! I can't wait to see the results I will get when I wear it during my workout!
5	1381017600	First of all, the size chart was accurate and they fit well when I tried them on when they came. I was first skeptical about the size chart but they fit differently from regular gym wear. I burnt a lot more calories per session with the suit, but they will take some time to get used to. Just walk with a lot of water and be sure to consume it. I will recommend this product.
4	1381017600	Suit seems to be well made. Stitching is very good in all the stress areas.I look forward to it wearing very well and lasting a long time.
5	1380931200	I've used similar products years ago when I was a avid racquetball player, but time has passed and after several surgeries I don't have the body from back in the day. I found this item while doing some online shopping and literally jump at the opportunity to purchase it. I realize it's water weight that you can easily replenish, but you need to keep your muscles warm when doing any workout routine. This suit by far is the best thing for that purpose and the sweat, or water loss is a bonus. I like this item.
5	1380844800	AT first I did not think this would help but it does, My Besty I have it to tells me that it makes you sweat as long as you stay active, If you are using it to lose weight make sure you have an exercise regimen, It will make you sweat loads, She is quite happy that I gave her one of these because she has been after one for such a long time but thought the price was too much for it, But guess what, You can use this as a scuba diving suit as well, lol 2 in 1 isn't that great? The woman on the phone, I'm sorry I forgot your name geez she was so pleasant and helpful but unfortunately for me I will have to buy another one for my besty at a size 4xl because the 5xl is too big on her and she weighs in at 290LBS, in case you guys were wondering, I may have to ask if its possible to send it back to get a size smaller! it's been 1 week already my bssty has it and wore it once, BUT I did have a suit for myself and from my experience omgoodness it works well. I don't know what others are going to say about this but from a besty and a personal u se this suit is a good way to go for that extra help. Also buy the cap as it will make you sweat, All in all GREAT PRODUCT!!! and the people over at the KUTTING WEIGHT thank you for helping me! Oh btw guys, Kutting Weight pants will be too long if you are short lol. I hope they can get some sort of shorter length pants for shorter people :) So if you are like 5'5 they will be toooo long! the shirt is good as well! :) this is way better then those garbage bag suits! with this one you can also wash and hang up unlike the other one you have to really wash down to take the stinky out! Get this you will be quite pleased and you will notice that the water does come out FAST! lol... it's well worth the $80
4	1380758400	it is a great suit. made me sweat but the suit was too big I ordered ,2x  I weigh 205lbs. do go for a smaller size.
5	1380758400	Love it love it love it got this and can't stop wearing it lol Would get a size bigger but they do not have it
5	1380758400	I'm extremely happy with this product. First of all,  I go through a lot of the plastic suits which comes about 20-30 dollars the set. They'll last me about a month each and then they'll start ripping apart. Not the Kutting weight,  this thing feels like its made to get beat up, tight to your body so you can wear clothes over it, and it doesnt makes that annoying plastic noise when youre working out.  Did I mention it makes you sweat like crazy and for some reason I actually dont feel sofocated while working out...
5	1380672000	This sauna suit is an excellent product for weight loss.I have been using a neoprene high waisted short prior to this, which also works well. However, with this sauna suit, the upper thorax, back and arm areas also reap the benefits of this material while excercising.Cellulite definitly will disappear, skin becomes smoother and because of the increased metabolism while excercising, the benifits of weight loss become accelerated.I would recommend this to anyone who needs extra help losing both weight and cellulite.
5	1380499200	wearing this suit during my work out..yep, sweating like crazy! i would recommend this to all of you who trying to shed a few pounds.
5	1380153600	This is by far the best sauna suit I have ever used.  It molds to the body and does not restrict any movement.  It does fit snuggly but I think that just adds to its effectiveness.  I have used this suit pretty hard for the last three weeks while do a variety of workouts and there are no signs of wear and tear anywhere that I can tell.  I would highly reccommend this sauna suit especially if you use one on a somewhat regular basis!!
5	1380067200	My 10 year old daughter is overweight and started working out with me. I noticed that she doesn't sweat as much as she should. I purchased this suit for her and she loves it. This is the most she has ever sweat and she is definitely on her way to a healthy weight. Thanks for a great product.
5	1379894400	I have purchased this product from its official site. This product will not work by itself, you must workout. This should be the tag line of this product. This is a great product and I have been using from last 2 months. I lost a lot of weight because I do workout daily by wearing this. You need to do treadmill/walking for 45 min or YOGA in order to get results. Drink lot and lot of water while doing your workout.
5	1379462400	I'm very pleased with my purchase, still waiting for the long durability test, but usually already my suits will be torn up, so i'm happy and it looks great
5	1379462400	This is my second week using the suit and so far so good. It has been very helpful to  boost my sweating and speed up my metabolism. The product is well made, good materials were used on it and the finish is very good (no loose strings, no zip problems, etc.) The size I selected using the table, fitted perfeclty on me.Compared to other options (for example a suit built with bulk pvc plastic) this one is very comfortable and doesnt seems like a bunch of plated trash bags on you; actually it seems super pro in part because the vinyl details on it.Because the suit covers part of your arm and legs and cover basically the core of your body, you sweat from all these parts making the suit even more effective.Good product indeed.
5	1379462400	Honestly I had my doubts weather this product was for real or it was a rip off as I usually feel when I buy weight controlling products, but so far, I can say I am pleased with Kutting  Weight both in quality and in effectiveness I've never felt so much sweat coming out of my body like when I use Kutting weight neoprene weight loss sauna suit.I did my research before buying and yes, you need to go 2 sizes up from your usual clothing size, I am medium size, and bought XL size and fits perfectly.There is nothing better than buying from a manufacturer in which you can rely both on quality as in product effectiveness.As usual, AMAZON.COM is the best seller out there I will advise any one to buy at this e-comerece any time, I can only compare their customer service to APPLE.COM, there is no need to say more, but I would rank amazon 10/10. one of the best sellers of all time.thanks.
5	1379376000	All i can say it is Flawless product. You swet as hell and keep lossing weight on specific areas without noticing.
3	1379376000	It make you sweat fast ..The only bad thing about this is ...It's really difficult to take it off ...
5	1379289600	Excellent product to assist is losing weight. I don't only wear it to work out in, I also wear it when working around the house to get that extra calorie burn.
5	1379030400	I have been trying to lose weight so I bought a sauna suit from Walmart (You know those plastic ones) but the pants kept ripping. So I bought this suit. I. Love. It. I use it to do house work, work out and even on walks around the park with my dog. It is starting to feel a little loose (I'm losing weight yay!) and will probably buy one in a smaller size, I definitely recommend this suit. It is durable, comfortable, and best of all it works!
4	1378857600	Awesome suit! It definitely increases your metabolism because after wearing it a few times I even sweat more when working out without it. My one and only concern is there is no sizing chart and when you email the seller they try to approximate as best they could from the measurements you send them.... I probably could've fit a size smaller. But baggy & all it STILL does it's job!
5	1378857600	Wanna lose weight? Buy it. Used for natural bb show. Never sweated so much before. Easy to use. The real deal!
5	1378857600	Good sauna suit, better than others plastics suits. Keep your body temperature hot and is very comfortable. I will buy again.
4	1378771200	I just got my suit yesterday and couldn't wait to try it out in the gym.  My problem now is the sizing.  I got a medium based on the size chart but it is running big on me.  Is there a way to exchange and get a size smaller?  Ive emailed Cazzy with Kutting Weight and am awaiting a response.  Will update this review if I hear back from her.
5	1378684800	We love these suits! Great for those with joint discomfort or stiffness, and provides another dimension to any regular exercise. Those who complained of the fit, these are made to fit a variety of sizes, and are based upon a weight range to ensure the best fit possible. If you are looking for a custom sauna suit, this isn't it, but then, I'm not sure they're even available. Of all on the market, this is the best overall.*I'm a personal trainer, martial artist, and fighter. I have used this product for everything from warmups to weight cuts.
4	1378684800	I have used this suit for 3 to 4 work outs.  I do sweat alot.  I purchased a XL I'm 5'7 and I weigh about 188.  I will also purchase the L since it is not a snug fit.  Overall this is a good product.  Just make sure you drink plenty of water during and after.  I'm giving this a 4 star because it is not as snug as I would like.
5	1378512000	Works great....got so many compliments! Can't wait to get another one as I loose weight. Great investment, especially if your just beginning a new exercise regimen.
5	1378425600	this product is great, perfect, I can not ask for more, delivery was fast, the product without any damage i'm happy. greetings from El Salvador.
5	1378339200	This sauna suit fits very well and is comfortable.  Have just started wearing and seems to be doing the job...
5	1378080000	My metabolism is such that I do not typically sweat in the gym. I like to sweat! I feel it cleans out my pores and the heat generated increases my internal temperature so that my metabolism is running at high speed is for 5-6 hours after a workout. In the past I have used cheap plastic weight loss suits which are bulky and not all that attractive at the gym. The Kutting Weight sauna suit is made of neoprene like a wetsuit, so it is form fitting and does not show under regular gym clothes. So now whether I am doing cardio or weights, I am sweating up a storm and I LOVE IT. Thanks for a great product.
4	1378080000	I bought a size medium because I weight 130 lbs 63' tall. I should've select a size small because medium was a little too big for me. I have plenty of room on my stomach. I usually work out about an hour at the gym on stair master or elliptical to see result.  Now, I go running for 2 miles and maybe on elliptical for 15 minutes, I'm sweating so much. I cut my workout time in half and get the same result. I only wear the suit once or twice a week because you have to drink a lot of water. You can get headache from dehydration just wearing the suit. You don't need to put it in the washer, just rinse in water and hang it dry.  This suit is not just loosing water weights. Its also condition your body to take heat. When you run your body heats up, so wearing this suit will definitely help you keep up with long run.  Overall, I will recommend to my friends.
5	1377993600	Normally when I go to zumba I sweat like any other person would.  I went to zumba in my suit and I was amazed by the difference it made. I had unintentionally made a puddle of sweat . I was completely imersed in sweat. I would honestly recommened this suit to anyone.
4	1377820800	The size reviews are correct.  Order 2 sizes over your usual, perhaps even 3.  I'm 5'10 about 225 lbs and I could stand to lose some weight.  The 4Xl fits on my a little snug.  Also, I don't actually believe this is a &#34;weight loss&#34; item, but it makes you sweat, so if you're looking to sweat, this will absolutely do the trick.  One thing I've noticed is the sweating while wearing this thing, always with a shirt and pants in between, I tend to break out, which I never do with a regular workout.  I don't give it a strong recommendation, but it's a pretty cool item if you want to sweat more.
5	1377734400	Because I am planning to run a marathon Singapore, I wanted a product that would help simulate the heat and humidity of Southeast Asia.The product came quickly, and was a great fit (I just used their sizing chart).  The size I got was about one size larger than what I normally wear.The suit is comfortable and you can easily wear shorts/shirt above it while you train.The suit works as advertised and helps store heat making you sweat a lot.  I was already sweating before I even got outside for a run.All in all, its a great product and I would get it again.
5	1377734400	Five stars because it works!By the end of my workout I am drenched ~This product will not work by itself, you must workout.
5	1377561600	Great Product and really works .. The size of suit is quite bigger than what expected but it is alright
5	1377388800	Wanted something to help me sweat more and lose some of this water weight while I am doing my daily 3 mile walk. I wear the suit twice a week rotating days. Each time I wear it I lose a ton of stored water and burn more fat. I had the suit about a week and a half and already down 5 lbs. but that is also is attributed to excercise and eating healthier and drinking plenty of water.
4	1377302400	This thing will really make you sweat alot! So just be ready to have your workouts become x2, you will sweat!
4	1377216000	I like that fact that this sauna suit traps your sweat and it doesn't allow your sweat to drip out of the suit like most traditional PVC sauna suits.  The suit covers your entire upper arm area; which allow you to shred water weight in that area.  The purchased a size large and I'm 176 lbs and 5'8'. It fits well; but it kind of baggy in the midsection.  Overall, a better sauna suit than the traditional PVC sauna suits.
4	1377216000	It really does help with weight loss and muscle tone however it did fit perfect in some places and a bit large in others
5	1376956800	I've tried some of the older plastic/Mylar style and they work although they usually don't last very long and are nowhere near as comfortable and with this cutting suit you can still box/cross-fit/grapple and do all over conditioning work. It's all around a great piece of equipment.
4	1376870400	Love the wat it fits and its  flexible. I just wish the neck line was cut lower or maybe cut in to a V neck.
5	1376870400	I will buy all the set.It really works and make you sweat , this is my 2 week since I get it and I already lose 3 Pounds.Stylish and Neatbuy all of themregardsHG
5	1376784000	I bought 3 suits for my fiancee, her sister, and me. We all love the suit as we use while we all work out to Focus T25! It does great to keep your muscles warm as I have done Insanity and notice a huge difference in how my muscles feel after the workout then when I didn't have the suit.....it is pretty durable as we use it 5 days a week! We also love how much we sweat while wearing the suit! I think my next purchase will be the 2 piece suit!
5	1376784000	This is a well made, light weight neoprene wet suit.  I've been using it for 5 days while in the gym and have found that it definitely kicks up my workout a notch or 2!!  I sweat like an animal and seem to burn more calories as well.  Hopefully, it will be for sale in a few weeks when it becomes too big for me!!
5	1376697600	Love this sauna suit! ive NEVER sweated so much in my entire life!! I worked out for about 2 hrs and i was dripping sweat.. literally running down my arms.. and lets not talk about the drenched under clothes... I really feel the calories dripping off me!! Makes me want to work harder in the gym! i even walked home (1 mile) with it on to keep those calories burning!! I love this suit butttt.... I am 5' 4&#34; 185..Mostly large thighs and butt..Little stomach .. i originally purchased a Large which was extremely big!!  I mean my husband couldnt even fill it in!. Returned it and got the Medium which fits like a glove!!  I honestly love my sauna suit.. its inspired me to just keep going to see great results!!
5	1376611200	So far so good!  I purchased the small being a female, 5" 2" 125lbs, hoping this suit will last me til I can fit in the XS ;-).  The stitching is pretty strong even after working out with my 30 day shred videos.  I've only used this suit for 3 weeks and have already lost 3 inches off my waist!  So glad I purchased it!  FYI I wash mine in the shower after a sweaty workout.
1	1376352000	I can't believe so many people have fallen for this worthless product. A sauna suit's only function, is to make you sweat. What regular people like yourselves don't realize is that sweating doesn't mean losing fat, it means losing water weight. If you workout hard, you're gonna sweat without a sauna suit. The only thing it does is make you weaker and force you to drink more water, and if you fail to do so there could be harmful side effects of being dehydrated.Quit the excuses and work hard in the gym. There are no shortcuts to losing weight. Eat healthy, do lots of exercise.So please, I am begging you. Do not waste your money on this. Losing weight is hard work, for most people. Accept that fact and get going instead of looking online for magic products which don't exist. Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. Get your priorities straight.
5	1376265600	I am plus size women. The suit fits me perfect. I sweat double the amount whenI wear It to the gym. I am about a size 16. So I bought the 3x to make sure it would fit. I can't wait to buy a smaller size because it really does work. My trainer notice that I sweat more when I wear it. Its worth ever penny
5	1376265600	i ordered the kutting weight sauna suit and i LOVE it!  i was soooo happy to be able to find a plus size sauna suit that didn't look like a trash bag that would tear!  lol  Plus size people like to exercise too and i'm glad the creator of the sauna suit thought of that!  Amazon is the best when it comes to ordering ANYTHING.  You can track the item and it gets to you in a timely manner.
5	1376179200	I purchased the body suit and all I can say is Wow! I use it when walking/jogging in the park and the amount of sweat is incredible. I look forward to shedding inches.
5	1376179200	I got the product fast with the shipment coming to APO AE. The fit is really great starting Monday I will be working it out in my suit! Thanks for a wonderful product.
4	1376179200	Or Garbage bags as I used to call them.  This suit is basically a scuba suit that breathes better.  It fits well and goes perfectly under gym clothes.  The only complaint would be the neck is wide and doesn't sit well.  Under a shirt it bunches a little but its not an annoying once I get running or exercising. All in all I will defiantly purchase a replacement whenever I need one and recommend it..
4	1376006400	I start using the body suit and i notice that i sweet more then usually, i do recommend it but also consider buying a size smaller the your  size , they run big.
5	1375920000	I ordered my suit and received within a few days. The product is well made and fit nicely.  Sizing chart was right on.I used the product and it did exactly what it said it would. Worked out for 30. minutes. Just starting but built a good sweat just what the doctor ordered.I am excited to see progress
5	1375833600	This is the first time that I've ever bought this type of product so I did not know what to expect.  I found it to be very comfortable and it allows me to excercise without feeling restrained.  Thanks!
4	1375833600	Well I bought this suit to supplement my workouts and I have to say it is a great suit- top notch all the way. The ONLY thing I can say about it is that (because it's unisex) the torso is a bit long. I have a short torso anyways so I probably should have ordered the MED size but the bust on the LRG fits perfectly with a sports bra... SO if you just have an average bust and a short torso (like myself), order a size down. Other than that, worth the money!
5	1375747200	Best suit i bought so far! Fits perfectly and makes you sweat like crazy. Highly recommended. Excellent texture and stitching.
5	1375747200	wow, this suit works great, the first 20 minutos i started using it i was already sweating, my hands and arms started to sweat.  when i finished my excersise y was soaking wet, even my feet and socks were al wet.  i like that it covers your entire body. a bit of advice, if you are planning on using this suit for running or outside activities be sure to use it early in the morning or late at night because the sun can really make the temp to increase. other thant that works fine.
3	1375488000	Just got the sweatsuit and it appears to be working, I'm not drenched in sweat but I do think I burn more calories with it. The only thing the suit is not snug in all places I went by the chart and got a 2xl however I may have been able to fit in the XL
5	1375401600	To me is ruins kind of big. I had purchased a xl and had to return it for an large.
4	1375401600	Oh sweet sweat!!!  I hardly ever sweat no matter what I do.  I've had a few medical problems the past few years & had to really slow down.  This made me put on weight. My son told me about this suit & I bought it.  I defiantly have burned a lot of calories using this suit. I've lost about 35 pounds since I started using it so it's really working.  Only problem is it's so hard to use the bathroom with it.  Peeling off is ok but putting back on isn't.
5	1375315200	High quality, very comfortable allows movement with out feeling like something is plastered to your skin, most of all it makes you sweat... A lot
5	1375228800	I'm extremely pleased with the Kutting Weight sauna suit I purchased. The quality is excellent, the fit is great! I even wear it while cleaning the house. I would definitely recommend this suit to a friend.Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit
5	1375228800	It was comfortable and effective ..I used it during kickboxing class and sweat all over the place!! :) and def adds more heat during weight lifting ...I want to get a couple so I have them ready to go every day!
5	1375228800	Most impressive exercise enhancement product in my suite of products.  Was initially skeptical about the some product claims; however, upon my first use with one of my standard 45 min routines experienced significantly improved results.  My abs and thighs, the focus areas for most females, were noticeably more defined, results achieved only after weeks of the same routine.  After just 3, 45 minute routines have lost 3 inches from my thighs and 2 inches from my waistline.  This suit is worth every single penny, if you want to turbo charge your workout get the Kutting Sauna Suit, you will be very pleased with the return on your investment and on the road to better health!!!
2	1375142400	I am really disappointed in the product it does not make me sweat as much as other products i have tried before its really well made but i don't know if i have a defective one or what.it did arrive fast so there's that but honestly for 80 dollars i was hoping for a lot more.
5	1375142400	Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suitI ordered all 4 products, sweatsuit, pants, shirt and hat. All products arrived in a timely manner and impressed me with the workmanship in both fitting and design. At 290 I ordered the 5x sweatsuit, and 6x shirt and pants. Each fit me perfectly. I have only had the opportunity to use them for two workouts at this time. To date I have never met the 5lb loss in a work out. First workout was 3lbs, and the second 4lbs. I feel comfortable wearing the items in the gym and while out on the bicycle. I look forward to being able to order these items in smaller sizes in the time to come.I would recommend these products to anyone desiring a quality sweatsuit.
5	1375056000	If you want to cut weigh this is the best item to buy.  I believe how great it works.  Sweat everywhere.
5	1374969600	This product fits like a glove, it is easy to work out in.  The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Thank you.
5	1374883200	Perfect purchase, I ordered it to large, didn't have a problem at all about the return.  I reordered the correct size and enjoying my purchase/product.
3	1374796800	THE SUIT  IS VERY WELL MADE AND DURABLE... BUT I DIDNT GET THE SWEAE THAT  I GET FROM THE VINYL
4	1374710400	I got the suit and it fit great. I definitely like the w extra sweat in my workouts I have been using for a week now only 3 x and starting to see good results. The only problem I had it took them 4 days to knowledge my order. But other wise they were great and rushed my order.
4	1374624000	I finally received this sauna suit it was slightly big on me in certain area's but I wore it and it did cause me to to sweat, so that's a good thing. I will see in a few weeks if it does what it claims it can do for me.
5	1374624000	The suit just works ! Im 6'1, 210 lbs and I wont go to the gym without it. Proceed to the checkout and buy it ... 600+ reviews cant be wrong !
5	1374624000	This is a great suit to work out in.  I highly recommend it.  I will definitely buy another when the time comes.
5	1374624000	I've tried all the cheapo ones you get at Academy and other local sports shops. They usually last about 3-4 workouts then their cheap plastic just tears to shreds. $15.00 - $20.00 wasted. I went looking for a better quality suit and found Kutting Weight. It cost more than I thought one might but it is well worth it. It's like a thin wet suit for scuba diving - very strong, flexible. This thing should last for years, even with the abuse I put them through. Great product!
5	1374537600	I'm 5'1 , 120 ponds and female. The suit is a little long for me but it does work as promised! I ordered the X-small size.
5	1374537600	This is an amazing product.  I just wished I would have ordered my correct size.  Some of the previous reviews indicated that the product was on the smaller side.  I think it depends on your body type.  I got a size larger and it turned out to be too big, but it works just as great.  I highly recommend this product is you are looking to sweat a few extra pounds off.
5	1374537600	I am a female, 5'5 and currently 215 lbs. I typically wear 2x t shirts, sz 18 jeans. Bust: 38 C, Waist: 47 in. Most of my weight is in my mid section and bum. I ordered an XL.  I'm not a body builder or some fitness fanatic. I'm pretty squishy and working on living a healthier life style. I found the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit and figured I'd give it a shot. I was unsure what size to purchase because a lot of people said to order a size up. I contacted the seller and he was able to suggest the correct size (XL). So to be safe, I'd suggest contacting the seller. He responded within a day. I was really nervous it wouldn't fit but once I put it on, it was the right size and great quality. The torso is a tad bit long but it isn't bothersome. It will make you sweat a ton!I'm very happy with the results I've had in the past week and I will update this review in a month.I took photos I was hoping to post but it looks like the seller doesn't allow uploads. I'd gladly upload my photos so that other squishies can see how it fits lol! ;P
4	1374537600	This outfit will make you sweat!!! It's like doing bikram yoga, only you are doing cardio/strength training, so be sure to keep drinking water as you are naturally exercising.  (Not hating on yoga, it's just not the same as cardio).  It definitely does what it sets out to do, make you sweat, and I love the cold shower after, I do feel like I am cleansing crap out of my body.  I gave it one less star just because everyone's bodies are hard to fit, so it's a bit funny shaped on me, but it is the right size.  Of course I wish it fit perfectly, but I remind myself that the purpose is to sweat and not look shapely.  Ha.  Anyway it's a great product and I definitely recommend it.
5	1374537600	It will enhance your work outs (absolutely). The combination of my 20 min spinning session with this suit makes me sweat more than usual. if you're looking for some exercise suit to complement  your routine this is perfect, the suit increases the body temperature, meaning your body will burn calories faster. Highly recommended!
5	1374537600	Great product will have you losing weight in no time if you wear it at least 3 to 4 times weekly
5	1374537600	Ordered the 4x size and it was a snug  fit. I recommend ordering two sizes up to get the fit you want. Apply SWEET SWEAT to your skin then put on some tight nylon undies and shirt before zipping up. Do not stand in direct sunlight while wearing or you will feel like your in a microwave oven. Stay hydrated the whole time you have it on! YOU WILL LOSE THE INCHES! 20 to 30 minutes of cardio is quite enough. Don't forget the matching neoprene cap to shrink your head to!
5	1374451200	Great product, I use it everyday now. Durable yet light weight, totally flexible but your body is still able to breath. Lose weight = Sweating! Thanks!!
5	1374451200	I'm going to get the pants and jacket when I get the chance, meanwhile this is one of the best sauna suits I've ever purchased!!!!
5	1374278400	I love my jutting weight sauna suit, no more using plastic wrap for me. It covers perfectly all the target areas where I want to lose weight, even my arms which is great, when I use it I have never seen so much sweat and fat burning on my work out, I bought a small size and it fitted good, you feel very hot when you are working out but that's why I love the size I just open it up as much I need for ventilation, when at home I don't need extra clothing just use this sauna suit and that good enough is like you're dress to workout, you might wanna use a pair of pants if you are planing using it at the gym though
5	1374278400	I ordered this suit with the hopes of performing a miracle before my trip to Georgia to see my boyfriend coming home from Afghanistan. I've packed on more than a few lbs since he's been gone. The shipping was good it arrived in less than a week. Though I am spoiled to amazon's 2-day prime shipping. The problem was the suit size I ordered, it was a large but it was too big. It was a boost in the ole' self esteem but bad timing for my last ditch effort to shed a few lbs. I returned the product (had to pay for my own shipping). I guess my biggest issue is the sizing I may have over looked it but I wish there was/or I saw, a sizing chart to make sure to get the best fit. The suit looks like it will be a great help but I won't know for sure until I get the new one.Update:Upon returning the last suit the seller emailed me asking if I needed to exchange for a different size or if I wanted a refund. I appreciated this because you don't get many many sellers checking on you.  I decided to wait until until I returned from traveling to reorder so the seller issued a fast refund.  I really wanted to try the suit so I made another purchase this time in a Med. The suit arrived in a couple days. It was 2 days I believe because it arrived with some prime items I ordered.I must admit that this suit is the real deal. The size is perfect for me. I first wore it under my clothes while doing some yard work. I just wanted to get a feel for the suit. Within a few minutes I felt warm, just cutting my grass produced a sweat as if I was working out in a gym.  I am so motivated to lose weight with this suit. My starting weight was 184 a little less than 2 weeks of working out I see 172 on the scale. I am soooooo happy to see these results.
5	1374192000	This sauna suit is easy and very effective at quickly reducing any excess water weight.  I took another reviewer's advice and washed the suit while in the shower after my workout then threw it over the shower curtain rod to dry--easy.  The Kutting Weight sauna suit is of good quality and shipped quickly.  I highly recommend this product!
5	1374019200	BUY SIZE BASED ON YOUR WEIGHT!! MAKE SURE TO BUY NEOPRENE SHAMPOO!! I emailed kutting weight B4 i got the suit to find out which size 2get...Im female, 5'1 & 189lb... they emailed me back within 8 hours and said i needed the Large Size..

Im going to be wearing this suit all day everyday as this is arizona and it gets so hot here i should sweat profusely! I'll be walking my dog nightly..  School starts the first week of august which is when ill be starting my morning walks with my dog... so im hoping that will help with the weight loss...Im not going to be dieting just starting walking..... so hopefully this review each time i update will help others decide if this review helps them decide if they really want this suit to help them meet their goals...  I'll Update with results weekly! ;)**UPDATE**LoL I know its soon to update but ive been wearing this suit since i got it.. and i just got my new hubcaps/wheel covers for my minivan in the mail today also cause i lost one and therefore had to replace them all.. so i just went outside to change them and of course they are fairly easy... but omg by the time i was done.. i was dripping with sweat... i had to take off my glasses cause there was sweat streaming down my glasses went in the house and grabbed a towel and washed my hands cause they were all black and still right now i can feel sweat inside the suit and im all warm still dripping... this suit must work cause i didnt do very much outside to sweat like this... lol im so excited now!!!***update***Been a few days now.. i have worn the suit only twice now... all day the day i got it.. and all day today... mind you i have not been working out, and have not been walking other than to the neighbors and such and playing with my kids out front... weighed myself the day i got the suit and it said 189... weighed myself after i just took the suit off today and 184... dont know why. dont care, :) ive been wearing a a-shirt (tank top cami like) under the suit and a tshirt and fleece pj pants over the suit... so far i like what its doing...
5	1374019200	I read many reviews and decided to purchase this suit. It works just as stated. As far as sizing, I got a medium, which is what I normally wear in tshirts and it fits great. No need for one size up. It's easy to put on and take off as well as easy to clean. Just take in in the shower and then let it dry in the shower or outside. You work up a great sweat!
5	1374019200	Great product.  Put it on when it work with my personal trainig for one hour 2 or 3 time per week and I have lost inches and pounds in my waist and stomach area...a hard area for me to lose the fat...but it works
5	1373932800	Love it it working for me losing inch like crazy recommendation. To used it it a great buy  I want to order one for my hubby to&#128522;&#128522;&#128522;&#128522;
3	1373932800	At first, I looooved this sauna suit and wore it every time I worked out! It fits great! But after about 2 weeks, noticed a rip in the suit and now unfortunately can't use it anymore :|
4	1373932800	Walked on treadmill and never sweated as much. Felt great.  I got a size bigger per past record and it fit great.
5	1373846400	I prefer the long sleeve shirt and long pants but this product is just as effective. Excellent.  Will make you sweat like crazy.
5	1373846400	This one is an amazing suit. The first time I used it I sweat like crazy my short was wet. It was funny. I have not used too much the suit because i got injured but I m waiting for use it for every workout I do.
3	1373846400	I like the suit, just waiting to see results! I sweat but not more than usual.  Waiting to give it more time to find out if it was worth it!
5	1373328000	This product does exactly as advertised.  I have lost a few pounds but I am not sure if it is the product or if I just cut back on eating all that junk.  Mostly likely it is a combination of both because at one point I was  working out and not losing any weight.
3	1373328000	The suit does it's job!  Getting the right size is the issue for me.  I was informed to go with a larger size and I'm glad I didn't.  It would have been too big.  I would also like them to make variations of the product but as of yet they do not.  I don't need the sleeves nor the thigh covers. I would have thought that they could make it better in areas but it is the best I have found out there as of now. I have had to cut and modify the suit to suit my needs.  Kutting weight should contact me on how to make a better fitting suit.
5	1373241600	SWEATING HAS NEVER FELT SO GOOD !! I AM LOVING MY SAUNA SUIT IT'S DEFINITELY HELPING ME REACH MY GOAL WEIGHT!! ALSO PLEASE DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS
5	1373241600	First of all, the customer service with Kutting Weight is excellent.  I emailed Cazzy per the instructions to ask for help with sizing.  I'm a female, 5'2" - 153lbs.  She recommended a Medium and it worked out perfectly.  I really thought it would be too long in the torso as others had mentioned this in previous reviews but it wasn't an issue.  I'm still a newbie with the suit having just worn it once, which was today.  I just got back from a 15-20 minute, normal pace walk and am dripping wet inside the suit.  I'm sitting in the suit for a while just to cool down and hopefully sweat some more before I peel it off.  I think I will really like this thing.  I promise to update my results as time goes by.  Right now, I'm very optimistic.First update - 18 days since I first received delivery.  I'm down 4lbs and am happy.  I've crossed a big line in my mind because as I've gotten older, my pounds love me more and more and just are so reluctant to leave me!  Today . . . for the first time in probably eight years, I am back under the 150 mark and saw the beautiful number of 149.8 for the first time.  I use my sauna suit on the treadmill and probably go at the rate of 2.2 mph with an incline between 1-3 for 20-30 minutes.  I did it 4x this week. The difference for me now is this sauna suit.  I have walked and walked and walked outside since April.  10,000 steps a day often.  My starting weight mid-April was 164 and I feel I have had to fight for every pound vs my younger years. I stayed between 153 and 155 for almost 70 days.  I feel I'm being more efficient with my workouts now, not by what I'm doing differently but by what this sauna suit is doing.  True!
5	1373155200	One word - AMAZING!  To say that you sweat would be an understatement.  I am totally drenched when I take my suit off - totally and I'm just power walking with walking poles.  I love it.  I've been following my own diet and exercise program and at 1st the suit was too snug.  After about 6 weeks it was just right.  Your body temperature does raise and you will feel it.  At 1st I was wondering what was going on.  It is expensive but worth it.  I only wonder what I'm going to do when I'm ready for the next size down. The shipping was immediate, it must have been shipped out the same day I ordered it.
4	1373068800	I like the suit, it is tight but comfortable. I wear it to  walk the dog. We do about 3 miles.  I'm soaking wet  when I take the suit off. Loving the suit. Plan to do cardio in the suit later.
5	1373068800	I bought the shirts! There made well and comfortable I get a great workout and greeeeat sweat! I'm a personal trainer and recommend it if you want to loose weight and feel great!!!
4	1372982400	does make u sweat but also makes u get really hot really fast u have to keep drinking water... it a good item i like it but it all depends on the user
5	1372982400	This is by far my best buy on Amazon!  Great quality, easy to clean and it makes my workouts more challenging.  I will definitely look for more products from Kutting Weight. Get it you won't be disappointed.
5	1372896000	I Would definately recommend this product. I was excited when I received it, that I had to try it. I first weighed myself to see if I would actually lose anything. At first I was skeptical but when I had only worked out for just 30 min I thought what the heck,  I'll weigh myself and to my surprise I lost 2 1/2 lbs in jst the 30 min. I've been using this product everyday and can feel the results.
5	1372896000	Great product. Also can be used as a layer for cold weather running. I have the suit also...both quality products.
5	1372809600	Purchased XXL at 200. Worked great for losing weight. 3 months later after sticking to a sensible diet and working out every day I weighed 170. Purchased XL for maintaining weight. PS: at 51 I have some pain in my shoulders but the suit provided comfort during workouts.
5	1372723200	This suit is amazing! I never really sweat when I worked out before.  Now I'm not only sweating but I'm losing weight too!  The best $79 I've spent-since it's helping me get healthier and sexier.
5	1372636800	One a Saturday afternoon I was fed up. I had gone back to my bad eating habits, and gained back 10 of the 36 pounds I have already lost. Plus I wasn't motivated enough to exercise. So, I started getting up at 5:30 every morning to walk and got back to my healthy eating habits. I wanted something to try & help me burn fat while I walked. I found on Amazon the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit. After e-mailing back and forth with Cazzi who was absolutely amazing I bought the suit. My problem areas are my upper arms, stomach, back, and thighs. The sauna suit is amazing. I sweat all over, and with all my changes I've lost 10 pounds in a month. Everthing that is said about this suit on the website I have found hold true. Drinking water is extremely important. I didn't the first day, and had a really bad headache. I now carry a water bottle with me at all times, and don't have a problem. I have already recommened this to my Mom.
4	1372636800	The kutting weight suit works very well.  I sweat very heavily if I am walking on my treadmill, running outside or just doing everyday stuff around the house.  The fit is decent, make sure you ask about what size you should get if you don't fit into the sizing criteria exactly.
5	1372636800	I really like this product.  I haven't really worked out in it, yet...just worn it to increase my daily calorie expenditure.  It's a nice reminder to be careful what I eat.  Shipping was very fast and product was perfect.  Thanks!
5	1372636800	This suit works really really good. It does help a lot and you sure sweat like you have idea. I been using this for a couple of days and i have notice the the difference. I'm planning of buying the sauna shirt and the sauna pants to do much better on my exercises. I'm happy that to bought this product I will recommend it to any one who's looking to loose weight.
5	1372636800	I was a little skeptical since I have purchased similar products prior and based on cost.  This is by FAR the best suit I have ever purchased and it is constructed of superior materials.  I have used it now for approximately three weeks and each time it has taken me to the brink on each of my work outs.  Once it is taken off, I still feel the heat and it prolonged my metabolic rate.  It is a little tight on the sizes, but I think  that is by design.  If I can keep up at this pace I may need to come back and purchase a smaller size.  It fits under my workout clothing and is an AWESOME product....highly recommend!
5	1372550400	The Cutting weight workout suite is wonderful. It works and feels great when I'm wearing it. My husband and I loving it.
5	1372550400	I ordered four pieces. The pants, shirt, body suit and hat. Overall i'm very pleased with the comfort of the gear while working out. Most times I use all the pieces at once. Initially I thought this would be too constricting but it is not. Although it gets hot very fast. For me this product does two important things, it inspires me to work out because sweating that profusely is very gratifying...and secondly I have lost about 6 pounds of actual weight/fat in one month of use. I really recommend this product..follow the hydration advice and you'll be fine!!!
4	1372550400	This is the best suit.  I just started working out again in March and I don't sweat heavily.  With this suit I do!  Everything is soaking wet by the time I finish my workout.  Just make sure u drink plenty of water before during and after.
5	1372550400	Make sure you order only after checking the size chart. This sauna suit has a cool design. I liked it.
5	1372550400	I use to use the cheap sauna suits ( the ones that sounded like you were wearing a plastic bag) I saw these on amazon once just browsing and decided to invest because of all the great reviews. I can honestly say im also one of them!! The fit is great and I sweat my b**** off. Definitely worth it ppl. Go for it.
4	1372377600	This suit made me sweat as advertised.  The material on this is very nice.  I bought a neoprene vest from another company at the same time.  The vest is a lot thinner and cheaper feeling than this suit.  I didn't give it five stars because of the fit.  I read several reviewers complaining about the crotch being long for women.  I have relatively long torso, so I didn't think it would effect me, but it does.  There should be a modified suit for women.I've only used this suit two or three times, so I cannot say if it increases your metabolism or lose weight.  I can say I got warm a lot faster and sweat more than normal.  I bought this suit to help me get over my last 10 pounds plataeu.Suggestion for manufacture: 1.  Make suits specifically for women and another for men.  2.  Make a short sleeve shirt only (there isn't one in the market that I can find and my husband wanted one.)
5	1372377600	Very nice buy I will recommend to others for sure it's really helping a lot for me and my daughter
5	1372377600	I received this quickly, The product itself is quite nice.  Sturdy an soft.  I've only used it once so far.  And I could tell when I took it off that I had sweat quite a bit.  Now for the only con.  The size chart is off.  I should have fit into a Large based on the chart..  however I had to get an XL for it to actually fit.  So these are sized incorrectly, or they where when I purchased..  I understand they are planning on fixing the sizing chart.  I would recommend this product to others.
5	1372204800	ES-Antes de comprar el producto sent&iacute;a que hab&iacute;a aumentado mucho de peso. Orden&eacute; el producto. Una vez lo recib&iacute; comenc&eacute; a trotar cada d&iacute;a por 40 o 45 minutos. Ademas de esto compre una balanza digital para pesarme cada d&iacute;a. Luego de 30 d&iacute;as y 60 millas de trote he perdido 10 - 12 libras. Creo que el producto es muy bueno. Combinando con el ejercicio diario da buenos resultados, incluso tenia como celulitis en el tronco pero luego de perder estas libras noto la firmeza y la diferencia. Es ademas importante cuidarse de las comidas como el arroz y la papa.EN-Before to order this product I didn't feel so comfortable with my body shape. I realized I need something to help me to get back my younger body shape. Once I received the suit I jog almost every day (20 out of 30 days) jogging. In total I jogged 60 miles(3 miles per day average) and I lost 10 - 12 pounds. Working out, eating healthy and this suit are the key to lost weight. I am really happy with this product.
5	1372204800	I just bought my 2nd suit because the first one I bought, the zipper fell off....after over 5 years of use! I used the suit on deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and if my wife hadn't put it in the washer and dryer I might still be using it. It is great for working out and I use it in the winter when I do PT. It keeps me warm while everyone else is cold and it helps me sweat more when I need to. It may be $80 but it is well worth it versus buying the plastic suits that tear after 1 use. The only thing I can say is buy a size or 2 up if you don't want it super tight. I am fine with it since I wear underarmour shirts and the like but if you want it a bit looser get the next size up. Great product overall and I have already gotten a few of my battle buddies to buy one as well.
5	1372118400	It does what it says! I ordered it for my adult son & now I am considering one for myself. It's pretty true to size, something to think about as it is a one piece. But, be prepared to sweat.  He works construction & in one day saw results!
5	1372118400	Ordered this product to help shed some unwanted pounds. It does everything it claims. You will sweat profusely, keep a towel and plenty of water handy. It has helped me tone and lose those last "few" pounds. Bottom line would recommend this product to anyone looking to cut weight. It does fit snug so order a size up from what your normal size would be.
5	1372032000	This is a well made weight loss/therapy suit. I have arthritis and this helps me getting warmed up and keep my joints warm during exercise and therapy sessions. I am a big guy and have trouble finding clothes and shoes that fit. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 6xl suit fit well. It was tight in the chest but my measurement did exceed the recommended fit measurement. The forgiving neoprene helped with that issue. I found the fitting guide to be a true fit. The suit moves with me and does not restrict me in any way. I definitely feel better toned after a workout with the suit than without it. I would recommend this suit to anyone needing to warm up muscles, keep joints warm, dropping water weight, and extending that feeling of a good workout. I hope the Kutting Weight suit helps you as much as it helps me.
5	1372032000	I ordered a medium for my wife but that was a little to big so we contacted Kutting weight and they were very easy to deal with and exchanged the suit for the small one. Shipping was fast and my wife loves to work out in this suit and she seems convinced that it is great! She is very happy with it. Good quality! Fits well while still being comfortable enough to do her Zumba in.
3	1371945600	It's okay, I think I could've gotten a size smaller. I don't sweat as much as I would like to in the stomach area (it could be because of the size). I will continue to wear though, so we'll see!
4	1371772800	This suit really does what it says! Great way to add hot sweat off as part of your workout. The fit was perfect (M) except for the torso, it's long. However, it's fine for me as it allows for any additional weight changes :(
2	1371600000	i was so excited when it arrives in my house. I immediately fit it and I am so disappointed that it is too big for me. I am normally medium but i figure it will be better if I will buy the smaller size. However, it is still way too big for me. Also, according to the item description it was 2.5mm thick but the suit that I received is just 1.7mm thick which different from the suit description. the groin area is too loose that i feel like the skin in my legs are rubbing each other rather than the supposedly the fabric should rub to each other
5	1371600000	This suit is awesome I just started working out and wanted to build up a great sweat as soon as I start walking within 10 min I am sweating. Hopefully I'll start seeing a difference soon.
5	1371600000	I bought this product when I was trying to showcase my definition more. It works and wonderfully. I highly recommend.
5	1371513600	This Product has definitely helped me out in my Battle to get into shape. My muscles warm up quickly and I work out effectively.
5	1371513600	Really effective at raising my core temperature. The clothes that I wore under my suit were completely soaked after my 45min cardio!
4	1371513600	I love this product and I followed the sizing table provided and it still didnt fit well. I purchased the shirt and pants kutting weight and it was still too big ..... then I purchased the suit and it still didnt fit well. I had to return the first two items and will have to return the suit. Customer service was great. They accepted my returns and exchanges without any hassle. Too bad it didnt fit me. Would have loved to own one. Thank you.
5	1371427200	This product is one that performs as advertised. The fit is very good and so far it appears to be very durable... I am very satisfied with this product and would definitely advise anyone to try it.
5	1371427200	I just recently purchased a kutting weight sauna suit and it really does work. I like to wear it while working out specially on my cardio days. No one knows that it is on when I wear it the sleeve show but that is all. You really do sweat a lot! Which is great if your looking to lose weight lol.
4	1371340800	Just receive my suit. Look forward to working out in.  Hope it makes me sweat like it states it does.
4	1371340800	So I bought this a couple of weeks after I bought my $10 altus suit. The altus suit couldn't go through the physical demands that this suit goes through. It's a very thick neoprene material that heats up your body well. I was at first used to the altus suit that just left you soaking wet. After using the KW suit, I didn't feel as wet as the other suit but I did realize that the neoprene material absorbed most of it. Don't get me wrong, you're still pretty moist but at least you're not leaving sweat juice all over the equipment and floor (yuck). Overall I've been happy with this purchase, it keeps my temperature high and it's fairly easy to clean. Only washed it one time so far and I followed the instructions. Hand wash and I put in a little detergent to help. Overall it has good material and does its job well.
5	1371254400	I workout at a local gym in nj when I come in the gym, people look at me with admiration. I wear my suit well, and the results are phenomenal it generates heat that appears to be balanced and equal. Allowing me to complete a two workout 3 days a week. Thanks you very much for the products cap. Long sleeve top and pants. I'm a former marine I served proudly, you reinstated my faith!!
5	1371168000	since the first time i wore the suit,ifelt the weigth lose.  you shed water like crazy and all you have to do is just wear it.
5	1371168000	I LOVE this product.  I made my sister, her friend and 2 of my friend purchase the suit.  I sweat tremendously.  I have lost alot inches.  I would recommend this to anyone! My trainer insisted that I get it and I'm glad he told me to.
5	1371168000	I got it early. It's good, I wore it and sweat a lot. The suit is a little big for me, but it's ok. My height 4"11' Dan my weight around 140 pounds. I ordered medium.
5	1370995200	ive been using the sauna suit every day to exercise by the time I'm done I think I can fill at least five 8oz cups with sweat. its comfortable moves with you, its the best and durable and yes definitely need to order one size bigger than what you may wear unless you look like peter griffin from family guy I wouldn't know u might want to go three sizes bigger but overall best suit ever if you want lose weight.
5	1370995200	I love this suit!  I really works and feel so comfortable at the same time!  The added inserts for ventilation really work well with the neoprene suit.
5	1370908800	I re-ordered the suit and it fits like a glove. Kutting Weight suits are great and you will Love It.They have excellent customer service and will correct any problem you might have. If you do experience a problem just contact:Dustin ZahurskyKuttingWeight.com .Thanks Dustin for all your help,Mr Halliday
5	1370908800	Must say it really has me sweating, I don't sweat easily. The suit Kutting Weight is durable, comfortable, and well design. I have a large rear and the suit fit. My order was ship fast and delivery from Amazon was as they promise (fast). I have bought sweat suits before they were plastic and rip.
5	1370822400	Thanks so much for the friendly reminder to give my feedback on the product. I'm only sorry that I didn't  discovered it months ago.I Love it!Sincerely,Satisfied Customer
5	1370822400	I've been using the suit for about a week now and I've seen rather significant changes during this time (stomach is leaner).  Thirty-- even twenty minutes working out in this thing and you are absolutely soaking.  Easy to clean, very durable, and discrete under clothes if you'd rather not have people see you...silhouettes if you plan to use it in public.  Great investment and supplement to my workouts.
4	1370736000	I like the this sauna suit. It really make me sweat and helps me target the areas that I need the most sweating and heat when I do my work out. I'm small and petite so I order the extra small sized it fits well with the only problem that is a little to long for me on the inseam of the pants. If I pull the pants all the way up then is long in the torso. I like the suit so as long I wear cloths over it nobody will notice the extra material.
5	1370649600	The product works great. I work up a good sweat for detox and weight control. The suit is made of a quality material that has not torn nor wore down when exercising. I used the size chart on the kutting.com website and the suit fit just right.
3	1370563200	Kind of nasty to feel all that sweat on your skin for an entire work out. It makes my skin crawl. It does offer some support tho, running feels much better as I am large chested. Wish this would come  in female vs male tho. Crotch hangs pretty low and I have a smaller waist and wider hips and chest then men do. I would also recommend they start marketing body shapes as well as just male and female suits. It would have been nice to order a suit in medium female- - hour glass. Then all the ladies can make sure it fits perfect and there won't be so much sweaty nasty rubbing because the suit doesn't fit perfectly.
4	1370563200	A bit loose, since I listened to the other reviews to go another size larger. But other then that, the item works as described, I can really feel the sweat. Which is what it was meant to do. So it all turned out to be ok.
5	1370563200	I needed to contact customer service right after I've placed my order for a chance on it and it they were very quick to modify and respond. Also, Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit works as advertised. I recommend it.
5	1370476800	I purchased this to help with exercise and weight loss.  It makes you sweat a lot where the suit touches your body, but also increases your overall body temperature causing even more sweat everywhere else.  I like the fit (it stretches slightly to accommodate your curves)and feels supportive with activity.  At the end of your workout, you feel like you have accomplished something big when you can literally wring out your undergarments!  I've only been using it for the past week and have lost 4 lbs although I'm eating better too.  It is not an inexpensive item, but I hope to justify the price by improving my fitness habits over the long term.
5	1370390400	I really like this sauna suit and I would buy it again.I rate it as a 5 star but I am a 5 feet women and the bottom part or the suit .the crouch part is to long.But other then that the suit does what it says and at first I ordered a large because of a feed back I saw and it was to large.But I returned it and the seller was wonderful.He called me and four days later I received a medium size suit.
5	1370304000	First off I'm a big guy I'm 6'9 275 lbs  and I got the 4XL  and it fits great.  I'm use to buying the cheap plastic ones that tear after about a week's use,  I've had this fir about 2 weeks and its still going great.
5	1370304000	I can't say enough about this sauna suit. I love the way I feel when I have it on. I also love the way my torso & legs and arms feel. I notice a difference in my body and my skin after wearing it and the detox it gives me. fits me perfectly, not too tight or too loose.
5	1370304000	I got this item on may 25 and I put this sauna suit and the pants on the 28 I walked 55 minutes holy crap I never sweat that much in my life my whole body was drenched in sweat , I highly recommend this oh make you hydrate yourself drinking water and also you will need a towel !
5	1370217600	I have a slow matabolism.  Kutting Weight suit makes it easy to loose wieght.I tried everything from diets to supplements.  This the way to go.
5	1370131200	I use my "kutting suit" when I run (60+ miles per week). My muscles stay warm to prevent injury, I burn crazy calories and i sweat like nothing else. I love it! Im ordering two more for my daughters.  Be sure to stay hydrated to avoid overheating as the suit will make you hot!
5	1370131200	My gym trainer recommended me to get a Sauna Suit for better results. I got one from Walmart, it was the cheap plastic suit.It did what it was suppose to, however it tore apart completely just 2nd time when I wore it. So I was searching for a goodsuit that will last longer. I checked for the reveiws and bought this. This is really good. It makes me sweat head to toeand I feel good after the workout.Thank you,
5	1370044800	I wanted a way to sweat out the toxins while I work out and these are fantastic! They are well made and durable and you feel thin in them too :)
5	1369958400	I'm loving the suit. It is better made than the plastic sauna suits I have bought in the past. I bought the suit for a little extra help with weight loss and to get back into shape. I workout to Insanity, jumprope or jog and the sweat just flows like water. I was concerned with the sizes because I carry my weight on the hip and thigh area and usually need a size bigger than my waist size. Maybe hip measurement could also be included with the waist measurement. I ordered two sizes up and the suit fits perfectly on chest and hip with a some extra room in the waist. The one piece suit is easy to get in and out of and I just wash it down after use and hang in the shower. I can easily wear it under t-shirt and shorts without it being bulky and it does not restrict movement.
5	1369958400	this is the best purchase i have made in my life. BRAVO to this supplier. it fits good, it feels good... it makes you sweat even after you stop workout. i recommend this product!!!
4	1369699200	This product is great for weight loss.  In my first few uses I am down almost three pounds.  It definitely makes you work harder and keeps your heart pumping longer after your workout.  I would say you will not be the most fashionable person in these outfits but you will look good when you put on other clothes!
5	1369699200	The product I received from Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit (SML)  was just what I expected GREAT. First I was surprised to receive it in the timely manner in which it came. WOW!!!! A couple of days were all it took.  I was so happy. I had taken off from work that day so I got a chance to use the product right away. Second the fit was great for me the problem area's I wanted to focus on were targeted right on. The fitting chart really helps out well; just know your size and it's also very comfortable and you sweat like crazy so have a towel available I can appreciate the fit around my arms that is a problem area for most woman so when I sweat in that area I love it. I feel good about myself, and I look good. Each day, or every other day I use it I see a difference. I really like it I'm glad I bought it. It was not a waste of money for me. I plan to order the long pants and top for winter time. I just ordered the cream for the legs so with the two of them together I'm looking forward to a great summer. Thanks Kutting Weight.
5	1369699200	this is totally what I wanted totally worth the money I spent and very good it fits perfect and am so sure I will get my moneys worth out of it thank you amazon for always pleasing me in all that I buy form you and your sellers may you all have a bless day
4	1369526400	It fit well. It made me sweat. It was comfy enough. The problem I had is that the neck opening was large and loose.
5	1369440000	I lowered my calorie intake and drink a lot of water and work out 5-7 times a week. I wear the sauna suit with sweat pants and a sweat shirt over it..I would also like to order the shirt and pants, but for now, I wrap the problem areas with plastic wrap under the sauna suit. I jog in place for an half an hour and do arm strengthening exercises. I checked my weight Tuesday and checked it again Friday...i lost six pounds..thank you Lord!!! I highly recommend the suit.
5	1369267200	I'm 5'9, 195, female, athletic build. I purchases a L. It's tight but I like it. I can move comfortably. YOU WILL SWEAT! It works, it's awesome! After each work out. I rinse it immediately and let it air dry. I've put in in the washer (delicate cycle) to get a good wash, air dried...Good as new!
5	1369267200	I don't really have anything bad to say about Kutting Weight, except that if you don't have water with you while you're involved in a mega work-out, you are going to pass out.  I love this suit!  I work out everyday and it sweat up a storm and it is worth it.  Please, have some water with you when you  use it.Ami
5	1369180800	I ordered the kutting weight sauna suit last Wednesday, received it on Saturday and immediately started using it. I have been weighing twice daily with up and down results between 1-3 pounds. For the last two days, I have really sweated hard without trying. I put the suit on walk for 1 hour, and one of the days kept it on to do household cleaning. I am at a steady lost of 2 pounds to the same weight just in the last few days. Great workout without trying hard wearing Kutting Weight.
5	1369180800	I love my kutting weight sauna suit!! I love working up a sweat while working out it just makes me feel good. I usually wear a belt and loved what it did to my mid section and wondered if they make this stuff for all over the body. I did some research and found this suit and I'm so happy i did. I feel so good after my workout. Lost 2 pounds this week and I'm almost positive It's due to this suit! If it gets damaged in a week I would probably order again haha
5	1369180800	Good product. Strong and very nicely made. Makes me work up a serious sweat.  Wish I'd gone smaller.  I'm 5'2" tall and the scale says I'm 148, but no one ever thinks I'm even 125.  I was afraid a small wouldn't fit, but the mediums a bit big.  The swish sound when you walk isn't bad and I wear my suit to the gym all the time.  I love the way I feel after a workout.  I also have serious back/leg injury issues (from long, long ago and recurrent) and this suit really seems to help my back.  I highly recommend and someday want to get the small for a tighter fit. Great buy. No regrets.
4	1369180800	Don't really like the fit of this suit, but it was my error in ordering size. I am a runner so this one piece seems to be more appropriate for the biker. However it does work I still sweat a lot and do not realize how sweaty I truly am until it is off.
5	1369094400	I'm thoroughly enjoying the work outs I'm having in my new Kutting Weight sauna suit.  They were good workouts to begin with, it's just gratifying to see ounces of sweat pouring off!!!  It provides great mobility and is very comfortable.  Can't wait to get the rest of the Kutting weight items to complete the suit.  I recommend this to anyone trying to shed some pounds or just to shred up...  Remember to stay hydrated and use responsibly!  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do...  Oh, by the way - It takes a bit of practice getting it off by yourself, so have someone on stand-by to get you out of it. (minor set back)
4	1369094400	Its pretty new so I will have to see how it holds up. But so far I like it a lot.KK
5	1369008000	Love this suit!!!Can't say enough great things about it. It fits true to the size chart. The suit came within a couple of days and I sweat so much in this suit I can literally feel myself shrinking. Wearing this suit (and sweating my *ss off!) really boosted my workouts and gave me the extra push that I needed to keep going. I am really starting to see results!!! Spend the money and buy this suit. It is made really well and I promise you will sweat a helluva lot more than you would without it!!
5	1368921600	I got this an the amount of time i ordered it. (one day delivery). I know that when i looked at the reviews, i was having an issue on what size i should buy...i was going to go with what everyone else had said..(get 1-2 sizes up) but I contacted the sellers of the product and they told me to stick with a medium. (I am 5'4&#34; and 166lbs as of today.) I got it, and it fit great!!! Not sure of weight loss yet, but so far, so good.
5	1368835200	I received my sauna suit and immediately went to the gym, not expecting to see a immediate result, but as the basketball gym called me, and I was picked up quickly for a game of 5 on 5, the first 3 trips up and down the court indicated that the suit was indeed a product worth praise. The sweat generated from 3 games made me feel like I had just got out of the pool. The best thing about the suit is the ventilation under the arms which allowed for my body to breathe. I never felt like I was going to overheat in the gym. I would definitely buy another suit and recommend this to anyone wanting to cut weight or seek a great sweat from head to toe!!!
5	1368835200	After 1 week of trying this suit, I'm hooked.Pros: sweat, sweat, and more sweat! Great overall fit with room to breathe. Doesn't retain odor. No itchiness.Con: fits too long. Crotch is somewhere around mid-thigh on me. I'm 5'4, 145.
5	1368748800	Love it! You will sweat your butt off...literally! Make sure to drink plenty of water while using the suit. I normally rinse/wash it in the shower afterwards. Well made and worth the money.
5	1368662400	The product is great and was delivered one week prior to the expected delivery date.  Have had it for a couple of weeks and it has been working great.  I use it while doing a boxing workout and can see the results.Thanks!
4	1368662400	I use this suit during Zumba class and it makes me sweat twice as much. I can say I feel very tired midway through my workout. I guess its because of all the water I am loosing. Normally I am able to get through an hour class with no problems but when I wear the suit I am looking at the clock 30 minutes into the class. Please be careful to keep hydrated while wearing the suit as you will shed alot of water. Your suit will be soaking wet after your workout. I have not lost any weight yet but I am sure with continuous use I will start seeing results. I like to hang the suit inside out in front of a fan after a workout to let it dry. Also, I would recommend rinsing it in the shower every other week to eliminate any odors. Very good product and well made. I will be purchasing the other products which probably allow more movement.
5	1368576000	I am very pleased with the Kutting Weight Sauna suit and I have recommended it to all of my friends and co-workers. I am normally not a sweaty woman but this suit makes you sweat like a fountain. The first time I wore it I sweated so bad that when I got home I had sweat dripping all the way to my socks. I wear a tank top under it but it still makes you sweat. I know I will order more products in the future. I emailed the Kutting Weight website; submitted my pants size, my weight and my bust size. They recommended a 4x but I figured since Im paying for it I want it to last longer so I got the 3x and it fit just fine. Since I got it two weeks ago I have dropped a dress size (from 20 to an 18). I work out every day for an hour and eat right but this suit will have you sweating in no time getting some of the weight off as well. I rinse it off every day by using hot water in a spray bottle. I even took it off in the shower one time but I like spraying it better. All I have to say is "BUY IT YOU WILL BE SATISFIED"!!
4	1368489600	It's important to follow the sizing chart.  Very important.  I am a large man and had to order the 6XL and was surprised is actually fit like it should.  I find the product to be good quality.  I have yet to put it to good use, but like the product.  Great Buy!
4	1368489600	Small size is prefect to me with clothes under. and I'm 145lbs and 5'7 athletically build.I'm 'Sweating like a Pig' after 15 min on treadmill.I'm not able to survive more than 30 min, and I'm in very good athletic shape, not weak.If I do it every other day I see results right away: around my hips, upper legs and waistline.Only issue - the resin smell... Before I washed it a couple times was giving me a headache.
5	1368316800	Love love love this suit!!! It really makes you sweat while doing cardio and weight training. I got a small and it fits pretty good (a little big in the hips and a little tight in the chest area but I wear a 4/6 buttom and 8 top). It is comfortable to workout in although as the name suggests (sauna suit) it does get pretty hot and really makes you sweat! Thank You KW
5	1368230400	Honestly I can say this has been the best product I have bought! Its making a big difference! I used it for 3 days straight and I feel the difference!!! Love love it!! I really bought for sweating and it's doing that and more!!
4	1368144000	I bought the Kutting Weight neoprene one piece suit and I really like it.  Although the fit was funny (but it could just be my body since I'm small on top and bigger on the bottom.  The bottom fit really tight, like a wet suit, but the top was loose a baggy.  I should have gotten the two piece suit. Anyway this thing makes me sweat like crazy!  Which I LOVE.  I wear it whenever I'm doing a cardio workout, I don;t use it too much when I'm lifiting weights.  It fits nice under your gym cloths and doesn't make you look all bulky and big.  It's a little expensive, but I'm glad I got it cause it really works and helps sweat all the impurities out.  I would recommend this product.
5	1368057600	I have been using for four weeks and have lost 20 pounds while wearing during my weight lifting and aerobic workouts. I also make sure I drink lots of water. Will have to see how this works in the summer heat. Just starting using with sweat pants. Very good fit easy mobility and tons of sweat and lots of water. Did circuit on weights, bike 30 minutes and elliptical for 48. Very good product no tearing or ripping or material fatigue yet.
2	1367798400	So I read the other reviews about the sizing before ordering and ordered a 3XL. I am normally a 2XL in everything I buy. The item did arrive on time and seems to be made of good quality material, but it doesn't fit! I paid $80 for this suit and would love to wear it while I work out, but it is way too small, which is quite embarrassing. I know I'm not small. I have quite a bit of weight to lose, so I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear, as instructed by others who reviewed the product.A more accurate sizing guide would be much appreciated! In the meantime I'm stuck with this suit until I can return it and order a larger one. I'm really not looking forward to the hassle involved.When I actually get a suit that fits, I will be happy to update my review.
4	1367798400	At first i was skeptical about the product and whether it would work as advertised. Haven't had it long but after the few uses i've given it i'm impressed as to it's performance. First used was during an afternoon run. Sweated more than i ever have on that route under moderate weather conditions. Morning run, bit chilly but definitely had quite a sweat worked up. I like it cause i don't get back after a run with drenched clothes. It keeps moisture locked in while keeping your body temp up. It's breathable material is excellent in regulating your own body temp. Will definitely continue to use this suit in all my work outs, be it a run or just hitting the gym. My only concern now is, durability, considering cost. So far, great product!
5	1367712000	As advertised it really make you sweat a lot!! fits perfectly, although I would recommend to go one size up on what you usually wear.As for the result I will wait for one then I will check my weight again.
5	1367712000	Love it very much.thanks o lot.i recommend everybody get it .thanks amazon .i just got 3 weeks a go so far so great!
5	1367712000	Excellent product and shipping time. The suit fits good and helps to get rid of water weight. It is actually very comfortable to wear.
4	1367539200	Before I ordered this, I did some research into the product, and discovered it is intended to be used as a workout outfit, and that it tends to be smaller then expected. This delayed my initial purchase plans months ago, but after some careful consideration, I ended up ordering one.I'm a big guy, who doesn't work out. I stand 6'2" tall, and weigh over 400 lbs. My idea was to just wear it, and maybe it would sweat off some of the excess pounds. After having it a week, I now wear it to sleep in. I new it would be small, so I got the 6XL, and manage to get into it. The stretching of the material works great. It does retain heat, and I find that my back hurts less after I've been wearing it for a few minutes. After about 6 hours of sleep, I wake up, remove the suit, and return to sleep. It's become a habit. Is it helping me loose weight? Don't know. But I do feel like it is an investment in my future, and if I do take up some home exercises in the future, I've got my workout suit ready to go.
5	1367452800	I bought the suit to intense my workout and lose more weight - the suit does the trick! Great product, great price!
5	1367452800	I finally decided to give my kutt weight sauna top the test.  I weighed in at 113 prior to my workout on the Tony Little gazelle I have at home. Worked out for 45 minutes moderately.  No heavy exertion or huffing and puffing. Just a steady pace.  After workout I weighed 112.2!  I almost never sweat or lose any water weight whatsoever with workouts so this test was impressive to me.  I plan on doing a heavy workout next time.  As I've aged, my metabolism has really slowed down and I tend to gain water weight really easily.  I think this suit will help me reach my fitness goals.  I think now I will order the pants too.Great product!  LOVE IT!
4	1367366400	I am 5'2", 36 bust, 35 waist, 125 lbs (Hey!! Give me a break!  That's why I ordered the sweat suit!)I held it up to me and the length is for an average height person not a shorty like myself.  Once I put this on, the crotch sat at mid thigh because I'm too short!  The sleeves are big, the chest and stomach tight and the legs were good.  This is not flattering so don't think you can slap it on and hit the gym. Well, I wouldn't anyway.  No way, Jose. I looked like a side of beef crammed into a Slim Jim package with droopy drawers.  lol!  That being said, it does work.  Heck, getting myself into it, I broke a sweat.  Once out of it, I was sweaty.  I dunno, I still like it despite it drooping and so ill fitting.  Seems to work and when I'm in it I can't stop cracking up at how I must look so it makes it funny. Hey, as long as it works, I'm happy.  Just imagine if I drop 10 lbs, the crotch will be at my knees!  lol.
4	1367366400	The only complaint I have is the arms are too tight! Otherwise I have shed 10# since I purchased this sauna suit. It makes me sweaty without the feeling of plastic sticking to me. I'm so glad I have it a try. I've been using the plastic sauna suit and hated the way it felt. Really happy with this suit.
5	1367366400	It fits great, though I think I ordered just a little too big for my current body type. I haven't worked out with it yet, but it's intact, good quality, and I love it.
4	1367280000	Lighter weight than I thought... I have a older version (30+ years) that is twice as thick.  I don't sweat in this thing at all - and I have worn it all day, worked out in it, etc.  I use this to support my back healing (have three vertebra out and this is snug and it helping my fusing effort).  BTW: I ordered the size larger than my frame and this thing is TINY.... I would have preferred the XXL (and I'm only 5'7&#34;/180).
5	1367280000	This is my second Kutting Weight purchase.  Extremely happy. The products are made of good material and well put together and very durable...great stuff...thanks KW
5	1367193600	I got this to wear whileI do the P90X. So far it's worked great. I dis follow the recommendation to order a size big and its perfectly. It's holding up wonderfully. I can't express how well made this is and how much I like it.
3	1367107200	This suit was quite long on the upper body it was about three inches below the crotch area. I purchased the med/large and I wear a size petite 12 pants and large tee shirt. No other complaints since I could not use this product.
5	1366934400	This is a quality sauna suit.  I love the material, the flexibility of the suit. It is a little odd in the fit but it is unisex so I can understand that. I bought it one size up from what I probably would normally buy but it's great for all work out activities even when I'm cleaning I'll wear it and sweat!
5	1366848000	I love my kutting weight suit. Helps me to sweat, and it is easy on/off. The suitbhits all my problem areas!
5	1366848000	Suit is what it describes... Love it. Fits snug and does the job. Easy to wash, I throw it into the washing machine on a delicate cycle and works perfectly fine.
2	1366848000	I have used this for a while now.Pro-you sweat a lot,lose inches.cons-I have a very bad breakout .I washed it and try again and the same.Went to a dermatologist- skin infection from the moisture.I use it when i take my dog for a walk-1hour and then during exercise routine-2 hours.I don't know if i can use it again.
5	1366329600	I've only had the suit a week ans can feel the difference in my workout burning more fat than I ever have. Very comfortable to workout in.
1	1366243200	This suit costs way too much to receive the wrong one.  I read all the reviews about buying it an extra size larger and now I'm stuck with a high dollar item I can't use.
5	1366243200	I purchased this suit after reading the reviews. I needed something to boost my weight loss and I got it. I am 5.7", weight172 pounds and in regular clothes a fit in a large. I ordered XL and fits just right. Not too loose, not too tight. I wear it for spinning and eliptic; not for running. Not sure if I could run 3 miles with it on.I would recomend.
5	1366070400	I love my suit. I didn't know about the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit until I went to make a purchase for Sweet Sweat and someone had mentioned they use Sweet Sweat with their Kutting Weight Shirt so I thought let me check out the shirt but when I seen the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit I just knew I had to have it. I love it! It is better then any other Sauna Suit I have own and I am truly impressed with how much I sweat wearing it. I brought a size large and I am 5'3 and 160lbs and it fits perfect. When I first received it and looked at I thought no way can I get this on but it truly fits like a glove. Just perfect! I am hoping btwn my healthy eating, my daily work-out and the the Kutting Weight Suit that I will be able to lose the weight I need to lose. Great Product and money well spent!

5	1365811200	really get sweaty after workout. I am very happy with it. I really really love it. Thank you so much!
5	1365724800	It fit a little big but great suit and let me tell you if you want to sweat this is for you.
5	1365724800	The suit is as described. It is very sturdy and will probably get a lot of use before having any problems. I have had other sauna suits and none as good as this one by far. The suit is very comfortable and fits great. My only issue is that I'm a bigger guy that fits into the 6x category and its hard for me to get the suit off from my shoulder area when I'm done using it. Other than that minor issue I would recommend this suit to others.
5	1365638400	Let me start off by saying that I own a sauna & I use it 4 times a week at 145 degrees so I'm used to the heat & I love this suit! I'm a pretty big & wide guy at 290 lbs & 5'11 and I got the size 6xl & I think I shouldve got 5 xl but either way all I had to do was put this suit on & move some stuff around the house & I was dripping sweat, I use it on the treadmill b4 I hit the sauna & I'm hoping to drop as much weight as possible...... my advice=get it get it get it
5	1365638400	I love this suit. I don't know when I have sweated so much on my elipitical. It was slightly uncomfortable at first but i got used to it. The only problem I have with it is getting it to dry out. I suppose a second suit to wear while the first one dries out will work. Good quality and yes getting it at least one size larger than you need is highly recommended
5	1365552000	This suit is amazing. Ive used everything from a big garbage bag to the silver plastic suit. and this is definitely worth the money. I listened to the reviews and i ordered 2 sizes up from my shirt size and it fits good a little tight on the arms but im a big guy. The only issue i have is having to hand washing this big suit after I'm done. I'm 6'5 302 pounds i wear a 3x shirt i ordered a 5x suit and im in love. I wear it for cardio and weight training. You will sweat like NOOOOO other make sure to drink a lot of water dehydration kills so water, coconut water, all that helps. Just start your workouts with some cardio and you will be in love as well... Happy Sweating...
5	1365465600	The suit is great I've been using it for a week and when I work out its real comfortable it's been one of my best purchases.
5	1365379200	IT HAS A VERY TIGHT FIT BUT I  WEAR IT FOR A FEW HOURS AT A TIME,I AM JUST WAITING TO SEE THE RESULTS
5	1365292800	The suit is excellent. It is durable and is very productive! Will recommend the suit to others with the same need!
5	1365292800	I originally ordered a size Medium based on other reviews that recommended ordering a size or two larger. I am 5'4", 125 lbs., 36" around the bust. The Medium fit fairly well on top, but was quite baggy on the bottom. It was loose around the thighs and arms, and there was a lot of extra room in the crotch area. I contacted the company, and they told me they would have suggested a size Small for me. So I exchanged the Med for a Small, and it fits perfectly. Amazon processed the return and credit to my account very quickly, so I immediately ordered a Small and received it within a week. I have just started using it in my workouts, and I LOVE IT! It makes me work up a great sweat. As others have suggested, I wear a tee shirt and shorts underneath and looser clothing over it, and when I take it off, I'm soaked. I haven't used it long enough to see any results, but it does make me sweat profusely when I work out, and I am optimistic that I will get results.
5	1365206400	I came across this item while looking for fitness equip and i must say i was unsure at first, especially with the price, but i thought that i would give it a shot. I have to say that i love this suit, it works exactly like it is supposed to. every time  i wear it i sweat significantly more and it makes me feel like my work out is more effective, when i weight myself before and after- wearing the suit, i tshirt and cloth pants i am down in weight, which is great after a cheat weekend. in terms of overall weight loss speed has increased, with the same workout plan, i feel warmer longer,meaning my metabolism is working for longer. i use it about 4 times a week. the fit was true to size. i have a larger chest so i was worried about that but it helps keeps things in place. like the other reviews, there is a odd smell when you initially open it that does last for several days. I havent experiences a foul odor after use, but i do rinse it out as directed after each use. i love this suit and plan on purchasing the other clothing items as well.
3	1365206400	The problem with ordering is there was really NO Good sizing chart to let the customer know How and What size to order. I am usually a size 2x in clothing, size 2x top and size W20 pants, so I figured if I ordered it one size bigger it would fit n ordered a 3x I tried it on and it would not zip nor could I get the thing off, I had to take a clothes hanger and push it down the back of the suit to push it off my shoulder, took 30 minutes, I DID GET A GOOD WORK OUT DOING THAT LOL!! So I decided to give that one to my hubby and ordered a 4x for me. I have not tried this new one on, hopefully, it will fit and I can use it if not I will keep it and wait to use it when I can fit into it. Or I can just put the 3x on and get a work out trying to get it off again. LOL. Seriously, they need a size chart!
5	1365206400	Very swetty, i recomed it. Be advise run to tight , i am a medium and i order a xl to fit me.
4	1365120000	I'm writing this review a day after I received it and used it right away. I got to say it didn't dissapointed me, it did what it was supposed to, it made me sweat my a$$ off! I didn't loose 5 pounds like the guy in the video but I got to recognize I only had the suit and that guy had other clothes on also. Long after finishing my workout I was still sweating!! It got my herat racing and I felt great! I'm giving it 4 stars because it has little problems with proportion. I'm 5'9 and weight 260 pounds and thought it was tight on the core wich I loved it that way, it was bigger on the thights and chest, but anyway I loved it! If you're thinking of buying this, don't think it twice. I bought the 5xl but I think I could've fit in a 4xl. Buy it!
5	1365120000	I've been using this a little over a week for now and I'm already start to see some results. I notice my chest and arms are a little more define and also my thighs but its no drastic change its just a tiny difference but like I said before its only been over a week. I will hope to see more results through on out.
3	1365120000	The suit looks and feels great but I was disappointed with the seam that has come undone the second day I used!!!!
4	1365033600	This item does everything its advertised to do. The sizing was very accurate. I am 5'10" 185lbs muscular build so I got the XL. It fits like a glove. Its thin enough to wear under my clothes. I wear my Under Armour underneath to catch most of the sweat but there is going to be a lot of sweat. Also, this is hand wash only. I hand wash it after every use with detergent and warm water. Then I hang dry it. It would be good to use this in conjunction with Sweet Sweat or Albolene to maximize your perspiration. Just make sure you have water nearby because you can get dehydrated very fast with this.
5	1364774400	This thing is amazing! When I first used the kutting weight sauna suit I noticed a massive increase of sweat during exercise, to the point where I actually felt sweat flowing to the crease behind the knee(when I say flowing I literally mean flowing, think of pouring water down your leg) I wore my sauna suit underneath my other workout clothes, thinking I would drench the suit quickly, but in fact this does not happen as you would think it might. The neoprene actually blocks any sweat from traveling to the outside, so when you are drenched in sweat you can still actually look decent. The sweat does not show through anywhere except for the mesh areas, such as the armpits and crotch area. You could wear this suit by itself, which is how it probably should be worn, but wearing clothing over it does no harm. I also noticed with this suit my heart rate increased to an unusual number for me (typically I am in the 160-170 range on the elliptical and with the suit I kept at 185, I even hit 190, which is extremely high) I would not recommend this suit to anyone with any type of heart problems(could be very dangerous), but if you can handle actually feeling your heart pounding like crazy in your chest, go for it. The suit is also nicely made, but it can be a little itchy the first time you try it on(especially on the arms), however I've gotten used to it. I recommend that if you get this suit, follow the size chart by the chest measurement , I ordered a large and although I do not fit the height of a large(according to the chart), my bust does. The suit is snug (which is good) and fits wonderfully.
3	1364774400	Not sure about the weight loss, but it fits perfectly, provides great support for my back, only had it for 5 days so time will tell on the weight loss.
5	1364688000	just recently received the sauna suit . I like how it fits an I feel the pounds will melt off quickly. Thinking about ordering another one. Great product
5	1364688000	I was looking for a comfortable sauna suit to help me work off some additional weight.  This suit is well designed and allows movement easily.  I was skeptical at first but after all the excellent reviews I decided to try it.  The suit is intended to be used during high intensity workouts.  As long as I work at this level of intensity, I sweat up a storm in this suit.  I would highly recommend this suit.
5	1364688000	This product is the BEST by far compared to the other products available out there. It's worth every penny. It's a great investment I ever made for fitness.
5	1364601600	Great product!! I have only used it twice at that moment but love it and so glad I decided to get it. Just ot let others know you might want to get one size bigger becaus I would usally be an XL but I went a head and got a size bigger because of other reviews said too. And so glad i did because a size bigger fits great!!
5	1364515200	Dont spend another moment without it. I lost pounds in first week so no complaints from me thank you sent from above
5	1364515200	i bought it for a couple of reasons; to keep me warm and to sweat...it has done both those things very well for me...i ordered a large because i did not want to have a hard time taking it off and in case it shrunk some when i washed it (note, it says hand wash but i don't and it has held together but i do let it air dry).  i wear it on my runs and i log between 15-20 miles a week. i'm sure i will get another one soon...it's great for my lifestyle and i certainly recommend it.
5	1364428800	This is really a good product. If you are looking to sweat and loose weight, this is for you. I wore the suit 4 two weeks and did my routine workouts in the gym and lost 12lbs. Its startig to get loose on me now so I know its realyy working for me. Go out and get yours, you will be glad u did.
5	1364428800	This thing is awesome! I bought the sweet sweat cream as well and found that just the suit by itself is all you need. Not much difference with or without the cream. I'd recommend to get a size up like everyone else says because once you try Taking it off with all that sweat it gets stuck to your body and well...it's not as easy to get out of as it is getting into it. It's worth it to me...just buy it already!!
5	1364342400	LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! This Sauna Suit is awesome. I have been wearing it for about three weeks now during my yoga and aerobic classes and after my workouts I am soaked.  I can't imagine being without it now. Gone are the days of wasting my money on those "plastic/nylon" throw-away suits! The material is extremely comfortable and feels so smooth next to my skin.Just hand wash, hang it to dry, and start all over again. I can't wait to buy the top and pants. I like the option of having separate pieces to accommodate different workout activities.A high recommendation for any and all concerned about their health and weight!
1	1364342400	The suit has split in the back already it does help me lose weight but its not made very strong
5	1364169600	I purchased this product for my supersized teenager and it fits.He loves that it!!! If you want to sweat, this is the suit for you !!! The material is flexible and solid...especially for my 15 year old football player. It was worth the cost. I would buy again, and this time without hesitation. My initial concern was the cost....but it's worth it!!!
5	1364083200	Can't find stuff like this in stores. Very nice development. Breathing room for arm pits and crotch. Zips up like body suit.
5	1364083200	great suits for the following reasons:1. wearing it helps build excellent posture...i stand up straight and walk straight2. great for keeping you warm-- i wear it under my shirt and pants to stay warm in winter, no jacket needed3. great for  workout--i run around the lake with this suit on. I sweat more which is good for the skin, skin become clearer and more radiance4. durable, high quality materialsBonus: I also wear this to take cold shower. after i run the lake, I jump in cold shower to clean off the sweat. Amazingly it helps keep your body relatively warm even in cold shower. Wearing this product made cold shower bearable, which in turn i get all the benefit of great skin, shinny hair, and circulation. Also you lose more fat taking cold shower because your body burn calories to generate heat.
4	1363996800	Reminds me of a scuba suit and so far, I love it. Better than the thinner, cheaper ones. Definitely worth the money. Plan on buying the shirt too.
5	1363996800	The sauna suit works as advertised. When working out with the suit, your body's perspiration is increased which causes you to loose water weight fast. At 6' 5" and at 280 lbs, I was looking for something to help jump start my fitness program and this sauna suit has surpassed all of my expectations. Excellent build quality and a great product. I would highly recommend this product to any one training to loose water weight to tone their body.
5	1363824000	I got this suit to help me lose pregnancy weight gain, and holy crap! Every time I work out I sweat rivers! It definitely feels better working out with this on. It does have a weird smell, but who cares this thing is awesome, and the fit is tight, but its my right size. I highly recommend getting this suit to improve weight loss.
4	1363824000	The suit fits fine would be better if it was maid more for a woman's shape. But over all works just like it state's... i have been working out with it for a month now and i have lost more than i expected.. i have also found that if you where clothing over it, it makes you sweat even more
5	1363737600	really good quality,after put on it start fill warm up in couple of minutes,but the size was big on me.I'am 5'6 135lb S size is big reordered  on XS.
5	1363737600	I use it when working out and cardio love the product gives me a good sweat. I would order again from you guys thanks keep it up.
5	1363737600	Just wanted to share with you all the size of it. I bought a size large. Im 5'11, 190lbs, my stomache exhaled is 41in.Suit fits great. Just the right fit. Although it might seem like the zipper might break.Ill update this post if it does...
3	1363737600	Product Kutting Weight Clothing, I want to say that it is made of excellent material and it is very convenient but I have one objecting, and I give it 3 stars, the product has the smell of rubber, after first washing and still have the same smell.Thanks
5	1363651200	I am so happy I found this item. My husband can now stop buying me the cheaply made sauna suits that would rip after the 1st wear( he thought it was pretty funny)because they would always rip in the seat of the pants. This all-in-one "scuba style" suit is awesome- be prepared to sweat alot! I wear it while riding my stationary bike.I currently own a couple of neoprene waist slimming belts, arm and thigh slimmers. This suit is so convenient, just slip it on and zip it up! It certainly beats my ritual of wrapping myself in saran wrap or a garbage bag and then putting on a slimming belt, thigh and arm slimmers. It is well worth the price and you will sweat!I have recently lost 17lbs prior to ordering this suit and feel that I am definitely on my way to reaching my goal of losing 50lbs with the help of this product. I currently wear a 2x but got the 3x instead, some reviews suggested to go up 2 sizes but I am still losing weight and I want it to have somewhat of a snug fit as I continue to lose.I can finally say good-bye to exercising in countless pieces of neoprene,saran wrap, garbage bags, and vinyl sauna suits! Thank you Kutting-Weight and my husband thanks you too!!!!
5	1363651200	Excellent customer service when it came to answering my questions.Product is excellent, but if you need to consistently go the bathroom it gets a bit tough.I purchase this product because it had lots of positive feedback.I am into my 5th day,one day stationary bike for 35 min, couple of days of treadmill 60 min, 20 min of Zumba, I have not lost much weight,but with the answers to my questions I know I will lose the weight.
5	1363651200	Good fit...the garment does make you sweat, which is how you lose the weight...very well made....looks good....shipped quickly arrived on time.
5	1363564800	I am 6'2, 190 lbs, 42&#34; chest. 24&#34; thighs, 34&#34; waist. my biggest concern was that the XL would fit uncomfortably/small. It fits like a glove, tightest point being at my thighs(comfortably) & definitely room in the chest and belly for someone with a few more inches on them.. It doesn't fit loose on me at all, just has room to stretch comfortably if i packed on another 10-20 pounds. However I doubt you can be much taller and still be XL.As for the performance... I was able to move around enough in it to lift weights with full range of motion & it def makes you sweat. It's comfortable and I think the other pieces of optional clothing (pants/shirt) would def make it better as the only thing i didn't like is that it wasn't covering everything. By far a quality product that will last and easy to clean(just rinse water on it for a min right after u work out and hang it)I give it 5 stars because it is exactly what I hoped for and none of the things I hoped it wasn't.&Quality; long lasting product.My experience, having followed the size chart leads me to believe that the majority of the people who say it runs small are either:1. not used to wearing things that fit to form2. overweight and prob have more fat in their legs or belly than the average person which causes the measurements based on an average persons size to be slightly off. (i guess huge shoulders/chest could also throw it off a bit)It's actually pretty funny that the issue with a suit that is made to help you cut weight is rumored to run small in size... maybe you are currently running big in size :)
5	1363564800	Fit is great, works really well, a lot better than the cheap sauna suits. Well worth the investment. Put it on and you start warming up instantly!
5	1363478400	The suit runs small in size. Depending on your build I would get at least one size larger than you normally would buy. I am fairly muscular and take a large or extra large shirt depending on the cut. I purchased an XL suit and it fit well BUT, I could not extend my arms because the shoulder/chest area was cut too small for my build. The XXL worked out well.I do one hour of cardio at a fast pace in the suit and work up a really good sweat. The hat also will aid in working up a sweat as well. At my fitness level I can crank and not sweat or over-heat, so the suit really helps. I would recommend it to anyone who desires to take their fitness to the next level.BTW, I contacted Kutting Weight directly before making the purchase here on Amazon. I contacted them for size recommendations and was very impressed with the quick response time. Do yourself a favor and check out their site Kuttingweight.com There you will find several video's that explain the product and you can see if the product will fit into your fitness plan.
5	1363392000	I really enjoy Kutting Weight neoprene weight loss sauna suit. I like to wear it every time I work out. When I am done working out I feel like someone poured a water bottle on me. I have recommended it to a few people I work with. I am glad I bought it. Might buy another one in the near future. Totally happy with the product.
4	1363392000	Does exactly what it says it will do.Agree with others get the next size up for correct fit.I wear a long sleeve stretch material shirt to help with overhead movements while wearing the suit and for easier removal when done working out.Recommend this purchase.Would rate this more like 4.5 to 4.9 stars.  Nothing is perfect but this is a quality item.Excellent product.
5	1363392000	Fit snug and I wore it to work out used a sweating gell and sweated up a storm lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks ridind stationary bike and working out not dieting so highly recommend it would buy from them again
4	1363305600	I am a 5'5 female, 141 lbs. I just had a baby a few weeks ago and retained a lot of water weight so I bought this sweating suit to try to sweat out the excess water from my body. I want to get back to 115 lbs. I have been wearing it to do the Insanity DVDs and I love how much I sweat in it. Im not a sweaty person so this really helps. As soon as I unzip it, sweat just pours right out! I would definitely recommend this product. I havent lost any weight yet because today was my second time wearing it. But I do see a definite improvement in definition already.The fit: I have a short-ish torso so a size SMALL fits a little long and big in the torso. I have to fold it a bit on my tummy to make it fit better. Its only annoying when Im doing crunches and the zipper hits my mouth. The legs fit okay though. You can wear a t-shirt over it and wear it to the gym without looking like you are going scuba diving.The suit has a very strong rubber/gasoline-like smell which makes me a little queasy when Im all hot and sweaty in it. I washed it once and it helped, I hope it subsides with a few more washes.
5	1363219200	Love the product and it fits great designed to move with you so it is very durable. Shipped on time and actually recieved it early. Can't wait to see the end results
5	1363219200	I was impressed with the material of the product. It seems to be very durable. I went with the suggestions of others and bought it onesize up from my regular size and it fits great. I've only used it once just sitting around the house and I can say that it did warm me up and I was sweating a little when I took it off. Overall I feel it is going to be a great product to aid in my weight loss.
5	1363219200	I purchased this sauna suit because I do not sweat regardless of how intense my workouts are.  This sauna suit does the trick and has me sweating like crazy in no time!Based on other reviews, I was not sure what size to order.  According to the size chart, I would be a size medium...however, some reviewers said to order a size bigger.  I went with my measurements according to the size chart and ordered a medium.  The sauna suit fits great!  The only downside to this suit is that it is not available in different sizes for men and women - I think the crotch of the suit hangs a bit low.  This, however, does not interfere with my workouts.The quality of the material is great!  I do wish that the suit was machine washable though.I have only had the suit a little over a week and have not had any weight loss.  I did measure myself though and have lost 1.5 inches off my waist.I ordered my suit on a Saturday night and received it by Wednesday afternoon - very fast shipping!I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  :-)
5	1363219200	this product is awesome,it fits perfect and its comfortable. I would give this product ten starsSo far i have lost ten pounds using this.
4	1363132800	I bought this suit to wear under my uniform. It does in fact heat up the body to a nice sweat while peforming my patrols. I just keep it on throughout my shift and then just put on the kutting weight pants and a shirt and hit the gym for an hour. THE ONLY PRIBLEM IS.... WHEN YOU NEED TO PEE! !!!!! I have to take off the duty belt, , uniform shirt, vest and pants and then the top half of the suit  JUST TO TAKE A LEAK! It would be great if a pee zipper was made into the suit to make going to the restroom easier! I can't wear it while on duty anymore!
5	1363132800	My son is stationed in Afghanistan and called me about (2) weeks ago and his just words were "Mom, you have got to order a Kutting Weight Shirt!"  He was given this shirt by one of the marines at his camp.  There are a group of people wearing them while they run and prepare for the Marine Corp Mile in Oct.  He had his shirt a few weeks and people were commenting on how well and fit he was beginning to look, so he wanted to pass this information on to me.  I quickly ordered the Sauna Suit, because the shirt was longsleeve and I wanted something with shortsleeves, plus I have more in the middle and hip area that I wanted to loose too.  I received this suit, late last week and have worn it several times.  I sweat my butt off, noticing results and I love it !!!!...I recommend this product.  My daughters wedding is in June and I have about 20lbs to lose.  I am jogging and walking on the treadmill about 5 days a week for an average of (1) hour...I am seeing rapid results in the same about of effort was doing prior to the suite with slow results.  I LOVE IT !!!!Thanks you Kutting Weight and THANKS TO MY SON TOO!!!!
5	1363132800	Great fit. Compresses my muscles, fits like a glove. I drink plenty of water mixed with D-Ribose to replenish sweat-enduced water loss and rebuild energy. Lost 8 lbs in 2 weeks. Buy it. You will be pleased!
5	1363132800	Great kutting weight suit I love it the quality of it is great you don't have to worry about keep spending your money on them other sauna suits thats going to tear on you as soon as you move good. That is the reason why I got one of the kutting weight suits an then from there I wanted to sweat all this fat off me an so far it does what they say it do. It makes you sweat like crazy all the water you see you just know you are losing wait an then when you look at yourself as weeks go buy you start saying wow I look good an that makes you keep going because you want to look even more better an also have better health. Some people would say order a size larger than your size but i wouldn't do that because you want it to fit snug to your body so you can sweat as much as possible you still will feel good because the suit is so comfortable an when they say its going to be shipped between a certain day it will be there sooner than that they are quick with shipping and the product looks great an package very well. So I will give advice to anyone an let them no that this is the one an for you all to tell others about it because it could help others life all they have to do is put it on an start walking. God Bless an lets have some fun dropping this weight.
5	1363046400	This product is everything I hoped it would be.  It is doing everything they said it would.  Also the company came through just as they promised.  I can't wait to order the next smaller size every soon.
5	1362960000	First and foremost.. This suit is epic!!!... The size chart is spot on... It fits awesome.. And the rapid response for the kutting weight crew when I emailed about my size was within 10 minutes.. I've had it for several days and I lost 6 lbs after my first workout with it on... And the sweat I got out of this thing.. Is one for the books... I already ordered and received the long sleeve s*** to wear over the sauna suit.. I recommend this suit for anyone who is trying to make weight for a meet or you just would like to get a awesome sweat going... This is what you need.. I'm looking foward to buying the pants and the hat sometime soon... Thank you for making a genuine product...
5	1362960000	I was so tired of layering up with shirts/sweatshirts/pants that I decided I needed something made for building up a sweat.  So I tried the trash bag suits from a local store and was very disappointed after the legs ripped on day 1. Then I stumbled on the products from kutting weight.  This suit beats the pants off of your normal trash bag get-up.I agree on ordering a size or possibly 2 above what your normally wear.Just by doing a brisk walk (3.5-4.0 mph) at a steep incline (10-12%) on the treadmill you will sweat and sweat!  Its absolutely awesome, and I feel great afterwords.  Probably the best thing I have ever gotten for working out.
5	1362960000	Ordering was easy, delivery was on time.  Im 5ft 4in, 190lbs and bottom heavy.  I purchased the xl and it fits great! (Slightly long in the crotch but nothing you cant deal wirh)  Ive used it 3 times so far walking and jogging around the neighborhood.  No chafing and not bulky.  Dripping (gross!) after workout.  Havent lost weight yet, but think that is due to diet.  Very happy with this company and the product.
5	1362787200	what can i say i ordered this product and i am very impressed with the design and the fact it does what it claims to do which is cut the weight by u sweating your a** off i wear it at work sometimes but mainly around the house while i do my honey do list.i have noticed i have dropped a whole 1/4 pound.so all in all this a great product would suggest if ur trying to loose weight u get this an u will be amazed.. a add on too this review not a big problem but had to return the suit we found a small rip in it next to the seam. i am not complaining about the product because once i get my refund for the returned item i will be ordering another one asap.
5	1362787200	I love this suit.  I got it a little big so I can wear shirt and shorts under it so I can let them soak up the sweat and let me tell you, I sweat a lot.  Love this suit, it is sturdy and makes you sweat even if you are not working out!
5	1362787200	Before the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit, I dedicated to exercising at least an hour everyday in the morning before I start my day. Because I am overweight and I was really concern about my health I've been doing a lot of Brisk Walking/Jogging for about a month now and I've lost about 12 lbs so far. Now in comes the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit. I really want to lose the extra weight and I figure what do I got to lose here? Reading the reviews here about this product I was worried about buying the appropriate size. I'm 5'7 at 280 lbs and I normally wear 2XL clothing sometimes 3XL. The Size Chart that was provided here didn't really help me out so I took a chance about bought myself a 4XL suit. Upon arrival the suit may look small but once you put it on it fits on just fine. Tight as a glove but you're able to move your body freely and comfortably. I wore a hoodie and sweat pants over the suit so I don't look silly and I put in the work and the after results are amazing. I have never seen so much sweat come out of my body in an hour worth of exercising. There are no instructions on how to wash the suit other than "Hand Wash" on the back inside collar of the suit so I wouldn't recommend throwing it in a washer and dryer. Other than that, it does the job! I would recommend this to people who are serious about losing the extra weight. This is a very good product!
5	1362528000	Works and fits according to specification... dont take to much time wearing it can cause problems with breathing.Nice and heavy duty material. should last a long time
5	1362528000	Ordered this Sunday night & received it Tuesday afternoon. (with Amazon Prime)Followed the advice of other reviewers about getting 1 size larger than you think you need...I am 5'8&#34; & 165lbs.  I ordered a Large and it fits great.  Not too tight & not loose at all.I worked out for 45 minutes - mainly Cardio and this thing worked great.I wore a cotton tee underneath and when I was done my tee was absolutely drenched with sweat.Its super comfortable and very well made.  Cleaning was easy - I just rinsed it really good in the shower (inside & out) & hung it up to dry.I thought the price was a little high but its well worth the extra $ compared to the cheap walmart nylon suits.Thanks...I would definitely recommend to anyone!
4	1362441600	The sauna suit is the best I have ever tried. Excepted for being a little snug in the waist this sauna suit is very comfortable to work out in. Expedient delivery I ordered the suit and it appeared at may door almost over night. It is well worth the price. I look forward to doing business with this seller soon.Thanks
5	1362441600	Fit is accurate. Mesh areas are a nice feature that i believe help from over heating. Zip front makes for easy changes and care. Would recommend & probably buy another
5	1362355200	wasn't too sure about it..i wear a size 8-10 and bought a medium..it fits right in the middle but my arms and thighs feel kind of snug..thinking of cutting a snip in the legs and arms, then using baby powder..
5	1362355200	First off, I'll agree with previous suggestions, buy a size larger than you would normally wear. These seem to run a bit small, even with ordering the next size larger it's still little tight in my nether regions, but nothing unmanageable.All that aside, it's a very effective sauna suit. I've never seen so much sweat before during my workouts. If you're looking for the step up from the outerwear style sauna suits, this is it.
5	1362355200	i bought this for riding my bike. does exactly what it says it does, plus works great for working out or doing anything in cold weather. i would reccomend, you will definately sweat!
5	1362268800	this is a great sauna suit and hat i have wore it more than a week and i love it, before i had bought cheap plastic sauna suits that only last it a few days.  all i have to said is it was worth the investment....
5	1362268800	I had hit a plateau regarding my weight loss and I was looking for something stronger than the typical PVC junk out there. Because I have larger thighs (I'm Latina), the PVC would tear after about 3 uses, talk about a waste of money. I researched this product and decided to give it a try. It's been approximately 2 weeks and I've seen awesome results. I've continued a good diet and exercise, in addition to the suit/pants/top for women, and the results are absolutely amazing. I'm not going to lie, I watched the 5lb in 30 min video, and thought to myself 'No Way!'. Well, ladies and gents, it's 100% true! I'm leaner, and can now focus on muscle gain instead of allowing the mental block of looking in the mirror. The material is absolutely awesome. It reminds me of a scuba suit, but it just feels so good against the skin and has not chaffed (the PVC constantly did that). I would definately recommend this to any woman who is at a plateau, who wants to kick up (or start) their exercise regimen, or for helping boost metabolism for weight loss. Please keep in mind, you will see results with the continued use in conjunction with exercise and a proper diet. Absolutely wonderful product. Not a single complaint.
5	1362268800	Can't say enough about this product.  It fits true to size, and it lives up to the hype.  SWEAT is an understatement.  I sweat pretty heavily during workouts, but with this suit on, it is like working out in the rain.  You can feel the heat within minutes of putting the suit on (straight inferno). The suit is flexible & moves well with your body during workouts.  I used the suit the first day while I was doing cardio, and it was amazing.  The next day I used it for my cardio session, and kept it on to lift afterwards.  It really helped with my energy levels.The only drawbacks are that it is a little hard to get off at the completion of a workout, and if you have to use the bathroom at any time, you have to basically remove the suit.
4	1362182400	Received order earlier than expected, which was great.  I read a review where one person suggested you get a size larger, so I did, I got a 4x instead of 3x.  I'm 240lbs 5'9 and it fits fine but the first time trying on, it took a little work to zip up over my girt, or gut.The only problem I've had is taking it off.  I hurt my left shoulder back in November, and it has not healed yet, so I can't use this shoulder normally.  The first time I had to go to the bathroom, I couldn't get it off.  It took me 15 minutes to get that darn thing off.  It'd be nice if it zipped lower or there is a strap attached to the back that you could grab to help pull it over your shoulders.Other than that, I love the product, I now wear it all day.  I use it with some Cellulite cream, haven't noticed much of a change yet but I do sweat more in it, and combine that with a little exercise.  I'm sure I'm going to lose.Great idea, quality product, I'm going to rate it a little lower because no instructions came with it for how to care for it, and no instructions for getting out of it.  It is a bit of a trick if you don't have the use of both schoulders.  Feel free to email me if you have any questions.
5	1362096000	I have used this suit for 2 workouts so far. It is surprisingly comfortable and holds sweat well.I also wear it around as I work around the yard and it creates a sweat. I bought it to wear under my sauna suit which I am waiting to come in the mail.I currently wear it under a cotton sweatsuit and it works great. It works well during the workout and does not create any rubs or heat rashes. So far I love this and would recommend it to anyone. If you are a big person like me the 6XL was perfect. Thank, John
5	1362009600	I rate this product a perfect "10". The product is better than other sauna suit and belly fat burner. The suit can be used under workout clothes and it covers all problematic area. I sweat during workout regardless of intensity. In less than a month, I lost about 5 lbs.
5	1361836800	Over the last few months I have gone through a few of the "sauna suits".  All of them tore due to poor quality.  This product while more on the pricey side delivers.  I just got it in the mail and have used it twice so far.  I'm a bigger guy and according to their size chart am supposed to be 6XL.  I can tell you that this product fits a little big however, once you start working out it sticks right to you.  I guess I should also note that this is more or less a wet suit.Pros:Excellent qualityGood Fit, a bit largeCons:Pricey at $80...but well worth itHighly Recommend!
5	1361836800	I have both many sauna suits before that claim quality! So far, I am very pleased with this product! This is the first suit that I can exercise in and the zipper doesn't break. I even play racquetball in the suit! If you're looking for a good sauna suit, this is it. I will be buying another suit in a couple of weeks.
5	1361836800	This suit is exactly as stated it fits if you buy a size larger because it runs small but overall great product
5	1361836800	So Far love the suit been using it more for gym days run about 8 miles a day but use it more for the heat training thanks great product
5	1361750400	Love my sweat suit, it fits great( I did get a size up as others reviewers recommended). You can definitely see more sweat after you workout!
5	1361664000	For years and years I was using those silly PVC sauna suits...oversized, too big, bulky, swam in pools of sweat, looked like I was a Michelin space person lol...I finally got sick and tired of wearing it because it just seemed like my exercise performance was getting hindered and just didn't feel like I was giving it my full potential which isn't like me at all...I am pretty sure that I have reached my plateau and needed to get something that was going to provide better results and after much research came across the Kutting Weight clothing line...I read just about every review and decided to purchase this suit...the measurements on the website are pretty spot on, but I was still a bit nervous about whether or not the thing would fit (I ordered an XS and measurements are 36-26-38 approx)...anyway it showed up and it fit SNUG, but I liked that...the whole reason why I wanted to get away from the big baggie PVC ones...I tried it out yesterday, wore it under my sweats and sweatshirt and I couldn't believe the sweat that came out of me when I was done.  This is a TREMENDOUS product and I normally don't write reviews, but there was no way I wasn't going to write anything about this...the suit is pricey but it is worth every penny!  Very much recommend!!!  Extremely pleased and the customer service at Kutting Weight were great and helpful!  Plus the design is pretty sexy (I tried them on and my husband gasped!) I also ordered the XS women's sauna shirt as well as S women's sauna pants and when I try those I will write a review!  Mainly got those for my home yoga practices...stay tuned, but GET THIS SUIT...amazing!
5	1361404800	I've been looking for something of this quality that will last long time and I love this Kutting weight sweatsuit
5	1361318400	I wanted to sweat & this does the job! The fit and feel are pretty good, I can't complain. I wear it a couple times a week when I run.
5	1360972800	Really makes you sweat!  Have only used it a few times but am excited to have it.  Fits to size
5	1360972800	So i purchased this to help me get a jump start on my weight loss. I wanted it from all over. My arms, leggs, butt back and even my chest. THIS IS THE BEST SUIT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!! I would recommend it anyone and everyone looking to loos weight a little quicker, as i have gotten older of course the weight have gotten easier to gain and harder to lose. After one week I am down 5 lbs, and 23 inches all around. I like the fact that my skin tightens and I feel so FRESH after a shower. I feel like I have detoxed.I have not changed my eating habits, eating the recommended for my height, just added running every other day. The quality is excellent, the size is true to fit.....get it!!!
5	1360972800	this is a great.  i have had for a week and i truly enjoy it. It improves circulation, metabolism and a great sweat and work out....buy this suit
5	1360886400	I bought this product because I have been working out trying to lose weight for our wedding in a few months. After reading TONS of reviews and seeing nothing but good comments I decided to order. I read about ordering a size bigger, which I did and it fits like a glove! The XL was not available on amazon so I emailed Dustin and he got back to me very quickly and answered all my questions. Two days later Amazon received their shipment and the XL was available for order! I have been wearing this suit 3 days a week on the treadmill for about 35 min a day. I have lost 5 lbs so far in about two weeks! It really does make you sweat your A$$ off!!! It is very well made. My only gripe is that I feel that the $80 price tag is a little expensive... If this was made in USA I would have no problem paying that kind of money but since it is made in Taiwan, it seems a little spendy.  Overall it is a great product. I will keep updating on my weighloss journey! :)
4	1360800000	I GOT THE WRONG SIZE, THEY RUN SMALLER THEN YOUR SIZE CHART. IM STUCK WITH SOMETHING I CANT USE NOW. MAKE SURE YOU ORDER ONE AT LEAST 2 SIZES BIGGER THEN YOUR ACTUAL SIZE.
5	1360713600	I can not say enough good about this suit! Fits snug and comfortable and generates a lot of sweat!! Price was reasonable and shipping was fast.
5	1360627200	I wasn't sure which size to go with, so I emailed my height/weight (5'5.5" & 135lbs). I almost ordered an XS but was SO glad a Small was recommended instead. A size Small fits snugly on my legs & thru my shoulders. It fits well, but I definitely could not have worn an XS.I wear my sweat suit for am cardio at my house & sweat like crazy, which I love. After wearing it for a few days and really eating clean, my abs were more visible. It really helps sweat out the water weight.I don't know that I would wear this to the gym. Maybe with a t-shirt over it, I might wear it out of the house, but it really looks like a wet suit.It works great & I love this product. As a personal trainer, I recommend it to all my clients.
5	1360281600	The suit is perfect. Fits just right, the breathable parts are excellent.  I never feel overheated, I keep it on while I cool down. It's truly incredible, whether you want to lose excess water, or you want to keep you muscles nice and warm its perfect.
5	1360281600	I initially bought a neoprene belt for use during  a large weight loss attempt because I was worried about loose skin.I found that it helped me lose more weight at a crazy rate so I bought one of the cutting weight suits and it works even if you just wear it while watching TV.I don't recommend this but sometimes I would forget to take it off after working out for a few hrs or I would wear it and not make it to a workout and still got a good sweat.I purchased the fighting weight suit as well because it was cheaper and I wanted a spare but the quality was much lower and I actually ripped this suit in the first week.I would recommend you get one or two of these suits and skip the belts and cheaper suits unless you have back trouble in which case a belt is great daily wear item.I lost about 10 pounds in a week wearing this about 3-4 hrs a day not all of it was working out I think ideally you burn more calories a few hrs after working out but only do this if its a mild workout I couldn't imagine a heavy one you would be soaked.Overall it works it raises your body temperate and you burn more calories. There are countless dangerous drugs people use to raise their tempature for weight loss that don't do as good a job as this suit I can't believe I never thought of looking for an item like this before but it's simple brilliant science.
5	1360281600	the title says it all! no layering and you begin warming up as soon as you put this on! I run on a treadmill in my FREEZING COLD basement during the wee hrs. of morning. This helps A LOT!!!
4	1360108800	So, my fiance had a different suit before, which worked well, however, it was so gross as it would cause him to sweat massively and would leak out of the suit.  Furthermore it fir more like a balloon instead of close to his body and since we are military he would have to wear it under his PT uniform.  we are currently deployed and the original suit ripped so we decided to try something new.  OUTSTANDING IDEA!  The Kutting weight suit fits close to his body and the material absorbs the sweat.  He also likes the fact that the suit is flexible so he doesnt notice it as much as the other suit he had, thus being able to focus more on the workout.  Would definately buy this product again!!!
5	1360108800	delivered on time and as promised worked as promised  already lost a few pounds  use it for working out and martial arts it's very flexible and easy to move around in
1	1359936000	I have had better luck with other suits. I had to wear several layers of clothing over this suit to get the results that I had with other suits. I have been trying to find a way to contact seller to return the product but have had no luck. I am very unhappy with the product and the difficulty in finding someone to help return it. My suggestion is don't waste your time or money.
1	1359936000	The item sent to me was not the Kutting Suit, it was just the shirt.. That's why I rated it low
4	1359849600	First Id like to say I read the reviews before I purchased this suit and I too ordered two sizes bigger. Theirs no way I would have fit in an XL. I wore it now for 10 days (about an hour a day)and I'm down 3 Lbs. I don't workout in this suit. I only wear it doing my daily routine. It also works well to keep your body temp up when your sick if you can muscle though putting it on when your body hurts
5	1359676800	I love this product. I could not believe how much more flexible it makes me feel. I also noticed that it relieved some of my lower back pain as I workout. Also, it makes me sweat a LOT more which makes me feel cleaner when I finish my workout. This product truly detoxifies your body through an enormous amount of sweating. I am a veteran weightlifter with 11% body fat. I most certainly recommend it to however wants to super-charge their fitness level.
5	1359590400	make sure you drink plenty of water along the day .. you'll sweat it all out in half an hour of heavy exercise with this suit on ..Highly recommended ..
5	1359504000	I love this suit.  I don't know how effective it is so far in losing weight, but I definitely sweat a LOT more and its a comfortable suit.  Definitely order up in size those, especially females.  It would be nice if there was a suit targeted to females with less room in the crouch area and more in the breast area.
5	1359158400	The suit is great and really effective, it is the best thing I ever used in the gym floor. The suit really give u an extra support when you are doing cross fit excersizes. In addition you loose alot of water and fat without feeling any dizziness. if you are thinking of loosing weight or reshaping your body, this is a must.Regarding the size, I usually wear large sizes and I ordered the suit in large size and it perfectly fits.Thanks kutting weight...
5	1359072000	Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suitSo I bought one of these for myself and I loved it so much that I bought the boys and the shirt separates for my boyfriend.  I've bought several different sweat suits but this by far is my favorite.  It fits really well and boy do I sweat!  Sort of embarrasing in a good way...I use it in my group exercise classes and although it's cold right now so no one else sweats, I'm the only one that's leaving a puddle around me.  I work out a lot but this by far has been a great purchase.  The only thing is that I hand wash it after I use it every day, sometimes twice a day so that gets a little annoying and although it was only on my second wear - the stitching seemed to come apart a little so I'm extra gentle with it now.  I'm going to be buying the pants and separates for on the women's collection for myself and the hat.  My boyfriend got the hat with his and he loves it! I totally rave about this and he's like ohhkay you sound like a commercial for this thing so I figured I'd write a review.  Now I have to go put on my suit and go to kick boxing! :)
4	1358985600	I just received my suit and I am satisfied with it thus far.  I am sooo happy, though, that I took the advice of other purchasers when they recommended ordering a size up from what the sizing chart states.  I am a muscular 6', 220 lb male and the 2XL fits me fine.  I usually don't do reviews, but I felt I owed it to fellow shoppers in this case.The only reason I didn't give the suit 5 stars is because it is very loose around the back of the neck/ shoulder area... not snug at all.  I guess this could be by design though because this suit does get very hot and maybe it's made that way for more ventilation.
4	1358985600	I'm 5'7 211 pounds and I bought this suit (2X) to help shed weight quickly. The suit works GREAT but I tried to guess on the size using the table provided verses my body (muscular).... Their scale said a Large but that was not going to happen with me (pun at me). I probably could have made it with the XL but even the arms are tight on the 2X... Would be perfect if I were 6ft.
5	1358899200	Outstanding Quality. received product fast. would definitely recommend. Lost billions of pounds. there is only so much weight in the world, so unfortunately, all the weight I've lost, someone else has gained. may the force be with all of you!
4	1358899200	This product is amazing. It fits perfect and it really works. I have been using it to cut a few pounds here and there. I am 65 inches tall and weigh 155 and the small fits perfect!
5	1358812800	The suit even thou pricey it worth it. It does what the advertising says, the only problem like with everything new you have to stretch it out since its really tight. I would recommend it to my friends and family.
5	1358812800	Ilike the kutting weight sua sute l lost 1/1/2 lb in 3 days med size fit perfect I lost also 1 inc from my waist
5	1358726400	I bought this product in order to loose some weight. I just started a new nutritional program wanting to loose some weight from having my son. I have lost five pounds so far with the program I am following. The first time I put the suit on, it felt a little weird. You will sweat and make sure you stay hydrated. The suit will increase your body temperature. I would recommend this to anyone who seriously works out and has a few pounds they want to get off.
5	1358726400	I bought this to cut weight but love how it increases the difficulties in the simple exercises.  Tthe next day I feel satisfied from the my usual workouts, before the suit, I could not tell if my usual it made a difference.  There are times when I do not realize that I am sweating in the suit until I unzip the suit.  I recommend staying hydrated due to the nature of this product.
5	1358640000	Well first off, I paid for a faster shipping time, FedEx posted they had made delivery to my home, I complained to FedEx and didn't get product until 4 days later...that sucked. The product itself works great. Its just a wet suit but at least I dont have to be walking around looking like the michelin man with the baggy type sauna suit. The only problem I had was because of my chest size, it put me in a different height category for sizes and while everything fits good from my chest down Im left with extra material bunching up over my traps because the suit is too tall... other than that really good product.
5	1358553600	This suit will make you sweat!!Great durability,  does as it advertised. Within a week my pants felt looser in the waist.The only complaint I have is this -When you have finished your workout you are hot, sweaty, pulse racing  and exhausted. The first thing you want to do is cool off and remove the suit. This I have found challenging especially if you have large arms and shoulders.I find myself weirdly squirming around to try pulling the upper part of the suit off or ask someone to help. The suit needs some heavy duty straps attached on the back of the the arms near the seams.
5	1358294400	The shipping is awesome, I am out of the country.  It came a week and a half early, it fits just perfect.  I followed the fit guide and it is perfect.  It is warm and I can't wait to use it.
4	1358121600	I received the sauna suit a week ago.  The fit is good - a little long in the torso so it would easily fit a taller person as well. I purchased an XS and am 5'-3", 120 lbs.  I have lost 4 pounds since. I have been wearing the sauna suit while exercising;lifting and running. I thought I would get overheated but that has not been the case.  I now sweat a ton during workouts so I drink a lot of water during the day to stay hydrated. I am pleased with the quality and results and plan to continue using this product until I reach my goal!
5	1358035200	The Kutting Weight sauna suit has improved my workout, increased sweating, also improved my posture while working out. The material is good quality, well made and fits perfectly.
5	1357948800	Lost 10 pounds n 4 days wearing it doing everyday things I'm 224 5'7 got xl fits perfect do yourself a favor buy this product
5	1357948800	I don't know how anyone could give this product anything less than 4-5 stars!!! I love it!! Yeah it has a smell, the smell of what the product is made of. That's like complaining fried chicken smells like fried chicken! LOL! I gave it 5stars, the only reason I may have given it a 4 was that it took a little effort getting it off, but hey, I burned some more calories!!
4	1357948800	Great product!! Hides well under any thirst and shorts. Felt like a champ afterwards, from all the old sweat and toxins getting out. Remember to hydrate with new fresh h2o
5	1357948800	The pants are very comfortable and functionable.  The have the look of martial arts pants and have a great feel when working out.  I use this with the suite and shirt for my workouts.  Thanks
5	1357862400	Of all the sauna suits on the market, I feel this is the best product.  First, the Kutting Weight one piece targets all the necessary areas (thighs, stomach, buttocks and arms).  Second, the Kutting Weight sauna suit is made of a durable fabric: in this case, neoprene.  It's like wearing a wet suit (instead of snorkeling though, losing weight).  Third, the Kutting Weight logo is displayed but still understated; so anyone wearing this won't feel like a walking advertisement.  Fourth, the Kutting Weight sauna suit can be worn under clothing and remains completely inconspicuous.  I highly recommend this product to any person looking to buy a sauna suit and I also recommend looking closely at the size chart:  Once someone has decided on their size, add one more size.  For example, I fit the size XL but I ordered a 2XL, and it fits like a glove.
5	1357776000	This suit (I have the pants and shirt as well) has exceeded my expectations. The addtion of all Kutting Weight products has amped up my workouts considerably. The products are well made. The material, stiching, fit, comfort, and flexibility are all high quality. Please do not even attempt to compare these to the plastic sauna suits.I have had the gear for a month now and I would not even consider working out without wearing the shirt and pants or on alternate days, the sauna suit. They make you sweat, heat up your core and help you loose more than just water weight.Warmth - wore the shirt and pants out with just a normal coat and blew the snow out of my 1/2 mile long lane with my snowblower during a winter storm that was considered a blizzard in my county. I was sweating. Didn't feel the wind at all.Comfort - I weight lift, bike and do the treadmills regularly. All the clothes move with you not against you and you have full range of motion. Sometimes I wear the shirt, pants, and sauna suit all together and still have full range of motion, just seems like you have more layers.Care - I wipe the inside out with a cloth between washings in the shower stall at the gym. Hang them up and they are ready to wear the next day. I wash and dry with machines after every second use or so. No lingering smell problems.Fit - 6' 260lbs (when I received the clothes) I bought the 5XL shirt and it fit perfectly (I have a solid chest and arms, and keep most of my extra weight in my belly. 2XL pants fit my waist (Jean size 36 or 38) and the sauna suit was a 5XL -(Sauna suit fits, but right on the edge of being too big, If I would have been able to try them on I would have gone for the 4XL)Extra Value - I'm 47, lifted weights most of my life, and most of my joints have the normal ex-athlete wear and tear. I have found that wearing these clothes during lifting or cardio keeps me warm. I'm no longer sore in the knees, hips, elbows or shoulders since I have been wearing these clothes each time I work out!Bottom line - I have lost additional weight since wearing these clothes. It is not just water weight. I will purchase again as needed. Never would consider a plastic suit again, and probably will not work out with just a tee shirt and shorts again because my joints no longer ache after a hard workout. Love the sauna affect!
5	1357776000	I have some major back problems and so my mobility is limited.  I thought I would try this product just to see if it would help me any.  I started using it on Jan. 01, 2013 at a weight of 209.4.  Today is only Jan. 10, 2013 and I weighed in at 200.0 and I have done only limited exercises with it on.  This works!!  I can only imagine how I would look by summer if I had full mobility!  Thank you.
5	1357689600	I was a bit hesitant about writing a review in such a short time (a week to be exact), but I received an email from the seller asking me to review the product, so I thought "I like the product, and I know I'll keep it, so I'll just do it now."I actually wanted to buy this product for a long time, but the price was too high and the sizing chart kept me questioning. I followed the chart in order to get my size, it turned out it was a small size, but everyone here in the reviews said it was best to always go one size bigger, but still I went for the small. After finally saving the money to buy this and hesitating about which size I should get, I finally got the small suit.The suit arrived about a day before the estimated arrival date and as soon as I got it, I tried it on. It was tight of course, especially on the chest area, but it felt perfect, not too tight and not too loose.I went for a run with it the first day and boy did I sweat...I sweated like I never sweated before. Once I finished, I took off the suit and my whole body was dripping in sweat, I was surprised and at the same time amazed! For the next days, I kept wearing it for my usual 3 mile run and also for my weight resistance exercise. Of course, I still sweated like crazy.I keep on using this suit when I exercise and I can tell it is working because I can actually see my waist size going down and it never fails to make me sweat.For those who are debating to get this product, trust me, don't debate on it anymore, it works. Follow the sizing chart in order to get your correct size, I did and it worked perfectly for me.Without a doubt, this is one of the best fitness investments I have made.
5	1357603200	I have tried the rubber belts you wear around your waist with no success.  They would only last about a month, before ripping and coming apart.  When I googled "Men Sauna One Piece", I came upon Kutting Weight website.  I immediately fell in love with the one-piece sauna suit.  I ordered that and when I received it, tried it out while I did my daily workout routine.  OMG, this product is amazing.  I recommended it to my co-workers who also have tried those rubber waist belts.  For the price, this product is definitely worth every penny.  The kutting weight sauna suit fits great, feels great and is very comfortable when wearing it during my workout.  I immediately felt my body sweating.  So, for anyone out there tired of those rubber waist belts, this is definitely the product you want.  On the website they also have tops, pants and hats.  With the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit, 2013 is going to be the year of sweating off the pounds...
5	1357603200	Got a Large and it fits really tight. I am ready to shed some pounds to be at my goal weight. Thanks Kutting Weight.
5	1357516800	Great, Great, GREAT! Lost 6lbs first week. With light cardio, upper body work out. My only regret is, I don't order complete suit. Thanks!PS the wife says I look good wearing suit. Lol!
5	1357344000	I ordered this for myself to lose some weight and started a jogging program with it.  I am 5'8" and weigh 190 pounds. Ni ordered the XL suit and it fits very snugly.  I wear a t-shirt inside and a t-shirt outside of the suit and wear basketball shorts over the bottom.  You can hardly tell I have the suitor with my outer shorts and t-shirt on.  I start my jogging about 4:30pm until my GPS says I completed 5 miles.  I thought it would be a lot hotter wearing this suit but it actually does not feel hot at all and mainly warm.  When jogging in the rain it keeps me warm and I don't mind it at all.  I take a water break at the 3 mile mark and good to go from there.  When I am done my under t-shirt is soaking wet from all the sweat.  I rinse my t-shirt in cold water and throw it in the washer together with my sauna suit.  I put the washer setting on rinse and spin mode and hang dry it when it is done.  It comes out smelling like new again and the quality is well made and should last a long time.  5 STAR FOR QUALITY!!!Update: 8 months later...This sauna suit is holding up well and still looks great and hardly worn at all.  I ride my bike for exercising 3-4 times a week with the sauna suit on with a t-shirt inside.  My rides are anywhere from 10-25 miles.  I now weigh 175 and hoping to go down to 165.  I also started doing 100 push ups, 200 crunches before starting my bike rides also with the sauna suit on.  Just make sure to bring a bottle of water with you so you are hydrated during exercising.  I also eat a protein bar at my 10 mile mark and rest for 2-3 minutes before taking off to finish the other 10 miles or so.
5	1357084800	Great product, really works as specified. I was a little skeptical before purchasing the product but I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. need to buy two sizes larger for better fit.
5	1356998400	I ordered 2 neoprene weight loss sauna suits and a sauna shirt from Kutting Weight Clothing for Christmas and I am absolutely thrilled.  They are very well made and sturdy and the design is just beautiful!  Especially the long sleeve shirt as it has these beautiful flames on both sides that are very attractive.  Plus they make you sweat like crazy and they have the perfect amount of compression.  You will be very happy with these products.
5	1356912000	I thought I would write about sizing because I was so unsure when I bought this product.  I would recommend the 2 sizes bigger as in most reviews.  I am 5'6 and 180 and ordered an XL which was a good fit.  This also was a good fit for my chest which is a 38 C/D.  Hope this helps
5	1356825600	I purchased a Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit to help increase the intensity of my workouts. After doing much research I decided to pull the trigger. I carefully read the sizing information. Much too my delight the suit I purchased fits perfectly. Its not too loose or tight, it fights like a glove. I finished by 2nd workout with the suit today. If definitely increases the amount of sweat, but it also heats up the muscles in my back and legs. The extra heat helps me get loose faster. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and I will be making additional purchases including just the shirt.
5	1356652800	I'm very happy with my purchase. The sauna suit fits great and really gets my pulse rate up when exercising.Make sure you read the size chart before ordering. Durable, looks good and effective
5	1356652800	I use a suit every day when cycling and doing workouts. I'm 6'10" tall and 270 lbs weight, got size 5XL, fits good. Perfect product.
5	1356220800	I am pleased with the suit, my husband has one and liked his and had good results so I decided to try it. The fit is good I was at 172 when I purchased it so I got the medium at 5'9" it's perfect
5	1356220800	I wanted to wait a month to give myself a chance to really get use to using this, and here is my impressions after using it for a month.  First like every says, order larger than you think you need, this fits very tight and will cause trouble if you get your normal size.It has been well made, holding up well on both stitching and zipper.  The seams appear to be quite solid, and I expect to have no trouble from them any time in the near future.On how well it works, well to start with it is currently winter and I exercise in an unheated garage.  Because I start so cold I wasn't expecting a huge difference, but now I've come to expect to be quite wet after some basic exercise.  In fact, it works so well in the cold that I'm starting to get concerned about what will happen during the summer when it will be in the mid 90's.The advice about getting plenty to drink while exercising would seem to be very safe advice, and I will be sure to explore my limits with care since I don't want to have any trouble from over heating.
4	1356134400	By using the weight & height chart, I ordered my suit, " XL ".After receiving the suit, I tried it on only to find out it was to tight over the stomach area making it hard to breath.I am 5 ft 9 215 pounds which put me in an "XL" mens sz. I may have to loose 5 or 10 pounds before this suit does me justice.Neoprene does support perspiration and I do acknowledge this as proof. I will keep this Sauna Suit and use it after loosing 5 to 10 more pounds.The product does provide 3 areas for venhilation in the right spots. The thickness of the product is satisfactory. I would recommend the "Sauna Suit" to others, just order a size larger then what the chart suggests.
5	1356048000	Every morning i put this on and do 25 minutes of cardio and i have lost 20 pounds in three weeks, if you want to shed some pounds this product its a very good thing to have .I am very happy with the results.
4	1356048000	Two of the products work great.  One pair of shorts was not what I expected , the waist band not as high as the picture showed.
5	1355875200	This product fits well and is very comfortable...does not restrict movement and it really makes me sweat...i love it...yes indeed
5	1355702400	I absolutely adore it. Wearing it even during my house chores and burning, burning, burning. If I had one request that would be a separate model for women. One that fits better around chest and it allows to use to use the bathroom without taking the whole suit off.Highly recommended! Thanks!
5	1355702400	I've only had the suit for a week or so and have worn it on a few heavy cardio workouts.  It does exactly what it says it will do.  Within minutes I can feel my core heating up and the intensity of my effort really increases.  I haven't used it long enough yet to see any noticeable weight loss, but I can't imagine my metabolism is not speeding up with the amount of sweat this suit produces.  The mesh areas in the crotch and armpits are just enough to provide some relief without compromising the integrity of the suit and its purpose.  All-in-all I am very happy with the product and plan to use it for quite some time.  I would recommend its purchase to anyone on the fence about it.  It was recommended to me by a co-worker who is also very satisfied with the suit.  It's  alittle tricky to slip out of once you are ready to take it off, but after a few times you get the hang of it.  Someone to help you pull it off from behind would completely mitigate the problem.
5	1355616000	I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I am down 5 pounds. I put it on before I run on the treadmill, and the sweat starts dripping in a matter of minutes. Fit is great. Definitely recommend if you are looking to lose the extra pounds.
5	1355443200	I've only had this product for since the 4th, but I must say it's an awesome suit, like so many others have said, you feel warmth almost instantaneous. I began sweating after about 4/5 minutes after putting the suit on.My only thing is, is that the suit sizing is tricky, I ordered up a few sizes like others said to do and got a somewhat loose suit, only part that was tight was around the chest part. I still kept it though, didn't quite feel like sending it back ;) and besides it still works great.
5	1355356800	This suit definitely makes you sweat. I would also reccomend buying a size larger than you usually wear. Been wearing for a about a week and a half now along with a good workout and strict diet and I've lost 5 lbs.
5	1355270400	This is a good workout suit. well-made. It makes up sweat and is comfortable. I would recommend this for a better workout.
5	1355270400	This is my second purchase of Kutting products and its amazing.  The best I have owned.... I like this one because I can ride my bike and still receive and additional sweat.  Do yourself a favor and purchase one you won't be sorry....
5	1355184000	A little pricey, but love it!! It actually made me feel like I worked out really hard. If it didn't cost so much I would order another one.
4	1355097600	Item fits well and does as advertised.  I weighed in two pounds less after using the suit for the first time.  Only complaint is the cost as $80 is a bit steep but maybe worth it in the long run.
3	1355011200	it is ok. would be perfect if i was 6 or 5'10  .  this is made for very tall women or normal men.  xs should be offered.
5	1355011200	I love this thing. I use it every work out. I also use a stomach strap under. Ive lost 4 inches on my stomach line in less then 2 months. Makes me sweat like crazy. Fits perfect. 100% Back this product.
5	1354838400	Let me first start off by saying I am 6'4&#34; and a lean 180lbs, and went with an XL size despite the sizing chart provided being a little off based on height vs weight, and this XL suit fits me nicely, with a little room to spare for breatheability. You obviously want this neoprene suit comfortably tight, not loose so that you feel and keep the burn close to the skin to generate the best results. I have never tried to cut weight before but I want to drop my weight down to about 170lbs again. I eat healthy, exercise and sometimes weight is gained over time regardless of lifestyle habits. I just turned 40 yet most people believe I am in my late 20s, early 30s. So eating right + portion control and exercising regularly does keep the body looking and feeling good.I decided to test this suit out as a gamble, but based on all the positive marks left by users/buyers of this Kutting Weight product, my gamble paid off. I opted for the suit instead of the shirt, or the shirt and long pants combo, because it just is a better fit for me me more as a biker/peddler (mountain and road).I have only had this a week now and I can officially say it works. You sweat buckets in a good way, totally detoxify yourself, and my skin looks and feels amazing too. Because it traps the heat in, you will MUST have lots of water with you and listen to your body's signals when exercising to ensure you don't over do it and harm yourself.I can speak toward the cardio workout while wearing this biking, and you generate a lot of heat and sweat, so make sure you wear a t-shirt under the neoprene to catch the moisture and to gauge how much water you are losing.The design is comfortable and sleek looking. Cleaning is a cinch. Just shower it down gently to remove the human moisture and air dry / hang dry and presto, good to go!I highly recommend this product.
4	1354752000	The Kutting Weight Sauna Suit arrived in good shape and well ahead of schedule. The material is like that of an inner tube, but still very comfortable. I bought the right size for myself going one larger. It is a little big, but fits fine. For now, I am only able to work out for 25-30 minutes so I hope after the holidays I will be able to see a drop in size dramatically. For now it is only minimal without changing eating habits. Will review again once the holidays are over with.
5	1354147200	The suit fits perfect.  I ordered an XL and good thing I did the large would not have fitted.  I'm larger up top so I needed the extra room.
5	1354060800	Having already lost weight on an excercise program over the last several months prior to getting the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit, I was uncertain what size to get.  All my suits were 44L and I had only recently purchased a sportcoat in size 42L.  I selected the size based on size 42 and it fits absolutely like a glove.  I am using it to treadmill for 45 minutes-1 hour daily as well as weight training 3x per week.  The level of sweat is amazing and I am experiencing a boost in metabolism during workouts.  My workouts are more intense and enjoyable.  One of the few products I've bought that exceeded my expectations and I can't imagine working out without it.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to lose weight and/or improve the effectiveness of their workout.
5	1354060800	I don't usually write reviews on products but not too long ago I was feeling a little "soft" (6'2" - 235lbs) - I train BJJ and was feeling sluggish. So I get the sauna suit and I swear, I may've worn it about 3 or 4 times while training and another handful of times to run (2 miles). About a month and a half (maybe 2) later I'm down to 215lbs - I'm planning on getting down to about 199lbs and with this suit that shouldn't be a problem at all. It's great having guys you haven't trained with in a while see you and immediately notice the difference.
5	1354060800	The kutting weight sauna suit is so cheap in price and so high in quality. When you are trying to lose those extra 5-10 pounds for a fight it works A LOT better than garbage bags all over your body. In my case I am using the suit in a completely different level, I am using the suit to get rid of extra toxins in my body. I was diagnosed with cancer 2 months ago, I am curing my cancer by my self and not letting the killers ("the ones who call them selves doctors") put me in the coffin. This suit is SO effective at helping me detox my body of impurities that AMAZINGLY the tumor is shrinking so rapidly and effectively that it is almost gone. Of course I am supplementing my body with other organic stuff but this suit is well worth more than what they are asking for. Ya'll have a good day and don't doubt your self about buying this suit. Amazing and God bless
5	1353974400	I was much more impressed with the build quality of the Kutting Weight neoprene weight loss sauna suit than the person wearing the suit.  It was exactly as described and it does everything it was advertised to do.  Profuse perspiration is a given and the heat buildup allows my tired leg muscles to pump longer.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and would not hesitate a minute to purchase another one.
5	1353974400	This suit gave my body the needed boost to finally break my weight Plateau! (i think that's spelled right?) Everything that I was doing to loose the few additional pounds failed until i got this suit.When i first tried it on i was worried that i should have bought the next higher size.  These maybe are sized small. But still i love it and it fits better now.
5	1353456000	This is the best sweat suit i have ever purchased, it really lives up to what it claims to do. I recommend it to any and everyone looking to jump start their exercise regimen.
5	1353110400	Love this product. I have been using the suit for a week and i'm in loe with it. I sweat more and lost about 2lbs. It fits right and is made of quallity material. I highly recomend buying this suit.
5	1352764800	Kutting Weight sauna suit is a well made suit.  I am 5'5" and 156 lbs and wear a medium.  When I wear it during treadmill routine I really sweat.  The good thing compared to cheap sauna shirts I have tried is the sweat does not drip all over. There are also vented areas under the arms & between the legs for breathability. Clean up is easy.  I hang inside out in shower and spray with warm water and spritz with lite soap & water mixture.  It is difficult to rid the excess water so I get some out and then roll in a xlg bath towel and press to absorb the excess.  Have only been wearing in the last week so I can't claim weight loss as of yet. I would recommend.
5	1352764800	I have been using this suit for 3 days now. It does what describes. You can really feel the heat when exercising!! I'll be updating when I see more results.
5	1352592000	had a mix up with my order.  but they reconciled it quickly with a refund and let me keep the cutting weight shirt.  works great and is easy to put on and off.  free range of motion when using the shirt
5	1352419200	Just the suit I was looking for my sister. She did like it a lot. It makes her sweat a lot when she runs or jogs. We bought size M and it fitted her.
5	1352073600	Ive used it only few times but yes it's like real sauna ! After I'm done running I'm soaked in sweat. Can't tell about results yet but I will get back to u on that. So far I like it a lot
5	1352073600	I never write reviews, NEVER! But I had to take time out to say that this is the best investment I have ever made!
5	1351987200	Great high quality product.Easy to slip on and off.Zipper is strong and stitching is superb.Great for losing water weight.I wear it when lifting and running. I log about 40-45 miles per week and this suit is durable.
4	1351555200	Suit is good. Makes you sweat but u need to drink enough water through out the day. Also sleeves are quite tight I had to cut them off looks even better sleeveless
5	1351555200	I must say this is an awesome product for anyone looking to lose weight, I started at the largest size and have cut two sizes since wearing this product.  I must tell you if your not use to be compacted and training your body to breath you may want to reconsider, but it trains you to learn to breath and you sweat like crazy so it's imperative that you drink tons and tons of water.
5	1351036800	This SWEAT SUIT is AWESOME.. I bought this suit a week ago and I have already lost weight.  The suit was tight when if first put in on for ZUMBA but now it FITS LIKE A GLOVE.. love it love it love.. RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT..
5	1350864000	Received order the next day!Fits GREAT!!I've lost a total of 7 sustainable pounds so far!Love how easy it is to clean!Downside: needs some sort of tab on the back of the collar to make it a little easier to get on. First time was a pain! Overall I love it!
4	1350864000	Just put it on for the first time, sweating like crazy.  Good kind of sweat, love it.  Will keep on my diet and workout program....
5	1350432000	If you want to lose weight than I recommend that you purchase the neoprene weight loss sauna suit, you will not go wrong. The sauna suit is well made and the $79 you pay you will get a band for your money. I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks and that is with a workout of 30 min 4x a week. Just make sure that you order the right size that on the chart. I purchase the suit through Amazon.com
5	1350432000	I wear this to the gym and to bed (silly, I know). It keeps the water retention from a medication I take off. Started working immediately. Totally worth the money. Beats wearing 4 layers of Under Armour any day!You WILL sweat and in places you didn't know you could sweat. Dries easily and quickly.Sizing is on their site and is standard and straightforward. I'm a size 8 with 34D, usually a medium in other clothes, and the medium suit is perfect. Small would definitely be too small, perhaps a large would fit if you don't like a wetsuit tight fit but that's what you need for it to work.Well-made and effective. You won't regret this purchase.
5	1350086400	This is a great addition to their hat and shirt. Also great on those chilly morning runs.  The fit is perfect and the product does exactly what they say... Makes you sweat by trapping in your body heat.I have lost 165 lbs in a little over 2 years and was looking for something to help with the last 25 when I found kutting weight products about 4 months ago. I am now with in 3 lbs of my goal of 169 and would definitely say your products have helped. I started off hesitant and just got the shirt and after seeing results with that I got the hat and the suit because I figured that I would help me continue with outdoor exercising with the summer ending.  Granted doing a good workout with them will give instant water weight reduction and that will comeback shortly it does seem to kick your body into letting go of some excess fat faster than just good eating and the same exercise. Plus I really like the mental feeling of knowing that what you just did was at the level that caused you to dump the water. Just putting on the suit does not equal a sweat session and even some minimal exercise in it at this point does not cause massive sweat so when I do finish and am soaked I can be assured that I was at a good level of activity.
5	1350000000	This suit beats out all others and does a whole body weight loss.  I'm ordering the separate top and bottom as a more complete weight loss suit.  Their products are true to size so there's no guess work involved.  The materials are excellent and durable.  I especially like the distinct materials used in the underarm area and between the thighs to allow for extra air and reduced friction.  I'm buying a suit for my brother as well.  We've both been using the cheap sauna suits sold at sports stores and Walmart.  They rip and tear so often that the cost of these durable Kutting Weight suits equal or are even less than what we end up spending on replacements.  For those looking for a miracle weight loss option, this item is not it since it doesn't exist.  However, for those looking to boost their weight loss program, the Kutting Weight products will give you that edge.  You'll loose optimal water weight, reduction in fat cells and tightened skin.  Be sure to have water before, during and after your workouts.
5	1349913600	I needed this.Due to the fact that all the other products have torn or rolled. I think if you're trying to cut weight this is the product
5	1349654400	I was looking for a sauna suit that was not out of cheap plastic. I did some researched online and saw the Kutting Weight neoprene weight loss sauna suit. I checked you tube to see what was the product was about and how well it worked. I liked what I saw and went to Kutting Weight and e-mail them about ordering the right size. They e-mailed back that same say and told me what size should get. I'm 5'1'' with a 44 chest size, so I had to get XL. I have been using the product for about a week now and it works as advertised. It gives me a great sweat but doesn't get me over heated. Maintenance is easy, just hand wash it and hang it up to dry. I plan on ordering a second one so I can interchange them during the week. If your looking to drop water weight and help get yourself get back in shape, I recommend using the Kutting Weight sauna suit with your diet and exercise routine to help you achieve your goals.
5	1349481600	Great product, better than I was expecting. Great quality and definitely go a size higher than you think for a comfortable fit.
5	1348963200	we are professional athletes...muay thai,K1...love this product to make weight for a fight.!!!!..IT WORKS ....NO stress for any fighter...we suggest this product for any athlete....
5	1348790400	I am very pleased with my purchase I wish I had bought this before my last sauna suit.I love the material that its made out of I don't like to work out in long sleeves or long pants and by it being a one piece short set that was great . I have always lifted weight and worked out even played a Lil football for a minute been on the heavy side all my life but recently I decide that I wanted to loose some weight so I started eating better and increased my cardio for the last 20 weeks I have been dropping on average 1.5 lbs a week and for me that was great but it wasn't enough so I stared doing some research and come across this product and decided to give it a try I figured hey what have I got to loose and man do I love the results. I will say this you must drink plenty of water and be careful not to stay in it to long because over use will leave you feeling weak and drained for a little bit . I weigh every Monday morning and I have weighed twice since I started working out in the suit and I have lost 6 lbs in two weeks that's twice as much as I was loosing with out it I must say its the best I have ever owned as far as getting the job done and I have owned about six different ones over the years now the test is to see what the life of the suit will be . Its a must buy for anyone wanting to drop some extra weight
5	1348790400	I can't say anything about this suit that hasn't already been said, IT IS GREAT!!! I think I read through everyone of the reviews, at least a few times, and went back and forth with my decision for a couple weeks. Man, was that a waste of time. The best advice I can give is just order it. If you want the best get this suit. If you want something cheap and something of less quality order something else. It's that simple!
5	1348790400	Only using the sauna suit at the moment and i noticed results only having it for a week i lost 5lbs and kept it off i plan on getting the shirt and pants it a sturdy product and i look forward to more product releses from kutting weight
5	1348790400	I BOUGHT THIS SUIT BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF BUYING THOSE PIECE OF CRAP PLASTIC ONES BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO USE THEM BECAUSE ONCE THE SUMMER IS OVER I HIT MY WORKOUT PRETTY HARD!!! SO I BOUGHT THIS SUIT AND IT IS AMAZING... I LOVE THIS SUIT AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE SEEKING TO SWEAT A LOT. TO BE HONEST, I BOUGHT THIS SUIT ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO, BUT I DIDNT USE IT UNTIL LAST WEEK, WHEN I STARTED DOING MY INSANITY WORKOUT AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME AROUND I PUT THIS SUIT ON AND IN ONE WEEK I HAVE LOST 4 POUNDS AND IT IS GREAT!!!! SO THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY.... GET THIS!!!!
5	1348617600	Info:6'2245lbsPurchased XXLI bought this mainly to do Insanity with to give me something extra since after completing Insanity 3 times, I wanted something that will make my body work more. This product makes me sweat like crazy. It literally feels like I'm doing Insanity in a 100+ degree room and sweat is just coming down my face, my arms and my legs. After one work out I was sweating so much from my legs that my socks were drenched.The suit fits nicely and snug on my body but it still lets me move around during the work outs. I also wore it when I was doing weights, although it kind of limits the movement of your arms it wasn't that bad. I thought of it as more of a challenge then anything else.
4	1348617600	This review is similar to my other review of the "Shirt".  The main difference between this and the shirt, as far as the upper body, is that this is Short-Sleeved; while the "Shirt" is Long-Sleeved.I've worn this out on hikes and jogs a few days since I have received it and it really works as you'd expect.  I've hiked about 30 miles and 375floors (elevation) this past week.  Despite a very, very minor discomfort with it, there are no rashes or anything that causes rubbing on your skin.  Essentially this is a wetsuit type thing.  I didn't give it a 5-star only because I think it would be nice to have a suit like this with Long-sleeves and Long-pants.  As it is, this "suite" is short pants and short sleeves.  I'm overweight and working out and losing weight, so I had to get a larger size, actually the largest they have; it fits nicely and I'm already getting close to needing a smaller one.  It stretches nicely to fit larger men - though initially, you might want to ask someone for a hand in putting it on the first time; if you're comfortable with that sort of thing... :)
4	1348531200	I like everything about the sauna suit except the the material used under the armpits and the crotch...if they werent there the suit could have a dual use, working out or swimming in cold water...I understand the concept of breathablity..but when working out I am not in it long enough for that to be a concern..
5	1348185600	So far so good, I measured my chest and brought the next size up.  So it fits perfect.  I have used it twice and I look forward to updating you in the future.
5	1348185600	great fit wish they were a bit more economical so i can get the other pieces. Otherwise, as described. Great sweat.
5	1347926400	Suit was better quality than I expected and gets the job done. I was hesitant but I'm glad I made the purchase.  I use it all the time.
5	1347926400	Great product. You can feel the heat off of your body minutes after putting the suit on. It leaves me drenched in sweat after my workouts or runs. I had doubt about the sizing, but the chart was dead on for me. I would reccomend this to anyone looking to sweat off the pounds.
3	1347840000	I like the suit, but it already has a tear after 1 use.  Thankfully the tear is not major but i was expecting better quality.
5	1347667200	I was looking for a product to optimize my workouts and I thank god I ran across this product. I contacted Dustin to get his advice on fitting, and he suggested XL ( I am 511 and I currently weigh 220) and wow! It fits like a glove! I can not be happier. It is really comfy and you will sweat your ass off!!  I also bought the pants and the shirt. I am hoping to loose all of the extra weight. Good luck !
3	1347408000	The order was received in the said time period. Having it available through Amazon Prime is great. I was able to start using the product right away.As far as the product itself, in hindsight, I would have preferred to have the shirt separate from the shorts. Also, it doesn't feel natural with movement due to the thickness. I would have rather gotten the thinner versions if I could do it over again. However, it certainly does what it said. Especially when you put a running shirt and pants over it.
5	1347408000	Haven't received yet, so I can't speak to performance, but thought it would be helpful to see a size chart...here you go:Size  Weight  ChestXS  100-125  32-24"S  125-140  34-36"M  140-160  36-38"L  160-180  38-40"XL  180-200  40-42"2XL  200-220  42-44"3XL  220-240  44-46"4XL  240-260  46-50"5XL  260-280  48-52"6XL  280-300  50-54"Also, I went online to Kutting Weight's website and spoke to an agent - my weight is exactly 180 - he advised the following:"This Suit is made to fit tight. Since the whole purpose of the suit is to cut weight, you would probably be okay with the Large, the final decision is yours to make though. You can return or exchange the item if you do not like the way it fits."And, it can be used by men or women.  Happy sweating!!
5	1347062400	I used to have a trimmer belt..... after time it ripped apart. I saw this suit for an amazing price and love it for everything that it is.
3	1346630400	i think it will help me alot i was ready for it when it arrived but !@#$...i ordered the wrong size so now i have to send it back and it sucks because it's a third party order so now i gotta send it back wait till amazon gets the okay to refund me then i'll re order it then it'll be another wk till i get so stay tuned folks when i get it and start using it i'll let you know the results
5	1346198400	Great product since the first use I started to sweat like never before with only half an hour at the gym, I recomended to who ever wants to sweat like never before.
5	1346112000	Just received sauna suit today, 5 days after I placed my order, great! I have NOT used it yet, but want to post regarding the biggest concern I had when ordering. The size I should order... A lot of reviews (and I read 'em all) discussed issues with the size and how to order. Some said to order according to your normal shirt size, some said to go one size bigger than that, and many said to follow the size chart provided by the manufacturer. Heck, even the manufacturer said that sizing can be tricky. Wow, what to do? I look at the sizing chart with its 3 categories (height/weight/chest diameter).My t-shirt size is 2XL. For weight, I fall into the >270# category, specifically 285#. This would put me in a 6XL. For height, I am 6'4", so anything from 2XL and up is good to go. Chest diameter: 44", get a 2XL or 3XL. Hmmmm.I went with height/chest measurements to order, as well as listening to the "buy one size up" crowd, and got the 3XL. It truly is the perfect fit! Zips up without a fight, but not loose or baggy anywhere. I think the 2XL woulda been a tad too snug. A 6XL would've been hilarious, but not the idea I was going for.What I am getting at here is this: I am not a gym rat or built like a brick house, but also not built like peter griffin (as another reviewer put it), so for those of you who are not in the best shape but aren't in the worst shape, I recommend the "one size up" method. It is truly the way to order these to fit. If this does not work out for you, sorry for the rotten advice.
5	1346112000	Ive used this product a few times already and can always tell the difference. I jog and hike a lot to lose weight and wearing this suit gives me more bang for my buck, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a change in their workout routine.
5	1345852800	This suit really works. I wear it to exercise, and at work under my coveralls. I could tell a difference in my waist in just four days! You will sweat the entire time you wear the suit. If you want to sweat away pounds, I recommend buying this suit. It's worth every penny.
5	1345680000	I previously purchased a good sauna suit from Amazon, it was your typical bulky suit that would make you sweat like crazy but was really not designed to use as weightlifting gear. I really like that the Kutting Weight suit has a nice tight fit and I wear it under my normal workout gear. It does not get in the way at all and actually makes me feel as though I have a little extra body support which is quite comforting during my workouts. The material feels great and I think that it will last a long time. I use it 5 times a week and never workout without it. As far as sizing goes, I just measured my chest and ordered accordingly.
4	1345593600	I am 5'2" and I have all of this extra space that this even in XS doesn't cover. I am thin with curves and it still leaves me with bulky shoulder space on top or air rolls in the middle. Besides that, I really like it, maybe I'll get it tailored. My friend has it and he's 5'8" and he loves it!!!
5	1345420800	I've had the suite for about 2 weeks so far.  Got it to increase my metabolism during workouts and increase sweat to help lose weight.Suite is very well made and is as comfortable as it can be for wearing a neoprene body suite.  I had to send the XXL back cause I ordered a size too big (5' 11", 210, 44" chest, 36" waist).  The XL fits very well except for one extra ~1" material in the stomach area, but pretty close.  I think the L would be too small.It works.  I start to sweat as soon as I put it on.  No weight lose yet, but that's my problem.  The suite is doing what it should - - make you sweat. Cleaning after a workout is not bad but does take some time to clean & rinse & wring out.  I hand it in the morning to dry the rest of the way and it is dry by the next morning.  Great addition to my workout gear.
5	1345420800	I was nicely surprised to find that the suit has a cotton crotch and underarms.  Don't understand why this was omitted from the description.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the body of this one piece suit is long, so if you are short-waisted, it will be somewhat saggy.  Wish they would come up with a two piece suit, shorts & zipper top.  Their pull-over, long-sleeved shirt would be too claustrophobic for me.  The sizing seems right to me.  I am 5'1", 150# and somewhat large in the chest area and the x-large fits fine. The suit does have a strong rubber-like smell to it but it goes away after you wash it.  I wash the suit in the shower after each use.
4	1345420800	I was unbelievably impressed with this suit.  I was looking for a suit that I could get a good sweat in with my workout but without feeling like I was wearing a bag like those other suits.  Love it!  The one complaint I have is I'm short 5'2" 138 lbs and ordered the small, the torso was longer than expected but fit everywhere else nicely.  I'm overall satisfied.  Thank you Kutting Weight!!
5	1345420800	Amazing product for anybody who wants to cut weight. I received the Sauna Suit a week ago but, I have been busy with work that I just got a chance to use it. The moment I put the Sauna Suit I felt it working.  I am looking forward to see how much weight I will lose in the next few weeks. I love the product and everyone should have one. Enjoy
5	1345334400	I use this suit evertime I run or play kinect's dance revolution game and yes it helps me sweat more. I feel so great after each workout! My body is more toned now and  I recommend this product to everyone! Since its so effective I bought another one for my mom.
5	1345248000	If I'm not sweating when I work out, I don't feel like I'm accomplishing much. I used to wear the 'trash bag' plastic suits. But after while, those wear out and becomes uncomfortable after awhile. I was looking here on Amazon.com for an alternative solution and I found it in this Kutting Weight Sauna Suit!!! I wear it every time I work out. And I'm definitely seeing the results! Its comfortable and form-fitting. Not 'bulky' and uncomfortable like the 'trash bag' suit.
4	1345075200	I was very excited to receive this product. I think its the extra edge I need to lose the last few lbs. But I had to return it because it was too big. According to the sizing chart I was between a small and medium, and I ordered the medium. The sizing chart might be more accurate for men, but if you're a woman like me, you may want to order the smaller size if you're between sizes. Thats what I'm planning to do. I think the small will be perfect.....i ordered the small and its perfect now. If between sizes, I would definitely recommend ordering the smaller size. I've only used it a few times so far, but VERY happy with it so far. Product is exactly as I thought it would be.
5	1345075200	I really recommend this product it helps a lot when u workout. U don't need to wear anything else. Im really happy i think i make a good choice getting this
5	1344988800	I just received my suit on Friday. I have used it for 3 workouts this week. I do a mixture of interval cardio, cardio and weight training. My workout lasts about an hour. So far I have lost 5 lbs per workout. My workouts feel much more intense than they did before the suit. I am 6'2" and weigh 219, I bought a 3x and it fits great. I was nervous about the sizing because I have a long torso, but that is not an issue. I also bought the hat
5	1344729600	This suit really makes my workouts allot more intense. I do not have any complaints at all about the suit.
5	1344643200	This is an excellent way to cut wieght. The suit is comfortable and durable. I am very impressed with this product!  Thanks!
5	1344556800	This suit is the best... It comes in Huge Plus Sizes...They thought about everyone when they made this suit. I love you guys~
5	1344470400	Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suitI am a,46 yr old woman who has lost 115 lbs with the help of this product. I wear it when I go walking to sweat the pounds and inches away.
5	1344384000	Ordered a size based upon the chart, chart was spot on for my size. I wear the sauna suit even for casual weight lifting workouts and still generate a sweat. great product.
4	1344124800	It s awesome. Thank you! I can go jogging and swimming even twice a day now and I have the same feeling that loosing weight is so nice and easy as if the only think you should do is changing your cloths.
5	1344038400	I read all the pro's and con's of this product and it is worth it! you can feel the burn and even though it is a tight squeeze (which i lay down on the bed to get in) it is worth buying.  Sweat pours off and pounds are beginning to melt off!Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit

5	1343692800	I have used my suit for the past few runs and have been throughly impressed! The suit is of high quality and will really give you the additional kick in the butt that will be needed when training/losing those final few pounds.  I highly recommend this product!!
5	1343606400	Great quality and easy to use. Also, it arrived earlier than expected. I use it four or five times a week. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the product.
5	1343260800	Got it on time. Really great quality and fits well. Within few mins after putting it on you are getting sweat. Now lets see how durable it is...
5	1343260800	The Suit is very good. Have worn it to work out & very comfortable, easy to get on & off. I have no complaints!
5	1343088000	I'm 250lbs 5'11'. I purchassed a 4x. I fit great! Every user of product should list their measurment for potential buyers. I do 45 minutes on elipticle every over morning. The water just pours out of my body! I'm going to buy the bennie cap today. I'll tell everyone to try this product! It  works It works It works.
5	1342742400	Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He was Extremly happy. He wears it all the time when working out. I have witness all the sweat that drips off him. It's amazing if you want to loose weight i recomend you to purchase it, you will not regret it. He also uses it when he is riding his road bike.I am thinking of purchasing one for me!!
4	1342483200	I bought it to lose weight and it been great at that. I''ve gone from 205 to 195 in 4 weeks. But it it has made me more efficient. Keeps my muscles warm and tight so I'm less prone to injury. And helps you keep your form. It give me a good muscle pump. You have to watch out that you don't over heat in it. But, if you open the zipper that is all that I needed. I'll be buying more product from them in the future.
5	1342310400	I love this product so far it does what it is suppose to do, and thats make you sweat its easy to wash and it drys really fast I the material wouldnt rip easy its been a great experience thus far.
5	1342137600	I like it alot -- fits well and does the job -- will be buying another one very soon..  put it on and go work out, run, walk
5	1341964800	I purchased the Kuttweight suit in Oct. or Nov. When I started working out I weighed an embarrassing 283lbs. At only 5'7" even with my wide frame, I was one obese individual. Now at an amazing 68lbs. lighter I'm on my way to living a longer, healthier, better life. I'm 215 lbs. now and almost at my goal weight of 185 lbs. My Kutting weight suit has not only allowed my to shed extra pounds while I work out, but I've increased my metabolism, and my body stays detoxified. The amount of sweat I produce during a 30 minute workout is phenomenal. I'm drenched as soon as I finish stretching.This is by far, the best suit I've ever owned, it looks great and is very, very durable.  I work out in my suit five days a week religiously.  Last year, I went through two vinyl "space suits", while this year my kutting weight suit shows a little bit of wear but definitely no tears.  My girlfriend is so impressed she wants one. I just want to thank you for bringing such a quality product to the exercise industry.  Thanks again..I got the pics to prove it!!!Mr. Rae S.Detroit, MI
5	1341964800	Now I must say i'm a large person... I Weigh at this time 420 and I look pretty bad in this suit :)  Truth is, I am in the Bariatric Surgery program and will need to loose 41 pounds just to have surgery.. The program classes have been great... I got this suit to help give me a kickstart with my exercise and hope it helps me lose weight just a little bit quicker... Right now I am doing Tae Bo "Billy's Boot Camp" and I am on day 4... So far I LOVE THIS SUIT!!!!  It really does what it says... I sweat like a mad man and I'm a natural sweater but this is just crazy... This morning I walked around the kitchen to get more water after my workout and there were sweat wet marks all over the place.. haahahah.. It was a good thing to see... Now as far as the long term benefits it remains to be seen. However, I have a great feeling it will be a great tool.. Now for all you big folk out there, Take your time in this suit and recognize when you need to pause the tape to get water and/or cool down... So far so good but this suit could also be dangerous if you over use it...  The feel of the suit is  amazing while working out, Especially for a large person... It helps keep the ummm Fat tight hahaha  I will let you know the results in a couple of weeks because I weigh in on August 7th...  I feel like I will want to wear this suit on every indoor workout... I recently got a bowflex and I have to put it together today and tomorrow. I can't wait to use it on that.. My muscles don't get as sore with it on... Only downfall is the price.. Tho worth it, I would like to have  a few items but I can't afford 80 bones for another...  It wouldn't stop me from buying another tho after this one wears out... It will be in for some work in the next couple of months :)Hope this helps!!Also FAST SHIPPING THANKS!!!!
5	1341964800	I bought this item after owning just the waist to knee product (from another seller).  My first surprise was that it fit in all the right places.  Everything is cut so that it doesn't rub in the wrong places when sweating (unlike my previously owned waist-to -knee style from another seller)  The full body kutting suit is awesome.  If you are looking to burn those last few pounds that just won't budge or want to shed a few pounds for an upcoming event, this product is a great booster for both guys and gals.  I do all my cardio with this suit on and look forward to it because.... I get results!  I received the product on time and in great shape.  I would purchase from this seller again.  Very thought out and professional cut for runners/joggers who will sweat alot with this on.
5	1341878400	The suit is great i use it to play basketball in makes me sweat and play alot longer with no problems does make me thirst but i love how it makes me feel.  If u want correct size order two sizes bigger then your t-shirt size. Another thing i wear like the tight biker shorts and tight under armour shirt underneath and feel great then i put my t-shirt and basketball shorts over and it looks like im not even wearing it. It makes me feel so good i also wear it to walk, ride my bike it works so well that i cant wait to work out in it . Also if i could keep it on all day i would Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4	1341792000	I think this is one of the best sauna suits I have seen. I tried a lot of sauna suits , but none of them was as comfortable and good quality as this.Definitely makes me sweat  a lot more when I am doing cardio.
4	1341705600	After the post office sent it to another city and tried to deliver it. I have the product and I can say I truly enjoy it.It does what it's intended to do very effectively. However I could have gone a size smaller. But glad I did not. When the Suit is wet it's hard to maneuver it back on. So the right size is a good thing.I had to experiance putting the suit back on as there is no zipper in the Crotch or a Fly if you will to at least relieve from the front. So each time you have to go to the toilet, you have to wrestle with the product to get it back on.This though is not a show stopper. I have worn it over the weekend and already see results.Great Product!!!!
5	1341619200	This is definitely one of my best choices on Exercise clothes (I have tried many and this one is the most resistant made and comfortable option plus effective), since the very first day I got it, I went for my three hour tae kwon do training and it was awesome! I sweated like hell, and the best part of it I did not even notice that I was wearing such neoprene suit, believe me if you want to sweat and burn more calories this is your choice, what I recommend have your bottle of water at your side always full while your training, the only thing I do not like about this suit is that when I have to go to the bathroom to do the one option, I have to take off my shirt then pull down the zipper to release the water, it would be more comfortable if the suit comes with a independent "water release" zipper or any other easy way but besides that I am really satisfied. I hope this help anyone to make their mind about this suit.
5	1341446400	First, the item arrived within 3 days after ordering.  2nd, the suit fit per the ordering instructions, no problems.  I used the suit the first day on the elliptcal and it was very comfortable and started sweating within 5 mins with a good pace.  I would recommend this product for those who would like to cut extra weight for weighins.
5	1341273600	I bought this for my son who has a medical condition that causes blood pooling in his extremeties and abdomen.  This compression garment started to make him feel better immediately.  The material is high quality and while we didn't order it for weight loss but rather for compression, I can see that working out in this suit would definitely cause a "sauna effect".  Also, for people with scars or those who need to avoid sun exposure, this would be a great suit for swimming.  The quality for the price is excellent and the shipping was fast.  I recommend this company to everyone and we will order from them again soon. Before I received the email to comment on my purchase, my son said, "Mom, please give them highest marks when you can because it is a really great product."
4	1341273600	I received the "Kutting Weight" suit very quickly. It was exactly as described and fit correctly. I have been using it while running and it has helped to burn the extra weight off. With the extra support provided by this item I should be down to my recommended weight quickly.
5	1341273600	I received my Kutting Weight sauna suit in two days! i used it for the first time the very next day.  Did not get the best workout in due to being a little tired from work.  Used it again a couple of days later, and I was drenched in sweat! Went through my hour of cardio with it as well as my resistance training and was drenched to my shoes.  Used it again today, and I was soaked even more.  I have a lot of water weight to lose and I am definitely getting the most out of my suit.  As a former high school wrestler and power lifter who always struggled making weight, I recommend this to anyone who needs it.  I am 6'1" about 280 lbs and ordered a 5XL which fit perfectly.  I cannot stress enough, that hydration is of the utmost importance while you are using the Kutting Weight sauna suit.  I had to take mine off today because I was probably losing more water that I was taking in.  Highly recommend!
5	1341100800	This is a good product. Neoprene is a great material for any kind of workout, as it is in the family of synthetic rubbers.  It maintains flexibility, is of  good durability, good forming snug fit,  quick drying after wash, and most importantly, can quickly raise your core temperature, causing you to sweat a lot. The model I have has  vents designed in the fabric in the crotch and underarm areas, which is a good design as these are naturally the two warmest spots on the body to begin with. Sizing chart is really quite accurate. In short, its a great product that I would recommend to all looking for something to assist in their physical activities, workout, ect. Just keep hydrated. hope this review was helpful.

4	1340928000	I was concerned about the sizing, but if you truly follow the table they have you won't go wrong.  As soon as you put on the suit you start to feel the heat, and it's built very well with gussets to allow free movements. Get one you won't regret it.
5	1340668800	Well worth the money, ran with it lost 7 pounds on day one and 6 pounds on day two. Watch the videos on how to do it safely.
5	1340582400	awsome product! I used it everymorning for walking  from 0530 to 0630 am. I love it I sweat so much...I started seen a difference in my body within 5 days. Buy you will not regret it....
5	1340409600	The Kutting Weight suit is an excellent product! I don't have to spend 15 min to warm up anymore 5 min max and i am ready to go thru my full workout. Less time in the gym and more time in the real world. I also like the improvements to the suit with the mesh areas under the arm and between the legs. 5 stars.
4	1340323200	Works as advertised.  I really get a better work out with this suit during tae kwon do practice.  It takes some getting use to but in the end, I am happy with the product.
5	1340236800	Great shipping time on the item!  Had the product in only 3 days.  Tried it out the first night and have never sweated so much.  Sweated out 4 pounds in about an hour!  It has a good fit, but isn't too constricting.  I was really surprised at how much mobility I had after the suit and I warmed up.  You can tell the product  is built to last.  Highly recommended!!!
5	1339977600	I think the product is excellent. Fantastic for keeping joints warm and pliable during a workout, helping to protect the joints and promoting perspiration.
5	1339632000	For those that think a wet suit would be cheaper, there is a huge difference between the two.  The major differences that impressed me was the vents.  Under the arms and between the legs are vented fabric that allows you sweat without over heating.  My first use was during a moderate bike ride of 12 miles and I did drink a lot of water but I didn't overheat.
5	1339459200	This item is amazing! Gives me the flexibility to do my workouts from running to biking to weight lifting or just lying down reading a book sweating!  I wear it under a shirt and shorts. Kutting weight suit is worth every penny! Just remember to drink lots of fluid. By the way sizes are a little tricky so be sure to check the size chart before ordering, im a medium on normal shirts i ordered large and it fits perfectly. Diet + excercise + kutting weight suit = lose weight and get toned! I might
5	1339200000	Absolute love it! I wore out my first one which lasted over a year so this is my second one.
5	1338940800	Does what it says!  Wears great in high intensity workouts.  Bought a second one!  I would recommend the product to anyone who wants to drop weight fast.
5	1338940800	Great product. Fabulous results. NO games. It delivered absolutely everything that i expected during my purchase. It fits great, thanks for fitting chart on purchase page, which is correct to the inch. I enjoy it and would recommend it for adding effectiveness to your exercise routine.
5	1338681600	Very helpful at cutting weight and generating heat. I bought my son one as well. Hat is also helpful but perhaps a little over priced. But the suit is very good all the way around.
3	1338508800	Thanks to all the previous reviews, I got the right size for me.  If I had based size on height, need Small; on weight, need medium, on Chest (Bust) need Large. I'm short (5'2") and weigh 147 with a 38" Chest.  I decided to make sure the suite would zip up and ordered a Large. It fits perfectly.  Now for the down side and the jury is still out on this.  The rubber smell is unbearable.  So, I have soaked the suite in my tub with vinegar (lots of it) and water twice.  The smell is about 50% better.  I'm going to soak it one more time.  Each time I do this, I hang it outdoors to dry and air out.  If the smell does not go away, I won't be able to use this suite.
4	1338422400	I have been using this suit for a week and feel more lighted and with more energy, suit a lot believe that is the intend
5	1337990400	I absolutely love the Kutting Weight Sauna suit, it has definitely helped me bring my workouts to the next level!This is a Phenominal product its made of great quality material, its very well put together and very durable. Love the heat that Kutting Weight products puts your body through, I feel the burn hours after my workout, hike or jog is done.  I definetly feel more energized and my stamina, flexability and toughness both physical and mental has greatly improved which very important for me being an active asthmatic!I hope he makes a hooded sweat shirt...
5	1337817600	I bought the suit for my son, a high school age wrestler to help with excess water. The day of weigh-ins, my son was fully hydrated but 2 and 1/2 pounds over his weight class. As soon as he put on his new Kutting suit he started to lose that water weight. In the past it might have taken several hours and a lot of effort to lose that much water. In forty minutes he had lost the weight with little effort. He did not feel rung-out like he normally does. On our way to weigh-ins, my son asked " why didn't we get this sooner". Make sure to re-hydrate.
5	1337817600	Absolutely GREAT product!!I use it along with the Kutting Weight sauna hat hat when I run and ride my bike!! The weight just drops off!!!
4	1337817600	Regarding the product, this is only my second week using it, about 3 times per week, but I've noticed an increase in sweat, warmer body temperature, and a certain comfort that can't be found in wearing a plastic sauna suit.  Previous reviews are correct in saying that one should go a size up from initially measured chest size, as the product is tight.  Legs, arms, and waist, however fit comfortably.Prompt shipping, great packaging, no problems with the initial purchase.
5	1337817600	I found this by searching for sauna suits & saw the rave reviews. I had purchased a different one before purchasing the Kutting Weight. I must say I'm loving this so much better. After using during my dvd workouts for the 1st time, I actually felt like I had been in a real sauna. If I can just remain consistent w/my workouts, I know I'll reach my goals.P.S.- be prepared to sweat like never before & stay hydrated.
5	1337817600	I was sceptical in purchasing this product at first from the fear of it being more hype than substance, however, I went ahead and took the leap of faith with the purchase. The item arrived on time and from opening the box the scent of tyres first caught my attention but it was not overwhelming nor distractive, however, for some persons the scent may pose a problem.I bought a 2XL after confirming my size with the sizing chart and the suit was a perfect and snug fit and felt really well made. There are areas under the arm and in the crotch that are made of breathable materials apart from the neoprene which composes over 95% of the suit. But the suit itself is amazing and does what it says....it makes you sweat in places you never knew you could sweat and once your body is fully heated from simple workouts the suit is so compact it provides the function of a sauna that is wrapped around your body.One point of warning is that you should keep a bottle of water or your favourite fluid drink at hand to mostly rehydrate since the suit will drain you through the extraction of sweat from your body. After a full workout of your own combination of exercises, and once you peel away the suit from your body, you will definitely feel a sense of well being.Caring for the suit is simple which involves a rinse within the washing machine with soap and not even your best smelling detergent will get rid of the neoprene scent since this will remain evident throughout the lifetime of the suit. Give it a try and I guarantee that you will be fully satisfied.
5	1337644800	I just recieved the sauna suit and have only used it 3 times. It will make you perpire 2 to 3 times as much as you do wiht out it. The first time I wore it I was just making sure it fit so I put it on and did a little work around the house. just folding cloths and I perpired so much that sweat was dripping out of the arm and legs of the suit. When working out you perspired even more.
5	1337299200	A lot of sweat I love it, the material is very good, worth every penny or actually for what it does I think it's cheape for $80.
4	1337212800	No complaints about quality, sizing (I got a SM and I'm 5'8" and 140lbs. DH got a L and he's 5'10" and 210lbs), etc.Definitely makes you sweat and as reported there is a need for additional hydration. (EX: I run average speed/incline intervals on a treadmill for about 60-75 minutes and I drink about 96 ounces of water in that time, and another 32-64 oz following the workout.The only hopefully helpful comment I have is that the suit had no impact on my weight or size despite the fact that I wear it EVERY workout and my workouts are 4-5 times every week. (I also have adhered to a 1200 cal, 40-30-30, no fast/pkg'd food nutrition plan over 6 month period.) I am not sorry I bought it; somehow it makes me believe I'm doing something extra because I am soaking wet when my workout is over.It's not a miracle product... even for those who exercise regularly and diligently.
5	1336867200	this product it great. The normal cheap suits suck and you're always afraid that it's going to tear. This never enters the mind with this terrific product.
3	1336780800	I bought a 4xl and it was a little too big in the shoulder area. It really do make you sweat without working out real hard. Since the suit is a 1 piece item it is very hard to take off when you real sweaty. It would be better if it came in 2 piece top and a bottom.
5	1336780800	Love this item, it Definetly makes you loose a lot of water weight. Which I have the most since I had my baby. A bit smelly though, so wash it first before use. But I love the this suit. :)
5	1336694400	The quality of the Kutting weight suit is outstanding.  The flexible clothing around the legs and arms, it really makes a big difference.
5	1336694400	This suit is awesome, it fit like a Glove! I got a size M and was worried it might not fit me since several reviews calimed it to run small... But I was able to fit myself in it.. it was a little snug on my chest but nothing I couldn't handle! Just in that little while I had it on I SWEAT away! I look forward to working out in it!
5	1336694400	I am 6'2" weighing 277 lbs and I ordered the 5X size and it fit me perfectly. However I can already tell that in about a few months I'll need to order a few sizes smaller (maybe 2X) to accomodate my decreasing size, which is a GREAT problem to have, right?This suit really warms you up and almost becomes a therapeutic muscle support as it loosens up your muscles while trapping the heat inside of it. The combination of the material and the fact that the suit goes up to your neck all in one piece really retains your body heat and just sucks that sweat right out of you. I enhance the effect by also wearing both a sweatshirt and sweatpants over it which the guy on the Kutting Weight site does as well.I've been using it now for two weeks as I work out to my favorite exersise DVD and I'm already down 12 lbs to 265 and I feel great. I've always been a fan of those waist trimmer belts but this does a better job by targeting your whole body.Previous reviewers were spot on about wearing undergarments underneath as they will trap the sweat so you don't have to make a watery mess when you step out of it! They get soaked!
5	1336608000	I was intrigued with the subject of sweating to loose water weight as well astoxins.  I've been taking Bikrim Yoga classes for several weeks and loved how Ifelt afterwards - lots of sweating taking place there.> So I started to research this on line.  I thought it would be a great idea tobe able to increase my sweat after one of my regular workouts.> I initially saw a one piece item from Bally for women that zipped up to rightunderneath the chest area and came up a little higher on the thigh area thanyours.  I was going to purchase that until I clicked the link to your product.Your product covered the chest and arms and also went down lower on the leg.  So- I decided this was a better choice for me.>> I've since used it when running, weight lifiting, and when doing cardioplyometrics.  In each and every case the sweat was great!  Much more so thanwithout the suit.  So far I am loving it!  I ordered a small based on the sizingchart.  I wish I would have gotten  the extra small as the small is slightly toobig.  But not enough such that I would want to go through the hassle ofreturning it.>
5	1336608000	The product does as promised.  I am 5'8", 230 lbs, with pretty broad shoulders.  The 2XL fits me snug except around the neck.  I've ha the product for 4 days and I have used it twice.  I am very happy with it.
4	1336348800	OK, I worked out this morning in my suit.  I have to say, for a lady with "thick" thighs it was very difficult to get on.  I read the other reviews so we were already aware to order a size bigger than what we needed.  Once I got in it, I immediately started to feel my body heat working "against" me.  I had a light sweat on before I even left the house.When I got on the eliptical, I started sweating in half the time I normally would and kept pouring while I was going.  It wasn't difficult to move in, it was actually pretty comfortable. I noticed that the little "giggle" I usually have in my mid-section wasn't there anymore.  The suit helped me hold it in and made me feel as if it was helping me contract that area to help me burn more. When I got off the machince (before taking the suit off), I continued to sweat for about 30-45 minutes.I can see myself wearing this every day.  I can't wait for the rest of the suit to get here. We (my husband and I) ordered the entire outfit.  Nor can I wait for the size of my thighs to start going down so that I can come back and SCREAM about it!The only "funny" thing was we couldn't get OUT of the suit after the work out... I wish I could post a video... just funny... it was STUCK to us... LOL
3	1336176000	Order the right size.... I like the product...Its not like other sauna suits that tear as you pull them off...I wouldnt wear it as an outfit please put something over it...
2	1336003200	The suit was returned.  It did not fit right,  The neck gapped.  The crotch came to my knees.  This suit is made for men.
5	1335916800	I can feel after my first day.work out, verygood product. and very fast shipping good job and will recommend to my friends
5	1335830400	This was ordered for my Husband for working out, as he wanted something light weight that would be easy to workout in, yet get fabulous results.  When it arrived, it was just as expected..lightweight, pretty neat design too.  Fits great! (I tried it on, a tad large for me..haha) but overall we are greatly satisfied with the product.
5	1335830400	The sizing chart worked well, and I've used the Kutting Weight suit for about 3 weeks on strenuous hikes. Itcertainly works as advertised, and allows a good range of motion so I don't notice it other than it createsmore of a cardio workout with the heat, and generates lots of water loss. The quality of the materials are solid.
5	1335744000	got this suit a few weeks ago after months of research and i must say the best money i have ever spent i have lost 8lbs of water weight in 2weeks but the change didnt go un noticed several co-workers have been telling me how thin i look not only that but my skin has also made a vast improvement cant weight to see how much i lose in 3 weeks
5	1335571200	I love this product! It is very well worth every penny! Helps me to sweat continously during any workout, I suggest if you buy this, if your looking to lose the pounds! By the way the seller is awesome, I had no problem with recieving my item on time!
5	1335484800	Just what I wanted to enhance my workouts. The only issue I have is what the vendor recommends for cleaning the item. There is no contact email on the website. Please add either info on washing the item or a contact email. Thanks!
5	1335398400	This item works wonders.  It definitely starts working as soon as you zip-up.  The fit is great so definitely ask questions if you're not quite sure which size to get.  It's tight and snug to ensure that you get the most out of your workouts.  Cleaning is simple so save time and money by washing it by hand then hang to dry.
4	1335139200	ok so this suit is a little tricky to put on but once on it fits like a glove. I got the SMAll and was crossing my fingers because I didnt know it was going to fit. I am 145lbs 5.7ft tall and I managed to squeeze into it... perfect fit! the chart says 140 and up bumps it to a medium but I figured since its unisex it would be fine! did 30 min of cardio in it clothes were soaking wet inside. I LOVE IT!
5	1335139200	This product works great. You feel hot right away, keeps you hot once you start sweating. Just be careful sometimes you can't tell that you are sweating or how much because the suit absorbs the sweat
4	1334966400	it feels great, it makes me sweat a lot. but I want to see in one month how will it effect my weight. then i will write a new review.
5	1334966400	TODAY was my Kutting Weight experiment, just like the video on you tube.  I know I could not do the continuous HIIT training he was doing in the video so I opted to do my 2 hour Low Impact Training w/ [...] I weighed myself prior to workout 163.4 after both workouts and using the kutting weight suit w/ sweat pants I was 155.8. That is 7.6 lbs down. I feel great! I will have my recovery drink. This will assist with your weight loss program with proper nutrition and workout program. Now make sure you purchase the suit 1 size bigger and the pants at regular size. The clothing is comfortable and very flexible. I am 5'9 African- American woman with thick legs so I ordered a large suit which fit just right. I also ordered medium pants which fit just right. So the sizes are a little off. Make adjustments and enjoy your purchase, I am. Will post again when I reach my goal weight! Thanks Kutting Weight!Alicia D. Leesh6@hotmail.com
5	1334880000	I wear a sz 44 suit and I'm 6'2 this sauna suit in xxl fits just right gets you warmed up quick has you sweating like crazy and adds resistance to your training I love it. Great quality
5	1334707200	I love this product, was very easy to workout in and received it when they said it would come.  very happy
5	1334448000	This good quality material and I love it! I have not sweat too much like I want to do but I am sure it will pick up sweat over time! But I love love it!!!!
5	1334361600	I trail run 3 miles before working out to get a good sweat going I put this bad boy on and keep it going it keeps your muscles warm and pumped up and soaks you with sweat it's my favorite tool other than my Wieghted vest and together they make me cryIf your sierious about wieght loss and general fitness it's a must have. Way better than those 30$ plastic sweatsuits
5	1334188800	I'm getting great results from wearing my recently purchased  'sauna suit ' -  I notice improved tone , reduced cellulite &  increased detoxification - I wear it while exercising & 'around the house as much as possible ' - even to sleep in - really gives  me increased results for my efforts + I LOVE it !@!
5	1334102400	This item is simply amazing! Great product and shipping was very fast. Even being stationed in Germany I received it in under a week.The sizing guide was very accurate as well, I was a little skepticle about the sizing especially after reading previous reviews. But went with the chart, The suit is a little tight but that's part of the effectiveness of the product. I've been working out with it for 2 weeks now and went from 205 to 195. I wear it to the gym, my routine is mainly weights with cardio 3 times a week for 20-30 minutes. I do not excessively hydrate but this suit will pull every ounce of water weight out of your body. I have 2 friends that are currently ordering the product as well..... 2 words for it purely amazing! Thanks Dustin!
5	1334016000	I JUST GOT THIS YESTERDAY AND THE SMALL IS TOO SMALL SO I WILL BE RETURNING IT BECAUSE OF THAT ONLY.THE SUIT APPEARS LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND OF GOOD QUALITY AN AS I CURRENTLY USE A NEOPRENE TOO WORK OUT IN I KNOW THIS WILL DO THE TRICK.
5	1333929600	Product works great! A lot better than the classic sauna suite. Feels comfortable under clothes and mobility is still good.
5	1333929600	Ok. Here it is. I own every suit Kutting Weight has for men. Long sleeves tops and bottoms.  I can tell you with this product and a good diet i have lost 120 pounds in 8 months. I use it dily. With summer coming i upgraded to the one piece short sleeve set.  Love the feel. Love the way it builds up that sweat and detoxes the body.  I almoast gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because when you wear it and have shorts on over it you will look lile you have a MAJOR bladder problem.  Sweat is everywhere dripping out of the legs.  If i was to change anything it would be a tighter leg seal or possibly a different less pourse rubber around legs.  I literally sweated off 7 pounds on a recent 5 mile jog and got massive blisters from sweat running into my shoes.  So double your socks or you will have issues.  Cant wait to see what they make next!!
5	1333843200	Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suitI first came across Kutting Weight Suit on YouTube, I was not sceptical of losing weight from high sweating as I have been boxing training at local club for the past year and loads of people there use Plastic suits which are just cheap & rip.Where do I start I have ordered the Pants Long sleeved top and hat as I also think the product branding is cool BUT it works I have to use a Sauna to sweat like I do in this Suit it's just great I feel really good after as well.Even running on my treadmill at home I wear the suit it WORKS PEOPLE & WILL HELP YOU LOOSE WEIGHT & ACHIVE YOUR GOALS QUICKER.Also I am starting a Facebook Page soon so people can post their training updates & how things are going.
5	1333843200	I am very happy with this purchase...fit is great and I really sweat even when not working out.  Only had it a few days, but so far so good!  Thank you!
1	1333843200	when i rec'd suit i worn it as instructed and two days later my skin broke out . so eager try again a second time and this time ibroke out in hives. they tried a third time and i broke out again sad to say i'am disappointed to say the least....
5	1333756800	This product is very sturdy and well made. And it heats your body up in minutes. If you eat half way decent and work out in this you will drop weight. Be sure to measure correctly before you order. Do not order big or else the portion around your chest will be loose. The only issue I had is getting it off after a workout. At first I just wore thin shorts underneath, but it took a while it get it off the shoulders. I have to wear a tight fitting or spandex shirt in order take it off quickly and easy. Regardless thi product is great and I am thinking of getting the rest of the kutting weight line.
5	1333670400	I love the suit, it's comfortable and I sweat a grip during my workouts in it..The shipping service was quick...Feel like a superhero when I zip it up...
5	1333670400	I have been using those vinyl suits since my previous neoprene suit had fallen apart and I had gone through approximately 4 vinyl suits within a 9 month span.  I have used my kutting weight sauna suit twice a day since I received it and its exactly what I have been looking for...its extremely comfortable and well made and all I have to say is I'm completely satisfied.  Awesome product!
5	1333411200	Suit arrived quickly. Slight 'rubbery' smell that went away after a couple uses. Easy to clean, turn inside out and rinse in shower, hang on hanger to dry.As other reviewers have commented , pay close attention to sizing and order a size larger or contact Kutting Weight if you are on the fence. I am 5'-10", 175 lbs, 43" chest, muscular build and the 2XL fits perfectly. Cut allows full, unrestricted movement. Suit quality and construction is excellent. My sense is that with a little care I will get years of use, even wearing it three or four times a week.Be advised ( hard to see in the pics ) that the suit has ventilation gussets under the arms and at the crotch and is not 'skin tight' so it will not work very well as a wet suit on your next trip to the beach. But that isn't the intended function. It does exactly what you want. Helps you work up a sweat as you work out. A really good sweat. Don't forget to hydrate.I found that getting the suit on and off easier if you roll it on or off the shoulder one side at a time fully unzipped. Very pleased, even think the logo is kinda cool.
4	1333324800	I received this suit in November 2011. I did some research and this one was one of the most expensive sauna suits, but it had good reviews so I decided to take the plunge and buy it.Many reviewers advised to order the suit 1-2 sizes bigger than your size and they were totally right. I'm not sure why the manufacturer labels them this way, but it would be clearer and more convenient if the suits fit their sizing information. It's not a big deal as long as you know to never order your size.I got it for workouts to help me lose more water/weight more effectively. I would start sweating about 20-25 min into my workouts before and now it starts happening about 10 min earlier and the perspiration is lot (and I mean a LOT) more intense now when I'm wearing the suit. It really does what it was designed to do well.The quality of the suit is solid, but I did have a problem. The zipper broke all of a sudden about 5 months later. I wrote email to the seller with the picture of the broken zipper and he said there was no warranty on the suit (which is probably understandable) and advised me to take it to a tailor for zipper repair or replacement. I did that and the zipper was un-repairable, so it had to be replaced. It cost me $20 to replace it and I sent the invoice to the seller. He promptly (and I mean the very next day) issued a $20 credit to my account. He was very courteous throughout our email exchange and answered emails within couple of hours.Things do break unfortunately, we've all experienced that (this product gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me because of that). What's important is sellers standing behind their products and we've also all experienced ones that refuse to take any responsibility. This one was great and he issued painless non-aggravating refund. I know I would definitely buy from him again knowing he will back it up.
5	1333238400	This is very good for losing weight, this makes you sweat and detox your body! I would definitely recommend this to someone that is trying to lose weight.
5	1333152000	It really does great as it says you will melt the pounds away with a good work out. You can wear it without much exercise as well.
5	1332892800	I had my doubts about this suit becuz it reminds meOf a wet suit .. Within a couple of days of using thisSuit.  I've notice a big change in my arms , stomach and thighs.I really makes ur body sweats I would recommendThis suit to all out there that want to lose some weight !!
4	1332892800	I was surprised.  I was expecting something flimsy and delicate, instead this thing is rugged as all get out.  I was lifting weights, and the rough grip of the olympic  bar kept scratching against the legs during deadlifts, yet there isn't the slightest amount of damage on it.The suit stops above the knees, halfway over the biceps, and the neckline is a bit lower than a T-shirt.  The crotch and armpit areas are vented.  It is like a heavy-duty swimsuit, and the compression is clearly detectable but not uncomfortable, though people with bigger arms might feel the end of the sleeve uncomfortably tight.Now, if you are actually going to sweat in this, wear at least a shirt underneath it.  The neoprene, with the slightest amount of moisture, becomes a high-friction surface when you try to remove it.  There isn't really any chafing when you are moving in it, though due to the durable nature of the fabric it will cause substantial resistance (like lifting things over your head), but taking it off afterwards without wearing a shirt underneath becomes an exercise not unlike what it would be like trying to free yourself from the unforgiving grip of an octopus.  But with a zipper.Bought it through Amazon, standard shipping, and it arrived a week later, exactly on the estimated date.
5	1332720000	I must say that I was hesitant prior to making this purchase. Everyone claims to have the latest and greatest weight loss solution. However when I tell you that this suit delivers exactly what it says it does...you can believe it. The sizing is right on target and fits perfectly for someone of an average height. I'm 5'4" and would have probably preferred my suit in an extra small versus a small. Try it you won't be disappointed!!
5	1332547200	This product is great.  It is everything that I hope it would be.  I have only had it for two weeks, but I have worked out in it since I received it.  It was true to the size chart and it makes you sweat as soon as you put it on.  The flexibiity makes it very comfortable to workout in.  If you are looking for a great weight cutting product, I highly recommend the Kutting Weight sauna suit.
5	1332460800	My Husband is forever buying the basic sauna suits that would tear sometimes before he would get a chance to wear them. He mentioned a suit like this he owned in the 80's and wished he had 1. I found this on line and did't want to pay the price but I am happy I did. I belive that it is very durable and this will make up the price.My husband loves the way it makes him sweat and absorbs it. I also brought him the hat and he said that he like how it keeps sweat from dripping in his eyes. The mesh in the sensitive areas help prevent irritation in those areas.I brought a 3x and it is a little snug around the chest, otherwise perfect fit for him. I brought myself one as well, same size for my hips and it is just a little long for me. He is 5'6" and I am 5'4. Needless to say if my husband is happy so am I.
5	1332288000	I got this product for my husband. I researched it and decided to purchase it. I was tired of my husband tearing up the pants on the sweatsuits while running to lose weight. The Kutting Weight suit has been WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!! He loves it! We saw results after the first use. I plan to get it for myself also. It looks soooo much better running with this, than a trashbag in Oklahoma! I have told everyone about the product!Kutting Weight (cutting weight) neoprene weight loss sauna suit
4	1332201600	Only issue I have is that the sleeve is too tight for my arms, planning to cut them since they are making my arm numb. Great product but I think they need to make a sleeveless suit.
5	1332115200	When i first look into this I was like ok lets see, well after weeks, I started Sunday I notice some changes and the weight is coming off it heats up quick you sweat after you stay hot, I use it for my atvantage I play softball when I get there I am still warm and ready to go. over all it is great just get a size bigger. at first use I could not zip it up, now it is zipping up. That should tell you How I am doing on the weight loss. I do not write reviews just to do them, I write them and I call it the I see it, over all anyone who wants to loss weight or use to keep warm this is what you need.
5	1332028800	The Sauna suit is great, I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and find that it's easy to put on and take off (even when I've really sweated up a storm), when wearing under clothing it doesn't look bulky and boy do you sweat in it, I've actually had to start putting towels and plastic on my driver's seat when i leave the gym because if i don't my seat gets drenched.The only possible complaint I could have is that I wish there was a way to put something along the waist area to prevent some of my shorts from sliding down slightly, other than that everything is great!!!!!!
2	1331856000	So I'm 5 feet tall and the fit is awful. So it doesn't work for me at all. When I pull it up, the suit rises nearly to my chin and there's a huge gap at the neck.  If I pull it down in the other direction it creates a fold by my thighs and makes it difficult to workout in at all. The bottom line is that it's a complete bust for me.I do have something positive to say about it though. The suit fabric is awesome and feels great on my arms. So I think for normal heights this suit would be awesome.
3	1331769600	I'm 5 feet tall and the suit is definitely made for tall people. What should fir around my upper tighs are all the way down towards the middle of the thighs which makes it very hard to walk. You can put it up but them would have a huge chunk of extra fabric (or whatever the material is called) around your stomach - I which I could return it but it didn't come with a return slip :(
5	1331596800	So I've been using the suit for about a week now, love it so far. I got a medium which fits perfectly on my lower half. I have a bit of room in the top half (I'm a female who carries most of my weight in the hips and thighs). I wear a pair of workout capris underneath so it catches the sweat dripping down my legs. I suggest wearing a shirt underneath the suit because I've started to get a mark where the top of the zipper rubs against my chest. The weird thing is it doesn't hurt while I'm exercising and it's not too tight so I think it must be the excess sweat on my skin rubbing against the top of the zipper. Overall I really like the suit and love the light feeling I have when I take it off after a workout. I'll update my review in a few weeks to share the results.
5	1331596800	I was very hesitant at first because I am a VERY CHEAP MAN, VERY! LBS! The reason I purchased the Sweat Suit was because of the VERY POSITIVE FEEDBACK this seller has garnered and reputation means alot. I took my chances and it paid for itself in the first week. I sweated away excess water whilst exerting energy as well when just sitting in the front of the teli.
5	1331510400	This suit feels great, made of very good quality neoprene. I have used it over a week now. I am fully satisfied with the results. It gives me great happiness to see how much sweet I can produce to make my tshirt soaking completely wet within the same duration of exercise which I was never able to sweat so much. This suit increased the momentum of my losing weight.When I start my exercice (cycling or rowing), I start to sweat much sooner than before and sweat much more than before, compared to waist trimmer belts.It keeps me sweating even after shower.I ordered pants, shirt and hat too after seing so remarkable results.I would definitely suggest Kutting Weight Suit for other people who are seeking to lose weight by exercising.
4	1331337600	I got this suit I bought the 6x but dont know if I should have ordered the 5x for a better fit, I am 5'10" and I weigh 330lbs. so I have a gut on me and Im just starting to do exercises so I bought this suit to help in the weight loss and the suit fits' the only problem I have is the suit dosnt fit like a glove around the shoulders and neck. but it does stretch and fit me around my midsection. I havent used it yet in my exercise as I just got the suit today and I just tried it on to c if it fits. thats why I have it 4 out of 5 stars because its not roomy enough around the shoulders but like I said before I might have done better with a 5x.
5	1331078400	This procuct is outstanding. I have purchased the entire line of the kutting weight gear.  After years of buying several $20 sauna suits and having them rip after a few workout sessions I am relieved that a product such as this has been designed.  The neoprene material is very strong and durable, it will not tear or be punctured.  It also is not restrictive, you can still move very freely while doing a superb job of maintaining an optimal body temperature for a great workout every time.  It also acts as a great windbreaker!
4	1331078400	This is the first sauna suit I've ever purchased. At first I thought it was a bit steep in price.  But now that I've had the chance to wear it a couple of times, I'm glad I made the investment. It is a great addition to my workout. It is easy to move around and run in.
5	1330992000	I love my new sauna suit.  sometimes I like to call it my reducing suit because i lose 3-4 pounds of water weight when I wear it for a workout or a long walk.  I have seen an improvement in the appearance of (the "c" word, gulp).....cellulite in my thighs and upper arms. I also feel cleansed afterward by drinking lots of water.  This is a great addition to anyone's regime for stayng in shape and looking their best.
5	1330473600	Highly recommend this sauna suit.  Awesome addition to my workout.  Easy to move and run in.  Will be encouraging my friends to buy one.
5	1330473600	After a few weeks of using the suit. I can see the difference. Just make sure some one is around to assist you taking off the suit the first time.
4	1330214400	this product has worked well but be careful and drink lots of water,a few times i felt like i over did and was gonna pass out so just take your time and dont over due it.again drink lots of water.
5	1330128000	I love this!!! I have lost 5 pounds so far (x1 week).  Of course using a healthy diet intake.  I have been "advertising" the suit at work.  I am very  pleased.  Here are a couple of tips: Please make sure you wear something light under that can absorb the sweat.  Be prepared to change in the gym prior to getting in your car.  You will be sweating to the point that it leaks thru your clothes.  HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE.  Prior to using it, while you use it and after you use it.  Keep in mind that you are loosing water from your body and you do not want to get sick.  I followed the instructions on a previous review and ordered a size up.  I am a L and bought an XL.  they run slightly smaller.  Other than that - Buy it - you won't regret it!!
5	1330128000	First off,I Bought this here on Amazon because of the High reviews.I Dont consider me Much overweight, I Weighed 119 lbs and Am 5'2.You might think thats nothing but Read On.A year and a half ago i was 106 Lbs! .... The weight gained from snacking Cheez it'z,Outback steakhouse, And dominos(A Boyfriend and no exercise) Made a Reservation On my Stomach,Sides aka love handles,ATTACK OF CELLULITE MUTANTS!Back of thighs,Inner Thighs!.The weight looks like Alot Because Im SHORT.Then i hated not being comfortable in the Nude with Boyfriend and told myself This has to STOP! I would exercise the treadmill and I DIDNT SWEAT Much.Specially my face,It would just turn red.Then i Made plan to Just Drink water and green tea.I Hated water before ,now cannot live without it,Stop fatty fast food eating,Stopped snacking on Cookies,Cheezits,etc.Ate added salad everyday to my lunch.And exercise with the GOD Sent Neoprene suit,Applied Sweet sweat,Took acai #3,and hoodia combo pills sold on amazon(loove stops all Cravings) And After 2 weeks im 105 lbs!Ive never Ever sweated Much, this Suit makes me drip! and forehead sweat which never happened before.Bottom line IT WORKS!The exercise intensity is twice as challenging,But twice rewarding with this Suit.Thanks Kutting Weight =)
3	1329955200	Love the suit however it tends to get in the way while doing jumpjacks and sit ups. It may be the size that I got because the sizing seems to be tricky.
5	1329782400	I have never written a review on Amazon before but felt I had to with this. I didn't know what to expect but the shorts were REALLY comfortable. I'll admit the neoprene is a little smelly at first but not overpowering and after washing it fades quickly. I couldn't believe how well they worked. Dry on the outside, soaking wet on the inside. I was impressed. I think I may need a smaller size soon!!
5	1329782400	I've just started using the suit and love the fit and how it works! I can feel myself starting to slim down and that's definitely a good thing to me.
4	1329696000	First off, I bought two of these suits for myself and wife from another Amazon dealer with Prime Shipping, but they don't have any reviews and are sold out almost always.  If you're lucky and keep checking they come in stock and then gone within days or a week.  So I'm posting my review here for everyone to see.  My apologies if anyone is upset.You do loose weight wearing this suit and best results come from aerobic exercises such as running, cycling or using an elliptical trainer.  It will increase your core temperature and provide a more intense work out, but be careful.  Your heart rate, or more specifically the beats per minute (BPM), will increase 10-12%.  The maximum heart rate for a 20 year old male is:  220 - age = 200 BPM. In this example, the most effective fat burning is a sustained 80% heart rate, or 160 BPM for 30 minutes per day.  With the Kutting Weight suit on, you will do at least 176 BPM, or 88% heart rate.  The danger here is that if you're not careful, you can go in to anaerobic conditioning with regular use of this suit.  Yes, it will burn more calories, but will also lead to fatigue, which is not a good thing unless you're already conditioned like an athlete.  Now, if you're looking for VO2 max conditioning, then this suit will get you there faster, but please consult your doctor before doing so.Another benefit in the winter is that this suit can be worn underneath to keep you warm. I also wear it around the house doing house work will make you burn more calories.The reason I gave it 4 stars is the sizing, depending on a person's body shape, you will need 1-2 sizes larger.  If you look like Peter Griffin from "Family Guy", make sure you get 2 sizes bigger.
4	1329609600	I have to say this has got to be the answer!!! Simple and plain. I work in the moutains of Afghanistan. Right now its 30 degrees out here. Im trying to shed some pounds for a cruise I have coming up in June and I have to say the results for me in the first week of using it were almost instant. This suit really makes you sweat.I truly believe that I will make my goal weight long before the cruise.I went to work out on the treadmill before work.I do about three miles. Man!! I have to tell you! This suit is awesome! I was sweating like you wouldn't believe! And already in 7 days people are starting to notice a difference. I feel a difference myself. More energy, clothes a little looser. As I said before there are three guys here that have the suit as well. We are all working out together. We work along side the military and i think you should expect a few more orders from this army unit. They were looking at us and asking a million questions about the suit and you web site.
5	1329609600	I love this part of the suit it's easy to put on and clean.  Not sure how much weight I have lost but I know I'm losing inches and some weight.  The only down side is using the bathroom if needed.  This suit works and I will purchase the cap and jacket soon.
3	1329436800	So I bought this suit as a supplement to my diet and exercise plan. I've been working out for two months prior to this purchase and have only managed to drop 5 lbs. This along with a reduced calorie, reduced carb intake, high protein diet had me a bit concerned that I wasn't truly able to drop any water weight. This was never a problem 5 years ago, but now I think being in my dirty-thirties my metabolism is close to flat-lining. I purchased this particular suit after reading several good reviews. Here's my story:WEEK 1-The suit definitely makes u sweat. and by sweat, I do mean SWEAT!. I dropped 2 lbs in weight though I'm not too sure if this is water weight or fat. Hard to tell.-I immediately fell in love with the material and how it holds in my body heat where I need it most. The material adheres well to my body and allows for full motion whether I'm on the elliptical trainer or on the ground doing crunches or stretches.-After every use I hand wash the suit off as I peel it off my skin in the shower. If I had to measure, I would say there's a good 3/4 cup of sweat pouring out so be prepared. Using a mild soap keeps the suit clean and storing it in dry environment helps keep it in tip-top shape for the next use. Treat it as you would your own skin; No harsh detergents.WEEK 2-I'm noticing that my thighs and lower back are toning up more rapidly than when I wasn't using this suit.-Not noticing much in weight-loss. Diet/meal plan still on track. Not sure if this is normal.WEEK 3-I'm noticing an increase in firmness in my midsection. This is a definitely a surprise!I'll update once I see any more results..Overall: Good product, but too soon to tell whether the product is worth the price for me.
5	1329264000	This product is all and more than described.  I am an active duty Soldier in the US Army and workout on a regular basis and always looking for an edge to increase my training.  At 39, I put on some extra weight and want to cut fat, but I reach plateaus quite frequently.  I have used the plastic suits and the rip after a few uses, but the Kutting Weight product in durable and effective.  I recommend this product to all who are looking for the edge to seeing more gains as it was recommended to me.  I am so impressed I will be pushing this to my brigade as a way to help overweight Soldiers lose weight effectively with their exercise and diet programs.
5	1328745600	I bought this hoping for a improvement over the bulky and awkward plastic sweatsuit i had already and boy does this do the job. I would be dreading putting on my old suit between the plastic tearing and the hassle of drying it off after a workout but this fits tightly under your clothes and dries off easily. Helps get a great sweat going during your workout and it feels natural enough on you to ignore the fact its even there. Highly recommended
5	1328745600	I recd the suit yesterday and tried it out, and I must say I ve never sweat like this before, I was all red after my workout,I got a medium and it fit perfectly. I plan to wear it every evening for my 60 min workouts and hope to see a change in inches in sometime..
5	1328486400	Really does add a lot to having a workout have thermal element.  I sweat a lot wearing it and really wakes me up for my morning workouts.
5	1328486400	I purchased this item to loose weight fast for a competition.  When I say this thing will make you sweat, its an understatement.  This suit makes my workout 10x harder and I am burning more calories.  Even after I take it off I am still sweating.  I have recommended it to my friends and they say the same thing.  Its a definite must have if you want to maximize your cardio.
5	1328140800	This is an awesome weight loss suit. I am 185 lbs with a 42 inch chest and the XL fits very well. The material is not to thick or stiff and comfortable with coolmax short and top underneath.
5	1328054400	I give this weight cutting suit an A+.  It works exactly as advertised.  I have used it on a couple of occasions so far, and it gets your body temp up in no time flat.  I was sweating buckets after a BJJ practice.  If you need to get in shape (the compression effect helped my cardio) or lose weight, get this well-constructed suit!
5	1327795200	At first it felt like a new shoe. All tied and a little uncomfortable. But after 2 exercises it got softer and now I don't even feel it. You do get sweat a lot. Be sure to put t-shirt and underpants they will help to absorb the sweat otherwise it can run down your legs. I lost some weight so I am ordering a size down now. You won't regret if you buy this one.
5	1327622400	Kutting Weight products really work to trim the inches not only around your waist but every area the kutting weight clothes are worn. I recommend it for anyone that wants to not only drop weight but drop inches.
5	1327449600	It does what it says- makes you sweat and increases the effectiveness of your workout.  I've also used it while lifting weights (free weights and machines as opposed to straight cardio) and havent had any problems with flexibility or movement.
5	1327363200	I noticed results with this suit the first time I used it.  I wear it for 1 hour a day while I work out 4  days a week.
5	1327276800	this product is great if you want to loose weight, it really make you burn lots of calories, just remember to drink lots of water, i love it
3	1327276800	Normai my size 3xlt size l want 4xl and come wery small ..size small 2number big size want size small
5	1327276800	I tried out the suit the first time and I felt great, without feeling rundown . . As soon as I put on my business clothes, I could tell my business clothes fit differently . . This product is a MUST-HAVE if you want to slim down.
5	1327190400	The first time I wore it, I hopped on the stair climber for 30 minutes and did I ever work up a sweat! I also wore it for an entire day while working at home and with it on, you'll feel some water loss even when you're doing normal chores. Quality is great and the fabric is thick and feels very durable. Just remember to give it a good spray after you're done and let it hang dry.
4	1327017600	Ok so I wasn't to sure about this product. But I really needed something to help me with my work out. I didn't feel I was getting the most out my work out. I saw this product from Kutting Weight and after reviewing alot of the reviews I said what the Heck and gave it a chance. I have to admit I was still in doubt once I got it of how much it would help. I put an undershirt inside the suit then hit the gym after 1 hour of working out I felt I was almost passing out. I had to admit this thing make you really hot. After I took the suit off I was actually surprised by the amount of sweat on my clothes. It was insane and I smiled from ear to ear. This thing is awesome I love it and now I'm saving up to purchase the sweatpants and shirt.
5	1327017600	This sauna suit was just what I needed to raise the level of my workout. I ordered this suit 2 sizes bigger because I thought it would run small, but it is true to size. I still get a great workout with it and I actually like it loose. I still sweat alot and I love it. I've used it 6 times aready and can't see myself working out without it.This neoprene sauna suit is well made and it does what it says. It helps you to sweat. I retain a lot of water and I think this is going to be my answer to working off some of that. I'm doing the insanity workouts (round two ) and I can't wait to see the difference this time around. I expect to see a lot more inches coming off.Delivery was fast and the suit is well worth the money.
5	1326672000	I really love the suit. I've used it while I was on my elliptical machine and it made me sweat like crazy. It's good for anyone trying to reach their weight loss goals.
5	1326585600	This product works very well. It has changed the effectiveness of my workouts. It's expensive, but worth the price.Pros:Sturdier than the other sauna suits(doesn't just randomly tear)FlexibleEasy to cleanCons:Price(but worth it)
5	1326585600	This was my second purchase of a Kutting Weight Suit. I bought one over a year ago. I did not replace the old one because it ripped or wore out. It is still in great shape after a year of almost daily use!! No, as a result of using the suit, I have lost so much weight (over 50 lbs.) that I needed to go down a size. This product is definitely with the cost. I would suggest that you get one size larger than the clothes you wear.Best training aid I have ever found.Jim
4	1325721600	The product does what it says it does. It really boost your metabolism so you are losing weight after your workouts. The actual sweating that occurs with just the suit on is negligible in my opinion. In order to optimize the actual performance during workout I definitely had to bundle up in the usual sweatpants, sweatshirt or hoodie. The other benefit is the increased flexibility and challenge of working ou in one of these. You feel like you are training with weights on, especially once the sweat gets going, and almost like wearing an oxygen mask it really pushes your body hard. Take it off and you feel light as a feather. I am a 170lb 5'11 and I ordered a Large which fits pretty snug and comfortably, the movement provided by the suit is amazing and definitely is alot better than wearing the non-neoprene sauna suits that simply tear with one use. I can see training in this a week to two weeks out from any competition just to push myself. I definitely will purchase the Kutting weight hat and perhaps some other items when they go on sale or release a coupon code.
4	1325548800	The Kutting Weight suit does what it says by making you sweat. However, it is really bulky ( like a wet suit) and I wish that it wasn't so easy to see under clothes. The sleeves and legs come down pretty far and the neck is high, so it looks awkward under workout clothes.
5	1325462400	This suit will "KUT" weight. I found this product to be all I thought it would be and more. You will definitely sweat wearing this very well made sauna suit. The neoprene hugs you tight but can flex with your movement. I recommend ordering one size larger than you usually wear. Get it and get ready to sweat. Even doing light exercise it will make you sweat. Hand washing is recommended but after I use mine, I throw it in the washer on the gentle cycle and hang to dry. You'll love this sauna suit. Seller shipped right away too.
4	1325376000	This is a great product. The only reason I give four stars is because of the strong rubber odor that won't leave the suit despite multiple hand washings and inner seams having sharp edges that can scratch sensitive skin. You definitely have to wear a shirt under the suit. Overall, the suit works - you get warmed up faster and get better (quicker) workouts.
5	1325289600	This suit is great. My body is a lot warmer and more flexible. I'm not getting sore as much because of it. I actually bought the McDavid Waist Trimmer before this and I put that on first and then the suit. Its crazy to see the amount of sweat coming off my body once the suit goes off. I'm 6'1 and 180 pounds and I bought a large. Fits great.You may think you'll lose some flexibility in this but you wont. I can still do all my stretches just fine and run fine.
5	1324512000	They did an awesome job in sizing correctly and shipping was very fast. This is much better than the traditional pvc suit which is too thin and tears easily. I just rinse off the suit with water after a workout.
3	1324425600	Seems to fit after i cut the sleeves off at the seams. this is my second order because the sizes run extremely small (especilly the arms which were 2 sizes too small). The suit does add to my body support while i work out each day. i do wear it everyday.
5	1324166400	I have had your one piece suit and cap for around 6 months now and wear them while riding my stationary bike and while doing cardio workouts. I have noticed a large reduction in my mid-section, aka my spare tire. You sweat like a monster when wearing your gear which feels great! The gear is well made and I am glad I bought them. Thank you, Adam - Baltimoreps Dont wash or dry with heat, I shrunk my cap. It still fits but it is Tight!
5	1323561600	I just want to say that I am very happy with my recent purchase of the Kutting Weight sauna suit. It is everything and more that I expected. It really does the job. Helps to keep the core warm, promotes sweating, which to me, I love. Sweating makes me feel like I am really working and achieving the results that I am looking for. I would highly recommend this product, but, I would like to remind anyone purchasing this that you really need to order the proper size by referring to the size chart. I ordered my first suit by the shirt size that I wear. I ended up having to return it and reordering the correct size. Once I selected my size based on the chart, all was good. So now I am enjoying my suit. Hope you enjoy yours and I hope this helps.
5	1322956800	All good so far.  Recommend carefully reading the size information and check measurements.  My size fluctuates, and 4X fit is good for my waist, height, and legs.  The fit is snug at upper torso, and tight in the bicep/tricep.  For me the next size up would be too loose in waist and legs, but may then be perfect in upper torso and arms.  Since I use while walking on a treadmill the tight arm fit is okay, but I actually have to keep my arms straight to avoid feeling like I'm constricting my circulation in my arms.  I'm not very muscular.  If someone is large in their bicep/triceps it may be best to get a size larger.  Also if I wore during upper body exercise it would be better to use a size larger.  For my use this is as good a fit as could be expected so I give 5 stars.
5	1322870400	I love this suit for my son it works very well. I would order one for myself but I cant afford that much for me right now.
5	1322784000	I love it. The fit is a little snug but the product works great. I would suggest a little better sizing info, but I am extremely happy with the product.
5	1322611200	I'm trying to lose weigh and I found this suit here, it helps a lot when I exerciseA piece of advice check the sizing info before you buy, get an extra size
5	1322352000	This product is high quality.  I don't sweat much, even when exercising.  I did with this.  I just started using it so it is too early to tell if it will result in significant weight loss over time, but many other reviewers have had successful results.  Initially I ordered one that was too large.  This company had integrity and were good about returns (of course, I returned it in original brand new condition).  I think it it true to size.  You want something like this to be snug, you can still work out in it just fine.  I'm 5'9" and 185 and ultimately a large suited me just fine.
5	1322092800	The kutting weight sauna suit works well.  I prefer the suit to the shirt and pant which I bought also.  What I like to use the suit with is a set of neoprene calf warmers.  With these two elements, keeping a slow jogging pace creates a great way to loose water weight while keeping muscles warm.  It also appears to help skin complexion.  I like to keep a t shirt under the suit or shirt and pant to allow the water to have a place to wick away, otherwise neoprene does feel kind of odd against sweating skin.  The quality appears to be very good and I think I will get a lot of wear out of these two sets of exercise wear.
5	1321488000	this is one of the best pieces of training equipment i have ever purchased, wearth every single cent, i definately recommend this to anyone looking to get in shape quick kut it up!
5	1321488000	This suit makes me sweat more than I've ever sweated in my life. Only issue I had was that it made my stomach itchy but I wear a tank top under the suit and it's all good now. Highly recommend it!
5	1321401600	The Kutting Weight suit is freaking fantastic. Fits like glove and really ups the sweat intensity. I wear it at least a few times a week (strength and conditioning, jiu jitsu, muay thai, mma) just to burn a few more calories. I'll be cutting to 135lbs for the first time soon, and I'm sure it will play an integral part in the process.
5	1321228800	I had purchased this three weeks ago. In those three weeks I had lost 14lbs. Yes it works and I highly recommend it to anyone serious about losing weight. But remember to hydrate
5	1321142400	I purchased one for myself and my wife and we love them it is made of good quality material and really makes you sweat the first time I wore it i couldn't tell how much i had been sweating until i took it off and my tank top and spandex were soaked just love it
5	1320969600	when i started using it i felt the difference just a little.  after i started using the product thicker after my cardio i saw my pants wet and i fit a pair of pants that were a size smaller better than before i was able to close them.  so its working looking forward next month.  but one thing you must be consistent with your workout and eating habits.
5	1320278400	this is a reall good weight loss suite.i has loss 6 pounds with this suite in 2 weeks. it raises the body metabolism while working out. the price is pretty good too!!!
4	1320019200	Finally recieved my suit after very helpful supplier sort the distribution company - Thank you. Very pleased with the suit which is both comfortable and effective. Reccomend both the suit and the supplier - Montyz.
5	1319932800	I've had sauna suits before but this one is the best by far.  It's made of neoprene which doesn't rip when you do your routines.  And it really works for water weight loss.  I've used it for about almost a month now and I've definitely lost some inches all over.  Don't waste your money on the cheaper sauna suits.  Kutting Weight is worth the price and then some.
3	1319673600	I had purchased 3 items, 2 tops and 1 pants, (extra top for a friend) to take advantage of the free shipping from their website, well my items arrived slow boat. The material is nicely made, dimensions are exact to their measurements. Putting it on for a couple of hours and light workout, never raised enough sweat or water loss. I tried a cheap sauna suit to wear underneath, that did the trick. I recommend plenty of water. I am glad I bought it. Nicely made. Im on a slow weight loss the last few months, with diet and the suit(s) and exercise I shall reach my goal.
5	1319587200	This is a great product for anyone wishing to increase their body heat, prevent injury and cut weight quickly.  Standard sauna suits tear easy and get dangerously hot in the sauna and steam room.  This lightweight suit is durable and dries quickly.  I've been using mine for 2x a days and after a quick rinse is good to go in a few hours.  In the gym it provides full range of motion so you can do your slow fat burning cardio and resistance workout without shedding layers.  Also, you can wear it under casual clothes for outdoor hikes or trips to the zoo.  I wore mine last weekend for lawn cleanup and cut 4.5 lbs in 90 minutes of light yard work.  I usually wear a size 48 jacket but ordered the 2xl to ensure a snug fit.  It will take some adjustment to get used to the rapid rise in body temp will affect endurance and it helps to recover with an ice bath like Tim Feriss reccommends in the 4hour body.
4	1319328000	I received the product within a few days.It is made of quality neoprene and has worked as advertised.It has helped me drop my excess water weight and makes my workout feel more productive.
5	1318982400	I bought the suit over a month ago and since then I use it every time I work out.  I have lost over 14 pounds since I got it and I would definitely recommend it to those who want to lose weight.  It didn't happen overnight.  Keep going and don't give up.
5	1318896000	I bought this and it is awesome. I use it while I'm on the elliptical mainly... It helps get my body temperture up. I will be buying the pants soon!
2	1318896000	I purchased the suit based on the rave reviews I read.  When it arrived I discovered that the suit was too tight in the chest area - which I had measured carefully and matched to size Large.  I returned the suit and ordered size XLarge.  This was as tight as the Large.  The seller claims the the chart is accurate but upon reading some old reviews I found that other customers complained about the same issue.  When I contacted the seller my order was canceled and my money refunded minus all shipping costs.  Too bad.
4	1318896000	product wroks great. i have used it and everytime i have gotten a great sweat. goes under most clothes and not to bulky that you wouldnt want to wear it. i really like it because no matter what i do if i work out or just wear it i will get some kind of sweat. my body feels very warm as soon as i put the suit on. so it helps warm my muscle up and keep them warm however i never feel as if im over heated or feel as if im going to pass out. great product and i will buy other products sold.
4	1318896000	I think this is a very good product. I haven't had it long and I've only used it twice. It fits me and I am in a 4x. It appears to be very durable. Takes a little getting use to when I first put it on but once I started wearing it I was good. So far it is the best I've invested in.
5	1318896000	After the very first time wearing the suit I've seen a difference.  GREAT suit and I recommend it to anyone who would like to lose weight.
5	1318896000	This item is exceptional!!! I lost 10 pounds in a month and lost my love handles at that. I recommend this to anyone interested in losing weight in other ways besides dieting. I use this item under my workout cloths on the elyptical machines burning over 900 calories in a single hour. Best method for us guys, use with boxer briefs or underwear versus regular boxers for comfortability and continuation on the machines without the rubbing/discomfort of the seeming. When you are finished doing cardio, I recommend changing out of your cardio workout cloths before you go and weightlift, the cloths are drinched with waterweight. It took 9 cardio workouts to get 3 inches of waist off me and my speed has improved and so has my heart rate. Don't go more than you feel comfortable doing like I have. Work your way into the path of burning more calories and going further on cardio machines. I wouldnt use with weight lifting, but thats my personal preference.
5	1318377600	I have been using this to suit to do interval runs on my treadmill, for 30 minutes. I have to say that when I take it off, wow! It's very effective in getting a good sweat going. It takes some getting use to, but range of motion is normal and it makes you sweat quicker and more that if you were in regular exercise clothing. Very good product.
5	1318204800	I REALLY ENJOYS THIS kUTTING WEIGHT SUIT CAUSE IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT EASY TO MOVE AROUND IN HAS AIR VENT BETWEENLEGS AND UNDER ARM PITS WERE IT IS NEEDED FOR AIR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I'MGLAD I FOUND KUTTING WEIGHT SUIT ON AMAZON THANKS YOU ARE A LIFE SAVER
5	1318204800	This is an absolutely awesome and essential work out product. The only con is that you'll probably have to buy another after not too long because you will lose so much weight. Would highly recommend to anyone trying to cut weight or even casual excercisers.
4	1318204800	It will not do the job for you, but it helps. I would recommend the product for those people that wan to lose chest fat.
5	1316044800	This is a great suit, well made. Really makes you sweat, specially if you use it with Sweet Sweat cream in the areas you are working out. I would recommend it to anybody to enhance your workouts.
5	1313884800	Okay, i have NEVER written a review for a product guys. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO LOSE WEIGHT. THIS IS MY MAGIC PILL! Yesterday i run only one mile and pools of sweat develop. i see instant results. if you are borderline on this dont be. like seriously dont be. best decision ever.
5	1313625600	I have been using the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit for almost a month and the results I've seen are nothing short of impressive. Before using the Kutting Weight Suit, I used those cheap vinyl garbage bag style sauna suits. Considering the price difference between the two suits, the Kutting Weight Suit's benefits far outweigh the money you think you save by buying the cheap vinyls suits. The Kutting Weight suit can be used for any exercise, as it incredibly comfortable and extremely durable, while the vinyl suit is easily ripped just by putting it on. The Kutting Weight Suit does as it is advertised, it will make you sweat, even after you stop your cardio; you will be sweating for at least another hour while your cooling down. The results speak for themselves. On average I've lost about 2.5 lbs a week using the vinyl suit while running on the treadmill daily. With the Kutting Weight suit, my weight loss has been around 4 lbs a week because I am also able to wear it while working with weights. The sizing is also true to the size chart provided, I measured my chest at 46" which was the maximum of the 3XL I purchased, and it fits perfectly.
5	1313539200	At first, I didn't think it was working because I didn't have sweating dripping down my body but when I took it off I was soaked. I like that it absorbs the sweat.  It fits just fine.  I would recommend this to anyone trying to sweat it out!!
5	1313193600	I recently purchased the Kutting Weight Suit through Amazon and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. First, the suit is amazing;I dropped 5 pounds the first week and have been dropping about two-three pounds per week since. My goal is to lose about 25 lbs by the end of the year and I'm right on pace. Clearly the Kutting Weight Suit combined with my workouts is working better than I imagined. Relative to ordering the suit, it took about ten days to arrive and I received a number of email alerts tracking the status of the order. Great Buy, Great Service!
5	1313107200	This suit is one of the best pieces of equipment i've ever purchased, and I would recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing one.
5	1313020800	This product will really make you sweat.  I lost three pounds in one week while on the treadmill for 30 minutes three times a week. I also wear it when cleaning up.  Be sure to stay hydrated.
4	1312848000	I already owned the long sleeve version of this suit. So I knew what this suit does. Summary - it quickens your body's core temperature so it going into 'burning mode' sooner. As I stated before with the long sleeve version, Do not use this product to do any extreme workouts with consulting a trainer.The suit drains you of liquid and energy quickly. You could put yourself in very bad physical state if used improperly. A plastic suana suit does the same but one, they stick like hell and two, tear very easily, even the $40 plus dollar ones.I got this cause it summer almost year round where I am from, so this is more practical for my needs. Only complaint is the 2x version is not the same size to me anyway as the 2x long sleeve but since it was a once piece its is a tad more snug than the long sleeve. Washing is a breeze, I put it on delicate wash and let it air dry.I use it off and on, with a workout I do, and its worked as I hoped like the long sleeve version did. The zipper makes getting into the suit and out a breeze and the velcro is a nice touch to add support to the zipper for closure. My body reacts to this suit very good. Thus far it has helped with the increase in stamina and lowering my BPM for excercising without it.I again recommend this product for assistance in getting that extra burner some of us need when we plateau with our regular excerise routines or help losing that extra little weight quickly for sports. But again please consult with a trainer or someone with knowledge of a sports trainer with these sorts of product.
5	1312502400	awesome product.  i had to cut down on my workout 'cause with this thing on i couldn't handle my regular routine.  have tons of water around and be ready to sweat sweat sweat.  the only problem i can say there is - is with the sizing.  it says go one size bigger and according to their size chart i am suppose to be one size bigger but i think 2 sizes bigger would've been best.  in 2 weeks i have lost 7 pounds.  would definately recommend. so far product seems to be well constructed.  it's hand wash only for those who want to know.
5	1312070400	Months prior to ordering this product, my son, who is a very active high school wrestler, contacted Kutting Weight through their web site.  They were helpful and provided the information he needed to educate himself about the products (both negative and positive aspects).  They also provided the proper size based on the measurements he sent to them.  My son then requested me to purchase the product.  I have always used Amazon; I trust them.  When I saw Amazon selling the item, I ordered it and was not disappointed.  The product is exactly what my son wanted and the professionalism of Kutting Weight and Amazon was outstanding.  Thank you.
5	1311984000	I am so pleased with this suit.  I attempted to purchase it last year with some difficulties which prompted me to leave a negative review and I cannot recall rectifying it.  However, the company were in touch with me personally and rectified the problem quickly and easily.  The issue appeared to be a postal one.  It seems my London postal system didn't like me putting a rush on the order, so I let it come via normal post after my refund.  It took longer than I wanted to wait but it was worth it.I am a woman who only needed to lose weight in certain areas to make me feel better not because I was overweight.  Now I want to maintain my current weight and I wear the suit after every single workout.  I don't ever need to worry if my weight creeps up on me because I put this suit on and go for it.  I have a friend that has been working out much longer than me, about 5 months, he has only lost 2 pounds.  I have lost 9 pounds in 2 months of irregular workouts.  Neither of us have altered our diets.  I don't work out every day, maybe twice a week for the last month.I have tried all the naff plastic suits and got fed up with stapling and taping them back together when they fall apart after the slightest strain or even getting dressed/undressed in them.  When I take off the cutting weight suit I need to be careful where I rest it because it is always soaked and heavy from the workout.  It cost a little more than I wanted to spend plus postage but good value.  I wash it after every workout and it still looks great.  I am considering purchasing for friends and I am recommending it to everyone I know who are serious about losing weight and putting in a little workout to accomplish this.  For me it could be a touch longer to cover my complete thigh but that's just me.  All in all, I think it's great!
5	1311465600	The suit has become my workout uniform of choice. I have been able the break a long standing plateau since I got the suit. I lose a ton every workout, most of it water weight, but not all of it. Keeps my core a few degrees warmer. Started with the large size, but after 2-3 months it got too big, so now I'm at medium. This suit is second only to my will power and drive to exercise. Keep hydrated before during and after workout. Thumbs up.
5	1311292800	It was a little snug at first but I can actually see results after only a week of using it.  The only problem I had was the thread coming undone a little at the neck but that didn't stop me from using it or it from working.  I am going to continue to use it until I reach my weight goal.
5	1310860800	I like the product its really good; I have used it twice and strongly recommend the product. Make sure you get the right size because the product is perfect fit.
4	1310515200	I had one of these before so I purchased another.  Gives you a very good sweat and raises your body temperature to assist in burning calories and increasing metabolism.  It's not a "wonder" suit by any means.  You will need to work out.  Don't just put it on to walk around in all day.  You'll see some results after a few weeks of working out in this.  My biggest complaint is the shipping time.  It makes no sense they charge over $10 for shipping (which is an overcharge) and it takes nearly 2 weeks to be delivered.
5	1309996800	Ordered the Kutting Weight Suit and received it timely.  Based on other reviews I ordered a bigger size.  So the suit is way too big and I would not be able to wear it under clothing as other reviewers do.  I do wear it for work outs at home (treadmill & workout videos).  Even though the suit is too big I still sweat when I use it and actually feel I'm getting a better workout.  Would recommend.
5	1309305600	This will make you sweat... I've been working out for some time now and I can tell you that this suit does what it says, the only time I've sweat this much was Back in basic during BEAST week in 60lbs of gear in 100+ weather and in full chem gear( several People passed out)but this suit is way better than training in chem gear, if you want a sweat get this, but don't put it in the washer I made that mistake and now it has a hole in it's shoulder, but besides that it still works and feels great. :)
5	1309305600	I received my Kutting Weight Suit almost 2 weeks ago and I love it! The first 5 days I used the suit I lost 12 pounds of water. I wear it when I work out on my Treadclimber and when doing weight training. I sweat a lot and really feel that I am burning calories. I'm recommending this to my family and friends. Thanks so much for a great product!Angela
5	1308182400	I love it! I would wear the original sauna suit at home on the tread and loved the feel of all this sweat(toxins)dripping off me. However, I just started a hip gym and would not dare wear the  trash bag. Thankfully,Kutting  looks great and I get the same results, with out the tear between my thighs(working on that). One  small thing, it is a bit tricky getting out of.  Since it is plasted to u after a workout and you are beat.
5	1307836800	I discovered kutting weight while surfing online. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase! I was drenched in sweat after working out for only 10 minutes.
5	1307577600	lovin' this suit....creates alot of sweat, and I thought that it would be confining, but it isn't...still have flexibility to move around and work out....I used it to play basketball this week......
5	1307404800	I wish I had gotten this sauna suit years ago. I am a powerlifter and have to make weight every time I have a competition. As I've gotten older, this is not coming so easily, as it did in the past. I've used the "garbage bag" type sauna suits, which eventually bunch up, then tear. They are so uncomfortable. The Kutting Weight suit is amazing. It's comfortable and not bulky under sweats and a hoody. I can do my cardio, and I can work out the entire time with it on, even wearing my weight belt, while benching and deadlifting. When first putting it on, you feel the suit, but as it warms up to the body, it's not noticeable. You can really feel it working the body into a really good sweat.I got the suit a week ago. I was at 156. I'm now at 150.8. Only two more pounds to my competition weight. Mind you, it's also, working out and clean eating, but the suit does its part. It's helpful too, in the event I need to take off a few pounds, the day of weigh in. I won't need to do cardio for a ridiculous amount of time. Many of my teammates have seen the suit, and are considering purchasing one of their own. The cost is reasonable, having to replace the other suit everytime it tears, it's worth the cost. If I had known about the Kutting Weight suit years ago, I could have been at weight in half the time.Kutting Weight Neoprene Weight Loss Sauna Suit
5	1307145600	I went by a few reviewers suggestion and went a size up and ordered an XL, huge ...."HUGE" being the word. The suit looked like it was made for a linebacker. I am 5'2 approx 168lbs but I measure a 38D bra size and given the neoprene in the suit I didn't want to take the chance of it being too snug and restricting my workout. The sizing to me just doesn't line up on a Unisex basis. I feel the sizing chart is best applied to a man's stature, as my suit was exceptionally long in the groin and the shoulders had so much excess that the fabric just  sat above my shoulders like 2 domes. I ended up placing a new order for a size M. Apart from the sizing disappointment, I would like to attest that the suit has excellent workmanship.
4	1306713600	This is a good suit, you will heat up immediately, heart rate will increase and you will sweat buckets. Read this... order a size 2x larger than your actual size!!!!! This is a very well constructed suit that does not give much, you will regret ordering smaller.  All in all, a good suit that will make you sweat if you can take the heat.
4	1306627200	Love it.  I like that its a total body suit.  Need to get another one cause I use them everyday.  The only thing I dont like is the fact that i have to take my t shirt off in order to use the restroom. lol. But I love it anyway.  It makes me sweat and thats the point.
5	1306454400	i ORDERED THIS SUIT LIKE LAST SUNDAY I THINK I FORGOT i JUST GOT IT TO TODAY BUT HAVENT USED IT BUT i PUT IT ON AND IT FEELS HELLA COOL. i BOUGHT A XL AND JUST THE WAY IT FEELS AND HEATS UP YOU BODY I KNOW THIS IS WORTH THE 91 DOLLARS I SPENT ON IT. bUY IT AND TRY IT.
5	1306454400	I'd ordered it a size up as recommend, but it was still VERY snug. The zipper is very durable though so it's not a problem. Delivery was very fast! It was only 2 days, and I live in a place where it takes 7-9 days usually.I love my suit and I'm going to invest in the pants and long sleeve next!One of the only things I don't like about the suit is the noise it makes when I move, but I'm hoping with more use that will stop.
5	1305417600	I use to use to wear the sweat belts but didn't get the results I was looking for so I purchased this suit. It was the best investment I have ever made. I workout approx 2 hrs/day by running and cycling and lost about 25lbs in 6 weeks sweating the fat away. I wear it every day I workout and continue to sweat incredible amount as the weight continues to drop away. It's meant to be worn under your workout clothes and make sure you hydrate yourself during and afterwards. The material is great and its still looks brand new. So if you want to lose weight I would say make the investment as you will not be disappointed at all.
5	1305417600	Kutting Weight Suit gives your body a great start for some serious workout! It helps you warm up and stay warm during exercises. I love the product!My body does not sweat very easily in order to lose the extra pounds and toxins, but this product does what it says. But as a woman, I would like a more feminine version for us. All the same, its still an excellent product for those who want to sweat and lose weight!I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.Thanks.
5	1305331200	I am using this to kick-start my exercise regime and wanted to shed some of the water weight. This suit is a very high quality and I am pleased with the results.Go to the website for precautions and product care.
5	1305331200	This product is worth every penny! It makes your core warm quicky so you FEEL like increasing the intensity. The suit helps you sweat fast, the suit looks great alone or you can wear it under other work attire. GREAT PRODUCT! My husband and I both have a set. It looks great so you can actually wear it outside the gym too. I've recommended it to several friends and coworkers!
5	1304899200	have been using it for about a 3 weeks. realy like it. easy to clean. you sweat a lot. got it more for detox than to loose weight. but still, loosing weight is always welcome. really like it.
5	1304812800	An amazing suit.Nice material.I tried many other suits in the past, but this one, it's lasting so far.I recommend it 100%.
5	1304640000	I bought this product exactly a month ago and I have lost 14 pounds and went down two notches on my belt in that time frame. I am 42 and workout 3-4 times a week based on my work schedule and this suit has helped me kick start my weight loss. I also own a shirt, two hats and I bought a suit for my wife and she has lost 10 pounds and went down a dress size in a little over 5 weeks. I would advise anyone that wanted to kick start their weight loss and drop weight quickly to buy this suit along with the hat becuase the combination works great!!!
5	1304640000	Great product - I bought it primarily as a warmup suit to keep my muscles warm during heavy weight lifting. Suit works very well for this. suit is non-restrictive and works great for exercising. Also, using your chest measurement works well for getting the correct size. highly recommended!
5	1304640000	I used this Kutting Weight Suit for about 2 weeks and amazingly I lost about 15 lbs . I also incorporated counting calories and carbs; not eating past 1200-1500 cals and drinking lots of water.  I ran on the treadmill for 30 mins to 60 mins and the weight just melted off!
5	1304467200	Great product and very fast delivery... Tried it on straight when it arrived and man, I was already sweating in it... Tried it while running on the treadmill and it looked like I just had a bath.. i was socked wet by 15min.. Will give it a go for a month and would see how's the performance... but I am excited for the coming month.. good product n would recommend it....
5	1304467200	Great product. It gets my blood pumping and builds up a sweat in no time. It's very flexible and my movements have not been limited at all when I work out.
4	1304467200	This is an awesome suit that helps me to burn even more, even faster.  Glad that I purchased it.
5	1304380800	this suit is amazing and very productive for weight loss management. it has contributed to my loss of 20-25 unwanted pounds. one caution to note i dried the suit after washing and it has developed a hole, but continues its purpose. Amazing!! The shirt from kutting weight is equally amazing. I truly  enjoy the look of its style.
5	1304208000	But you should probably order up a size or two. My bra size is 40D and I needed a size 4 XL.
5	1303948800	Great product...great fit!I by all means am not training for anything just common girl trying to add a little "extra" to my workout be it running outside or on the treadmill, elliptical, and/or weight training...this being said I have noticed some improvements in my workout and sweating it up way more and feeling more fit and tone...
5	1303948800	until I got my Kutting Weight Suit.  I really luv it, I use it when working out, in the stationary bike, doing Zumba at home and the treadmill.  Now I look forward to do my cardio.  Thanks Kutting Weight now my friends are going to buy one for themselves.
5	1303948800	Im happy I bought this suit. It really works!!! I sweat nonstop and it really increases my workout.  Make sure you drink a lot of water and stay hydrated with this suit on.
5	1303862400	Sweet Sweat is excellent and for the serious hardworkers in the fitness center I highly reommend it. It rids the water fat and floating
4	1303862400	Great product, well made and worth the money! No a longer a need for buying plastics suits that always rip and tear.  This suit has been used in multiple boxing program workouts and cardio session with no sign of wear and tear. Follow the instructions on how to use this product and you should be fine.  It will definitely help you lose water wieght, burn more calories, heat your core temp up and keep your body warm and kick up that metabolism. Dustin is very helpful and knows the product so if you have any questions or issues, he will definitely take care of you and ensure that you have what u want and are satisfied .....i recommend it if your in need of a quality suana suit
4	1303430400	Its an awesome item that do what is supposed to be doing! Keeps you warm and you can see the results really quickly but i still dont like the fact that it makes an upward fold and makes pressure in the groin area and it's annoying trying to walk, do squats or just sitting down.. I have to wear a cup everytime i use it so it doesnt squeeze around.. Other than that it's an awesome item!! I've been shedding pounds like crazy (water weight mostly) and burning fat also thanks to it! But i would like to be more lose down there...
5	1303430400	I run with this suit on a regular and OMG, it makes me sweat like crazy!! I wear a t shirt underneath the suit, and by the time I'm done running (approx 40 minutes or so on avg) the shirt is always drenched in sweat. I have gained about 10-12 lbs from the 2010 Christmas-New Years holidays and I have been trying to lose that since 2011 started. Ever since I started using the suit, I've lost a few pounds. I still have a long way to go, and will keep using the product to help trim me back to shape!I think this is a definitely good product, but it is a bit pricey. After my work outs, I sweat so much that I am super thirsty!!PROS:-This will enhance your work outs and you WILL sweat profusely! (Don't forget to replenish and drink water!!)-You will notice a difference in the amount you sweat from the first time of use.-JUST GET IT!!! ITS WORTH IT!!Cons:-The suit smells weird when its new.-It's pretty pricey, came up to $92 dollars with shipping-Sizes are very tight, I'm normally a medium, bought a large and it feels really tight on me. Would order 2 sizes up from what you would normally wear.
5	1302134400	I've used other sauna suit before but this outbeat the rest, the price i did find a little steep but i bought it anyway, the best investment of all time.when it first arrived and i tried it on right away it was a little tight in my chest area  had to wiggle the zipper over my boobs.the first day i used it i was sweating bullets, it was a little hard to move in because of the chess area but i worked thru with it anyways for an hour.the next day the same thing but i was so convince this item will melt me down to fit it right i didnt give up, on the third day the kutting weight suit went right up and over my boobs and left extra room,wow i thought i must of lost either inches from wearing this or weight.i weight myself an there was 4lbs gone, i didn't measure myself but i could tell inches was lost just from the fit of the item and my other clothes.Please get this item and let it help you reach your goal
5	1300233600	Well I wasnt really sure if the suit was going to work for me.I usually wear a plastic sauna suit and was fine with that but every 3-4 months I had to buy another one during the year.I saw this suit and I was planing to test it out and then return it, but I was amazed to find out how great it is.I live in nyc and this winter was horrible, due to the cold weather I was not so encourage to go to the gym but thanks to this suit I go very often because it warms me up and keeps me warm on my way out and makes me sweat a lot.I totally recommend it, it takes a while to get used to it (between the legs) but is not a big deal.Also the quality is great!
5	1298851200	This product is a God-send...have lost so much weight already..and fast...After I hit a plateau, I decided to try this rather thanturn to fat burning pills, etc. This product really works. Three of my friends bought it after I told them about it and havehad incredible results as well. Definitely money well spent. A+++++
5	1297900800	I 'm planning to get one more for my wife.So see can see the result,that I'm experiencing with the suit.I'm look forward to purchasing some workout rubber band that I cancarry with me,when I cannot make it to the gym ?Thank You !Mr. Tracy Johnson
5	1296864000	I did not purchase this suit for pre-competition weight loss.  I initially purchased it simply to promote perspiration during exercise for "detox" which for me means that I simply feel great if I sweat heavily during training.  (I supplement with [...] for electrolyte replacement if I drop a great deal of sweat, usually in already warmer weather.)  I was delighted with the results based upon the reasons I initially purchased it.I began using the suit for an entirely different purpose last winter and I am even more pleased.I walk daily, "HeavyHands Walking" style. (Or, as my 10 year old son calls it, "FunnyWalk.")http://www.amazon.com/Lion-45630-Heavyhands-Walking-Book/dp/B004AKWR48My walks are pre-dawn and this winter, (Long Island, New York,) has been a bear.  I've used the KuttingWeight Suit as a first layer walking in blizzard and sub-zero conditions.  As stated in the review title, "Excellent Product !"The "excellent service" part of the review title refers to the fact that I had a shipping issue when I purchased a second suit. (Shipper's fault, not the KuttingWeight's fault.)  Nevertheless, Dustin was all over the problem and provided excellent customer service.I just ordered the hat and I can't wait to start using it !
5	1296777600	First off I purchased the entire package, the hat, the "sweat" shirt and pants and the "slim suit" and all I can say is that THIS IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!  The products are an essential part of one's training gear!  I was so impressed!!  The quality is top notch  and most of all, it's designed by someone who is in the industry!  So a lot of thought and experience went into the product.  It's used by celebrities and athletes alike.  I am so pleased with the item that I plan on purchasing another set to rotate as I use this everyday for my workouts!  Sizing tip:  you may want to get one size bigger then your normal size.  I for instance, would wear a Large.  I've got 39"-40"inch chest and I got the XL and it fits beautifully.  A bit snug on the crotch when you raise your arms but that's how neoprene suits are in general.  I cannot recommend this product enough!  If you want to drop weight, detoxify your body and are serious about your fitness, then you need serious gear, KUTTING WEIGHT GEAR.  Kutting Weight products LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME!  PERIOD!
3	1293408000	At 6'1", 295lbs and shaped like a beach ball I ordered a 6xl since it's max was right on my measurements.  I can concur with the recommendation to order 1 size larger then you need.  While the suit fits it's a bit tight in the middle which I expected and planned to work into a good fit, however it's tight on the shoulder and arms to the point to where moving the arms overhead produces a uncomfortable pressure on the top shoulder just above the bicep. The material does stretch but there should be more room here.  I'm not overly muscular in this area and if you have any kind of development it will just be worse.  Hopefully I'll be able to work into a better fit but I still think there could be a bit more material under the arm as done in the groin area to enable better arm fitment and support for someone with developed shoulders and arms.
4	1292112000	I purchased the weight suite to work out in after using a sweat belt for several weeks and getting good results so I figured why not try more than just the waist.  I have been very pleased with the quality and the performance of the product.  I use it almost every day and I work out for 45 to 50 minutes.  I can't believe how well it has helped my weight loss and reshaping of my body.  The sweat just pours off me and the fat along with it.  I have dropped 2 jean sizes in 8 weeks and I contribute much of it to this weight suite.  Not that my tough workouts and improved diet have not helped but I believe the Kutting Weight suite has really accelerate the process.  I strongly recommend this item to anyone wanting to increase their core temperature when they work out and increase the intensity of their workouts.
5	1290902400	I am a 41 year old wrestling coach. I wear this suit to every practice. The suit gets me warmed up quickly and keeps my back muscles warmed up throughout a two hour practice. Without the suit, older guys like me tend to get stiff after warming up to wrestle and then cooling back down during technique sessions or even a water break. With the suit, I can get back into "live wrestling" and full speed drilling back like I could when I was twenty.Dustin - you have created a "mini-time machine super suit" that lets us old-timers get back into the mix and enjoy going full speed without stiffness or injury.This is really the greatest workout-related product I have ever purchased.Todd
5	1289001600	This suite awesome, I wear it every time I run, I can feel the weight coming off.
5	1287446400	I've had other sauna suits, and this is nothing like it. It raises your core temp as it describes much more effectively than anything else I have tried. When worn under gym clothes, and long shorts or sweat pants, and no one can tell you are wearing it (wear dark, because the sweat pattern looks weird). Kept my upper leg warm and loose through out my workout, and I can see why they say it allows you to be more flexible. Stitching is top notch and the zipper glides smoothly, and there is a little tab at the top to tuck it away. Dries extremely fast. Does not make that weird russling trash bag noise like other suits. Definitely worth the money in quality and performace. Not use to something being this form fitting, use the sizing guidelines, because if I would have gone with what I thought, it would have definitely been wrong. Great product!
5	1284422400	This is a great product that really works.  It is far more comfortable and durable than conventional 'sauna suits', and it will make you sweat!  It is easy to use, and can be worn for a number of different physical activities.
5	1282348800	This is probably the best invention in the history of trying to make weight for competition.  I wish I'd discovered it BEFORE dropping 48 lbs. in 24 wks. for a bodybuilding competition.It fits like a glove, and from the moment you zip it up, you start feeling warmer.  I used it in conjunction with long-sleeved shirt, pants and hat, and I can honestly say I don't think I've EVER sweated so much, even wrestling in plastic sweats in an over-heated wrestling room back in high school.Wow!On top of water loss, though, there's another feature most folks don't consider:  by elevating your body temperature, your metabolism increases.  I tested it -- after an hour on the recumbent bike, my body temperature increased 2.7 degrees!  That represents well over a 20% increase in my metabolic rate, meaning my body was burning calories faster, not only because of the exercise, but the increase in temperature.  A half-hour after I took the suit off, my temp had only dropped half-a-degree, meaning that the effect lasted even after I took off the suit.This is a great product for anyone looking to drop weight -- whether for wrestling, MMA, Boxing or Bodybuilding!
5	1281484800	I've been looking for a under workout suit and found this one.  Make sure you get the right size since I had to return mine.  The suit really makes me sweat and it's very comfortable while working out.
5	1281312000	I have been bike-riding for the past two months and wearing the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit.  The combination of my 8 mile bike ride and wearing the suit has resulted in a 23 lbs of weight loss.I was at 223, I am going down to 175 by next July if not sooner. Get the sauna suit it helps.
5	1274832000	I bought the Kutting Weight suit a few weeks ago. I wanted to get on here and tell everyone that this suit is INCREDIBLE! I love the feeling I get when I am done working out and my suit is soaked with sweat. It has made me interested in fitness again because of its "feel good" quality. I have been able to drop pounds immediately. I was able to lose 3 pounds in 30 minutes today. Thank you Kutting Weight!
5	1274659200	I used the Kutting Weight Sauna Suit and it made each and every workout worthwhile and allowed for faster fitness results.  I would suggest anyone looking to get fit fast and effectively to workout with this Kutting Weight suit.
5	1274572800	If you want to actually lose weight in a fast yet healthy manner, with no strings attached, then the Kutting Weight Suit is for you.I have had this suit for over two years, and it still looks as if it has never been used, despite each time I take it off it is soaked with sweat.Definitely recommended for the novice or the advanced fitness pros. Easy and fast Kutting, great investment!!!
5	1274486400	The Kutting Weight suit is amazing.  I've dropped up to 6 pounds in a single workout with the suit. Plus it's comfortable, flexible and helps me sweat out toxins in my body.  I've worn the suit for 2 years now and I plan to wear it for many many more!
5	1274400000	I can't say enough about the Kutting Weight products! The sauna suit feels great and you can even wear it under your regular work-out clothes if you want.  I reached my weight loss goal in half the time thanks to this suit!
5	1274227200	I've tried about every sauna suit through out my 14 year wrestling career and this one is by far the best.  I got sick of buying cheap plastics that would rip.  Even the ones like Realsauna suit rip; on the first time I used it.I'll never use another one, after using this one.  The best part about it is you can wear it under a pair of T-shirt and shorts and sweat just as much as the cheap plastics and no one can even see your wearing it.
