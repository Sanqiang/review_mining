5	1405987200	Everyone should get this case its awesome.
5	1405728000	Pretty and just as ordered, quick delivery and very durable. I would recommend.
5	1405296000	Great transaction and I love my phone case.
1	1405209600	Ballistic is not a good case and they do not honor their life time warranty. My phone dropped from a 18 inch ledge onto the floor and the screen cracked instantly. Ballistic will not cover any costs incurred to fix the screen because they said Amazon is not an authorized retailer even though this product is being shipped from Ballistic. If I could I would give this 0 stars.
5	1405209600	Awesome, love it. After shattering my screen with a cheaper case, I knew I had to invest in better protection for my phone.
4	1405123200	Case works great. Protects my phone from day to day bumps and drops. Fits snugly over my phone and the plastic shell is very sturdy. Only con is that the rubber casing is just a little loose. Other than that perfect case. Would definitely get another one.
5	1404950400	I love my new cover better than the Otter box one I had.
5	1404950400	Works great. Protects phone well from drops
5	1404950400	Awesome case had it for about 7 months. Was worried it doesn't have a face cover but the case is so good I haven't had any scratches on it.
4	1404864000	great
5	1404864000	This case has saved my phone several times when I accidentally dropped it. It's perfect for parents of young kids.
5	1404864000	Great case, it doesn't look like it would protect much, but I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and the case has totally protected the phone, not even a scratch.  Love this case.
5	1404777600	So like everyone else was saying, it fits like a glove and goes on in two pieces. The soft rubber sleeve goes on first, and then the plastic frame goes on top of that and grips the rubber sleeve.Looks great on the phone, like it should have come with the GalaxyS3 in the first place! Everyone who has seen it has commented on how nice it looks.I've accidently dropped the phone several times, and these case did an excellent job of absorbing the shock. So much so that the phone didn't even really make a sound when it hit the floor. I was amazed.Don't under-estimate those corner bumpers on the case, they do exactly what you would expect them to do and are a great feature and obviously a lot of thought went in to it. Only thing I think they could improve is the cut away where the power cord plugs in to the phone I think should be tapered at an angle so it would be easier to plug the cord in to the phone, but it's really a minor issue.I highly recommend this case!
5	1404777600	Works great, fits great! Really protects the phone, and has protected it from a drop already!
5	1404777600	Best covers
5	1404691200	I absolutely love my case I've had for months now, better than outterbox in my eyes. I had an outterbox which made my phone bulky and it broke after 2 months..The ballistic keeps it thin and its rubber mostly so no breaking.
4	1404604800	very good it's just kind of price it.
4	1404604800	Fits fine and seems to protect from drops pretty well (have toddler so its got a workout).  Rubber part rubs make-up which is annoying and I wish it would have come with a screen protector but eh. Price great.
5	1404604800	Great phone cover, fits great on the phone.
5	1404604800	Have dropped my phone many times and it was protected. The anti-skid works for the most part. Adds just enough bulk to make the phone feel secure in my hands, but still able to put in my pocket! LOVE IT! BUY BUY BUY.
5	1404604800	I love this case! I have dropped my phone a billion times and it is still fine! It is VERY easy to remove but never comes off if I don't want it to. LOVE LOVE LOVE!
2	1404604800	Smart looking cover and looked very durable but wouldn't stay in place. The outer protector case kept slipping/fallingout of the rubber case.
5	1404518400	We purchased this cover after a poor result with Otter Box.I like how it is not bulky.The cover has just enough texture to prevent it from slipping out of your pocket or hand.It does not have a screen cover like the Otter Box. However the case has enough of a lip to offer a bumper on the front. If the phone is face down, the screen will not touch the flag surface.It was easy to put in place. It was equally easy to remove for cleaning.It has provided protection from multiple drops.I would purchase again!
5	1404432000	I've had this case on my phone for a year now. Best case I have EVER purchased. Better than otterbox. I drop my phone at least once a day. This case has maintained its shape and it's not bulky.
5	1404345600	Great case. Fits perfectly. Feel very secure with phone in this case. No issues with charging as I have heard with other cases.
3	1404345600	Wasn't what I thought it was but it works
5	1404345600	The case is great and has saved this phone when I dropped it recently.
5	1404259200	Nice fit, looks very professional
5	1404259200	This is a great case!  I have dropped it on my ceramic tile floor several times and it seems to just bounce with no damage to the case or phone. Love the bright blue color!
5	1404259200	Love the colors just how it looks, good quality and protection... great product!!
5	1404172800	I've been using it every day since I got it. I like the rubber outside so it doesn't slip from my hands. Grip is awesome. Feels nice. Have dropped it several times and not a scratch. Of course now that I wrote that, it's going to break. oh well. I would recommend it.
5	1404172800	Dropped my phone and the screen didn't shatter. Doesn't feel bulky to me.
5	1404172800	This product is exactly as described.  I compared it with two similar products on YouTube that were more expensive.  I like the nonskid grip in my hands and the tight fit. You can use all of the phone's buttons with no problems.  My toddler has tossed this a couple of times and it has survived without any problems.
5	1404086400	It works great. Absolutely happy with the case
4	1404086400	This case protects my phone well, though it seems to interfere with my reception. It also does not keep water out as well as I would like.
5	1404086400	Works great for half the price of my sons Otterbox.  Why spend money you don't need too?
5	1404086400	This case provided the extra protection that we felt was needed for my niece's new smartphone after she had already accidentally dropped it a couple of times. Perfect fit. Works great and it's her favorite color.
5	1404086400	Iam very happy with the Ballistic Case. Its very light and has just enough rubber for a good grip.I was very hehesitant to purchase because I was afraid it would slip easily, but no. Love the color as well.
5	1404000000	This was exactly what I needed to protect my new phone.  Sturdy and functional, and I love the color. No complaints so far . . . .
5	1404000000	5 min after I put it on I dropped my phone and thank God I had the case on thank you ballistic
5	1404000000	with this case now i feel my phone is way more protected especially after dropping it once already and cracked the screen.
5	1403913600	I really like this case and it seems very sturdy and has good &#34;grip&#34;  I think it would protect my phone well if it was dropped.  I didn't have a problem with the buttons functioning either.  The instructions stated to put the volume side of the case on, then snap the right side in.  I would recommend!
5	1403827200	My mother loves the color of the case and she loves the case on her phone, she feels her phone is protected!
5	1403827200	Fits perfectly
5	1403827200	This case does a great job of protecting my phone.
5	1403740800	This is a great product, and I am totally satisfied with it, matter of fact it really exceeded my expectation
4	1403740800	It fits great. It looks great. It is exactly what I wanted for my new Galaxy S3. I might buy another one in a different color if I get bored with blue over time.
5	1403481600	Ballistic always makes nice cases. This one is no exception and protects like nothing else. Plenty of lip on the sides of the screen to protect the screen from breaking in a fall.
5	1403481600	Had an OtterBox but this case is much better!!! I would recommend this case to someone looking for a new case, priced right!!Fast shipping!
5	1403481600	This product is the perfect solution to protect my phone. I have dropped it several times since I purchased the case and it totally protected my device as expected. Very pleased with my purchase.
5	1403481600	I bought the Ballistic Phone Case to replace my Otterbox Case that broke.  I am pleasantly surprised at how much better this is!  They were genius enough to reinvent what everyone thought was the best case & made it even better!
5	1403395200	I'm fairly certAin I already reviewed this product.  I Like it.  It meets my expectations.  I've never had an otter box to compare with. It does the job, good for  the  price.
5	1403222400	This was easy to put on, great quality material, easy to grip to keep hold of the phone, and pretty colors. Love it!
5	1403222400	This is a superb case for the Samsung Galaxy S3 at an outstanding value.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality protective case.
4	1403222400	loved the color even though I wanted bright orange. it feels nice and safe in the case. I thought that it would have a built in screen protector. I was expecting that. I would prefer that. but I would buy from this same company again.
5	1403136000	Delivered as promised and the case is nice.Does not protect glass very well but protects the rest of the phone.I have dropped several times and protected phone... but not glass screen.
5	1403136000	I bought this to replace a defunct Otterbox Defender that became useless after 4 months of use. I paid $50 for it at Best Buy expecting a super legit case, and it turned out to be a giant waste of money. The screen protector got dust under it immediately and made typing and swiping harder, the rubber outer case got loose and wouldn't stay on, and the buttons were hard to press through the case.This Ballistic case on the other hand has no screen protector (which I prefer since the S3 has gorilla glass anyway), is a simple 2 piece design, is less bulky, is more attractive (in my opinion), and the buttons are just as easy to use as if the case weren't there. I've dropped my phone a few times and had 0 issues with damage with this case on it. On top of all of that, it was less than half of what I paid for the Otterbox and has not had one problem yet! I've been rocking it for 3 months now and it is just as snug as the day I first put it on. This Case is a winner!!
5	1403136000	I love this case!  It has protected my phone against breaking and is very durable.  The case is easy to use and very convenient.  I would buy this product again for my next phone!
4	1403049600	I was a little skeptical about buying this case over an Otterbox since a lot of the reviews weren't stellar. Nevertheless, I am very happy with my purchase! I love the color and I feel like it really protects my phone. The only reason why I haven't given it 5 stars is that I haven't dropped my phone yet, so I can't vouch for its effectiveness. But as of now, so far so good.
5	1403049600	Arrived FAST!  Great packaging,  fits perfectly on my Samsung S3. Have dropped it a few times already and no cracks or scratches. I love it!
5	1403049600	My expensive case had a large chip in it (not sure how it got there), but this appears to be as good as the more expensive brand that I've bought in the past.
3	1402963200	Okay first thing. This thing has saved my phone from breaking. And I will pick practical use over pretty. BUT it's not QUITE the color I had hoped for. I probably would have chosen a different color if I'd known it would be more pink that highlighter purple. BUT STILL. It's a good product.
5	1402963200	Great buy!  This works wells, I am clumsy and drop my phone a lot.  This case keeps it protected!  Bought one for my husband since then.
4	1402963200	Fast shipping and product was as advertised. :) The material is sturdy, if a little clumsy to attach, and the color is bright and lovely.Satisfied customer.
5	1402963200	HAVE HAD FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. HAVE DROPPED MANY TIMES AND EVERYTING IS STILL GREAT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WOULD BUY AGAIN.
5	1402876800	I received the phone case the other day, I have had something similar to this before. It protects my phone very well. I love the colors and how smooth it feels. If you want protection, but don't want to spend a lot of money, I recommend this. Everything on my phone works well with it.
5	1402790400	With a teething 1 year old and a 2 year old who like to use mommy's phone I can honestly say this case is very durable. I have had several other cases and my children have destroyed them all. So far no destruction and it has held up against many drops.
5	1402704000	I owned an OtterBox prior to this case so if anyone's on the fence on which to get, I'll give a side by side comparison.First, the basics. The Ballistic is rubber inside, plastic outer case, but no cover for the touch screen. The OtterBox is the reverse; plastic inner and outer rubber with the added benefit of having a screen cover. Both have decent color options, but personally I tend to think the Ballistic is a bit more stylish and sleek in appearance.Size: The OtterBox is slightly more bulky than the Ballistic, and increased size means more difficulty getting in/out of pockets. In addition to being slimmer, the Ballistic's smooth plastic coating makes it somewhat easier insert/remove phone from pockets.Grip: The OtterBox's outer rubber coating means you have a pretty solid grip compared to most plastic coatings, but the Ballistic makes up for this by having a textured back which keeps the phone from being slippery. Both are pretty solid for one-handed grip, but if I had to choose one, I'd say the OtterBox has a slight edge over the Ballistic.Protection: Both are good. Both passed the unintentional pocket drop test with phone no worse for wear.Ports: OtterBox has it's ports covered whereas Ballistic does not. The OtterBox's headphone port cover was somewhat deviated to the side making it difficult to use some of the bulkier headphone jacks. If you charge your phone frequently or like to run with music, the Ballistic is more convenient, but if you keep your phone in a purse/bag where the ports might get damaged by small objects, keys, etc, then the OtterBox might be a better fit.Buttons: The buttons (most notably the volume) on the Ballistic are much easier to use than the OtterBoxPutting on/removing case: Equivocal; the Ballistic is a little easier to take off, but the OtterBox is easier to put on. I will say I had to periodically remove my OtterBox case for no other reason than to clean out dust on the inside the screen cover, an annoyance you won't have with the Ballistic. If you change your battery or memory card frequently, you may want to consider other cases that are a bit faster to put on/take off as each of these takes a few minutes.Long term durability: Over time, my OtterBox got pretty worn down at the corners from me constantly shoving it in my pocket, and the rubber began pealing away from the plastic. I don't think the Ballistic will have the same issues, but at this time I haven't owned it long enough to give it an honest &#34;wear and tear&#34; trial. If I had to guess, the issue long-term with the Ballistic may be the plastic coating falling off, but if you don't plan on removing the cover frequently, this likely won't be a major issue. I will update this at a later time as issues arise.Price: If you shop around, you can probably find well-priced OtterBoxes, but in general, the Ballistic costs roughly half as much. If you want to add a screen cover, that brings the price difference a bit closer but still leaves Ballistic with a slight edge.All in all, if you want extra protection for your ports and screen and don't mind a bit extra bulk, go for the OtterBox. If you want more convenient port access, a slimmer frame, lower cost, and don't mind the lack of screen cover, go for the Ballistic.
5	1402531200	Very pleased with this case it protects my phone and I like how you can carry it knowing it won't slip out of your hand. There is no bling but your phone is safe.
4	1402531200	The color of this product is not the same when you have it on hand, my wife likes it. When she accidentally drops her phone it doesn't come apart it stays together.
4	1402531200	Perfect fit, protects my expensive phone from drops and bumps.  The included screen protector is only OK ~ it didn't hold up to the riggers of my work life as well as the original screen protector.  Other than that I really like this case still looks good after almost 5 months of daily use by a very hard working man.
4	1402358400	i love this case protects my phone very good and i love the quality of the case i do recomended.
5	1402185600	I've been using this case for about a month and have dropped my phone a few times and it has been undamaged.  Last week I was roofing and using my phone for music, (stupidly) I dropped my phone and it rolled and bounced off the roof.  No damage!  It is easy to slip in and out of my pocket and looks pretty cool too!  Definitely recommend it!
5	1401926400	This case fits nice and not as bulky as my old case.  Fits snug, but easy to put on.  No screen protector, but they are pretty inexpensive to purchase separately.  The pink is not as bright as pictured, but not a big deal to me.
2	1401926400	The case is robust but it affects the volume button.  When I try to decrease the volume,  it sky rockets.  I have tried to adjust the case multiple times but without success. .. would not buy again.
5	1401926400	Bought this case for my S3 to replace an otter box. Definitely prefer this one.Can use the side bottoms easily and protects very well.Like the design and color.
2	1401840000	I bought this case after reading reviews, thought it'd be great and less expensive than the otterbox. It is horrible. I dropped my phone in the GRASS and screen cracked. A friend of mine did the same with the otterbox defender and her phone is still in perfect condition. I recommend spending the extra $ and getting an otterbox or lifeproof case.
4	1401840000	Purchased this case for my wife and she says its either the best or one of the best cases she has ever owned I would buy this again and recommend it highly. I only give it 4 stars because the rubber around the edges seems to have dirt suck to it from her pocket. But the case its great, but the case would probably have looked liked this aft ea few months anyway.. but strange it happened to quickly.
5	1401753600	Works great, fits well and I have dropped my phone a few times with no breaking. No problems to speak of.
5	1401667200	I love this case. I wish they had a case at a reasonable price that encloses the entire phone with an easy way to use the touch screen.
5	1401667200	I can see where the rubber section may stretch out, but after 3-4 weeks it had worked fine even after taking it off 3-4 times.I would definitely buy this again.
5	1401580800	This is my second ballistics case first one unfortunately got lost with my other phone but really good case keeps the phone safe and easier to grab, but if your careless and let it drop and dont notice then becareful because the rubber edges prevent it from hurting the phone but also from making a sound which is how I lost mines overall great case, very sturdy.
5	1401408000	Great case, I love how its so easy to press the buttons. (i had a previous case where it was hard to press the buttons) Great quality and it has a nice grip. Well worth it :)
5	1401321600	Love it .. looks good, works like it is supposed (no I have not dropped my phone again to test it!!) and the price was awesome!!  Would definitely buy Ballistic again!
5	1401321600	My wife had a different case for Galaxy SIII before and dropped the phone from 2 feet.  The screen broke.  We had to replace the phone.  I bought the Ballistic for her this time.  Even though it makes the phone a little heavier, the support is really good, both front and back.  I like this product.
5	1401235200	case is a very good buy and protects the phone very well. The case arrived and looked just like described
1	1401148800	The case has this wierd buldge on the sides and will not fit my phone properly. i ahd to double check when i got the case to make sure i got the right one because the fit was that bad. I am not sure if i just got a defected one or not but I had to go back to my old case because I didnt want to have to keep adjusting my phone case all day long!
5	1401062400	Around the years i have boght several cases por different cellphones, and i have to say that nothing compares to ballisctic. I`m a loyal customer to this brand.
5	1401062400	I dropped my phone a lot and so far it has been safe with this case. It is cute too, which is rare for the stronger cases.
5	1400976000	I have just had this case a little over a week, but I really like it. I wish it had a screen protector, but it is otherwise great. I can get to all the buttons and ports that I need to use easily.
5	1400976000	My husband and I both ordered cases at the same time.  He ordered this one and I got some cutesy looking one.  He told me I was going to regret my decision and this time he was right.  My phone broke almost immediately and his still looks great.  Needless to say I went back and ordered my own just like his.
5	1400976000	So my mom has a GS3, and originally had an otterbox commuter for the phone.  The downside?  Not even I can press the buttons easily, the case is just too stiff in the regard.  So it had to go, I opted to try this case and no problem, good fit, nice color, and easy button presses for all.  Win win.
5	1400976000	this case has protected my phone really well. especially since it likes to fall on the corners so the corner edges make it bounce. im happy with it over all. its done its job on occasion. the only thing is that its a bit bulky and makes it hard to take in and out of jean/pant pockets but ive learned to live with that. id rather have a functioning phone then a fat bill for a new one.
4	1400889600	At first, I was leery about this cover because of the reviews that said it was hard to remove, but it's really a snap to get on and off.  The main thing is to separate the rubbery cover from the hard plastic brace that holds it in place.  Once you separate them, you can easily put the rubber case around your phone and then snap the hard plastic in place.  Same holds when removing.  Love the sturdy, wrap-around protection!
5	1400803200	Works great, I've dropped my phone a bajillon times and no breakage. It does make your phone a lot bigger though, but I can still fit it in my back pocket.
4	1400716800	Well, this has been in use for over a year and after a few drops, protects the Samsung S3 just fine.  The Wife likes that she can hold it without losing grip and it likes to fall on the rubber corners when she drops it.  Nice double shell setup.
5	1400716800	These are really rugged covers and have saved my phone more than once from some pretty harsh falls on concrete. They are a little bigger than some other protectors out there, however, I feel the slight increase in size is worth the extra protection. The materials and finish are nice too, a great looking cover overall.
5	1400630400	I choose this case because my last phone case was a &#34;pretty&#34; case and when I dropped my phone (which is inevitable for most) the screen cracked and smashed beyond repair and I had to pay out $150 for a replacement phone. I quickly regretted purchasing a case based on looks alone. This case however not only looks great, still keeps my phone slim but it does the job of protecting my phone. Within a week of getting it I dropped it face down on tiled floor from about 4 feet. The case totally absorbed the shock and I had zero damage to my phone. I will always buy Ballistic cases!
5	1400630400	Love this phone cover. Not bulky at all. All buttons are easy to get to.  Soft to the touch.  Got one for my daughter too and she loves hers as well
1	1400544000	It broke within the first week I'm honestly not happy at all. I feel like I should either get a new one for free or a better one at a discount. This is completely unfair.
5	1400457600	I liked the case . The sharp blue took a little to get used to. All dark blue would have been better.
2	1400457600	It didn't fit my phone just right it kept coming off all the time. I loved the color but the case kept coming off
5	1400371200	I love this phone cover! Most of my family and friends have the &#34;O&#34;ther cover. Although I like the other one, it just seemed a little big and bulky for my taste. An employee at the Verizon store recommended the Ballistic cover and it was a great choice for me.
5	1400284800	It took me forever to finally decide on a case for my Samsung Galaxy S3 after buying one that was nearly impossible to put on. I decided to take a chance on this case and I'm glad I did. I love it! It has done a great job of protecting my phone and it's VERY easy to put on and remove. I would recommend this case to anyone.
4	1400284800	I've dropped my phone a couple times and not had any problems. Has good friction so it doesn't slide off things like the bare phone does.  For the price it probably is one of the best cases for a Galaxy III.
5	1400198400	Love this case. It is just like my old otterbox. The buttons are easier to press and I like the price better! Very happy! My 18 month old throws my phone down all the time and the case stays put!
5	1400198400	My wife loves her new case.  The fit is perfect for her Galaxy S3 and it is well protected in there.  It has already survived one drop.  She is on here second phone after the first one not surviving with the standard flip cover style case.
5	1400198400	Nice and easy to put on phone and I like the protection it gives my phone. I also really liked the color.
5	1400198400	I switched from an Otterbox and have to say that I'm sold on the Ballistic case. It fits my phone very tightly (a little effort was needed to get the outer hard shell over the softer silicon layer - but in the end, this makes the case fit really well) and I really can't complain at all. It's still a little bulky, but I tend to drop my phone a lot so it's definitely what I was looking for and what I need. Additionally, the commuter otterbox (what I had before) was all soft silicon on the back layer which made it difficult to put into my back pocket, a smaller clutch, etc... now, granted that the phone+case is rather large and doesn't fit into my pocket well anyway, this case IS much easier to slide it into my pocket when I need to. I would definitely recommend this product to others!
5	1400112000	I loved this case..loved the color, the snug fit unto my fone..overall I am totally happy with my purchase. .thank you..
5	1400112000	Loved this case. Wasn't very bulky, but still felt very sturdy. I really liked this case, a definite buy! Cheaper than an otter box, but very durable.
5	1400112000	I love my case, works great, it fell a few times but my S3 is still in tack! Great buy!
5	1400025600	This case is def worth the money..  protects the phone from falls with its sturdy corners and and raised front..
5	1400025600	The case was an easy one to put on the phone. It looks great and has saved the phone at least once since I got it. Highly recommend this!
2	1400025600	I can't use the back &#34;button&#34; on my phone due to how this is cut, it's very awkward. It has saved my phone from being broken on numerous occasions, but due to making it difficult to use the phone due to a design flaw I can't say I really like it. If they rounded the corners on the front like an otterbox does I'd give this 5 stars every day. I've given it a few months thinking I could make it work but am going to just break down and buy the otterbox to replace this.
5	1399939200	My hubby destroys phones in 2 seconds flat. So i got this for him. First of all, I know PINK. But it is more so it stands out and he can find it easily. So far he has had his phone for a while and it is holding up great!!
5	1399852800	It's a snug fit, easy to put on. I have dropped my phone a handful of times already with it and it does exactly what you want it to. phone works great and case is still in one piece.  no complaints.
5	1399852800	bought this case as a surprise for a Samsung GS3 user.....it works great.  not too expensive and not too cheap.....protects your phone like a champ
3	1399766400	it fit fine however does not come with a belt clip/ holster of any kind and didnt see it in the description any where, but it works great
4	1399766400	I'm well pleased with this cover before buying I read the reviews on this product and many more the ballistic got  good reveiws and the price was reasonable. I decided to give it a try and I'm happy I did this product was a good investment
3	1399680000	Ok, not a great fit around the phone, but it will do for a while. Now I'm just withering on to fill the word limit.
5	1399680000	Purchased this several months ago.  Fits great, good quality and offers great protection for my S3.  Good value. Was given another case as a gift, tried it for a while and could not wait to switch back to this one.  Access to controls much much better with this than the other one.
5	1399593600	I would recommend came quickly thank you....not liking the fact that I am forced to type so many words if a comment is required then I should be able to type whatever I want without using filler words like this....annoying
2	1399593600	This was a gift for my daughter and didn't hold up very well...we had to buy another case within a month
1	1399593600	The case is OK, I also ordered a Otter Commuter case that is awesome. This case is a much better fit, but does not come in colors. The  Otter box comes with a protector shield which fit perfect and was clean. I wish I had two of the Otter cases and returned the protector sheets and the Ballistic for the Samsung Galaxy S III. Please respond, thank you.
5	1399593600	The case fits my S3 perfectly, nice and snug. It gives my phone a more rugged look, made me feel like I had a new phone again. It does make the phone a little bulkier but I think it's neccessary to fully protect the phone. I've dropped my phone gettingout of my car a couple times and no damage has occured to it. Overall I'm very satisified with this case.
4	1399420800	The only reason im giving four stars and not five is because it doesnt come with a screen protector .otherwise im pleased with it
3	1399334400	After having the Ballistic Case on my phone for approx 6 months the rubber part that goes around the phone has seemed to &#34;stretch&#34; out. It's loose and floppy on the ends. It does protect the phone when it drops.
5	1399334400	I bought this for my husband and he love it and we got it very soon. I wish they had other colors for myself.
5	1399334400	This thing is nearly indestructible. I bought 2. One for myself and one for my wife. She drops her phone even more than I do and we both have had no issues. These cost a little more than other cases but for protection this is the BOSS of them all. I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone.
5	1399334400	I've used Otterbox almost exclusively, but I loved this case. It's not a very slim case, but it's slim for the protection you get. I've chucked, dropped, and knocked this phone on so many things (on accident) and it still lives. Easy to slip on and off.
5	1399248000	So far I am very pleased with the purchase. Nice color and easy to remove and put back on. Good quality.
5	1399161600	Ever since I bought my Samsung Galaxy SIII the phone has been trying to kill itself. It jumps out of pockets onto concrete floors, it slides off counters onto tile floors and so it needed protection from itself. The Ballistic is prefect. The case provide excellent protection, it went on it a snap. The color has come in handy too. The phone likes to hide and the bright pink on the case stands out.
2	1399075200	Wife and I love this case until you have to take it off again.(Maybe you need to change SD card or take out the battery). When you take it off or it drops and hits the ground outside it breaks. Other than that its a great case. We went thru 4 cases for our phones because of them breaking.
5	1398988800	I got my case and it wasnt what I expected at all, I love how the rubber is on the inside and the hard cover is on the outside  but overall I am very satisfied.
5	1398988800	I like this a lot, thought it would be heavy and bulky but its not.I m going to purchase other colors .
5	1398902400	I like the size and easy fit of this case.  A little less expensive than ottercases but I feel it is just as good.  Only thing missing is the screen cover you get with otter cases - but I just ordered them separately.
4	1398902400	Although it's not the blue I thought it would be,  it looks fine. I've already dropped it twice on the cement garage floor while exiting my vehicle without any damage done. Taken some lickins but it's still tickin'.
5	1398816000	Thank you for providing this safety case for my phone.  I don't worry so much about the phone being dropped or broken because this frame is sturdy and durable.  Thanks!
5	1398816000	I was incredibly worried that this case would not fit my Samsung as it is not made by Samsung and I have seen other cases that claim to fit and don't even come close.  This cover fit perfectly and is exactly what I was looking for.  The phone is COMPLETELY protected, even if it falls directly on the face/screen.  The grippy feel makes it easy to hold onto and helps it stay put in the car instead of sliding all around.  Shipping was extremely fast, I received the case within a couple days.  I would definitely recommend this product.
5	1398643200	great fit came early works like a charm protects the phone really well and i feel as if it doesn't take anything away from the phone itself. like other cases take away from the design of the phone or even make it difficult to hear your phone calls because of the case.
5	1398556800	I am really happy with this case. It fits my phone really well. It is also really durable. I have accidentally thrown my phone down the stairs and it did not break while in this case!
4	1398556800	FANTASTIC! I drop my phone all the time & this case has saved my phone numerous times and me a lot of money! Very durable but could use a more girly look for girlish colors. It's not very sleek but hey, it protects your phone like nobody's business!
5	1398556800	This case has saved my phone a hundred times. A little bulky but the rubber corners work the best. Thanks.
5	1398297600	I have so many friends with broken iPhone screens. They wear them like badges of courage and honor, as though the person with the most cracked screen has the most street cred. They laugh, haughtily at the idea of phone cases and covers and instead brazenly put their iPhones on couch arms and the edges of counter-tops.hat's one of many reasons I got a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I decided I wanted to get a decent case for it. Being a professional in career but refusing to deny my adoration of the color pink I bought the Ballistic SG0930 in what they call Ruby Wine/Dark Wine. Don't let the fancy colors fool you, it's pink but I feel absolutely no shame in pulling my phone, with it's unshattered screen out from my pocket or purse.
5	1398211200	I am quite pleased with the quality of this cell phone case.  After reading reviews from others about the quality and the great price I decided to order and  I'm glad that I did.
4	1398211200	It  is good and beautiful. Very durable.  I love it.  It can easily be taken off and put back. You don't need to take off anyway
5	1398124800	When I got my new-to-me S3 I immediately ordered the Otterbox Commuter case for it, as I had been satisfied with that case on my old Droid X2.  Unfortunately I found it was very difficult to press the buttons, it was an inordinate struggle to get the case on and off the phone, and the color wasn't right.  Feeling unsatisfied, I went back onto Amazon and found the Ballistic.  What a difference!  Putting the case on, and taking it off, is a piece of cake, the buttons are very easy to press, and the pink/violet colors are lovely.  I also really like the rubberized back on the case.  It feels secure (but not overly grippy) in my hand and doesn't slide around when I set it on a table (unlike the Otterbox).  Overall I'm very satisfied.
5	1398124800	This case has the great colors that I was looking for and protects. This was a second option as I wanted to go with the OtterBox cases because it was for my daughter's phone. It exceeded my standards as far as style and durability.
5	1398124800	This is a really nice cell phone case and goes on easily, looks like it will do a great job protecting my phone. I only wish I wouldn't have dropped my phone 17 hrs. before I got this case in the mail, now it's going to cost $65 to repair my phone. So if you have an unprotected cell phone do yourself a favor and get a case for it, it will be the best $23 you spend for you phone.
5	1398124800	This case has saved my phone from many a tumble. GREAT buy, great price. You will not regret this purchase.
4	1398038400	Case protects phone very well.  Would recommend to a friend.  Only wish the case came in more colors like purple or green.
5	1397952000	I bought this for my GalaxyS3 at the end of June 2013. I love it! The case has held up well under abuse and numerous drops, and my phone is still going strong. It's small enough that I can still stick it in my back pocket if I want, and it does great in my purse. The under ballistic layer also has not lost shape in the 10 months I've been using it. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and will be using ballistic cases for my future phone cases!
4	1397952000	I had dropped my phone 2, so I had to get something. Love the pink color, haven't dropped my phone since I got this, so really don't know if it works. I'm able to use my buttons on the sides with no problem.
5	1397865600	Fit perfectly. Easy to put on & I believe it will protect my phone. Nice color also. Definitely a good buy.
3	1397865600	Pretty colour.  Not so easy to get off, but understandable so.  Arrived on promptly. What you see is what you got.  Which I am always concerned about when ordering online.
5	1397779200	best phone case I have ever owned, I have dropped my phone several times with this case and there's no damage to my phone and barely a scratch on the case
5	1397779200	My husband has the same phone and case, so I knew the case would be kind of bulky.  I need something to protect my phone WHEN I drop or bang it.  This case does the trick.  It is difficult, however, to find a wristlet or phone holder to fit it with the case on the phone.  5 stars all the way.
5	1397779200	Much better protection than previous case. I would recommend this product if someone is looking for a case that provides more protection.
5	1397779200	Great price, great case.  After having another phone break (in a case), I was looking for something stronger.  This is exactly what I was looking for - strong case, and cute color too.  I highly recommend this case for the S3 - fits easily & snug.
5	1397779200	I like this case. It fits my phone well and seems to work great. I've dropped my phone twice and had no damage at all.
5	1397692800	Works great! Just like an otter box. Only way better price. Easy to put on. And take off. Protects the phone well. My kids use these. They are 9 and 11. So they are pretty rough with their galaxy s3. They look nice too.
5	1397692800	These cases are very similar to the very popular Otterbox cases. But the price is more affordable. I've had my case for months and drop my phone constantly and am happy to report that my phone is still in like new condition.
5	1397606400	This case protected my phone with a million and one drops. it was easy to take off and on if i needed to get to the battery. The little piece of plastic by the volume cracked, but it didn't effect the overall durability of the case.I recently purchased a new phone and the black rubber part is being used interm for my daughters G2 phone case, it fits well, but not accuratly.
5	1397606400	This case is awesome!. It has saved my phone many times. I have dropped my phone and this case has saved it from being damaged in any way.
5	1397606400	I give this case 5 stars.  Within two weeks of having my phone, I broke the glass, right across the screen.  It fell on a corner on concrete and the glass shattered.  I got that fixed and then bought this case.  I have had it for almost two years now.  My replacement glass is just fine.I have dropped it many, many time on the corners and from standing height.  My almost two year old has dropped it (and thrown it).  It has stood the test of time.If you are klutzy like me, this case is wonderful and will protect your phone.Fantastic product.  Worth the money.  Very impressed.
5	1397606400	The case is designed very well and is very sturdy. The case has a very hard back and thick rubber edges to protect the phone. The first week I had it I dropped the phone and it bounced off my leg and landed on the back of the phone in my driveway. The phone is still working perfectly and I highly recommend this case.
4	1397606400	The phone has such a beautiful line to it, I hated to cover it up with this clunky cover.  But when I dropped the phone (EVERYone drops their phone at some point, right?) I was happy to have it.  I didn't even flinch when the phone hit the floor.  I knew it wouldn't feel a thing!
5	1397606400	after dropping phones a million times I finally invested in a strong case.  This ballistic case is great.  A little bulky but not too bulky.  It frankly just does the job and I'm confident the next time I drop my phone (which is inevitable) it is sturdy enough to do the job.  Great price and look as well
5	1397520000	I love my case.  It is so easy to put on and the protection is awesome.  Had an Otter and it wasn't has easy to cvoer the side buttons.  This is easy on easy off, but very secure
4	1397433600	Good protection for a great price!  I would recommend to anyone that is on a budget looking for a great little phone case.
5	1397433600	This item was PERFECT!!! Met my needs and was the perfect addition to my after hours wardrobe and weekend wear!  And obviously someone else loved it too because it disappeared :-(
4	1397347200	needed something strong and not too bulky and it fit my needs although pink is not my best choice for a  color.
5	1397347200	Protects the phone nicely. I don't have any more words that I can think of right at the exact minute.
5	1397260800	I'm impressed with the case, having used it for over six months now. The corners are a thicker, bouncier rubber for those accidental corner drops, and the hardshell back and sides offer excellent protection for everything else. It's a bit sleeker than most other cases for this phone, a definite plus. The colors are true to what you see in the pics.I've got no complaints about this sucker at all.If I were to make a wishlist of things I'd love to have on the case, the only thing I could list would be that the back of the case were slip-proof - some kind of thin rubberized coating. But the truth is, then it'd be a little more difficult to get in and out of pants pockets, and I'd probably be making an imaginary wishlist asking for a non-slip back.Ugh. Humans! We just can't be happy, can we??
5	1397260800	My delightful husband is hard on cell phones so I bought this and the screen protector for his new phone and so far the 2 items are protecting it nicely. Hurrah!
4	1397260800	color is more of a purple then a hot pink ... different then pictured in my opinion! but the case is a great case! fits well and has been dropped a few times an has protected the phone! 4 stars due to the fact i wanted hot pink and it isnt a true hot pink!
5	1397174400	Great case.  Protects my phone well.  Nice look.  A little hard to remove, be careful pulling from the sides.  Overall I am very pleased!
5	1397174400	This phone case is exactly what I wanted. It is comfortable to hold, not to bulky and not to thin. I have had no problems with this case and I've had it for a month or so. I would recommend this case.
5	1397088000	I've never wanted a hard case for my phone, but I love this....It is still easy to handle and carry and good protection for my phone..it also looks really great..definitely recommend this to anyone
5	1397088000	Even better than expected! Already dropped on tile floor with no damage to my phone!! Those were my expectations and have been met.
5	1397001600	I've had my S3 for 6 months now and put this case on as soon as I got the phone. Haven't needed another case yet! Definitely protects the phone! Who needs an expensive otter box??
5	1397001600	This case is great it protects my phone perfectly and the color is true to the color on the website
5	1396915200	This cover is great for protection.  Since I put the cover on I must have dropped the phone a couple of dozen times without a knick or scratch.  It has a great bumper guard all around and the buttons are not disrupted at all.  If you a little clutzy, then this is the phone case for you.
4	1396828800	I am very satisfied with my purchase. I experienced none of the problems others spoke of, it fits my Galaxy s 3 perfectly. I would recommend this to others.
4	1396828800	Grrr! Great. Loving my ballistic,  good look. Handle well and great protection for my galaxy phhone. Thinking about ordering more
5	1396828800	Great case, looks just like the photo. I really recommend this case, its good, looks nice and cheap which is the good part.
5	1396828800	great case with good protection for the phone...the case is easy to take off and put back on as well
5	1396828800	I bought this after ruining a new phone from accidentally dropping it. So what did I do after I got this case? Yup! I accidentally dropped my phone again! UGH! The great news was I never even got a scratch on it! I should have bought this when I got my phone as it would have saved me a chunk of change with getting a new screen!
5	1396742400	very reliable! I have two boys and with this case my phone is practically indestructible! I have dropped my phone twice, on hard concrete and everything is still intact!
5	1396656000	I didn't like the pink on it other than that its a good case. I recommend it if ur looking at buying it.
5	1396656000	this product fit my galaxy s111 perfect fits over buttons very nice quality would recommend this product colors great thanks
2	1396656000	The Black Part of the Case wants to keep slipping off from the pink part. Other than that its good
5	1396569600	Tough,  durable case. I've dropped my phone several times since purchasing this case,  and I've never worried about my Galaxy. I've had the Otterbox,  and while the Ballistic isn't as comprehensive (two layers of protection, vs three) I love how non- interfering the Ballistic is. Fits into my jean pockets easily.  All buttons are easily accessed and pressed. Would recommend getting a screen protector in addition to this case,  however.
4	1396569600	It a good case for a reasonable price. I bought it for my fiancee and she loves it! It makes the phone very shock resistant
5	1396569600	After having bought a different cover and returning it, I am very pleased with this sturdy cover.  Although I don't drop my phone but rarely, it is nice when that does happen on occasion.
4	1396569600	I would give 5 stars but when it first arrived it had a strong smell of rubber and chemicals. I made a paste of baking soda and water, cover the case and let it sit over night, that took it away. Some say my nose is highly sensitive but the smell gave me a headache. Anyways I love the fits and feels and is very protective.
5	1396483200	I love it....no complaints!!!!!! It's very sturdy and well made. I love the color and feel of it...I recommend it
4	1396483200	Only problem I have with it is that it tends to push against the edge of my screen protectors and they begin peeling up.  I have dropped my phone a couple times and there have been no problems at all with cracking screens.
5	1396396800	I bought this at the same time that I purchased my new Samsung SIII. I love this cover as it has a nice grippy feel to it and not heavy!There is plenty of corner protection and you can lay this face down and the screen is protected from touching the surface of everything.The Case fits perfectly and it looks great for less than the price of an Otterbox. Buy this and you will not be disappointed.
4	1396396800	I have dropped my phone with the case from 7 feet onto a hard concrete floor. It's doing its job and so far so good.
5	1396224000	Love the case works great fits perfect on my phone! Shipment was on time and to put the case on was really easy.
4	1396137600	I looked at a similar case to this locally for $40 so I decided to purchase this case. The case was easy to put on the phone and looks great.
5	1396137600	Excellent fit for the S3. Keeps the phone protected and makes it easy to grip. It doesn't make it too bulky either. Nice color in blue.
4	1396137600	great case for the price, would definitely recommend fits the phone perfectly and I looks like it will protect my phone from damage.
4	1396051200	Quality is good, easy to take on and off the phone for switching out fresh battery. Phone has survived several drops intact. The hard &#34;shell&#34; sides are too slippery for the phone to stand up on its own (sideways) but overall a very good product. Product color is exactly as shown in photo.
5	1396051200	This has been a great case! I have been using it for months now and it still looks new and so does my phone!
5	1395878400	Awesome case! Fits snug and keeps the phone protected. Love the color. Great value for the price. I have another one in black so I can change them out and have a different look
5	1395878400	This is a sturdy quality case cover without being bulky.  Very reasonably priced.  Easy to take on and off.  However, it does not include a screen cover.
5	1395878400	So much sturdier than the other cases out there.  My phone is 10x safer now!  Even my daughters like it.
4	1395878400	Durable phone cover. I like the fact that the power key is easy to push, as opposed to the Otterbox brand that my husband has. Compared to the Otterbox, it's not as bulky. I have dropped my phone a couple of times and the case does it's job.
5	1395792000	I'm using this cover for over a year now. I dropped it few times, yet the phone is still unscratched and in one piece. I think that this says it all.
5	1395792000	Fits snugly and you are able to use the keys on the side of the phone this is a great item.
4	1395792000	Just as earlier reviews have stated, this cover has soft but sturdy feeling and the plastic back panel makes it slide fairly easily in and out of pants' or purse pockets. And unlike some reviewers, I had little difficulty inserting my phone into the dual-layer cover and all my buttons and outlets are working fine.
1	1395792000	I bought this for my wife's phone and when I speak to her my voice echos very loudly. When she takes the case off there are no problems.
5	1395619200	I love the color of the case. I have dropped by phone several times since purchasing this case and my phone has remained protected.
5	1395619200	This case has been great! My only problem would be how it tries to slip off at times. Other than that I've had no problems. Even dropped my phone and all was ok. Overall loved this item
5	1395619200	Price was right and item came quickly.  The fit was perfect and the protection covered all the edges and corners, which is what you need for these devices.
5	1395532800	Bought this for my wife's Samsung GIII and she loves it.  It stays on the phone (unlike the silicone only cases) and doesn't slip or slide around while you are using the phone.
5	1395532800	I was nervous for the first day I had my new phone.  I do drop things, and my now-defunct five year old Blackberry has plenty of battle scars.  I know that Gorilla Glass is very resistant to scratches but it is brittle.  I've seen many Samsung smart phones with cracked glass.  I noticed that the glass surface of the main camera touches whatever surface you set the phone on, and there's nothing I hate more than a scratched camera lens.The Ballistic case has extra thick soft silicone at the vulnerable corners, and provides ample clearance both for the camera lens and the front glass.  The Ballistic case encases the side buttons with silicone, so if you operate them with a wet or dirty finger they are protected.Installation is simple.
5	1395446400	price was right and it was what I was looking for holds my phone perfectly and easy to install protects phone good
5	1395446400	The color is true to the photo, and i've had no problems with this case.  Comfortable, and dosen't block sound.
4	1395360000	This case looks and fits better than the high priced Otterbox. The quality is just as good too. Better even!
5	1395273600	Love this cover. Easy to put on and take off. All the buttons on the side of the phone line up perfectly.
5	1395273600	Great product! love the color!! came exactly as desricbed. fit great. no issues at all with it. will maybe buy another
5	1395187200	It looks little bit bulky. But if your baby child kick the phone off the table you'll must not scary too much ;)
4	1395187200	It secures my phone properly n is a pretty color! I thought the color was sooooo appropriate bc I love red n pink wines! Also like the feel, smoothness n softness of this case!
4	1395187200	This is the best case that I have ever had!  I have dropped my phone so may times in this case, and it bounces like a rubber ball.  I have ordered other cases, they have all torned up,(all but 1) but the ballistic is still going strong.  The only reason why I ordered other cases, is because I love to change the colors up.  If ballistic would make more colors in these cases, there would be no reason to try any other.
5	1395187200	The Ballistic case for my phone has exceeded my expectations for protecting my phone. Unfortunately, it has had several occasions to prove its sturdiness.
5	1395100800	This case has a snug fit, it looks good, and does its job - as I have already dropped my phone several times.
5	1395100800	It's easy to put together and have had no negitve issues.  Gives it a little more bulk, but the phone alone seems too breakable without it.
5	1395100800	This fits the phone great the buttons react perfectly. its sturdy and durable, The one time she took her phone out she cracked the screen LOL!. BTW you will need a screen protector.
5	1395014400	The case came as advertised. Works and fits great. Some people have said they had a problem with the fit and the outer shell coming off. This is not the case here it fits and stays together just fine.
4	1395014400	This case fits good, the only drawback is it doesn't have the built-in screen protector that Otter Box has.Of course, if you don't want the built-in screen protector, this would be a plus...
1	1395014400	Ii read the reviews and saw good things it's a sorry excuse for a phone case. It's lightweight but it doesn't protect your phone. What a waste!!!
5	1395014400	This is the second one of these I have purchased, they are very good quality and protect the device very well.
5	1394928000	Without being overly bulky, this case provides superior protection for my cell phone.  I'm sorry I didn't find it sooner.
5	1394928000	Replaced my Defender for this case. Although the defender did the job, the rubber stretched so much that it came off.  With this case the rubber is on the inside of the plastic... so far so good.
5	1394928000	These are great cases for this cell phone easy on and easy off all ports are perfect and all buttons work well, very nice, and very sturdy...
3	1394928000	I was looking to by the belt clip part of the holder and I thought it was included as one unit
5	1394841600	Very pleased it was a birthday gift for my daughter-n-law and she really liked it and also I was very happy with the shipping very prompt and the quality of the product was awesome!!
5	1394841600	It fits great. Easy to put on. About a week after I got it dropped my phone with no damage.
2	1394755200	It doesn't seem to fit very well.  The outer shell Keeps coming off. I finally just left it off and am only using the rubber shell piece.
5	1394755200	This cover fits well and seems sturdy.  Haven't had any problems with it so far.  I like the color and the feel of it.
5	1394755200	its pretty and protects my phone. i drop my phone just to show people how great it works. My teacher even has this case
4	1394755200	The screen was spotty,so ended up putting my old screen in that also looked more durable.Other than that I liked the lightness of it very much and loved the blue color very much.
5	1394755200	This case fits my wife's phone perfect. She was impressed that I got exactly what she wanted and all of girlfriends are jealous! Score one for the Men!!!!!
4	1394668800	We got this for my sons phone.  I was worried he would think it's too bulky but he likes it.  He's dropped it twice with no damage and that's the most important thing right?
5	1394582400	Bought 2 of these for my new Samsung S3 phones.  They fit perfectly and seem to offer same protection as the Otterbox that I had on my old phones.  My wife likes the blue color on her phone.  The black one looks sleek on my phone as well.  Worth the money!
5	1394582400	Chose this because a friend has this case and it fits well and protects the phone from being damaged in a drop. Love it. Shipped promptly an exactly as described
2	1394496000	Didn't come with screen saver as shown. Need the clear plastic screen saver cause mine had a crack in it that the only reason I order it
5	1394496000	I love this case! I have dropped my phone several times since i had this case on my phone and it does take the impact and keep the phone safe.
5	1394496000	Fits my phone perfectly. My phone has dropped three times and nothing happened to the glass. It does what it says. It protects your phone.
1	1394409600	SO frustrating.  I upgraded to this case to protect my screen, since I and my kids often drop my phone.  Just dropped it from a grocery cart, and my LCD is broken.  Very sad.  :-(
4	1394409600	I really like this case. I have tried several different ones and this has been the best so far. thanks
5	1394409600	Had this case about five months now. Very shock resistant, dropped my phone a couple times, and nothing happened.  Plus it has a little ridge around the face of the phone so when I put the phone on it's face, it doesn't scratch the screen.  Recommend!!
4	1394409600	Has a bad gasoline smell. My husband said it should go away, but other than the smell its very strong and cute.
5	1394323200	Case was all it was advertised to be. My case matched my phone and made the appearance pop.  Friends also loved it.
4	1394236800	It has been good so far.  I Just wish the hard plastic piece for a little better one u put it in your phone.
1	1394236800	The rubber doesn't stay on very well and stretches out to where it fits loose around the phone. It's over priced for the quality. I got a better case with a built in screen protector for a fraction of the price. Don't waste your money on this case.
5	1394236800	I am so glad I bought this high grade piece of equipment. My phone is quite big now as a result, but I don't see that as a problem.The recharge, volume, earpiece, speaker and other controls are perfectly accessible still.A benefit I didn't expect is, the phone does not slip easily now. It sits on a sofa, beside my pillow, on a countertop, or wherever, without sliding off as the S3 phone does so easily when it is unprotected.Excellent product.
5	1394150400	I tried this case for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and love it. Fits great and buttons are easy to get too. I would recommend.
5	1394150400	Looks good and fits the phone well. Not a bad price, and my hip granddaughter has the same one, lol
5	1394064000	I love my cover.  The rubbery piece fit around my phone very nice and the pink plastic part snapped over that with no problems.  This would not save your phone if it dropped screen down on a rock, but if you set on a flat surface it will help keep the screen safe.
2	1393977600	No cover for the front of the phone screen and too much plastic. Rubber only on the corners. Not too much protection for the phone.
5	1393977600	Love the look and feel. Makes the phone thick enough to hold, and soft and comfortable to the touch. can be taken off and put on easily, unlike other cases I have owned. This is a plus as I have to take the cover off when putting it in my car harness.
5	1393977600	This case is great! I love the colors, and it has provided durable protection for the many times I have dropped my phone. It provides good grip for holding the phone also--it feels good in my hand.
5	1393977600	Just what I need for the work I do every day, the quality of material is very good, this case is very good.
5	1393977600	Durable and light. But doesn't mean less perfection. I have two ballistic cases and they hold up better than otter box at half or a third the cost.
5	1393891200	Protects my phone very well. Have not had any problems with it thus far. Couldn't have asked for a better product.
5	1393891200	Used by my wife in her phone.  Minimal effort needed to install.  Its what she wanted in color.  Good buy
5	1393891200	Ballistic is my go to cell phone protector. They fit very well, I have dropped my phone several times, never an issue.Great protection and the best price here on Amazon.
5	1393804800	Purchased this to protect my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works great so far. No drops but I have security knowing if I do drop my phone it is well protected.
5	1393804800	This product is wonderful,If you are a heavy user and a very sloppy one like me, this is the best case for you
3	1393804800	looks nice, feels nice but.. there is a gap at the top or bottom about 1/4 inch so corners can get caught on things including your pocket
5	1393718400	Great product and protects very well.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to protect their IPhone.  It is sturdy and looks great as well.
5	1393718400	Purchased for my wifes phone. A less expensive and quality replacement to a Otterbox.  It looks great and is very durable.  The plastic is semi-smooth so you can easily slide the case in and out of your pocket.  But still provides enough grip to easily stay in your hand.  Easy to take apart if you need to access the battery/SIM/SD Card.
5	1393718400	I love this case.  it protects.  it is pretty.  it was everything I wanted.  it was more than I normally would pay for a case but it was worth it.
5	1393632000	Gave it to a friend as a gift, she loved it. Great for destructive people that constantly drop their phones. Good protector.
5	1393545600	Bought this for a friend and she loves it,  thank you for making it affordable, I will make sure and do business again
3	1393545600	I should have looked at the photos more closely, but I was hoping to save money and not purchase an Otterbox case. I wanted a case with the closure to the micro USB connection, and this case does not have it. The case itself is also not made with plastic as strong as the Otterbox. I haven't changed the case yet, but I will eventually and try it out.
5	1393545600	I bought two for me and my husband and they have held up great! I drop my phone all the time and it never damages or makes my phone have problems. kind of bulky but wouldnt trade it for another!
5	1393545600	It is just as expected.  Very glad I bought this.  It works well for me.  I would recommend.  You will not be disappointed.
5	1393545600	I ordered a case for both my daughter and myself and love it.  Why pay tons of money for an otter box when this does the same thing!  I've dropped my phone several times...MANY times...and no damage has been done to this case!
5	1393459200	words very well and I am very happy with both the quality and price.  easy to install.  thanks very uch
5	1393459200	Totally love it. I have it on my phone and it has kept it protected and most of all my favorite color is pink.
5	1393372800	AWesome case. Easy to install, very protective and although slightly bulky, it feels nice in the hand/pocket. highly recommend this case
5	1393372800	We have ordered a similar product in black, so our expectations for this one was similar. The product is as good as the other one (which also came with a belt clip). Good protection without too much bulk. A little harder to slip in and out of your pocket than some cases, but the extra cushion on the edges is worth it. The product arrived on time as stated in the delivery notice.
5	1393372800	Case fits perfectly and is holding up great.  Cost was much more reasonable than the otter and I think just as good.
4	1393200000	Doesn't add too much bulk to the phone and seems to be doing a decent job of protecting it. I just received this item so we will see how well it works over the next couple of months. Only issue, it smells horrendous but it's made of plastic and rubber so I'm not really surprised.
5	1393200000	Not waterproof, but water resistant. Durable, nice color, easy to get case on and off, easy to slide in and out of pocket, good color. Overall a great purchase and I recommend it.
5	1393113600	I bought this for my son  and he just love especially the stand .he use it a lot when he is watching a movie
5	1393113600	I am very hard on my phone. I dropped it with in the first week and have a beat up edge to prove it. This is the 2nd of this model I've bought (got to have color options) and I have yet to have a problem with it. It is relatively easy to put on and take off (you have to play with the rubber some when you first put it on). I do use this with a screen protector as well. My phone has taken many a tumble out of my pocket (or hand) which is a good distance being 6'2&#34;, and has yet to have any damage. I will probably buy another one in a different color soon.
5	1393113600	this product is great.. it has a 2 part case and very comfortable . makes using the Galaxy S111 much easier. love it
5	1393027200	I chose this product because the ease of use durability color style.I often change my battery out and the case comes off easy and has no tabs to breakso the case is perfect for me. I have already recommend ballistic cases to everyone at my workincluding some customers that asked about my case.I also love the color. My favorite color is blue and I got 2 tones of blue.must have case if you take your case on and off changing your battery out.Very satisfied.
4	1393027200	I love it. ..this is the 3rd that I bought got my self different colors. I highly recommend. Great product for your money.
4	1393027200	Case like this really helps protect your gadget.  Only draw back is that it doesn't come with the screen shield
5	1392940800	I love this phone case/protector... It's cute, and my phone is secure! I like the feel, in my hand, as it isn't bulky, like others I've had. Would definitely recommend!
5	1392854400	I had this case when i originally purchased the galaxy 3. When I lost it I knew i wanted to get the same case. It protects your phone from falls.  Only thing is when it falls you can't hear it drop :(
5	1392854400	fits the phone nicely; it does make the phone larger and a bit clunky, but a small price to pay for the protection it provides.
5	1392681600	Great Case, way better than the otterboxes we had been using. Rubber does not seem like it is curling. Arrived on time Great colours
5	1392681600	I love this case, I even wanted to test if it was sturdy so I threw my phone across the room, and my phone stayed intact as well as did the case, and it just kind of bounced a little before it landed.  Love the design of this case.
5	1392681600	We ordered this for my husband's phone and he loves it. It protects the phone and looks great. The blue is bright and fun, true to the picture.
5	1392681600	I like my phone case alot but the first one that I bought came with two cases in a package, other then that it was a great buy!!!
5	1392595200	Works well, good quality. Protects my phone and looks exactly like the picture. Good price. I like the product .
5	1392595200	I am really glad I bought this case its a great price and protects my phone. I have hd no problems with it
5	1392595200	Does exactly what it should do - protects the phone, fits perfectly and looks great.  I got this to replace the Otter Box one which unfortunately was terrible.  I wasn't sure this would match up to the Otter Box as they are usually pretty good - I would say, for this type of case and phone it surpasses the Otter Box.  No screen protector supplied which was a surpise but I don't feel that I need it anymore.
5	1392508800	I'll start with a little bit about myself. I am absolutely the worst when it comes to cracking phone screens. Almost every single phone I have had, I have cracked. I always kept cases on my phones, but they were always the flimsy ones because they were &#34;cute&#34;. Finally, after cracking my 5th phone screen, I decided enough was enough and went searching for a case that was both cute and effective in preventing cracks. I finally found this case and I was hooked. Not a single crack in my phone since I put it on. The case is cute, and it protects my phone so well. I highly recommend it to anyone who has issues with cracking phone screens. It has been a lifesaver for my Galaxy S3.
5	1392508800	I really enjoy this case.  It is sturdy and not as bulky as I found Otterboxes to be.  All of the buttons are still easy to get to and have even dropped my phone a couple of times with no damage. This case is a great value for the price.
5	1392508800	Bought this as a gift for my brother's phone - I've got one for my phone and I really love the quality of protection that this cover provides.  Very good quality product too - I will be buying this cover again for my next phone.
5	1392508800	I love it..not a rubber back so it wont pick up the oils from your hand. And being a woman it is easy to spot in your purse.  Not bulky...Fits great in your jeans pocket..easy to install.  Get it!
5	1392422400	fits very well thought it was an outter box with the front screen as well but still very pleased with this item love the color and how strong it is
5	1392422400	totally impressed by this case.  I'll buy again in other colors.  my phone feels safe and secure without being too bulky.  the price is right.
5	1392422400	Protects my phone well.  I also like how the buttons on my phone works now.  Before I would always hit a button by accident.
5	1392422400	Case comes in two parts: Rubberized inner case and harder plastic outer case. Both fit snugly on the phone and is easy to put on and remove. Rubberized button coverings work well.
5	1392422400	I haven't dropped my phone yet, but the case seems to work well. It is also relatively thin, which helps keep my phone from being too bulky.
4	1392336000	It's a good value compared to the Otterbox.  Feels solid.  The only negative is that it doesn't come with a screen protector.  Just buy your own.
5	1392249600	decent enough product, good price, and helps keep phone from sliding around or out of pockets.  Everyone else has different colored cases so this stands out.
5	1392249600	Not bulky...fits very snug and has kept my phone protected! No stretching like the weak Outterbox! I absolutely love this!
4	1392249600	The case is great for what it is but I thought I was getting a plastic covering for the screen like an otterbox. I read carefully but couldn't get a definitive answer.
5	1392249600	Bought one of these for my S3 after the rubber part of my Otterbox kept coming off. This case is even better. When I would drop my phone with the Otterbox, everything would fall apart including my phone at times. When that happens with the Ballistic, it does what it is supposed to do! Keeps everything together and damage-free. It doesn't even look discolored or anything. Buttons are easier to push and the case is easier to remove. Save your phone and buy this case!
4	1392249600	I purchased this for myself and then a year later I gave it my nephew. That really saying something because most cases I purchase don't last  a month never mind a year. Provides good protection and the color was an added bonus.
4	1392163200	I like it but ordered 2 diff ones & liked the other color better.  Wish I could return this one--never out of case.
2	1392163200	i have a ballistic and my gf has the otterbox. My ballistic fit good in the beginning however it lost shape to the bottom and started raising my screen protector. my gf made me purchase an otterbox. Havent gotten it delivered as yet but if hers is anything to go by i made the wrong decision buying the ballistic
4	1392076800	Strong sturdy! I have not dropped my phone yet, so I cannot contest to the ability to sustain a fall.
5	1391990400	This case is very sturdy and durable and is easy to take on and off. Its actually two separate pieces that lock together and secure the phone tightly.
5	1391990400	I love the fact its not bulky, easy to put on and it protects. I would recommend this item, great price!
5	1391990400	Who needs something more exspencive?I owned the more exspencive BOX, had to replace parts of it twice.The Ballistic does the same job with less bulk & parts.
2	1391904000	I ordered a case for Galaxy S3 never recieved it. Hasn't been able to contact the vender to request refun or replacement.
5	1391904000	So far I am loving this case!!! with the previous dual cases that I have purchased- the rubber made it hard to push buttons, reapply the case etc. There is &#34;extra room&#34; on the hard shell part of the case to where everything fits PERFECTLY!!! also the hole where my charger would go in is perfect!! I would buy this case again and in other colors also- for the price you cant beat it!!
5	1391817600	This is our second Ballistic for the S3. Better half originally had the &#34;Othr&#34; brand which failed after awhile. Then copied me with the Ballistic
5	1391817600	Love this case much better then my otterbox.  this case is much easier to press the off/on button, and volume keys. would recommend
5	1391817600	this is top end quality , for the price it is great, Good looking and strong. I would recommend it if you don't have a lot to spend.
5	1391817600	Protection, check. Drop test, check. Nice ergonomics, check. Blue, check. Check, check (I know, it for old pretty fast). The point is, this is a no regret purchase, it's easy to take off, and, most importantly, it delivers. The PB to my J.
4	1391817600	Case fit phone perfect. The holes for the camera and speaker were perfect. Able to use buttons on the sides of the phone with no problem.  Easy to remove and put back on the phone.
5	1391731200	Gave this as a present and she loves it.  Color and durability were perfect.  I would buy it again  Thanks
4	1391731200	The case is a good case. Protects the phone well. The only part I dont like is that it is pretty slick material. Easily will fall out of your hand.
1	1391731200	Did not protect my phone at all. It's only plastic that shattered the min it got dropped. Total wast of money
5	1391644800	Thanks for the product. Excellent product, great quality, highly recommend. Met expectations, it was what I expected. Coming'll buy other items.
5	1391644800	The case was just as promised.  My Samsung S3 is protected and looks great too.  Surprising quality for a good price.
5	1391644800	I bought this as a present for my mom for her Galaxy S4. My boyfriend has a Ballistic cover and highly recommended it for her. It was very easy to get on her phone, and even easy to explain to her how to take it off and put it back on. All of the buttons are still easy to use (power, volume) She loves that her phone is protected and that the color is so easy for her to spot.
5	1391558400	It's just what I expected which is always nice.  My phone just feels more secure with a cover on it.  I love the color, it's very true...on my computer anyway!  Easy to see in my purse which is a plus!!
5	1391558400	I love this case. It protects my phone, fits perfectly and looks amazing. It's the best case I have ever bought and it really was made for this phone, adjusted flawlessly
5	1391558400	I have dropped my phone several times since purchasing this case and it has protected my phone Nicely. :) Thanks!
4	1391558400	It fit well, provides pretty good grip.  Haven't dropped the phone yet, so don't know how well it protects the phone
5	1391472000	It seems well made and I love the color,  The phone seems like it will be well protected if I drop it..
5	1391472000	I bought this for my galaxy s3 phone. It fits great and plenty of protection.  Love the color combination.  It's lightweight and not at all bulky.  It's has good grip so it won't slip out of your hand.  I highly recommend this cover.  I also ordered other colors so I switch off.  A must have for protection for your phone.  I've tried outer box and ugg but I like this the best
5	1391385600	I have had 2 of these cases for my Galaxy S3 & Galaxy Note 3 & I don't think I will ever buy another case. I personally think this color is awful, but I bought it for my girlfriend & she likes it. It is a little bulky if you are used to gel cases, but there is no better case for protecting your phone from drops...period!
5	1391299200	I wasn't sure about this one.  I really wanted something that covered the front of the phone too.  My son told me this one is what I should buy for real protection.  I went into the phone store on a different matter, and the technician told me this would be better protection for my phone than the &#34;cute&#34; one that also covered the front.  He said if the phone fell, this cover would take care of the front of the phone because of the corner bumpers. So I purchased this one, and I have been really pleased with it.  I can put it face down on my desk at work without worry.  Easy headphone and charger access.
5	1391299200	I bought this case for my wife to replace her old not-too-expensive case. She loves this case's stylish design, and robust construction.
4	1391299200	Case fits well but the sides where you grip it are a little slick. I am learning to pick it up from the corners.
1	1391299200	It wasn't the right phone cover. Waste of money. I would not recommend buying something of this site.  Very disappointed
5	1391212800	BEST protection case out there! I will forever use Ballistic!!:) Saved my phones life soooo many times! Now I have the galaxy mega 6.3 and the ballistic case for that is even better! Highly recommend this brand! u wont regret it!
4	1391126400	This case is rugged and fits the Galaxy S3 perfectly, protecting it from damage if dropped, even on a corner or the screen. The ridge around the glass face keeps most things away from the surface.  The only drawback is that it makes the slim and elegant S3 much more bulky, since the emphasis is on function rather than styling. If you are hard on phones, this is the case for you, but if you are more concerned with the looks, you might want something less capable than this one.My only real complaint is that the bulkiness and grippy surface can make it hard to get the phone out of a tight pocket, e.g. the pocket in a pair of jeans. No problem in a shirt pocket or a cargo-type pocket.
4	1391040000	I bought this case because family members recommended it. It fits well, and offers protection to most every area except the screen. There is no screen protection afforded from this case. Fortunately, however, I had purchased a Zagg Invisible Shield screen protector which worked beautifully with this case. Together, they offer nearly as much protection as an Otter Box. I would definitely recommend this product.
5	1391040000	I love this Ballistic phone case! Fits well on my Galaxy III, great vibrant color and doesn't feel too bulky.
5	1391040000	Solid feel easy to put on.. Having a choice of colors is good also. I bought it for my wife and sje loves it.
5	1391040000	I received this case earlier then specified. It fits perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy S3. The buttons line up properly & very easy to use. Seems very durable being an infant got a hold of my cell & sure enough it got bounced on the floor a few times & my cell was kept in tack. I strongly recommend this case.
4	1391040000	Case works very well, protects the phone, and doesn't look to bad. Wish it came with a screen protector though.
5	1390953600	I always seem to be dropping my phone. I've dropped it several times already from carpet to concrete and my phone is still in one piece!! It's a very solid case!!
5	1390953600	A really strong case that protects the phone against falls. My mother really likes that it covers as much of the phone as possible, even the buttons. The cover also sticks out a cm or so protecting the screen if it fell screen first from cracking.
5	1390953600	I love this case! Very easy maintenance.  Good bumpers on the corners. I've dropped my note2 numerous times and no damage at all. I use a screen protector with it and its the perfect combination. A good case is a critical item.
5	1390953600	Purchased this for my Samsung S3 after my young boys destroyed my otter box cover.  This' one is definitely easier to use (put on and take off) and the side buttons aren't as hard to find and use as wIth other covers.  It  isnt as bulky as others and when I need to I can put it in my pocket.  Overall I'm very happy with this cover and how it wOrks for my phone.
3	1390953600	I found it easy to get on & off.  The only thing I don't like about it is that with the lip that it creates around the screen it makes it a little more difficult to hit your buttons in the bottom corners of your screen.  Not too big of a deal, but if you're someone who uses one hand with your thumb it may bug you.
5	1390953600	Very cute case! My favorite color and feels good to hold. Fits like a charm, very nice. I say buy it!
5	1390953600	I have been going back and forth on phone cases for months and finally caved in and bought this one.  Now I'm kicking myself that I didn't just do it sooner.  It went on to the phone easily and all the side buttons are still easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this case to anyone.  And the pink touches on the back are nice, they add some color without being obnoxiously girly.
3	1390953600	I had recently lost a cellphone via a robbery, I chose this one because it was half decent but its not better than the one before. It still gets the job done.
4	1390867200	Sturdy case, love it!  This case has two different cases in 1.  The soft case that goes first goes around the phone and the harder casing goes around the soft casing and it makes for a great phone case.
5	1390867200	I received the item on time . The case work's perfectly , does everything you would want from a phone case.
5	1390867200	My wife's phone is now protected (me) and pretty (her). We heard about this case from our son-in-law. He has one too.
5	1390867200	I got it as a gift for my clumsy Mom that has an Siii phone and the phone is still perfectly fine. Its not too expensive and its stylish while protecting the phone at the same time.
5	1390780800	Today I dropped my phone with the case down a marble staircase and it still working great.  No damage to it whatsoever.  The case passed the test.  I think it's as good as any otterbox.
5	1390780800	I got this for my daughter in law and she loves it and it was it was a total surprise to her
5	1390694400	I've had this phone case for over a year and it has protected my phone so many times from shattering, it has been dropped probably over 20 times and from pretty high places nothing has happened to it so far and I'm glad it was a great deal DEFINITELY recommend!!!!
5	1390694400	True to the description.  Easy to put on phone.  Protects the corners of my phone.  I would definitely purchase more.
5	1390608000	I love the color of this case. It fits very snug around my S3 and the corners are very well protected. All of the ports can be accessed. There is no screen protector but that is the main reason I bought it. Usually those screen protectors are made of plastic and they scratch very easy and it makes it harder to see the screen. At least for me it does. I am a bit tired of my S3 and I want a different phone but the case is nice and I really like it.
5	1390521600	This case fits my phone  perfectly. I have used an Otter Box previously and loved it because my young kids can be rough when playing games on the phone. This Ballistic case has also protected my phone well through rough handling and quite a few drops onto a hardwood floor from at least 4 feet up. Definitely recommend it.
5	1390521600	It is a very good protection for the phone.  I like the compact feel about it. I will recommend this case to anyone.
5	1390521600	Love it, it is exactly what I wanted for my phone!  I love the wine color, but I would have liked the light pink part  a bit darker but it is still very nice. I never worry about dropping either.
1	1390435200	This case do not fit on the S3 like its suppose to the pink part do not fit on the black rubber piece correctly
5	1390348800	I love this case. It's the first case I've truly liked. It protects my phone without weighing as much as an armored truck or looking like one. Go Ballistic!

5	1390348800	This case does a great job of protecting my Samsung Galaxy 3 AND the color makes it easy to see in my hand bag.  I just bought one for my daughter.  The Smart Phone is a mini computer and since I take it every where...... dropping it can happen.  This case protects my investment.
5	1390348800	I really loved it. I perviously had a terrible case that cause my screen protector ripping off because of rubbing on the edges. This case makes 100% better! Very durable and fitted. Thanks!
5	1390348800	I am clumsy and drop my cell phone a lot.  This case is very durable and easy to get on and off the phone.  It has saved my phone many times!
5	1390348800	I purchased this case for my daughter. she already has an Otter Box but she was looking for something different. She liked the color on this case so I purchased it. The case is very nice and the buttons are not as hard as with her Otter Box. The protection seems to be very good as well similar to the commuter series. She is very happy with her case and hasn't bothered with her Otter Box anymore.
4	1390348800	I am amazed at the fit and build quality of this case. When I saw the price I expected much less. My only concern is the inner soft liner will not line up perfectly on one side of the phone, but I think this will settle in as the material relaxes. over all, price, fit, quality, I would highly recommend this case.
5	1390348800	Good value for my money. With this case the phone looks nice plus it has litterary saved my phone a million time when it falls.
5	1390348800	Great case, great price. I love it! It fits my Samsung Galaxy 3 perfectly and keeps it from sliding off the dashboard.
4	1390262400	This case looks just like it does in the picture - works great. Easy to put on my phone and looks cute.
5	1390262400	I am very happy with this case.  It provides great protection for my Samsung SIII but isn't too bulky.  It is very easy to get on and off.  I have had it 3 months and it hasn't stretched out any either - which is a problem I have had with other cases.  All the phone buttons work well with the case on.
5	1390262400	The person I bought this for loves it. He's very rough on his phone and this case is very protective.
5	1390176000	Very pleased with this product.  It protected my phone.  After a year's use, my phone still looks like it is new.
4	1390176000	Really love the colors!  Only down side is it is a little slick and heavier than I was expecting.  I am pleased with it.
5	1390176000	Very sturdy case. It has already been put to the test when I dropped it on the ground and it  bounced a couple of times. Love it!
5	1390176000	This case was a Christmas present for my daughter.  I bought the wrong case, so I followed the Amazon instructions to return the case and at the same time, ordered the right one.Amazon sent out the correct case before they had even recieved the return !!New case fits, all good !!I always shop Amazon first !!!!!
5	1390176000	Recieved product quick. Fits like a glove and not too bulky. Very impressed. Will recommend to all my friends for sure.
5	1390176000	A lot cheaper than other name brand products and just as good. My 2 year old an I have dropped my phone numerous of times and it isn't an issues. The buttons all still work well without interference and I can still access all the ports with ease.
5	1390176000	I've had this case for several months, and it has protected my phone from a few drops. After breaking the glass on my prior phone, I was interested in finding a good case. This one has been that. It looks nice too.
4	1390176000	I like the case but my wife bought a VERY similar case at WalMart for about $7.00 less so I would check there next time I need a case..
5	1390089600	I have two kids who play games on my phone. They've dropped it several times and this case did it's job and protected my screen. My phone still works perfectly!I would recommend this case to others.
5	1390089600	I LOVE this case.  It's cheaper than an otterbox and is WAY better.  I had an otterbox for this same phone before this one and it stretched out in no time.  I've had no problems with this one and have dropped my phone SEVERAL times and no damage to my phone.
5	1390089600	The Samsung Galaxy SIII is a beautiful piece of design, but it's so slippery and so fragile that it's practically useless out of the box.  I literally couldn't hold on to the thing; it would slip out of my fingers.  I needed something more than a decorative backing - I needed something that would stabilize the thing, protect it, and make it easy to handle and manipulate.  This case does all of that.  Additionally, in the pink/wine combo, it's quite pretty, and easier to see in the depths of my bag than a blah black one.  I would recommend it.
5	1390003200	I have a 10 month old and bought this case several months ago.  With constantly juggling I have dropped this phone more times than I care to recall and the glass has never cracked or shattered and there are no scuff marks anywhere on phone when I remove case.  Buttons and ports are still easily accessable unlike the otterbox and the case removes in seconds.  I would definitely buy this product again.
5	1390003200	It's awesome. It's light but it doesn't cover the screen well. I loved my otter box for my iPhone but now I have the Samsung galaxy 3
4	1390003200	Would have given five stars but top and bottom of case are too soft. I thought it should have hard case there for good all around protection.
5	1390003200	Well...I just can't seem to stop dropping my phone.  Finally killed the last one.  Got a new one and this case.  Have already dropped the new one twice and so far...so good.  I am not expecting miracles but so far the case is doing its job.  Nice color.  Easy to hold. Buttons all work.
4	1390003200	Product was recommended to me and I have to admit, it looks sharp. Now I have yet to 'drop' my phone to see if it works, but it's there when my fingers decide griping is not something they want to do at that moment. I did not give it five stars, and its a nit item really, but the rubber piece does tend to give off an odor. I imagine it will dissipate over time, but at first, I was looking around to see what might be burning around the house, before I zeroed it down to the product.
5	1390003200	Very fast shipping, excellent quality. The case is comfortable and fits perfectly on my phone. Case is strong and durable. Would recommend!
5	1390003200	I have carried this for 3 months now and really love how great it is to hold and how well it protects my phone.  I have dropped my phone once due to arthritis and the case stayed intact and protected the phone.  If not for the rubber edging I am sure I would be dropping it daily but this is really quite nice to hold.
5	1389916800	I am enjoying this case for my Samsung Galaxy 3. The fit is perfect with all ports accessible. Charging is great and nice protection. No longer worry about drops, because this case will provide great protection. I do recommend to all.
5	1389916800	great case easy to take off and on. not cheap sturdy. will buy again wooo hoooo wooo hoo!! yeah baby!!
4	1389916800	Not to bulky, comfortable and I love the colors. They only problem is that my husband has the same color for his phone and I have to make sure I don't take the wrong one.
5	1389916800	The Color is beautiful! The buttons are very responsive. The cover is very sturdy. I wish the back had a piece of rubber included in it because it tends to slip on hard surfaces. I have dropped my phone a few times without any damage to the phone.My husband got a different brand and the buttons on his cover are almost impossible to push.
5	1389916800	I purchased this case about four months ago and I love it. It makes my phone easier to hold and it provides a good amount of protection against drops.
5	1389830400	Great cover, fit really perfect in my Samsung Galaxy SIII. The color is the same that they show you. Like it
5	1389830400	the description is exactly what I was wanting.and so when I received it, I was happy, and the price was right
5	1389744000	The case came as promised, and was everything the description said.  It went on easily, and feels comfortable to hold.
3	1389744000	It's awesome at first, but I've had it for a couple months and it's starting to get more difficult to put the hard case over the soft one without it being off.
5	1389744000	This Ballistic case I purchased for my new S111 is the perfect fit for my phone,  and you have zero problems using the control buttons they are very easy to push with the case on. For the money I spent $17.00 it's all I expected and much more. Fantastic value, great protection.
5	1389744000	This case arrived quickly. It is a beautiful color and extremely easy to install. I was able to do it in about one minute. All buttons and operating areas are easily accessible. The case appears to be extremely sturdy and protective without adding bulk. Feels good and fits nicely in the hand. Great buy. Everyone should have a case for their smart phone.
1	1389744000	Even though it's not quite my style, the appearance of this case would get 4.5 stars from me.  The protection it provides also seems to be far superior to my former hybrid case.  Once the case was on properly, I didn't have any issue with the usability of the volume/power buttons with this case on.  The case took me under a minute to put on/take off.  It required effort to get things perfect, but only a minimal amount.However, the things that bother me about this phone far outweigh any other pros.1) The case adds a lot of bulk and weight to my phone.  As a woman with average/small hands, it is uncomfortable to use my phone with this case on.  Perhaps this phone would2) The silicon/rubber on the front of the phone comes up high enough and far enough onto the screen area that it makes pressing the &#34;home&#34; button areas on the screen very difficult.  I had to 'search' for the button.For me, usability should not be compromised this severely by protection.  As far as I'm concerned, this may be a good case for some, but definitely not for me!
5	1389744000	I absolutely love this case, after breaking two phones with my tmobile brand ultra thin case I decided I needed something stronger. I didn't like the otterbox because it was really bulky and as a girl I like to take a clutch with me when I go out, or slip it in my back pocket. This case has a hard backing on top of the rubber so you can slide it in and out of your pocket without it snagging your jeans. I've dropped this phone a million times and I have had zero issues with protection. I highly recommend this phone.
5	1389744000	I dropped my phone on a few occasions, and found that it protected my phone. I do advise that everybody purchase a screen protector, though.Thank you.
4	1389657600	This was the second phone my wife broke. Purchased the cover and a screen protector after she broke the phone and it has been working great since then. Her screen still has a visible line but it works fine.
5	1389657600	Works great.  Easy to hold on to and protects the phone just fine. Great experience and would definitely buy again.
4	1389571200	I like bright colors on my phone so that I can find it easily in my purse.  This one is bright and protective.
5	1389484800	I had a little trouble getting it on the first time, but after I got it just wright it has worked wonderfully.  This is a great product.
5	1389484800	This case arrived on time and was a perfect fit. I could not have asked for more. The phone fits my hand better and helps guard the phone should it fall.
5	1389484800	I had previously bought the Otter box for my Samsung III and it did not last me three months (literally).  This case is not as bulky, sturdy, all the corners are all rubber. What I love the most is that the volume button is coverd by the case and you can press them and it does not get stuck.  I recommend this case to everyone.
3	1389484800	This item is o.k, however, it is not the item I thought it was. I will use it, but I thought it was a little more heavy duty.
4	1389398400	I think this is a great case, i just wish there was flaps to cover the headphone and microusb ports.
5	1389312000	I read reviews of the other brands before purchasing this one, and am very happy with my selection.  The buttons do really work well on the volume, and off/on.  After having to replace my screen when I dropped it (which is what led me to this purchase), I feel if given the same situation again, I would not need to worry. There were be no breakage. That said, the rubber part makes it easier to grip, but I do admit to having to take to reassemble if I have to remove my battery.
5	1389312000	Fairly thin, but very robust.  Your phone won't break unless you drop it on a sharp point with the screen facing directly down.  It also looks good, so very close to perfect.
5	1389312000	This case fits my phone perfectly. Isn't hard to put on or take off. No trouble getting it to fit together, nothing. Absolutely the best!
5	1389225600	This case feels extremely good on the Galaxy.  It is a pretty pink color and it comes as it shows in the picture.  Feels like I have an otter box.  My phone has fallen a couple of times, no problems.  I also took my screen cover off and since this wraps a bit over the front of the phone, I guess is preventing scratches as well.
5	1389225600	I have had this about a year and my phone is still awesome. Get this, you won't regret it. Protects great!
5	1389225600	I bought this case for my daughter's new phone. She absolutely loves it! The fit is great and it looks really nice.She doesn't like the big, bulky cases....but since she is clumsy and drops her phone a lot, she REALLY needs the extra protection! This case seems like it will protect the phone well AND it adds some much needed thickness & grip without being too bulky. I think it's going to be every bit as good as the more expensive Otterbox cases she's tried in the past. The price was great too!.
5	1389225600	This case is amazing. The case is composed of a hard plastic outer body with soft rubber on the corners and on the back. The light blue you see in the image is the hard plastic and the darker blue is the soft rubber. This is an amazing combination because the soft rubber helps absorb more energy on impact compared to any full hard-plastic case which would send the shock waves through the phone. Very good against water as well since I have dropped mine in the shower and it got no water damage. Definitely a buy.
4	1389139200	So far so good. The case is staying in place and has protected my phone from numerous drops of 3'-4'.
3	1389139200	This cover is much heavier than other covers I have had and that bothers me. My hands actually get sore if I'm on it for a while because of the weight. I guess its the protection factor though. I probably won't keep it that long. I do like the color
3	1389139200	I got it because I used to have ballistics case for iphone which was way better than the otter box. and for a lot less. But on this phone it messes with my screen protector. My screen protector is perfectly centered but the soft gel of the case sort of pushes the protector off a little and will eventually start coming off. Other than that good case.
5	1389139200	My wife loves it...functional, fashionable and durable....a trifecta..just as good if not bettet than a otterbbox but for much less $$$$
5	1389139200	I love this case because it fits well and is easy to take off to clean & put it back on.  It has kept it's shape & protects my phone almost as well as the Otterbox.  It costs much less than the Otterbox and I would purchase one for any other cell phone or tablet (if available) when needed.
5	1389139200	This case is amazing!! I absolutely love it. I have dropped my phone on numberous occasions and it hasn't crack yet! Im soooo happy with this buy.
4	1389052800	Haven't had the chance to see how well it will protect my phone and hope I don't have to.  It made the buttons on the side more functional.  So far so good.
5	1389052800	This case is rugged and durable.  I have dropped my phone numerous times with mine, so I ordered this one for my daughter.  The phone literally just bounces and lands smoothly.
5	1389052800	This case is not big and bulky. the phone still fits perfectly in my pocket. It is easy to remove and apply.
4	1389052800	Phone has taken a few spills, tumbles and this case has stood the test, phone is AOK and case took the impact.  It is two separate pieces and they both fit well and snug.  After a few months, the inner piece made of silicon has become a bit soft and not as snug fitting but the harder plastic outside shell is keeping everything in place.
4	1389052800	It had everything I needed in a phone case. Color, style, protectiveness. Only down falls? it doesn't protect the screen from scratches and it isn't waterproof. Still is a great choice in phone case.
4	1388966400	Rugged and ready plus the wife loves the color.  This has proved to be superior over her last case, and by far more functional.
5	1388966400	I bought this case for my mom. She loves it. It is one of the best cases for her phone.
5	1388966400	I absolutely love this case. I did alot of research before I purchased this one and I am totally happy with it. It is cute and stylish.. I love the color...and I get sooo many compliments on it  It feels great in my hand and I feel very secure that it is protecting my phone!!!!
5	1388880000	I love this case it protects from all drops while still looking cute at the same time! I would definitely recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect their S3!
4	1388880000	But wasn't quite what my husband was looking for. Ballistic is a great brand though and their products rival Otterbox for durability.
1	1388880000	I bought this as a gift.....the two sections come apart all the time and I am not happy with it at all.
4	1388880000	I really like this case.  It does add a little bulk to the phone, but to me just made the phone a little easier to handle.  The phone certainly still fits my hand well.  Haven't had any drops so I can't speak to the protective quality, but maybe that lack of drops is partly due to the phone not being slippery.  Love the bright color, which makes it easy to find if it winds up in my purse.  Did have a little bit of pushing up of the screen protector, but I've gotten the edges of the protector well tucked in and no more issues.
4	1388793600	I have not dropped my phone, but it seems that it would do well to protect it should that event occur.  I usually leave the plastic case off and just use the rubber part.
5	1388793600	This protector does the job. It keeps the phone from breaking, and it looks stylish.I like the blue color... so far no complaints from me.
5	1388793600	cam very quickly.  Fit my phone very well.  Easy access to necessary buttons.  A bit difficult to put on, but not too bad
5	1388707200	My son had one of these for the past year. If it could protect his phone from even a small scratch, I knew it would protect mine forever. He has dropped his phone too many times to count and not a crack or scratch with this case! Even I can't believe it protects his phone this well.So of course when I saw what this case could do, I had to have one. You will not go wrong purchasing this case.It may be a little bulkier than some of the slim covers, but I found that difference a plus. It makes it easier to hold onto this phone because without a cover these phones are so light weight and thin, it is easy to drop them.Can't say enough good things about this Ballistic cover. It's terrific!
5	1388707200	very pretty and well made, I love the texture and it fills well into my pocket and purse. I am very happy with this purchase.
5	1388707200	Not the most attractive case, but it does the job.  It provides the same protection of an Otterbox at a fraction of the price.  You can't go wrong!
5	1388707200	It arrived on time and was as described.  very similar to an otter box.  Daughter is happy with it and that is all that matters
5	1388707200	The case works I like it I dropped my phone and lol it work my brother wanted to buy it from me.
5	1388620800	Had previously purchased OTTERBOX Defender case for my college age granddaughter. It was out of shape within a matter of months and she was interested in the OTTERBOX Commuter as a replacement. Researching a replacement for her, and trying to get as close as possible to her request of &#34;pink&#34;, I came across the Ballastic case for the Galaxy Slll. The reviews interested me as most rated this case as good or better than the OTTERBOX series. We took a chance and found that the reviewers were indeed correct! A great case, comparable to OTTERBOX for a better price! No regrets here and I have since ordered another one in blue for my daughter for Christmas. She loved the color and said the fit was actually better than the OTTERBOX. Would definitely recommend this case for the Galaxy SIII phone!
5	1388620800	I saw a couple of reviews of people saying this was hard to get on the phone. Absolutely ridiculous. This is 2 pieces. The darker blue piece is the rubberized shell that goes on first and then the two tone stiff plastic piece fits right over it. Easy breezy! I haven't dropped the phone on concrete yet, but I have dropped it on linoleum floors and it's been fine. The case is very tight with the hard shell holding it in place. All buttons, camera and volume are a perfect fit so there are no problems taking pictures or hearing people or anything else. For the price, it is nice.
5	1388620800	This offers great protection and I drop my phone on hard cement all the time, and don't have one scratch.  I like the case, but makes my already kinda bulky phone even bulkier, but that's the price you pay for protection.  It does its job and overall is a good case.
5	1388620800	Perfect for someone who drops their phone more than they would like to! I had an otterbox before this and I dropped it maybe 5 times and the case cracked. The case is way more durable than any other &#34;durable&#34; case that I have seen marketed. I love it!
5	1388620800	Amazing case! I love it. It is just like my husbands otterbox but a whole lot cheaper! Great product for the price!
5	1388620800	Ballistic is better than Otterbox as far as protection and half the cost. I will alway buy this brand for my cell phones.
5	1388620800	Great cover at a wonderful price. Fit like a glove and the color is really nice. Would def buy another one for our other phone.
5	1388620800	I had thought that I did not want a bulky case for my phone so when I opened the package I was skeptical.  But I placed it on the phone anyway.  The next day as I was getting out of my car the phone fell out of my pocketbook. I  picked it up and saw that there was not a scratch on it.
5	1388620800	Love it love it had to order another one and gave another one as a gift. Durabel and will last.
5	1388534400	I love this case!  It's not only very secure and fits perfectly, but it looks awesome!  I've had several people ask me where I got it!
4	1388534400	This case does its job. This is on my wife's Galaxy S3 and she is not very careful with her phone. It has protected the phone well. There is one issue she seems to have with it though. That is, it tends to slip off the corner when it's in her purse on occasion. It doesn't come completely off the phone but she does have to fix it. When the corner pops off, it makes the back plate become unsnapped from the side the the corner is off on. This doesn't always happen but it does happen enough to make it an annoyance. It lost a star for this reason.
5	1388448000	In my career, I need a durable case to protect my phone is all weather conditions and especially from being dropped. This case does the trick, it is lightweight and ease to put on/take off. The service I received was also outstanding and I would highly recommend this.
5	1388448000	No one has this durable phone case for my galaxy s 3 phone.  This product gives off a very different look as well as hold up to any dropping of the phone..
5	1388448000	I love this product. It is just what I wanted. Everything I expected. Love the blue color too. Will order again.
5	1388361600	Love the color combination and gives my phone protection in case it gets dropped. Easy to put on. Would order a Ballistic product again.
4	1388361600	Good case just wish the silicone fit a little bit tighter.  But it was affordable and it does get the job done because I have dropped my phone and it was protected well.
5	1388361600	I love the feel, size, and how much protection it gives my Galaxy. I have been researching for weeks till I finally decided that the Ballistic is the best product for my galaxy. I recommend it!!!! If only there was turquoise and black though!
5	1388361600	Love the color and the feel of it. Not too bulky yet it protects the phone just the way I needed!
3	1388361600	The screen protectors do a good job. The ballistic we sent back as my husband was not going to carry a pink cover on his phone.
3	1388361600	I wasn't very happy with the color options, but it does the job in protecting an already cracked phone without adding too much bulk.
5	1388361600	The case is much heavier than my Otterbox on my S3. So if you like a solid heavy feeling case this is it.It is of solid build quality (on par with Otterbox ones that are more expensive).My wife drops her phone constantly and this has protected it no problem from all of the drops on many different surfaces.Cheers Ballistic for saving me $300 time and time again.
5	1388275200	I really want to drop my phone on purpose to test this out, but can't quite bring myself to do it! I seems like it will do the job though. The rubber wraps all the way around the phone, over laps the screen a little. It is still easy to plug in to charge, hit the buttons etc.
5	1388275200	The blue case is a little darker in actuality than in the photo, which I am perfectly fine with. Fits nicely over my phone and gives good protection.
5	1388188800	Purchased this case in the ruby wine/dark wine as well as the navy blue/cobalt and we absolutely LOVE them. It was super easy to put on and very durable. I do not find this case to be bulky and can slip it into little pockets on my purse easily. It does it's job well and we have tested it accidentally dropping our phones. No screen protector is needed because the case covers the edges preventing the screen from touching any surface when placed down. The colors are bold and beautiful! Easy to sanitize with a little alcohol on a cloth. And more impressive is the great price!Only gripe is that we would like to order more colors. Yellow, orange, green, lighter pink, red! Love the Ballistic Case for our Samsung Galaxy SIII's!
5	1388188800	This case is just what I wanted.  It is easy to get on and off of the phone unlike my Otterbox.  Only problem was the shipping but Amazon took care of me so no other complaints.  I would recommend this to anyone thinking about a phone case for your S3.
5	1388188800	I work as a camp counselor, stage manager and a full time student.  My phone is my life.  After dancing with campers and breaking my first phone, I knew I needed a strong case.This case is perfect.  My phone has been dropped and bounced, screen can not touch the surface it hits and the phone is now a comfortable size to hold.If you are female and trying to get your phone to fit in tiny pockets, this will not work.  I had to go shopping with it and do the phone test on all pockets.  Other then that, it's my best friend.
4	1388188800	It is way smaller than the otterbox. Light.It is super sturdy.I like the color.Worth the price. Love it!
4	1388102400	This would be better if it was closer to purple than pink but it does work very well with the new phone.
4	1388102400	This case does in fact help protect the phone. I've dropped my phone many times in this case and there has been no damage. Even down some stairs and not a single crack in the screen. Great product and has great protection for the phone itself.
5	1388102400	My daughter loves this new case for you phone.  She had an otterbox for less than a year that broke.  She likes the feel and less weight and just loves the color.  It fits the phone very well.
5	1388102400	Great product and seller. I'm a well please customer and I would definitely recommend anyone else to buy. I also myself plan on buying another one. A+++
5	1388102400	My baby gets a hold of my phone all the time.  He throws it and eats it and generally tries to destroy it. If it weren't for this case, I'm sure the phone would be ruined by now. I love this case. It is easy to take off and put back on, it protects my phone from my clumsy hands and my babies, and it isn't too bulky.  My husband has the same case in black and also loves it. I would definitely recommend this phone to everyone!
5	1388102400	Love this case.... My Android is well protected.... And my phone is chicly dressed all at the same time! Go on order it!
5	1388016000	I purchased this case for my 13 year old daughters phone. She originally wanted an Otterbox but after seeing better reviews on the Ballistic, I went with this. Not only does it cost less, you are basically getting the exact same protection that the Otterbox provides. She loves it!
5	1387929600	This case is exactly what I wanted. My other case made it very difficult to use the buttons on my Galaxy S3. It was also slippery when holding. This case fits perfectly and the buttons are very easy to push. I would recommend this case to my friends.
5	1387929600	I'm very happy with my phone case.  I love the color and it does a good job protecting the phone.  I've dropped my phone a few times with the case on and it survived... so no complaints here.
5	1387929600	Love the stability it provides in my hand and hope I don't ever drop it to find out if it really holds up.
5	1387929600	This is the best Cell Phone Cover I've ever had, it's sturdy and does not come off your phone like other reviews have put.  It's stuck on very tightly!  The color is brilliant, and I'm very pleased, I receive very nice compliments and it's stylish.
5	1387843200	Awesome, this was a gift for my wife and she loves it!  Put it right on,  I hope that it doesn't get tested but it is firm and feels capable of withstanding a lot of pressure on a drop.  Thanks!  Was delivered in approx 26 hours
5	1387756800	I'll admit, I'm clumsy.  I've dropped my phone more times than I can remember and the phone doesn't like it.  I put this case on it and it helps (I wish I had it when I first bought the phone).  It's easy to get on and off and the buttons are easy to use.  The color is a very vibrant pink/fuchsia color (very girly).  I honestly think it is just as good as the Otterbox and I've been very happy with it.
5	1387670400	I thought I was getting an otterbox. so I was pretty disappointed when I realized that is now what it was. but I have to say I love this case. easy to install. haven't had any problems whatsoever. color is great. and ive dropped my phone a few times with no damage.
1	1387670400	In the first week that I got mine, I dropped it and it cracked straight up the side. I thought it would be better at protecting my phone.
5	1387670400	I got a pair of these and they work like the good product ballistic is, you get what you pay for when protecting your cell.
4	1387670400	Love this phone cover, Very durable and love the colors, Great buy worth the price!! Saved my phone several times,
5	1387584000	We bought these after reading several other reviews and have been extremely happy with them.  Would definitely recommend the Ballistic cases over others on the market.
5	1387584000	Already dropped my phone several Times,  a couple in the snow. Never worried about it. Perfect combo of plastic and rubber makes a solid case
5	1387411200	Worth it, especially for the price.  No more Otter!  Goes especially well with the Hazard Koala big pouch.  Great value.
5	1387324800	It fits well and it goes with the color of my phone. I'm completely satisfied with the value and quality
4	1387324800	I bought this for my GF for Chirstmas so she hasnt used it yet. But it shipped very quickly and appears to be a stylish yet rugged case. packed nicely. So far I recommend it
5	1387324800	I bought this case for my new phone and I love it! The color is great as is the quality of the case.
4	1387324800	Relatively easy to insert phoneComfotable to holdRubberized back surface prevents dropsGreat protectionGreat valueI highly recommend this case
5	1387324800	Although this cover is a little bulky, I am quite happy with it.  It is easy to install.  I have dropped my phone on concrete and in the dirt several times.  There has been no damage to my phone.
3	1387324800	I bought this last year. I've dropped my phone a million times. But finally yesterday was the last time. It fell out of my pocket into the parking lot and completly shattered the entire phone :(  I will spend the extra money this time and get a heavier case.
4	1387324800	Really good n safe case... love the style n color... My phone dropped twice n nothing happened to my phone. It really protect the sides n all over the phone
5	1387324800	Was very easy to put the phone in. Looks good and seems like good protection. I'm very satisfied. I just wish it came in PURPLE since that's my favorite color!
5	1387238400	This is the best case I ever had. It fits my galaxy s3 perfectly and my phone feels strong. It does not add as much volume as I had thought. My phone is little heavy but I was expecting that. I will buy this(similar) case again for my next phone.
5	1387238400	Fits good only problem is it seems to mess up the screen protector, Love the color and it really protects the phone
5	1387152000	We have 5 phones in our house and 5 of these cases.  My kids are very hard on their smartphones and the cases have saved a phone or two several times . The case fits nicley and still allows a person to slide into a back pocket if they want . My only wish is that mabey there was a charger port cover .
5	1387152000	Great quality, fits the galaxy s3 perfectly. I would buy again.  The color and durability are the stand out features.
4	1387152000	Received it today. Took only 4 days. Looks good so far. I dont think i realized one of the pieces is rubber. I prefer hard cases. But im  hoping this will last a while.
5	1387152000	love this! This phone protector is awesome! It is not huge and as bulky as others and has protected my phone very well for over a year. I liked it so much I ordered the same brand case for my iPad.
5	1387152000	Its very close to the Ballistic case my boyfriend bought at the AT&T store for $50. The only difference is that his has covers for the charging and headphone ports. I got much more than I expected and it protects my phone from falls! I have decreased strength in my hands so I drop it probably 4 times a day and at least twice on the concrete! Definately recommend to friends and family and already have!
5	1387065600	Goes on and comes off very easily...great fit.  I happened to have dropped it today from a height of about 4 ft. onto a tile floor.  No damage what so ever to the phone (or to the case for that matter).  I'd highly recommend this case.  I've also been looking at folio cases but after this recent experience not sure I'd do that.
5	1387065600	This case fits my galaxy 3 perfect, i have dropped my phone soo many time and it still works perfect
5	1387065600	Fits well on the phone and easy to take off also, if you need to.  Love the color choices too!
5	1387065600	The case is pretty and is very protective for the phone.  I like the color and the functionality plus it came on time.
5	1386979200	This is a great case! It fits the phone very good I have had no problems with this case at all.
5	1386979200	Wouldn't change a single thing about it, no complaints, no buyer's remorse! It does the job of protecting my phone and looks good too.
4	1386979200	Don't know how well it will protect my phone if it drops, but it fits well.  And I like the color!
4	1386979200	Perfect fit and protection for the sg3, like the blue color scheme and the cushioned corners for added fall protection
5	1386979200	I have dropped my phone a few times, and it has bounced, but has not been damaged.  Today I had to throw my phone at some ferocious dogs that were ready to attack my son.  It landed in six inches of snow, and stayed there until my son was safely inside.  Then I had to dig for it.  I believe it bounced as well, since it was not where I threw it.  It was unharmed.  The case protected the phone from snow damage also.  I had to dry the front of the phone, but there was no damage.
5	1386979200	This case is petty awesome. It is easy to get on and provides some good protection. There's no screen protector with the case. I read a lot of reviews about this case before purchasing it. It appeared everything I read about the otterbox for this phone said the buttons for the volume and power were difficult to use or made the phone not functional so I went with this one. So far i am satisfied with everything about it. It's durable cute easy to get on and off and not bulky. It will fit easy into a pocket.
5	1386979200	This is the second case I have bought on Amazon. I also bought the black and white version. This case is made of high quality plastics, and has rubberized bumpers on the corners, rather than the having the hard case on the corners. The screen is recessed quite nicely on the front of the phone, so that if there is a frontal drop, it wont touch the screen (if the phone falls on a flat surface, that is).Note: It does add some bulk to my already large Samsung S3, but the extra protection is well worth it, and particularly at this price point.
3	1386892800	So easy to put on, only thing I do not like is how cheap looking it really is. I mean it does the job, but for the price, cannot complain.
1	1386892800	I wasn't happy with this case when I received it. The rubber part was softer than I was expecting and seemed loose on my phone. It also had a bad odor, like tire rubber. i returned the case and went back to my favorite Speck case.
5	1386892800	absolutely love this case ! Fits my Galaxy 3 like a glove..and the protection is amazing, dropped my phone many times since and not a scratch Thanx again..would definitely recommend this case
2	1386806400	The color is vibrant and eyecatching but the case is not made well..There is no screen protector,the case is not durable and it is a cheap version of the Otterbox..I purchased a 4 dollar case from a beauty supply store that was better made than this case..I returned it for a full refund...
5	1386806400	Case is easy to put on and take off, yet it stays on securely.  Protects the phone well.  This case does make it difficult to fit inside some cell phone pockets, but that's more because of the large size of the S3 itself.
5	1386720000	this  is a good product for the price  with good quality and arrived quicklyI would recommend this product  to others
5	1386720000	VERY durable and allows easy access to all the buttons on the phone; it has protected my phone when I dropped it.
5	1386720000	Product seems like it will  protect my phone and great price.  I haven't dropped my phone since using. It fits phone.
4	1386720000	Fits the phone perfect. Offers great protection when phone is dropped and it bounces on the corners. the only problem is that it's challenging to slide fingers to the very edge of the screen since the cover overlaps slightly there.
5	1386633600	Fit the phone perfectly and makes it easier to hold. Having arthritis makes my hands shake so having something more sturdy to hold is great. We loved the color options.
5	1386633600	I've dropped my phone multiple times (accidentally of course) and haven't had it damage in any way. This case has kept my phone flawless over the last few months since I bought. Highly recommended.
5	1386633600	Great case! I've had mine for a about a year now and it's still holding up, even got a Blue one for my mother in law. Great purchase and saved my phone from so many drops.
5	1386633600	Awesome cell phone case. I love that it keeps my phone nice and save but doesnt feel too bulky like the otterbox. It slides in and out of my pocket with ease. I have dropped my phone a couple times since I have had the ballistic case and my phone is still in perfect condition. Works like a charm!
5	1386633600	This is a very nice case for the price. I would recommend it to friends and family. wish I would of bought it sooner.
4	1386547200	Expeditious shipping and great product- have already dropped the phone while in the case and it remained well protected.  Easy to &#34;install&#34; and looks good.
5	1386460800	I've had this case for six months now, and I absolutely love it. It fits awesome, the buttons are very easy to push, and its super for protecting during drops (I would know...) My husband has the Otterbox Commuter Case, also works well, but I prefer this one.
5	1386460800	Just as good as ANY Otterbox or other super high priced brand name case. Easy access to any or the buttons and ports. My mom and aunt both use this case and love it.
4	1386374400	At first I was concerned that it would make the phone difficult to hold on to as it seemed like the back was pretty slick. So far that has not seemed to be an issue.  I do like the manner in which the phone slips into the case.  It is much easier to get into the back of the phone if needed.  That was the issue with the first case I had for this phone and as careful as I was, I cracked it when I had to take out the battery.  I have been fortunate enough to have not dropped my phone with this case, so I am unsure of how it will protect it then.  Hopefully, that will not happen.  I would purchase this again.
5	1386288000	I ordered the blue and the wine cases and got them both today.Me and my daughter-in-law are very happy with the casesThe colors are great!They look much better in person than in pictures,They were very easy to put on our phones and look really good.The control buttons are easy to work and the case does not hamper them at all.I am pleased with them so far!UPDATE:  My youngest grandson just dropped my phone and kicked it while trying to pick it up. After I recovered from seeing my phone fall I checked it and it was fine...now if I can just get my heart rate back to normal after the scare...LOL
5	1386288000	This case was exactly as described. It went on easy, protects my phone and is light weight. I also love the variety of colors available. All around very good product at a good price.
4	1386201600	Pretty good case.  It is hard to get out of my pockets because of the rubbery edging which is kind of annoying that's why it only gets 4 instead of 5 stars.
5	1386201600	This case is sturdy and attractive.  The seller provided fast shipping, which is a big selling feature for me.  This was a gift and he loves it.
4	1386201600	I love the case! The colors are beautiful and it's lightweight and easy to carry in any pocket or purse. I only have 1 problem with the case and that is it peels my plastic screen protector up on the edges. Other than that, the case is great! I've dropped it and put it through some serious roughness and inside, my phone is just as beautiful as the day I bought it!  :-) I liked the case so well, I ended up buying one for my sister for a birthday present. She loves hers too!!!
5	1386115200	I really like this case. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could because it is a little bit difficult to put into and pull out of pockets but other than that, it is perfect.I drop my phones a lot. I always have. Back when flip phones were the cool, new thing (in the 90's) I dropped those phones all the time and they were built like tanks so it never mattered. It is a habit of mine that never stopped, even when they started putting fragile glass screens on expensive, large phones.Well, I didn't want an Otterbox. My brother got an Otterbox but he is a dude and never really liked how fragile the Samsung Galaxy S3 felt anyway. So for him, an Otterbox is the perfect case. Tough, rugged, manly.Well, I'm a girl. I have girly hands. I like that my phone is light and delicate. So this case, in all it's girly pink awesomeness, spoke to me through the computer screen and after doing a ton of research about this case vs. the Otterbox cases vs. other &#34;rugged&#34; cases.... this one won.It definitely adds some bulk to the phone and whenever I take the case off (to do a hard reset or whatever) I am reminded just how fragile and pretty the phone is itself. But it isn't nearly as much ugly bulk as the Otterbox that my brother bought. I mean, it is pink!I have dropped my phone, while in this case, at least a dozen times in the past few months. At least half of those times were in a violent fashion from a higher up starting point. I drive vans for one of my jobs and I tend to forget my phone is on my lap and then I jump out of the van and the phone goes flying across the asphalt. Not even a scratch on the phone yet. The case doesn't even break apart during my &#34;drops&#34;. I had a case on my old HTC Evo that broke apart upon impact as a way for it to absorb the bulk of the impact, thereby protecting the phone. This case just stays tightly bound to the phone as the phone bounces around on the ground.I have come to trust this case so much now that I barely even react when I drop my phone now. I just assume it will be alright when I pick it up.So go ahead and drop your phone face down, from great heights, from the top of your car as you drive away, whatever you want... as long as you have this case on there correctly, I don't think you will have any problems. I haven't yet.Oh yeah... some people mentioned buttons being hard to push. I have little girl hands and fingers and I haven't had any trouble accessing buttons or pressing the home button. In the beginning it may have felt different but it wasn't difficult and now I don't even notice.
5	1386115200	I like the color and the looks of it.  I haven't dropped my phone yet so there are no details on that.
5	1386115200	Great case. I have bought two of them. The gel case stretches over time but I have never cracked a screen with this cover!
5	1386115200	This is by far the BEST case I have ever had for any phone! I drop my phone constantly and with this case and the rubberized corners its simply does a little bounce and is fine. No dings or scratches anywhere. It fits perfectly on my phone and is easy to remove if needed. I certainly don't mind spending the extra cash on a case that will protect my phone so well.
5	1386115200	I love my phone, but it is so slick that I had a hard time holding it. So I bought this Ballistic case for my phone, and love it.It was each to put on, it not too heavy, but at the same time it is very protective. It fit very well and I have no problem using my camera, side buttons, or getting the charger plugged in.I love it.
5	1386115200	I received this as a gift for my Galaxy II, and I loved it.  So, I had to buy one for my Galaxy SIII.It has a great feel, looks good, and fits my phone perfectly.
1	1385942400	Terrible case. My wife was not liking her Otterbox case, so we gave this one a shot. Her phone fell off of a low table and the screen instantly shattered. The phone had held up just fine to similar falls and worse with the Otterbox on. I don't normally give just one star since that seems overly dramatic and is usually accompanied by a review with many exclamation points, but seriously it had one job and it failed. Not only that but I'm pretty sure the phone didn't just fall off the table... it was pushed.... BY THE CASE!!No but seriously, its not a good case, I do not recommend it.
5	1385942400	The case is excellent.  Love the colors and it's is very appealing to look at.  Like it better than Otterbox.
4	1385942400	Just put it on it was one of two choices i purchased, only had it on for less then a month, Love the two colors together, able to press buttons easily.  Have not thankfully dropped it to proof if its a good as its suppose to be I hope so cause I read the reviews and brought it based on that review.
5	1385856000	This case just feels right!!! it fits nice & snuggly onto my phone. it's sturdy but yet not too bulky. so for a female looking for a firm yet feminine phone cover, this is absolutely the one for you.
5	1385856000	Love my new case .. feels very sturdy and is secure around phone have unfortunately already tested its durability..ha ha
4	1385769600	the love this item however I thought it came with a person for the screen and it did not overall a good bye
3	1385769600	Sent this one back. Needed more protection and purchased theB008D4X4GWThis one looks identical to theB008D4X4GWbut for some reason, it seemed a little more "flimsy" than the Maxx case.
5	1385683200	My wife loves this case for her new S3.  It provides great protection and the color looks good.  It's also easy to get the phone in and out of, which can't be said of many of the other cases on the market right now.
5	1385683200	Excellent quality. Feel safe that my phone if I dropped, will not break.Terrific. Good Buy and price. Excellent  quality. Amazon rocks, best service.
5	1385596800	This is a very heavy duty two piece case that exactly fits my new phone. Very good quality and the buttons are protected but easy to push. It makes the phone much easier to hold. I would buy this again!
5	1385596800	I have dropped my phone so many times since I got this case and it has no signs of damage. Its a great case!
5	1385510400	Fits perfectly,  I had no problems putting it on. My baby dropped my phone right after I put the case in and out worked as it should. Great buy
4	1385510400	very strong, fits nicely on, comes off easier,an doesn't sag like the otter box. All around a better product for less money.
5	1385424000	color is accurate, item is tough yet not bulky, plastic back does NOT pop off regularly as some other reviewers have said (why would you take it off at all?)  anyway...overall I would buy this again.
5	1385337600	This case is great. It is basically a thick black silicone sleeve that you fit on your phone with a pink and black hard case that clips onto the outside of the sleeve. It is only two pieces instead of the three I have seen on other protective type cases. The color is perfect and it feels really sturdy. It does not block any of the necessary functions or buttons of the phone and it doesn't cause the phone to overheat.
5	1385337600	This cover does not hinder use of the phone at all.  The cover fits perfectly, is attractive, and protects my phone.I highly recommend!!
5	1385337600	great cell phone case! i initially got the Otterbox or whatever and that did not even fit my phone correctly. although this guy costs a bit more it is every bit worth it! I have dropped my phone many times and it has been protected every time. What I like about this case is that it doesnt look all beat up after a while even after many drops!
5	1385337600	My daughter has destroyed two Otterbox Commuters because she can't stop fiddling with the headphone and charger covers and eventually the rubber rips clean off.  We're trying this one out as an alternative.  The buttons are easier to press than when the phone is in the Otterbox and there is no rubber covering the headphone jack or the charger port, but I haven't found that to be a problem.  It's not like the Commuter case was at all waterproof.  She tends to drop her phone a lot and so far this one has held up well.  We'll see how it lasts over time.
4	1385251200	This cover has been a great protector for my Galaxy.  The color makes it easy to find in my purse.
5	1385164800	I work with kids and have a small nephew that plays with my phone. I can't justify spending $40 on an Otterbox, so I researched this brand a bit. It was right up there with Otterbox so I decided to give it a try. It is fantastic! I drop my phone at least a few times a week and the hard rubber case handles the fall and there is no damage to my phone. Highly recommended!
5	1385078400	Great cases. We are hard on our phones and these cases have saved them many times. Definitely recommend these cases
5	1385078400	Love this case! It was very easy to put on the phone and it is easy to get off if you need to. I love the feel of it. I would definitely buy another one.
5	1384992000	I received item immediately and is enjoying the new protector on the phone. So many options to choose from, I'm satisfied with what I picked.
5	1384992000	Exactly what I expected and what I was looking for simple snd durable. Highly recommended. And the color is great.
5	1384992000	Very durable, yet not too bulky. Nice fit :) I switched from my Otterbox Defender case, as it was a bit too bulky for my taste, but this case provides solid protection for half the cost.
5	1384992000	Love this cover, comfortable and attractive. Good value for the money. Easy to grip and find fumbling around inside my purse.
5	1384992000	After 2 broken cell phones in a couple months, I started shopping for a case for my girlfriends phone.  She's not easy to shop for but we settled on this one and she couldn't be happier with it.  It's attractive, not TOO bulky and seems very well built and seems to protect the phone very well.
5	1384905600	good case, vivid color and good quality, fits perfectly and also it is easy to remove.it is sturdy and at the same time not bulky.
5	1384905600	i bought this as a gift for someone a few months ago.  it arrived on time and is exactly what we were looking for.  i haven't heard any complaints yet.
5	1384905600	I had it for a few days and promptly dropped my phone on concrete.  It landed on it's corner with no damage whatsoever.  My previous phone took the same fall and it shattered the screen.  This case was worth every penny.  It fits my Galaxy SIII perfectly and actually makes the buttons even easier to operate.  I highly recommend it.
1	1384905600	I put this on my phone and my phone fell off the table and the corner of my phone cracked.. I thought this was suppose to prevent that from happening
5	1384905600	So much better than the other cases.  Slim yet protects!!!  I have dropped my home already and you would never know!
5	1384905600	This is such a great case. I have dropped my phone several times, and this has protected it every single time. I even dropped it screen side down on the road and the rubber front kept the screen from touching the pavement. The only way it could get better is if it came with a screen protector.
5	1384819200	Love this case. Its sturdy and tough. Already dropped my phone 3 or 4 times and thankfully the case really protected it from injury.
5	1384819200	It fits my Galaxy S3 perfectly. And I like that it protects the corners with more padding. I used to drop my phone at least once a week, and 50% of the time it fall on the corner. Now I don't have to worry about that anymore.
5	1384819200	AWESOME!!!! I love this phone case it has protected my phone. Great phone protection and I love the color selection and durability.
4	1384819200	Everything about this case was exactly what I expected.  It goes easily.  It protects my phone and it does not get in the way of any of the buttons.  The only issue I have had with it is that the hard pink part slips slightly out of place sometimes.  Otherwise it is great.  I tend to drop my phone and in general be rather rough and it has protected it very well.
5	1384819200	I have had this case on my phone for several months. It has saved me several times from a broken phone. They only negative is it makes the phone thicker. I would pick this again.
5	1384819200	Nice case, has rubber corners, front and part of the back. This is a 2 piece case, darker pink is rubber and lighter pink is a hard plastic shell. The front face of it has a lip around the screen so that if the phone is dropped on it's face, the screen wont get damaged.
5	1384819200	It was perfect for my boyfriend since his Otterbox was just falling apart and I currently owned a Ballistics case and it was in perfect condition, so I had to buy this for him, and at such a great price!
4	1384819200	The only reason I gave it 4 stars was it did not have a screen cover. But I love the case!
5	1384732800	Case fits like a universal glove. Doesn't scratch phone or remove paint from casing. Easy to remove and clean. Protects phone from damage .
1	1384732800	I wish I had spent a little more and ordered the Otterbox Commuter for my S3.  The blue colors are very nice, but that is the only good thing about this.  The rubber material on the corners is way too stretchy and always pulls back to expose the corner when you pull it out of your pocket. This rubber material on the corners needs to be made more firm to keep it in place.
5	1384732800	It is in perfect condition and does very well for the phone! I love it and will use it for awhile!
4	1384732800	It's cute, high-tech-looking, feels great in the hand, is grippy so you are less likely to drop it anyway, and clearly protects your smartphone from accidents--and the price is right. The only downsides I can see are that it takes a little experimentation to fit it on correctly and that it's a bit bulky. If you put the case on as directed (left side first), one side will not go all the way over and your device will pull out of the case. if you put it on the opposite way (right side first), then the case will stay on fine. The extra bulk is only a factor when you are squeezing your device into a zippered pocket when running or walking; I usually remove the case before wearing it. But these things are small--the price, the stylishness, and the safety more than make up for it.
5	1384646400	This case looks good, feels good and protects my phone. I love it! The price was right and the quality is perfect.
5	1384646400	I love it- perfect fit, looks great. does not impede using any of the buttons. I only wish there were more colors to choose from.
4	1384646400	This is a great, safe case for your Samsung Galaxy SIII.  Easy to install and very durable.The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that it has a tendency to unstick and push up the corners of my Zagg screen protector especially at the bottom.
5	1384646400	I usually have to go through a couple of covers for a new phone before I find what I want.  As soon as I put this on my phone I was satisfied. It looks great and gives great protection. I especially like the soft, slightly tacky, cover because it helps prevent dropping it out of a shirt pocket.  I will admit it can be annoying as well.Overall, it's a great cover for the price and it gives good protection as well.
5	1384560000	What caught my eye was the color of this stylish case, love pink and black and the price was great!!!! It does what it's intended to do, PROTECT, I bought it for my Samsung Galaxy SIII, and with my 3 year old toddler always playing with my phone, it's clear that the phone would fall a couple of times and it has. But luckily I have my pink and black Ballistic case which gives it great protection, so check out the other styles that Ballistic has to protect your phones.
5	1384560000	I bought this for my girlfriend and she really loves it. Being a young mother I knew she needed it, and thank the lord I bought it when I did, as she had dropped it twice after applying this case and both times she could have sworn the phone would have been busted. She loves the feel of it, it's comfortable to hold and she loves the sleekness. Very reliable and very stylish.
5	1384473600	Awesome product. Just make sure you follow the steps to put it together or it won't fit properly. My only complaint is the front of the case makes it hard to pull down notifications, but it isn't a big deal.
5	1384387200	Love this Ballistic phone protector for Galaxy S3, it fits correctly and provides great protection from dust, falls, etc.  Thanks!
5	1384300800	I love this case. It is good looking but also very sturdy and protective. Where it covers the control buttons it works just great.I was lucky to find it.
5	1384300800	Love this case. Does a great job protecting my phone from falls. (And with a toddler around, it gets dropped a lot!) I used to cringe whenever my phone was dropped but with tye extra padding on the corners I'm now confident my phone will survive. Also, case doesnt split open when dropped. Back is textured, so it's easier to hold on to, and it doesn't scratch so it still looks brand new. My last case went in the trash.
5	1384300800	Love this case.  I wish I would have got it before I cracked all of the corners of my screen.  Light weight and the buttons still work good unlike other cases.
4	1384300800	Great durable case. Super fast shipping. Screen protector could be higher quality, smoother and easier to put on-that is slightly disappointing..
5	1384214400	I love this phone cover and the sale was fast and easy. Couldn't have been better!! I got this cover a couple days after I ordered it. It was exactly what I thought I was getting.
5	1384214400	Good Sturdy case, I love it. I actually bought tow of these and I am very please with the product.
4	1384214400	Way better than the otter box case since this one stays put on my phone. Protects the corners, which are really vulnerable (found out the hard way) because the front glass wraps around the side. Have dropped my phone a bunch of times in this and my phone is still perfectly fine!
5	1384214400	True to color, but it is not as shiny or as vivid as the picture, but I don't care. It's close enough for horseshoes as they say! I haven't dropped my phone YET, but I feel protected for the day that I do. The case makes it easier for me to turn the volume up and down and put to sleep/turn off. I have no problems plugging in the charger or headphones. I don't use a dock of any kind, so I can't speak to that.
5	1384128000	I drop my phone all the time and now i dont have to worry it will break.This case fits great and protects from any drops. I highly recommend this compared to other very expensive cases.
5	1384128000	So far this case is pretty awesome! LOVE the hot pink and black together! It has really protected my phon, i have dropped it serveral times and the rubber has protected it good!!! Definitely would recommend!
5	1384041600	I drop my phone all the time and this case is awesome!!  Never a problem&#8230;  I would highly recommend it!
5	1384041600	Great. Hard plastic protects my phone but allows it to slip easily in and out of my pocket. Reinforced rubber corners do a really good job of absorbing shock and protecting the phone when it is accidentally dropped.
5	1384041600	Would reccomend. quality item it does what its suppose to do. A+ have dropped phone many times and it still works.
5	1384041600	Color was exactly as seen on Amazon.  Fits like a glove.  I had put on the protective film before this case, and it didn't peel or push off the film.  What a relief considering putting on protective film can be a procedure in itself.  Got many compliments on the case.
5	1384041600	Great case!  Enough protection to keep the phone padded from 'shock' (ie dropping on the concrete)...yet can still fit into my (small) purse.  Power/volume buttons are actually easier  to use with the case.
3	1384041600	It's fairly attractive and would certainly protect, but it adds considerable bulk.  If you appreciate the lines of the phone, they are obliterated with this.  And forget about getting it into a clip style holster.  Perhaps if you had a  larger pocket style holster, it would be okay.  This case is just not what I was looking for.
3	1383955200	Sure I like to color, but it is a bit bulky, and the outer shell is a bit of a pain to deal with.  It was cheap so the price was perfect and I do not feel like I am losing anything, but I have begun shopping for another case.
5	1383868800	The best case I've found anywhere.  It's 2 piece & really protects the phone when dropped. Worth the price for sure.
5	1383868800	I absolutely love this case.  & shipping was fast! It fit my  phone perfect.  & its not to bulky. I love love love it
5	1383868800	I absolutely love the Ballistic SG0930-M775 SG. It is much easier to access than the OTTER BOX! If you are looking for a good case that is cheap then this is the one you should get.
5	1383868800	It's great they have a YouTube video about it. Takes impact, great feel. Its like 2 Cases in 1.http://youtu.be/3Mbq_Enzp34
5	1383868800	So I got this a few months back after doing a whole lot of research. ..I love it!  I've dropped my phone a few times already and my phone is in perfect shape. Even when it his the floor it sounds sturdy (weird I know). My guy had a otter box that he started having issues with after about two months and he paid way more than I did and it was much bulkier than this case.  This is a teeny bit bulky too,  compared to How slim and sleek the phone actually is but for the protection I get Its really not bad at all. Really do recommend this case
5	1383782400	Have tried other shells/covers for the phone.  This one feels better, more protective and yet allows me to access buttons, headphone jack, etc
5	1383523200	The Ballistic Protective Case I ordered for my Samsung Galaxy SIII was received timely via USPS & in good condition - Thank You - I LOVE IT !!!
2	1383436800	Within two days of getting this case, my wife dropped her phone and it cracked.  Aren't cases supposed to save the phone from cracking?  She didn't touchdown-spike the phone...it only dropped from 3-4 feet high.  Really didn't perform as advertised.
5	1383436800	My husband liked this case the best. He wanted me to return the others but he might want to change it later.
4	1383350400	This cover has saved my Samsung Galaxy S3 from many falls and I am very impressed with it's durability and longevity! I was very please with the manner in which it was shipped as well as how quickly it arrived... I will definitely be doing business with this company again as I am due soon for a new protective case...
5	1383264000	Fantastic case. Soft in the right places, and hard in the right places. All of the buttons and ports are readily available. I feel my phone is well protected, whereas without it, the phone was very vulnerable and buttons always got pushed at the wrong time.
5	1383264000	this case is absolutely perfect its very colorful and pretty to look at you can see it in a bottom of the dark bag or backpack and it offers a hundred percent protection to your screen and phone the rubber around the screen and on the corners is amazing I'm absolutely thrilled by this case!! also there is one more amazing thing about this case my phone froze and I had to take the battery out and I didn't have to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to take my case of it came off very easily and very quickly so I could get to the back of my phone where other cases like this are so tight to the phone that you nearly have to break your phone to get them off this is not like that it came off easily still very protective from moisture and everything it's just nicer to get off the phone.
4	1383177600	It definitely serves its purpose.  The only thing I wish it had was a screen protector or cover.  Other than that its great!
5	1383177600	I ordered this case for my phone and I love it.  It is sturdy and I can get to all the buttons on my phone.  I love the price too.  Great buy!
5	1383091200	good price,got here quick,awesome deal thanks,good protection for my phone love it good qualitylove the color and quality deffinetly would buy again
5	1383091200	The case for the Samsung Galaxy S3 fits very well the cellular phone and it is strong. The looks is good too
5	1383091200	Bought this for my husband and he loves it. The navy looks masculine enough and the lighter blue spices things up a bit. It fits the phone beautifully and it offers solid protection. No complains.
5	1383091200	My husband loves it. Great quality product. Picture was true to exact color as well. Plan to buy another for myself.
3	1383091200	I like the color but the black silicone case that goes on the phone makes it impossible for you to put in your pocket. It gets stuck on the material of jeans.And fuzz and other stuff gets stuck on the silicone part on the front.
5	1383091200	Love Ballistic phone covers! Very protective.The color is great and if you have different colors you can interchange the pieces.
5	1383004800	This case is very well made.  Its not too bulky and very easy to grip.  I love the color choice.
4	1383004800	Thought it was a good case.  It is a little bit of a bigger profile, so you sacrifice slimness for protection, but it's a solid case.
5	1383004800	This case is very durable and it protects against most things my phone goes through. I would recommend this product
5	1383004800	Case looks and protects great, plus comes with a screen cover.The headphones and power adapters have flip open covers, which surprised me, but are working ok.The top power button is stiff and takes some effort to press.  This is mostly obvious if you are taking a screen shot by pressing power and home button at same time.Even with top button stiffness, it is a very sturdy, thin case, and well designed with rubber around phone that then clicks into outer shell.
5	1383004800	I bought this case several months ago and it is still in great shape. It is the best phone case I have ever had. At first I thought I may not like the fact that it doesn't have a port cover but I ended up better because my daughter usually ends up breaking those off anyways.I definitely prefer this case over my old otterbox.
5	1383004800	I got it very quickly. I love it ...color is beautiful as displayed and very durable! A Must have and Great Buy!
5	1382918400	Perfect case. Love it. All buttons fucntion great and perfect fit. Color is vibrant. Goes easily in your pocket. Bought 2.
5	1382918400	Really works.  Have dropped it a couple of times and it is in perfect condition.  Would refer this to a friend.  Great product.
4	1382918400	I've had an Otter Box case in the past and the rubber part of it started falling apart after a fairly short amount of time. I don't have that problem with this case at all. Also drop things a lot in general and the most I've been able to do with this case is get a small dent in one of the corners. Definitely will be buying and suggesting this product.
4	1382918400	At first glance I thought it looked cheap but it is actually a good case because it is cute and durable.
5	1382918400	Very sturdy case. Fits the S3 perfectly and snug. I thought it might be too bulky but it was not.  It is a little heavy but I tend to drop my phone a lot so I am ok with that.  My power and volume buttons also work well with this case. It has no issues.
5	1382832000	I love the soft buttons and the hard case! It protects very well and the colors are exact shades. It was super easy to put on and its great quality!
5	1382832000	I have had this case for 10 months and couldn't be happier. I have a screen protector which holds under the screen perfectly and have had not had to touch the case since putting it on. I have dropped the phone a couple of times, as have my children and it is still in tact - no cracks or anything wrong with the phone.
5	1382832000	My God Son likes this case. I ordered one from AT& T and it was back ordered and it wasn't the color he wanted. Great buy.
5	1382745600	Fits perfect. love the color. don't interfere with anything great case would very highly recommend 5 stars dropped it a couple times no damage
3	1382745600	Attractive, not too bulky, wife loves. Blue 2 tone color is a good looking alternative to the black, grey, & pink I have seen elsewhere
5	1382659200	I love this case. There is no doubt in my mind that if I drop my phone on a hard floor that it will be safe as long as it doesn't land face down on a rock. The back and sides are completely safe and there is enough coverage on the front to provide a bumper as long as there is nothing on the ground to protect the front. Great Case.
5	1382572800	I didn't think it would work but I accidentally dropped my phone on the street when I got off the car with this case and nothing happened I LOVE IT!!!
5	1382572800	I've dropped my phone twice without issue.  Not even a mark on the case.  Will probably be buying more of these for myself and some friends.
5	1382572800	Fit great and very protective like an otter box. Great price too! I would suggest this product to anyone. Does its job.
5	1382572800	Ballistic case is excellent. Already owed 2 of these cases for other Samsung phones, so there was no question as to what case to order when a new phone was purchased. Case is durable, and ofters great protection to the phone. My other case is close to 2 years old and still looks brand new. I have dropped my phone on occasion with no sign of damage to either the phone or case.
5	1382572800	Nice cover that was easy to put on my phone.  All the buttons work well and there's plenty of clearance for the camera.
5	1382572800	It is a very good case. Just what I expected. I bought 2 cases and the two have been very good
5	1382486400	Love this case. Heavy enough to be rugged without undue weight or bulk. Still fits nicely in slightly oversized leather case. Just the other day, I accidentally juggled my phone, sending it to the ground. It fell squarely on a corner, now well-protected by the Ballistic case. That case helped cushion and protect my phone and after a little dusting off, we were back in business. It was just what I wanted, at a great price too.
5	1382400000	Bought for my wife she likes it. Protects it from her dropping it a nd breaking it again. Works and fits good.
4	1382400000	It has been good. I can not compare to any thing as this the first smart phone for me. It does need to come with a clip though.
4	1382400000	Yes it is bulkynot very elegant, but a fun colorbut with one crack on the screen I needed the protection.You can drop it you won't even hear it the padding is amazing and you won't fear when you turn it over to look at the screenYou lose one of the main attractions of this phone (slim, cool) but at least it can stay intact
5	1382313600	This case is well built and protects my phone very nicely.  I would recommend this phone case for Galaxy SIII.
5	1382313600	LOVE IT! i never took it off of my phone. fits well and everything! i dropped it and my phone was safe lol
5	1382313600	Good quality, fits very well, like it was custom made. No problems as far as access to the control button coverings.
5	1382227200	Good product, hoping to buy another color since they look so cool, its really worth the money so I recommend it
5	1382227200	Great all around protection for your phone. Easy excess to off and on switch, and other ports.  Love the color. I would recommend this case to family and friends
5	1382227200	This case offers great protection for the phone. Fits very snug but easy to put on and remove. The contrasting colors of the 2 pieces makes it attractive and there is good grip to the phone.  The corners are protected without being bulky and the lip allows you to set it on its face and the screen is not touching the table.  Great case without being too bulky. Would recommend.
5	1382140800	The cover arrived promptly... slips on and off easily.. makes me feel more secure about protecting phone if i should drop it..all the buttons are still accessible
5	1382140800	I purchase it for a friend of mine and he just love it, he think it so much better and have his phone so well much protected than to cheap one he pay so much money for his Samsung s3 and it fit nicely in the Reiko Plus Size Premium Horizontal leather Pouch so lovely...............................................love it
5	1382140800	I love my new case.  It protects the phone yet it isn't too bulky.  It has no screen cover which is what I wanted.
5	1382054400	I have a galaxy s3, it fits great have dropped phone and no cracks or breaks would definitely buy again
3	1382054400	The item is ok. Not as good or the protection as an otterbox, but for what it is, it's not bad. Like the color.
5	1382054400	I've used this for 30 days and it's Exactly what I wanted! The gel lining actually fits the case super snug, gel lining is not sticky, & it's very durable. The hard shell covers just what it needs to. As much as I set it down on hard surfaces, the hard shell is not scratched. I will definitely buy this case again if needed and from this seller. It came packaged and as described. Great product!!
5	1381968000	This case is holding up really well. I wore out a Defender case previously, the face was too scratched to read through. This one has no screen protector so I'm using screen covers with it. Its bright so I can find it. Its snug but goes on and off easily.  It is sticky enough it doesn't fall out of pockets but I can still get it out quickly when I need to.
4	1381968000	Wasn't what I thought it was but is a good case for what it is. Wish they provided better pictures in the ad
4	1381968000	When I originally had my HTC Evo, I tried a Ballistic case for the first time, and was extremely impressed.  It seems like the quality went down just a little bit from when they first started coming out, but its still a great case and much cheaper then other brands.
4	1381968000	Good as advertised.  I haven't dropped phone on purpose to test shock impact but believe it would protect the unit.  I miss having screen cover but I do like this case. It fits like a glove.
5	1381968000	Love love love this case!  It's a slim fit and stylish.  I haven't dropped it yet, but I'm fairly confident there would be no damage.  I would recommend this case over an otterbox. :)
4	1381881600	Both my wife and I love these cases for our phones. I have already dropped my phone numerous times on concrete - just last weekend at a height of about 5 feet and not one crack/scratch on the phone!  My last case from a different manufacture was dropped from about 3 feet and the case and phone shattered. I would like to see more color combinations though.
5	1381881600	I got this case for my husband Galaxy S 3. It is very durable and bright, no complaints from him.
5	1381881600	I used to have the otter box phone case but over time it just became flimsy and no longer really protected the phone.  This contains my phone more securely.
5	1381881600	Nice product overall for the price.  I bought this for my mom and she hasn't had any complaints.  Fits the phone great.
5	1381881600	If I had to do it over again, I would get this case again. I love it.  It is made good.  I have dropped it one time and it was just fine.  I definitely recommend this case and this seller.
4	1381795200	ALREADY HAD A CASE, BUT WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. MORE ALONG THE LINES OF AN OTTER BOX. LOVE THE COLORS, ALSO.
4	1381795200	This case works as well as my Otterbox at half of the price. My phone has fallen onto tile and asphalt without gaining a scratch. However, when I needed to remove the case, I noticed a layer of gunk around the camera and flashlight. I may notice it a lot more because my phone is white, and I have no problem cleaning it, but some may be bothered by this.
5	1381795200	I love this case! It can be on and off in about a minute unlike the more expensive OB. I have had this case for months now and I've dropped it on concrete, tile, asphalt and it still looks great and not a scratch on my phone! For a 1/3 of the price ...I highly recommend this case.
5	1381795200	I don't expect to drop my phone, but feel confident that if such occurs, this Case will avoid any damage
5	1381795200	My husband loves this case. It's very tough and durable. Great protection for his phone since our 3 year old always has his hands on it. Highly recommended!
5	1381708800	Yes, Works like a charm. well worth the price. I would recommend this item to the owner of this phone.
5	1381708800	I've had this case for what seems like forever now. I had another Ballistic case on my older phone and that one was just gimongous and this one is much more compact. there are two cases. one is rubber and the other is plastic in the inside and has rubber corners and some on the outside. I really like the fact that it is not all rubber so you can have some color on the case and it wont get stuck going into your back pocket. Recommend this product to others :)
5	1381708800	This case is worth every penny! I have dropped my phone from 4 feet up with this case, and it just bounced like a bouncy ball, landed, and there was absolutely no damage to my phone. Very easy to take off, put on, and clean. The black rubber part can collect lint if in your purse or pocket, but just use a damp wash cloth, paper towel, but i just lick my thumb and wipe the edges, and it's good to go.Love love love it. Would definitely recommend it.
5	1381708800	I had a white Otterbox before this that was similar, then switched to a pink Otterbox that quickly got stretched out, and the little charger cover/flap tore off. This Ballistic case leaves the charger and headphone plugs uncovered (which I prefer, but I can see where dust/dirt could get in, but like I said, I'd rather not deal with the little flap). I am very pleased with this case and it's cheaper than Otterbox. Again, the only difference between this and an otterbox case (besides the price) is this one does NOT have a flap to cover the charging port or headphone port - something I personally prefer. Would buy again.
5	1381622400	This is a very good case. It's cute and protective of my phone. Arrived super early, so I was excited about that. I always use this case even though I have many others.
5	1381622400	I have had this case for about 3 months & can say that it protects very well. It has more rubber in the corners so that when dropped it is well protected. It also has a plastic shell that snaps on, more protection! Plus its black & pink! Buy it u will love it!
5	1381536000	Excellent cover for the Samsung III.  Looks great. The same cover cost twice as much at the local phone store.  I highly recommend it!
5	1381536000	Fits great looks great and is very protective.  It's a keeper.  Will definitely tell all my friends this the case to buy.
4	1381449600	These are cheaper and all around just as good as an otter box. I will buy another soon I'm sure.
3	1381449600	Did know what to expect. . So far so good, but I think that the rubber is gettind a bit loose on the corners from taking on / off. But it does what I needed it to do...
5	1381449600	Love this item, great for the phone and protects it well. Makes me feel confident that my phone will be protected. Awesome buy!
5	1381449600	This case is very durable and yet not too bulky.  Really love the quality and the color choices were fantastic.
5	1381363200	I love this case. It protects my phone from the wrath of my 2 year old so its awesome in my book! Fit my SIII perfectly as well.
5	1381363200	I am a major clutz and if I can break something, I usually do despite my best efforts to be careful. I wouldn't take my phone out of the box until I got this case & the skin for the screen. In the few months that I have owned the phone I can't count the number of times I've dropped. This case has kept it completely safe it no matter the surface it hit. I LOVE the color (ever so slightly more subdued in person than pictured) and it was easy to install on the phone. I would definitely buy again and though Amazon, as it was half the price of the ones I saw in stores.
4	1381276800	This is a great case at a reasonable price. I got it for my wife's phone; her only notice is that the way it wraps around the front, it's sometimes hard to select text all the way to the front margin, but that's a minor point. Very happy with this case.
5	1381276800	I recently received my galaxy 3 case from ballistic,it arrived on time and the packaging was very secure.As far as the case goes,it is everything they said and more.It looks good ,is very rugged and fit my phone like a glove with very little effort on my part. I would recommend this case to everyone.
5	1381276800	Good fit and protects the phone well. Also very comfortable to hold in the hand. Buttons are easy to push too.
5	1381276800	I needed a case that would keep my phone safe.  I didn't have my phone protected before and dropped my phone and shattered the screen twice.  I was afraid the case would be too bulky, but since the phone is almost too slight, with the case on it's just the right size.  This is really easy to put on and stays secure and the buttons work wonderfully.  It keeps the all of the sides secure and I don't need to worry about a screen cover since it doesn't touch when I turn it upside down.  I was afraid the colors would be too bright or not cute IRL, but it's super cute and I love the color.  (I have the ruby/dark wine color.  The only con would be that it doesn't slide easily into my back pocket due to the silicone corners.  But I can still get it in there.  I normally keep it in my purse anyway.  Other than that, I think it's perfect and I am totally happy with this purchase!
4	1381190400	I was very excited to get this for my s3, the blue is a great color and easy install and it really protectswell, I've dropped it several times without any problems. Cant beat the price and great product all around.
5	1381190400	I've only had the case a few weeks, but so far I really like it.  It feels sturdy, and I am much more comfortable using the phone with it on because I feel like I have something to grip and it isn't slippery.  The side buttons work really well and I can still fit it easily in my purse or a pocket when I need to.  I would definitely recommend this.
5	1381190400	Great case for Samsung S3.  Easy to put on/take off.  The corners are covered and all buttons/outlets are accessible.  Exactly what I was hoping for!
5	1381190400	I was in between buying this or the otterbox and I'm so glad that I read the reviews. This case is great and comes with a great price tag. The case protects the phone and at the same time all the keys, camera lens and plugs are available for use with no hassle. Very happy with my purchase.
5	1381104000	Good protection for my phone and nice colors !!  I bought twobone for my husband. We like knowing that our phones have a secure cover !!
5	1381104000	This case nicely protected my new android, S3 when it slipped out of my pocket onto the tile floor.  I swear it bounced and kept it from any damage whatsoever.  The phone got dropped again onto a brick patio with the same thankful results.
4	1381104000	A little thicker than I wanted; but the dropping protection is excellent.  Will recommend for friends; or as a gift.
2	1381017600	The picture makes it look shiny but it's not.  Looks a little cheap.  But it works that's why I gave it 2 stars.
4	1381017600	My phone is in the exact condition it was in when I bought the case for it. I'm satisfied with it's protection capabilities, but I do wish the dirt and filth of life wouldn't stick so hard to the case.
5	1381017600	This case is super easy to put on your phone.  All buttons work easily with the case on. I like the case because it makes it easier to grip my slippery Galaxy S3--no more dropping it! I would buy it again.
4	1381017600	Very Good case. Won't survive the apocalypse , but for basic drops it will be fine.Also looks sharp and the price was good.
3	1380931200	I like the case haven't dropped my phone yet don't intend to so not sure how well it protects the phone. It seems very durable and it fits well and snugged on my phone.
5	1380844800	Works great. Durable and easy to put on. It has many colorful styles to choose from. Very good value. I highly recommend it.
5	1380758400	I love it! Just as good if not better than ottorbox. Its light weight and and doesn't feel awkward in your hand
5	1380758400	I liked all 3 of the Galaxy 3 cases I purchased from Amazon, the Ballistic, the Otterbox, & the UAG. It was really nice that B. Buy actually told me where to go for the best quality, selection and price for ALL the items I was shopping for!
5	1380758400	This was one of two items that I purchased and received that I liked.  It was exactly what I expected.
4	1380758400	This case seems to work well. installation took no time at all and just a bit of finagling to get the plastic part right where it's supposed to be. buttons placement seems responsive. the inner squishy layer feels like it could do some decent shock absorption and the hard plastic part seems pretty tough too. the hard plastics part only goes around the sides and back of the phone so there's nothing else holding down the top and bottoms of the silicon layer and the plastic part separates ever so slightly from the silicon at its top and bottom. i suppose this could cause it to get pulled off when being pulled out of a pocket if you wear really skinny jeans, but i'm not too concerned.one slight annoyance for me is that the silicon layer extends further over the corners blocks some of the area near the back button and now my thumbs collide with it instead of just hitting the power button but i guess that's the cost of safety.
5	1380758400	i love it! dropped my phone and it just bounced with damages to my phone. i should of gotten another one in a different color
5	1380672000	Was not just a flimsy piece of plastic-- hard and sturdy and the color is really great.  Fit my phone great.
5	1380672000	I drop my phone all the time and so far so good. My husband has the otter box and he is thinking about getting my case.
4	1380672000	This is a really great case for my phone. Durable and looks really nice. I would recommend this to anyone.
5	1380672000	Love this case. Makes the phone look stronger and I feel more official with it. :) Color is great too since the phone actually is blue.
5	1380672000	Perfect cover for my phone...I will recomend it for all my friends.I love the color and the quality. Thank u.
5	1380672000	I purchaced the pink and black color.  So cute.  Not too bulky, fits great into my pocket.  Does a great job protecting my phone.  The fit on the phone is perfect.
4	1380585600	Very nice, sturdy and very similar to the Outer Box. I will purchase another soon just to have for back up purposes.
5	1380499200	I just received my new Ballistic case today.  It has a slimmer profile than the Otter box I am replacing, which has stretched out in about six months of use to the point that it is no longer functional.  The volume buttons and the power button are much easier to access with the Ballistic case.  This case is reversed from the way the Otter box case is made, with the harder case on the outside.  I like this not only because it should keep the softer part of the case from stretching, but it doesn't provide as much resistance when trying to slide it into my pocket.All in all, both cases provide good protection for the phone.  I wasn't happy with the lack of longevity of the Otter box, but I drop my phone a lot and it is still working like new so it has served its purpose.  The Ballistic case doesn't have anything protecting the screen, but the screen protection on the Otter box makes the screen a little less sensitive.  I obviously can't testify to the longevity of this case, but I am extremely happy with the functionality and the price of the Ballistic.
5	1380499200	I am constantly on the search for a case that provides protection and style for my Galaxy S3. This case seems  to be a good blend of both.When looking for multi layer protection there are really three names I keep hearing, OtterBox, Incepio, and Ballistic. The OtterBox line is out for me because they are just too big and bulky to function for me. Incepio are slim, but occasionally I wonder just how well  they really do protect the phone. This case  is thick and well built offering assurance of protection, but isn't so big that I lose the beauty of my phone.It fits fantastic on my phone. It feels very strong and secure with even the plastic feeling strong. The extra padding in the corners is not entirely what I was expecting, but it does a lot to improve the quality of the case. The only problem I've had is that it takes some care to get the plastic back on over the buttons, but that does not diminish the case in any way. I am very happy with the case and would for sure recommend this to a friend .
4	1380326400	The cover looks like it is built very well.  Only thing I don't like is how most of the phone feels kind of slick due to the hard plastic which covers up most of the phone.  The only area where it feels like you have a good hold of it is around the buttons which are made of rubber material.  Overall it is a good case to keep the phone well protected.
5	1380240000	Love it! ordered another one that was total crap. threw it in the garbage. this one totally met my expectations! thank-you
5	1380153600	Just like I thought. Love the pink color. Arrived quickly. Sits on table without the screen touching the table. Thanks
5	1380153600	So far it has kept my wife's phone from breaking any more than it had before getting case. I do not know if the color has anything to do with that fact. perhaps
5	1380153600	I bought this for myself. I am very happy with this product, was reasonably priced and will definitely buy from again.
5	1380153600	Very cheap compared to retail stores and it works great!! I'm glad I made this purchase through this web site.
5	1380067200	This case looks great and fits perfectly. I like how it's not too bulky and the buttons are easy to press. It arrived two days before the expected delivery date. Thank you!
5	1380067200	The first case I got for my s3 was the otter. I thought it was ok and it certainly protected my phone from numerous drops, scratches and misc. liquid spills (I am very hard on my phones). But every time I went to clean the inside of the case (it collected a lot of dust under the screen cover), it broke a little. Finally I got fed up with how difficult it was to take on and off and went shopping for a new case. The balisstic is what I ended up with. I love love love it. It is SO much easier to deal with than the otter. The buttons aren't stiff and it is easy to take on and off. It doesn't come with a screen protector of course, but I got one of those cheap enough elsewhere.
4	1380067200	REALLY LIKE THIS CASE.  IT'S PRETTY DURABLE  AND I  NEED A CASE THAT CAN SURVIVE IN MY PLACE OF WORK.  THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS CASE IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE CLOSING TO THE EARPHONES  OR CHARGER  AREA.  WHICH DUST CAN EASILY GET INTO.  OTHER THAN THAT I  LIKE THE CASE
5	1379980800	Great buy would recommend to others. Cost was very reasonable and my daughter loves it. Will order more in various colors
4	1379980800	Good Case that fits the Galaxy III well.  It's affordable and looks good on my wifes phone.  Haven't had it for long, but it seems like it will hold up well.
5	1379980800	The case fits great and looks good. I carry in in my purse most of the time and I ended up getting an additional case that protected the front screen. I kept the Ballistic case on because I liked how it looked and the phone is still safe when I have it out of the leather case. I haven't dropped the phone so I can not comment on the impact resistance. I do like that I can place it upside down on my desk without the screen contacting the desk.
4	1379980800	I've already dropped my phone once after using this. It was not damaged in the drop. I'm happy it's protected my phone
5	1379980800	Works very well in protecting the phone. Seems high quality. 2 pc cover. Inside piece is a gel & outer side is hard plastic. It is raised about a 1/4 inch past the glass. I would buy this product again!
4	1379980800	Got my case today. One review I read said it would take a few minutes to install, but I installed in seconds. It was much better than I was expecting and fits my phone just right. I bought this case to protect my replaced phone after dropping and shattering the screen on my other Galaxy S3 (lesson learned, BUY the case!). Definitely pleased with my purchase except that I would have wished for more color choices such as red and black, but then again I was purchasing it for the protection abilities more than anything.
4	1379894400	Great cover...fits really good ...depth on screen mighr be a little harder to touch for larger hand people ....love the hard back
5	1379894400	This protective case is perfect--easy to put on your Galaxy SIII phone, not too bulky, and the rubberized grips give you a secure hold. The pink color is accurately displayed, but wished there were more color options.
4	1379894400	The 2 piece design keeps the case in place and beefed up corners offers extra protection to the phone.  I reccomend this to any owner of this phone.
5	1379894400	The case fits like it should and looks really great.  Should give good protection in case of being dropped. Happy.
5	1379894400	I've had other cases for other phones in the past.  This one seems to be a better quality.  Also, it doesn't stick inside my pocket as bad as some of the other cases.  The buttons are not hard to press nor does it block any of the screen.
5	1379894400	I LOVE THE BALISITIC PHONE CASE... YOU CAN NOT HAVE THIS PHONE WITHOUT SOME KIND OF CASE FOR PROTECTION.  I LOVE MY PHONE TOO  MUCH TO LET IT FALL TO ITS DEATH.
5	1379894400	Fits my phone perfectly and I just love this product. Have tried several others, but this one is the best for my phone. Protects it all the way round!
4	1379808000	This case is very easy to use. I love the fact that it protects me from accidentally pressing buttons I did not intend to ust.
5	1379808000	This Ballistic Case for my Galaxy SIII is perfect!!  Would highly recommend this product.  Love the color and the durability!!
5	1379808000	Great case for my Samsung Galaxy III.  Protects the phone well and is not too bulky. Nice color too.  Would recommend to others.
5	1379808000	The Ballistic Case has two parts, a soft shell that covers the back and all edges, then a hard shell that covers the back.  Looks great and is very sturdy and is a great phone protector.
1	1379808000	First item arrive over a week late of promise date. Case has a off fitting/silicon case do not fit well with plastic case. Waste of money buy otterbox
5	1379808000	The price was in the price range I was willing to pay.  Color is great.  Fit is comfortable in my hands.
5	1379721600	This is my third Ballistic case (two Galxy S2, one S3).  I haven't had a problem with any of them.  They fit snug; I haven't had any problems with the hard plastic slipping off, and they come out of my pocket with little effort.I've thrown two Otterbox cases in the trash.  Never again.My wife has dropped her phone more times than she can count and this case has protected it every time.  That's good enough for me.
5	1379721600	This case is just what I needed. While it protects my phone it is not bulky. If your looking for a great case look no further!
4	1379721600	I got a cool blue case to match my cool blue laptop cover. Really though, I have gotten so many compliments on this case and it is heavy duty. I have dropped and thrown my phone plenty of times and it is retrievable without damage. Plus on the phone it looks high-tech but a little bulky because of the layering. All in all great!
5	1379721600	Love this case!  Works great.  I  feel safer handling my phone now.  The color is nice too. Wish  it was in more colors.
5	1379548800	I knew the odds were good I'd drop my phone at some point and so a case was needed.  The problem was, lots of the case reviews were by men and extolled the &#34;armored&#34; look or the &#34;futuristic&#34; look of various cases.  I wanted something that would protect my phone but still look attractive and not appear overly masculine. This case is it!  I first installed a screen protector film.  I then put on my new case - it went on with absolutely no trouble and the small lip that surrounds the phone screen is enough to hide the small gap between my screen saver and the phone's frame.  What a nice finished look!  It adds minimal bulk to the phone and provides a good grip.  I can't attest to its protection if I drop my phone as I haven't had an accident yet, but it looks like it will do the trick just fine.
4	1379548800	I have been anti-cover for a very long time. But I'm apparently too clutzy to remain so. I destroyed one phone and decided to protect my second one. This is a great cover, adds a pop of color and isn't as bulky as some of the other ones (it still won't fit in my nifty phone pocket on my purse) but the phone is at least protected. I feel a little better about letting my kids get a hold of it. It really does just bounce on the ground and keep going. It's perfect for those like me who can't seem to handle answering the phone without a fumble or two.
4	1379548800	I have had this phone case for about 6 months now and it is sturdy. It definitely shielded my phone from the many bumps and drops. Durable case for a person like me :-) The color I got was more of a mauve.
5	1379462400	I have dropped my galaxy s3 about 8 times while having this case on. The Ballistic took the hit every time,  leaving my phone in great condition still. The color is kind of cute too. I am glad I bought this instead of the OtterrBox.
5	1379462400	Love it meets all my expectations. Would recommend it to friends. Quality very good and durable.  Going to order another one.
5	1379462400	I LIKE THIS VERY MUCH.  HAVE NOT HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH IT AT ALL.  EASY TO PUT ON AND PROTECTS IT GREAT.
3	1379462400	decent product... the more you mess with the case the more flimsy it becomes. my wife has had hers for only 2-3 months and it's already falling off. cool design, but this has a 6-12 month life span... not worth the money. GET AN OTTERBOX!!
4	1379462400	So far so good . It fits my samsung galexy 3 very well. It was easy to put on. The phone appears to be held in place tightly . It's not really bulky which I was afraid of . My husband has an otter box which is very bulky , at least that my opinion. The on off button on the right and the volumn button line up nicely and are not hard to work at all which I'm happy about . The only thing so far that I'm not thrilled with is my color choice . I bought the deep wine color . To me it's more dark and light pink . I should have went with blue lol . But for right now I'm extremely happy with the case I will update if need be.
4	1379462400	This is a great product, not a as bulky as I had anticipated. Definitely worth the price. You rock amazon
5	1379376000	This case is great protects against drops and bumps! totally love the color combination!! I did an excellent purchase! thumbs up! :D
5	1379376000	This is a great product. I love the color and it fits like a glove on my Samsung Galaxy SIII. I believe it will last a long time and was a very good price.
5	1379376000	I would love this case it was easy to put on an easy to take off. it is very durable. it came on time. I am happy with it, it was my first ballistics case and I will continue to buy them.
5	1379203200	This product is much better then the cover I was sold at Verizon. The black grip makes the phone easy to hold and I feel as though it is protected.
4	1379203200	Great cover for my S3 that has withstood several drops and the constant abuse of being in my back pocket all day long.
5	1379203200	The package arrived on schedule as is usually the case with Amazon shipments.The case is a snap to attach to the phone and it fits snugly.  Even though covered by the protective sides of the case, the on/off switch works quite smoothly.The price is right, the color options are OK and the case does provide adequate protection when the phone is dropped from a height of 3 feet (I've already "tested" this having accidentally knocked it off my desk a few times).
5	1379030400	Does not have a screen protector, but seems to be a good case.  We've had it for several months and it's holding up better than my otterbox.
5	1379030400	I bought this to have a little heavier duty case to protect the phone while hiking.  It's too bulky for everyday use, at least for my small hands and personal tastes, but it is exactly what I was looking for.  Great fit, looks much better than Otterbox, and the extra hard cover on the outside makes it feel more heavy duty and secure.  A few more color selections might be nice, but I'm a hot pink-and-black fan so it works for me.  Overall, a good pick for someone who likes the idea of an Otterbox but not the price or ugliness.
5	1378944000	Easy on and off, comfy grip, doesn't obstruct camera view, mic, or speaker. Attractive styling and vibrant color. Still leaves room for a headphone jack charm
5	1378857600	I purchased this case for a Straight Talk phone.  When I received the phone, I discovered it was set for the Sprint network...there is NO to very little coverage here on that network, so I returned the phone back to Straight Talk.The case appears to be very durable and would do well to protect a Galaxy S-3 or S-4 phone.
5	1378857600	I've dropped my phone a few times with this case & no damage has been done to my phone. Well worth it!!!
5	1378771200	This product is much more durable than the Otterbox Defender I first bought for my Galaxy S3.  I should have purchased it to begin with and I'm sorry that I didn't.  I will never purchase another Otterbox.  It was a waste of money!  I love this case!
5	1378771200	Gave it to my husband as a gift and he has really loved the case.  I liked the color choice!
5	1378684800	I haven't had any issues with this case, and have already done a little QA testing on it with a few drops and it's handled them like a champ. I have other people pick it up to look at it and tell me it's quite light compared to their cases, and less bulky.  For me personally, it compares to Otterbox brand, but with a much nicer price point.
5	1378684800	This is a great product.  There is no reason to pay full price for this, so happy to have found it on Amazon.  Very durable and a great color.
5	1378684800	Fits perfect! Very happy! Shipment was very fast. Dropped it a few times and phone was well secured. Saved my phone from any damage.
5	1378598400	My new phone case is perfect!  It makes grabbing my phone from my purse very easy and looks great too!
5	1378598400	This is the first protective case i bought for my S3. I hadn't previously bought anything other than slim fit cases because I hate not being able to fit my phone in my pocket or having it look as sleek, but I am very happy with this case so far! It feels very sturdy and I know my phone would be protected if it were to drop. I really like that when face down, the screen doesn't touch the table/would not hit the ground. Plus it still fits in my pocket and looks nice!Also, the other reviews were correct about the side buttons being easy to push, its no harder to use them than if there were no case over them! The rubber corners aren't as bulky as they may look, either.
5	1378598400	Love it! Study and yet light weight.  Stays on the phone well.  I'm looking for another one in a different color now. Received delivery as promised.
5	1378598400	I use to have a defender otter box and the rubber started ripping where I was putting itnin my pocket. So I ordered the ballistic and it has a hard back and slides in my pocket with ease. It also protects the bavk of the phone and when you drop the phone. The only thing I don't like is that it didn't have a screen protector with it but I have my own screen protector.
1	1378512000	DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!!!! When I received it, it looked awesome and EXACTLY what I needed cuz unfortunately  I drop my phone WWAAAYYYY  too often. But upon applying the case the plastic piece doesn't fit and keeps falling off. U apply the rubber casing then the plastic casing. well the plastic piece is too small. it's  really unfortunate cuz I really like this case and is exactly what I needed. but it's garbage. If the plastic casing piece fit I would rate this a ten plus. Please people do not waste your money. Can't wait to be able to send this stupid thing back and get my money. I don't understand  why when this product had such  strong reviews when it doesn't fit the right way on my phone. and I kno  I'm not doing anything wrong  since I was one of the 1st  people to have a smartphone and have went thru many diff phones and many diff cases. So unfortunate. I'm very disappointed.  And  EXTREMELY aggravated  over this situation. I  love buying  online in the privacy  of my own home and do it quite often I probably make about 5-10 purchases a  month  online.  But sometimes buying things in real life r better cuz then things like this wouldn't happen.
5	1378512000	It's easy to get on and not bulky but still protects my phone from my 3yr old. I love it!!!
1	1378512000	I sure missed on this one. The cover will not even stay on the phone. Very cheap made. I could get just as good protection with one of the cheap skins. Did not even come with a face protector.
5	1378512000	This is my first ballistic case. Im in love with it. It is simple but effective! I plan to buy more in the future.
4	1378425600	It  is a good cover but it is a little heavy. It seems to protect the screen with out covering it up.
5	1378425600	The case fits like a glove and doesn't gap open, like previous ones had done.  The grip is nice, even though her hands are small.  The feel of the case is nice too, it feels like quality and not like a &#34;Below $5&#34; item...  I am really happy with it thus far, our Otter Box did not even last a year until it started tearing, I think this one will last longer.
4	1378425600	This cover is a 100% better than the Otterbox. There's two covers. The inside cover, which is rubber, goes on nicely leaving enough space for headphones and charging. The outside cover goes on perfectly. I only have to line it up where the volume is and the other side clicks on. It's better than the Otterbox for this reason. The otterbox requires you line up both sides, which is hard to put on and take off easily and turns off the phone with the slightest touch. With the Ballistic, it's easy to put on and take off and my phone doesn't turn off easily. It also protects my phone. I just wish it wasn't $17.
5	1378339200	I went from an OtterBox to this, and I could not be happier! I did get myself screen protectors, since it did not have those, but it was totally worth it! Just as much protection, but so much slimmer! I've dropped it a few times, nothing serious, and have not had a problem. Highly recommended!
5	1378339200	This order came quickly and it was perfect! I am in love with this case and I wouldn't change my mind about getting it
5	1378252800	Exactly as described and my daughter hasn't figured out how to take it off my phone, so we're good to go!
2	1378252800	This seems to be a really awesome, heavy duty phone case, however, this does come in 2 pieces and the plastic piece that goes on the back does not stay on around the rubber. I'm not sure if there are just certain ones that are defective like this since I've seen similar reviews to mine, but others seem to have success with it. I was really looking forward to this case, too bad it doesn't fit properly :-\
5	1378252800	Great product. Love this it wo rks out great forme. I don't have to worry if I drop. My phone
5	1378252800	Bought this item for my wife. She has a habit of dropping her phone and needed a tough case. I have the same phone but I have an otterbox defender case for mine, she thought the otterbox was too bulky and inhibits screen usage. (I don't have that problem, but we agreed to disagree) She likes how the ballistic case protects the phone while still allowing the user to use the whole surface of the touch screen. She also wanted it in hot pink, to differentiate our two phones more easily.One suggestion I will make; be sure to purchase screen protectors to use with this case because it does nothing to protect the actual screen surface.
5	1378166400	Very Strong and workable case. the buttons are easy to push. and the case is out of the way of using the phone
5	1378166400	I love this cover. It gives me more to grip when handling my phone and when it accidentally drops to the ground, I don't worry about my phone breaking. Great case!!!
5	1378166400	this is a great case...easy to put on, durable, no problem with any control buttons, protects phone well..does not mess u[ my screen protector like my last on did. Great value.
5	1378080000	I scored a home run with this as a gift for my wife when we upgraded the phones.  It's her color and it gives the phone a great look and superior protection.So far no high-altitude drop tests, but from a couple feet up, no problem.
4	1378080000	Works well, easy to apply. I really like it and it looks good too. Only issue is it keeps disturbing my screen protector
5	1378080000	It was easy to put on my new Samsung S3 phone.  I thought I would be overwhelmed by the pink color but it wasn't too overwhelming and it protects my phone they way it needs to protected.
5	1377993600	Odered the Zek case first & sent back. The gel case was to soft & pliable, plus the hard case that went over knocked off the power button tab on case..This ballistic case has the perfect balance in softness & hardness in the gel. It fits the phone like a glove. Plus the hard case doesn't go over the power button, but the gel part actually by covering the power button makes it more funtional. Believe it or not that was bumming me out about going from the Galaxy 2, to the 3 was the placement of the power button. I couldn't use it easily, however the gel makes it protrude, so it's easy to find & work(promblem solved!) Need I mention the blue, I'm a total every blue color fanatic, the 2 colors pop. This case was made exactly for the phone, no wonder a ton of them have been sold on here.
5	1377907200	This case is sturdy and beautiful.  It fits just right and there is no problem with pushing any buttons. It slides into my purse easily.
5	1377907200	Great product you'll just need a screen protector now. It was about $13 plus FREE shipping and I do recommend others to buy this product if you don't need a SCREEN PROTECTOR IMMEDIATLY.
5	1377820800	Case is affordable and very protective; the color helps me locate it quickly in my purse. Corners are adequately "rubberized" and have already saved my phone ...I'm a li'l klutzy...definitely need this case!
5	1377820800	Great product. It fits my S3 perfectly and looks great too! I would recommend this line of products to anyone and everyone.  I like it much better than my husband's Otterbox.
5	1377820800	its a really good case. I had otterbox, which fell apart after awhile. I love balistic, except my screen isnt protected much. but I've dropped my pgone afew times. & its fine.
5	1377820800	So far its been a good case. I would like it if it protected my screen too. I love the colors of it and style. I dropped my phone once and it didn't mess it up.
5	1377734400	Bought as a gift for my daughter who is notorious for dropping her phone.  the surface is rubbery enough that her phone does not slip out of her hand, and if it does has enough cushion to protect the phone
5	1377734400	Has firm grip and outer cover does not gets removedAlso, my son did couple of drop test and it survived :)
5	1377648000	I received my Ballistic Shell Gel SG Cover and I am so very pleased with it!  I don't have a complaint!  I ordered it in the Cobalt Blue (beautiful color)!  It is well made, and fits my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) as good as it can get!  It provides a lot of protection, is not gommy (sp)!  Everything lines up perfectly, There is no problem with using any of the the touch buttons, volume controls, on/off switches at all.  The case feels real good in my hands, and makes me feel very secure with holding and using my phone! I don't feel there is any more bulk than most covers that provide any level of protection!  No problem charging my phone at all!  I was trying to decide between the commuter and the ballistic, and decided to go with the ballistic, I am sooo happy I did!  I have no complaints whatsoever!  Love it!  Thank you for this great product!  It came quickly (2 days) and was well packaged!  I rate it a 5+!!I forgot to state that putting the cover on and taking if off was really easy, follow the simple directions and presto, on and off!  But yet, it is secure and there is no way it will slip off!
5	1377561600	looks great and feels really good in hand and slides into pocket..fantastic product..would highly reccommend to my friends and family..thx paul
5	1377561600	This products is great, it is exactly as it was described. Its better than any other case I've ever owned.
4	1377561600	I must admit I was nervous as to the durability and quality of this product, this is a great product I have been using it for a month and I cannot give it 5 stars as I have not dropped my phone so I have not been able to see if this case will protect the screen from cracking and that was the purpose of this purchase. The ordering was easy and quick. I have always been happy with Amazon.
5	1377561600	very good, protects well, designed well, i would recomend this product to anyone that drops their cell phone a lot.
5	1377561600	The Ballistic cover has a sleeker slimmer profile than an Otter case. The Ballistic has more convenient access to home and back buttons with includes uncovered openings for headphones and phone charger. Overall, the Ballistic cover sports a much better design and it&#8217;s less expensive than the Otter covers. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.
5	1377561600	Everyone complements me on this case.  Very protected now. Combo. of gel/hard outer shell makes my phone feel indestructible.  Thanks!!
5	1377475200	seriously, this case has saved my life (ok, not literally but it is awesome). My ex bf had dropped my phone and shattered the screen, so i was forced to buy a new phone and search for the best case, and thankfully i found this. Ive dropped it several times and it just kind of..bounces... haha its great!
2	1377475200	I purchased this case when I bought my new phone. I have dropped my phone a few times and it was fine. Then today, my one-year-old knocked my phone off the couch onto the hardwood floor (approximately 12 inch drop) and the screen completely shattered. I don't know if it was the perfect angle or what but I am not happy. Maybe the case is not meant to protect the screen so this could be a misunderstanding on my part.
5	1377388800	We bought both an OtterBox and a Ballistic, and Ballistic wins ... easier to push buttons than on the OtterBox.  Sturdy.
5	1377388800	Don't dislike anything about it yet...I've dropped it a few times already and it's no worse for the wear!  I haven't tried to take it off and put it back on at this point, so I don't know about the ease of that as mentioned in other reviews, however I do very much like the look and feel of this case. I would definitely recommend!  A good case at a great price!
5	1377388800	Thia waa a gift for someone who need a case.Bad they love it and keep thanking me for it so i would buy it again
4	1377302400	I enjoy this case very much. It's a little bulky, but not too bad. It's also not quite as pink as it looks online, which was a plus for me. The 'dark wine' color matches the purple of the Samsung Galaxy SIII that I have perfectly.
5	1377302400	As described, works perfect with my phone!!!! Would recommend friends to buy this cover!! Worth trying and good price too.
5	1377216000	Wife is loving the bright casing color. Depth of the casing is a little deeper than UAG Model for S3.
5	1377129600	great protection and easy to install on Galaxy- much better than the one I paid more money for at Verizon
5	1377129600	It's child proof, my 2 year old drags my wifes phone all over the place and drops it constantly, no complaints, works awesome!
4	1377129600	Just received this product a week ago and it is working out well so far. Nice snug fit, side buttons work great with the case, and it has nice colors. I am very good with my phone, but having a durable case is important if I ever drop it. It looks cool too and has a good price.
5	1377043200	I have already dropped my phone twice and you can't even tell.  This has more than paid for itself already, not that it even cost that much!  I enjoy being able to locate it quickly, as well - the color is vibrant.  Glad they make cases for people like me!
5	1377043200	Loved the color although my daughter would have preferred it in camo. It has already saved her phone! Thank you for quality product at low cost.
5	1376956800	I had a ballistic for my HTC phone and loved it, so when I got an SIII, I went for a Ballistic again.  The case fits my phone perfectly!  I had no issues getting it on or off, or fitting the controls.  I've already dropped my new phone a few times, and the case just bounces the phone without any damage.  I just wish there were more color and pattern choices!  The blue is just as bright blue as the picture, which is a bit too much for me, but I'm sticking with it because I know my phone is protected.
5	1376956800	protects my samsung galaxy III just like I had wanted.  Dropped it a few times already and no probelms with it
5	1376956800	Safe case for drops and stylish too. Recommend it for anyone that does not want their expensive phone broken from a drop.
5	1376956800	The color is real nice it fits good on the phone. Not bulky but definitely not as protective as other cases.  Good buy
5	1376956800	This isn't for me, but, I looked at it and I can tell it's well built, makes the phone a little bulky, but, not a whole lot.  It does provide a nice cushion for the phone to be covered as the 4 corners is nicely padded.  Even the rubber itself has a nice feel and it doesn't feel slippery at all like the silicone case.Others have said that this is a better one than the more expensive cases out there.  I can agree that it's good.
5	1376956800	good quality, thankyou, I would purchase for a gift, thankyou so much. I really like the colors also.Price was a little high
5	1376956800	This case fits great.  Sometimes the power button sticks but not enough to really be an issue.  It looks nice and it shipped fast.
4	1376956800	I really like my case. It is comfortable in my hand and the buttons are easy to use. I have a considerable amount of confidence while I am talking and using my Samsung Galaxy SIII phone now! Without the case I was fearful holding my phone, the phone is rather thin and not that easy to manage. With the case I have a better grip on my phone. I already dropped my phone while it was in the case, and it was not damaged in any way! The case is great for protection and comfort. I gave 4 stars cause I wish I could've had a better choice in colors, other than that the case works well!
5	1376956800	I found it just to my likeing and very durable and the color I wanted. I'ts good to have a company that you know you can almost be assured of having what your looking for.
5	1376870400	This Ballistic case is a great buy! The buttons are still easy to use with the armor covering them. Great hard shell attachment over a silicone/rubber piece. This 2 piece set provides great protection for a fraction of the other name brands out there! I will definitely be adding more colors to my collection from this great seller! :)
5	1376870400	I love this cover! Not only is it pretty but it has saved my phone on more than one occasion! Great product! I've had it for awhile now and it's still doing great!!
5	1376870400	This case looks nice, like the larger rubberized corner protection. The two part case with inner rubber sleeve and outer hard shell is a nice combo. My phone feels secure in this case.
4	1376697600	I love it, I was expecting the color to be a little darker & brighter like the picture; but its still cute.&#9825;&#9829;&#9825;
5	1376697600	Very good product. Love the color combination. this product provides very good protection for my phone. I have droppedmy phone since having this product and was very pleased with the results.
3	1376611200	The case itself was rubber and has protected my phone adequately.  I had to spend another $17 on a screen protector, however.  It would have been just as cost effective to buy an otter box, which comes with a screen protector, and is a better quality product (my last phone had an otter box and was dropped repeatedly on cement, etc, with no problems).  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't waste my time and money on this product - I'd go straight for the Otter Box.
2	1376611200	When ordered I thought this product came with a screen protector. However, when it arrived it did not have one. I did not like not having protection for the screen on my phone. The product description should state there is no screen protector.
5	1376611200	It fits my galaxy 111 perfectly.  Not bulky at all.  I just wanted to protect my phone and this is perfect.
5	1376611200	I am very satisfied with this product. The metallic back cover to back up the rubber case is most extraordinary and the cushion is good.
5	1376611200	Perfect fit, loved the color, gel sides brace for impact in a very efficient way, feels secure and fits in pockets nicely.
5	1376524800	I had ordered the Otterbox (I should have read the reviews first). Needless to say, I had to send it back due to poor design on Otterbox's part. This fits like an Otterbox but you don't have to put your finger through the case and phone to access the volume and power buttons. And it's much easier to get on the phone unlike the Otterbox. It does have the soft cover with the hard shell that snaps over the soft cover just like the Otterbox. AND it's not big and bulky, it does add a little weight to the phone but not much.I had read some other reviews stating they wished it had port covers for the headphone & charging port. That doesn't bother me, I can live without them. At least I can access the power & volume buttons!!
1	1376524800	I am very disappointed with this product! I read many reviews before purchasing and a lot of people compared this to the Otter Box. There is no comparison, there is nothing to protect the front of your phone! Waist of money, I should have bought another Otter Box!!!
5	1376524800	This appears to be a really good case and it was very simple to install.  It also looks really nice.
5	1376438400	Rubber around the phone. The hard case was easy to snap on.  Believe this will protect my phone in case of accidental droppage!
4	1376352000	This is a good cover- it has protected my phone from numerous drops. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it traps heat pretty well, which means if you're charging and watching a movie the phone gets pretty hot pretty fast. I've resorted to removing the case  in those instances. Otherwise, solid product.
5	1376352000	Fits very well, although the gel part does seem like it could stretch out over time, especially if you take it off and on like I do.
3	1376352000	too bulky and heavyit's odd pink, not burgundyloose at the edgecut outs  fit buttons wellhave not undergone drop test
5	1376265600	I was very satisfied with the product.  it is a very durable product and the color was very vibrant.  thanks for being fast and accurate.
5	1376265600	This is a great case protective case and it shipped really fast and is nice and slim. would def recommend this product
5	1376265600	I had tried the otter box before but it cracked, this case is great, it slides in your pocket better it just has a better feel about it and was easy to get off and on! My husband also got one for his HTC evo 4g and it works great as well very pleased.
5	1376092800	My girlfriend loves her case. We thouthought it might suck but its awesome. I like the feel of it and want to buy another one but in a different color.
4	1376092800	I like ballistic cases. I have one for my iPhone and it works great. I figured I must get one for my daughters new galaxy. It doesn't seem to protect as much as the iPhone case, but I wouldn't buy any other case. Great deal on amazon. Less than half the price as the cell stored sell them for!
5	1376092800	The case is very strong and buttons are very easy to press. It has protected the screen from a couple of falls, I recommend this item to anyone.
5	1376092800	Exactly what I expected when on to the phone easily and stays on well. Worth the investment for my phone.
5	1376006400	I loved how quick the shipping was! The case sits perfectly on my phone and gives it a strong and bold look. Overall im extremely happy with this purchase and will order more in different colors.
5	1376006400	The item is great I would give it a ten I use it on my galaxy S111 and it looks great I would buy more
5	1376006400	this case is awesome!!! I drop my phone ALL THE TIME, and today, I dropped it on my driveway. it literally bounced and rolled--no cracked screen!
5	1375833600	I was looking for an alternative to an OtterBox for my fiance's phone. I am very happy with this case - it's easy to get on and off, clean, buttons are easy to push and all slots are accounted for. Anyone looking for a beast of a case (or are a chronic phone-dropper) - forget OB, go Ballistic!
5	1375747200	This case is rubber with a plastic frame to hold the rubber on.  It's got a snazzy look to it.  It's also more sleek than the otter box.  A friend of mine had the same exact phone with an otter box, and my was noticeably thinner.  The combination of the rubber and the thickness make it easy to grip.
5	1375747200	love it so glad i went with the ballistic over the otterbox  , great cover not to bulky and protect my phone
5	1375747200	Little difficult to put on phone but not bad. great support for your phone. Looks great on my galaxy! Would buy again.
5	1375660800	The case is a good fit and it is a strong case.  All buttons can be accessed.  Great price and I recommend it.
5	1375660800	Miss the beauty of the slim white design but in all honesty you cannot hold onto it too well especially to answer in the car.  Cute case and protective but not too bulky.
4	1375660800	And it is a neat color.  It would be nice if it was thinner, but then would not provide as much protection.  So yes, good choice.
1	1375574400	It does stay together properly at all I don't even use it anymore it was just useless need to better your products to fit correctly
5	1375574400	I hardly ever take my phone out of this case.It makes the buttons a lot more prominent for easy access and doesn't interfere with any functions or charging.
5	1375574400	Very durable exactly as described. Super fast shipping!! If you like the otter box but not the price, this would be a great option!
5	1375488000	I was looking for a phone case for my Samsung Galaxy and was convinced into buying this one due to consistent positive reviews and the price it was offered in. It fits on my phone perfectly and I feel like it's snug and secure. I also have a screen protector and the case doesn't interfere with it. The buttons are easy to press. The case is bulky and the gel part creates friction, so sliding it in and out of things will require a little more effort. I recommend it completely if you're looking for a Samsung Galaxy phone case.
4	1375488000	These cover has great colors, and fit's well, alought the soft plastic seems a little flimsy, and may not last all that long, but it's ok for now.  I bought this hoping the back was non slip, super rubbery, but it's not very rubber, not like the Otter case my husband has. Oh well, it will do for now, but if you are looking for something non-slip, this isn't really it.
5	1375488000	This is a very lightweight, two-piece cell phone case that takes 5 seconds for even me, a self-described "ordinary housewife" to install.  It does add a bit of weight and dimension, but if you want true protection and not just "bling", you need to compromise.  The only thing I wished it had were covers for the USB/headphone plugs, but it was pretty clear from the description that it did NOT have them, and I was willing to give those up in exchange for light weight/less cumbersome.  All in all, a great case at a great price.
5	1375488000	The case does add a bit of bulk, however the grips on the sides give you a better handle on the phone. I bought it after I dropped my s3 and broke the screen. I just dropped it about 5 feet onto tile and (on accident) and everything is fine. Great investment!
5	1375401600	I LOVE this case.  I've had it for a while now, it went on my phone right when I removed the phone from the box, and thank you lord!  I cannot tell you how many times I have dropped my phone.  Into an (empty) ceramic sink, onto concrete, falls off the couch, off my lap, whatever... and in this case, the phone just kind of bounces a little and comes to a rest unscathed.  Naturally if you drop it face down on something with a protrusion, the screen will be cracked.  But your basic slips and fumbles, this case is great.As far as the &#34;feel&#34;  The phone does seem heavier than when its &#34;naked&#34; but to me the lightweight feel meant fragile.  This feels sturdy.  It doesn't get in the way until I'm playing Draw Something... its a little hard to get to the far edges, but it doesn't get in the way when I'm texting.
5	1375315200	Very good case! I will be recommending this to everyone!!! It is easy to put on, has a nice feel to it and it also looks cute!!! Wish I would have gotten it sooner!!
5	1375228800	Probably the best case I have ever bought in my life!  Not only is it pretty, it is beyond sturdy and truly fits like a glove. I do not have the sensation of holding a brick or anything.  LOVE IT!
5	1375228800	My wife love feel, color with her new samsung galaxy 3. She didn t have a case for her last phone oops.
5	1375142400	Easy to install.  Looks like good protection.  I also bought the Otter Commuter which I like for a more professional look and very great fit.
5	1375142400	Love this case and the color.  Very cute!  Fits my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly and although it does add a bit of bulk it protects like a pro!
4	1375142400	Not as bright pink at the picture would lead to believe but still a nice hot pink and black case - over time however because of the cheaper material used the bottom layer of rubber stretches out and covers things that shouldn't be covered.  Was a great case for the first few months.. but isn't meant for the long haul.
5	1375142400	so far I am very happy with this case.  It makes my phone much easier to hold, I don't have any problems accessing any of the features on my phone.  I would recommend this case.
5	1375142400	I'm kinda clumsy and drop things alot...so when I first got this phone I was very worried.  This case protects the phone perfectly!  I have dropped it (only a few times) on a tile floor with no damage.
5	1375056000	I'm a girl who is very rough on her phones and I like expensive models so a good case is necessary for me. Purchased this some time ago just because it was reasonably priced and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality , I take it off a lot to switch batteries and it shows no signs of wear or tear. Would buy again
4	1375056000	in all honesty i both the ballistic and otter box cases for my mew phone. i should preface this by saying i'm a klutz's klutz. thus far the ballistic case is my preferred choice. the phone itself is slim so when you put on the case it gives it girth and weight. the rubber grips make it comfortable to hold and doesn't cramp your hands. great case can withstand the light falls thus far *knocks on wood*
5	1375056000	It fit my cell and very nicely it has protected it very well protected. The color is pretty. Nice for girls.
5	1375056000	This is a great case. It is easy to put on and take off, but gives me great protection and grip. It does add a bit to the bulk of the phone, but because of the way it is shaped, it makes it easier to hold, in my opinion. I accidentally dropped the phone face down on a concrete floor 2 days after getting the case and had no problems with the phone. I would definitely recommend this case!
5	1375056000	Prety legit.  It covers my phone well.  If it didn't I would sue.  I mean, how hard is it to get the dimensions of a telephone correct?  Great job, Ballistic....great job.
5	1374969600	Excellent cover, no more worries for future drops n slams. Cool color n easy touch n hold rubber.Great buy!
5	1374969600	It is awesome, got many compliments on this case and it takes a beaten, yes I have already dropped it,  turned it over and nothing, no cracks, scrapes or bruises.
5	1374883200	I was looking for a great case that protected well. I was not happy with my current case an otterbox so I decided to get this rather than pay for another otterbox. I am extremely happy with this case it protects great and i like the extra corner protection. I also does not make the phone feel bulky like the otterbox did.  I had no trouble with the second part of the case not fitting well. I ordered my case from CELLULAR 5 STAR and it came two sooner than expected.  The price is fair and a good investment.
5	1374883200	Good quality case. Goes on easy. Feels good.. gives phone good grip. Has saved my phone from damage several times! Excellent price from Amazon as well.!!
5	1374883200	I bought my Galaxy S3 about 4 months ago,  and I immediatly bought this case hoping it would work well... and boy is it amazing. It arrived just a few days after I ordered it. Now,  I am very, very, VERY clumsy and I drop my phone A LOT and this case is perfect for me! The case fits perfectly and didn't make the buttons too hard to press. Overall I love this case and would recommend to anyone!
4	1374796800	When I was considering this purchase, I read a review that addressed two different makers. For this one that review said that this product allowed much easier use of the side buttons of the phone. I could not agree more. In fact due to the design, it is mich easier to find them without looking and to  use them with protector on than without.If I had one design change to make it would be to cut away some of the protector that surrounds the touch screen, At least for me, any touch screen button that appears in the upper left corner of the touch screen are a little difficult to use.
5	1374796800	Its just like described, very durable and will def protect the phone. The price is way better than radioshack or walmart so a good buy
4	1374710400	I thought it was going to be thicker with a clear plastic piece to cover the screen like my old Otter Box on my old iphone. Otherwise I love the bright color and general appearance.
5	1374624000	I can see the phone in my dark purse.  The cases are more rugged than I thought.  I also like them because they do not have a smooth finish so the phone doesnt slip so easy
2	1374624000	It isn't specifically made for my Galaxy S4, and its rubber edges make it hard to get in and out of my pockets. I regret the purchase.
5	1374624000	I was relieved to find a ballistic case in my favorite color that wasn't a rip off. Great protection but I recommend taking it off and cleaning out the dirt that gets up underneath it.
5	1374537600	I just installed the case tonight.  Installation was easy and the color of the case is an excellent match to my GalaxySIII color.  The case adds little bulk to the phone and now the phone has a much more solid feel in my hand.  The on-off and volume buttons are still very easy to use and I like the lay-on-table feature of the case. Now the screen will not touch the surface when the phone is laid flat face-down on a table.  I wish the case included a screen protector, but I am very happy with the iSmooth HD Ultra Clear screen protectors that I ordered along with this Ballistic case.  I haven't drop-tested the phone with this new case and I don't plan too.  I think the construction of the case speaks for itself and I think it will provide the protection I was looking for.
4	1374537600	My only beef is the price. I took off one star because I see other cases with similar construction for half the price.
3	1374451200	Good product, prompt shipping. Buyers be aware: IT'S PINK! Actual color has nothing to do with wine, it's light/dark pink, hence minus two stars...
1	1374451200	My husband and I both got new phones at the same time. He got a Trident case and I got this tone. I bought this because it had great ratings. I didn't like it as soon as I took it out of the package. In fact I threw it away a week later after spending all this money on it. I ended up going with a Trident case. The jelly part of this case was too soft the colors were not bright as pictured but more dull and really ugly. I was not satisfied at all.
5	1374451200	Installing is very easy and I like the color. Add a good screen protector and your set. Your phone should stay where ever you put it
4	1374451200	I tried the otter box and the ballistic case. Though I liked the feel of the otter box better it seemed to disrupt my cell phone signal. I live far out in the country and need all the bars I can get so a case that blocks reception is useless. The ballistic case has a nice feel that makes the phone a little bigger and allows a lip when turned face down. The bumper corners aren't too bulky and the side buttons are easy to use
5	1374451200	Awesome some case!  Would definitely buy again when I get a new phone.Great fit and protection for my Galaxy S3!
5	1374451200	it's strong for good protection, easy to use, has good access to controls, I'm going to order another one  for another galaxy III.
5	1374364800	It's great.  On time and fits tight and right.  I feel it will protect my investment if I drop it.  It's not waterproof so I hope it is crash proof....;
5	1374192000	love it!....:) fast shipping..fits my galaxy s3 perfect! about to order a screen protecter!..this should really protect my phone. definitly a great buy
5	1374192000	This case protects my phone real good. I wish the cases were a little cheaper so I could buy more so I could switch up the colors. I've dropped my phone so many times and when I picked it up, no crack, NOTHING! I also love that it is built so that if your phone falls face down, you have protection but you will still need a screen protector
4	1374105600	The case arrived within the week of ordering.  It is sturdy and will protect my phone. Cheaper than Otter cases and just as good. Good purchase.
5	1374105600	I've had this case for a few months and love it.  It hasn't discolored or lost it's shape.  I have a toddler and he has done any damage to it. Love it
3	1374105600	Great case, good price. I felt that the design on the product at the bottom was a bit intrusive. It made it hard to access the 'Home' and 'Return' touch buttons at the bottom of the phone. I did feel that my phone would be well protected in this case. However, the design lead me to return. Fast shipping from this seller.
4	1374019200	Very cute and very durable! the color is a little different but the case is super dandy. Loved the case.
4	1373932800	This is a great case for my Samsung Galaxy III. I protects very well. The only thing that I don't care for is that it is thickerand heavier than I would like.
5	1373932800	We bought both the Ballistic and the Otterbox and I like the Ballistic way better.  My teen HAD to have the Otterbox, but then was jealous of my case and wanted to switch.  No way Jose'!  A very good case.
5	1373932800	Purchased for my teenager, he can be tough on electronics. This case is very durable and is great for anyone looking for a protective case. It is a little bulky, but much less so than the otter box. I would certainly purchase this again!
5	1373932800	Got this for my wife's new Galaxy S III. It gave it just enough extra grip and bulk to make it more comfortable. Looks great and seems to offer good protection (although she has yet to drop it, thankfully).
5	1373846400	We have these on all our phones. I moved everyone from th Defender to these once I tried it. There will never be another phone in our house without one on these on it. So quit looking and buy this!
5	1373846400	Love this product.  Easy to put on, fits great.  Dropped my phone on a tile floor a few days after I got the cover and it protected it completely.  Very happy with this product.
5	1373846400	I have dropped this phone many times with this Ballistic case and I can actually say I am impressed cause nothing happens to my phone. I love it.
5	1373846400	Love the color, and thickness. I had a similar case on my S2, protects the phone very nice, would highly recommend
5	1373846400	I bought this cover not the most expensive but not the cheapest.  I felt it did its job.  My son is 3 and well I have not had to replace my phone yet and it is stylish.  recommend it.
5	1373760000	It was everything I thought it would be. I would definatly recommend it. Good protection for the phone. Color exact
5	1373760000	This is the first time I have ever ordered anything from Amazon and was very pleased with the result. Love the case. Easy to install. Outside button covers make it easier to use. Arrived quickly. I would definitely recommend this product.
4	1373760000	This is a wonderful product. It will save a bunch of money on phones. Without it my phones slips out of my hand.
5	1373760000	I think that the case is pretty and it was a great fit for my samsung galaxy 3 phone. Perfect fit
5	1373587200	I bought this for my wifes phone.It looks better than the otter box she had and its not as bulky.Better deal and protects phone just as good.Just ask my two year old daughter who loves throwing things from upsairs.
5	1373587200	I wanted a case that would provide good protection while still keeping the slim lines of my Samsung Galaxy S3.  This one is perfect.  The back and most of the sides are slick so I can still slip it in my pocket.  But there is enough rubber exposed for me to get a good grip on it.  Easy to attach, and all the buttons are easy to use and responsive through the case.
5	1373587200	After dropping her phone, the wife bought this armor to protect it from those types of issues. Its nice to the touch and has done the job so far.
5	1373587200	As described on the description, this item is best for you if you considered your phone as &#34;slippery and too light&#34;. After I put the case on my phone, all I can say is I will never drop this phone. Or if I do, the screen won't be smashed.The case is consisted of 2 parts:1. Thick rubber layer: the best thing about this rubber part is that the company made it so that it has an edge around the rubber, so in case if you drop your phone face down, the screen will not touch the ground (unless you drop it on a rock then tough luck...)2. Hard case: this case goes over the rubber layer for extra protection, and give you that sturdy feeling.It is a little bit tough to put on since the hard case -- after successfully being put on the phone -- will fit snugly to your phone and the rubber layer. If you have some cheap screen protectors (the kind that would be easily peeled off). You may accidentally peel it off during the process.The rubber layerI would definitely recommend you to get this case if you are a butter-finger like I am when it comes to small, compact, tiny, and slippery tech gadget. I drop my last phone almost 10 times in a year....
5	1373587200	The case is a bit heavy but is very well made and fits the phone perfectly. The corners are well protected. Not disappointed with the case.
5	1373587200	this is a wonderful product. excellent fit and has kept my phone safe the few times I have dropped it.
5	1373500800	Great quality. Easy to put on sturdy. Id call it an otterbox killer for a better price. Go for it
5	1373500800	I bought this for my daughter. She is accident prone with her phones and I wanted a sturdy case. This case seem to protect her phone quite well. I would recommend this case to others who want protection and the different colors should satisfy your needs.
5	1373500800	I love this item for my mom phone its so convince for her. Not have phone for would be a problem thank you for the shipment.
5	1373414400	I love this cover. It protects my cellphone great. My phone is on the floor every minute but nothing happens to it.
5	1373414400	I really like the Ballistic case for any phone because it has the hard plastic case and the soft rubber case.
5	1373414400	Bought this product for $11 vs. $50, love it! I've dropped my phone at least three times a day for the past year, seen no scratches or problems with it! Totally worth it!
5	1373328000	It's a perfect fit and buttons are easy access. The color is great and easy to find.I totally recommend it.
5	1373328000	The covers fit beautifully and provide extra protection around the corners of the phone where any impact is likely to do damage. I ordered a couple of extra in case I want to change colors.
4	1373241600	Decent price range. Husband dropped his phone and so far so good this paired with a good screen cover should be enough to keep it safe.
4	1373155200	I initially thought it was too heavy, but now that I am used to it... I love it bc the weight always makes it easy to find my phone without it being inconveniently heavy.
5	1373155200	This cover is awesome. It fits perfectly.  No problems with it slipping off.  It STAYS on the phone and seems to be quite durable.
5	1373068800	Love my case! It protects and looks good. Shipping was very fast and price was great compared to Much more expensive cases that look and protect the same. .... very pleased!
4	1372982400	I loved this case. Had a nice and snug fit which made me feel secure just in case I dropped my phone. Color was a little brighter than what I wanted, but I realized it once I got the cover. But over all, great case!!!
5	1372896000	This Ballistic case is great and I am very pleased with this item.. Saved my phone many times already.I even bought one for my daughter who is 14 years old and she loves it as well.
5	1372723200	Got this for a friend and she loves it!  Works well with the Samsung phone and is very protective for the phone.
5	1372723200	This is actually the first review I've done where I gave a 5 star rating! This product is amazing, for consideration I have this case on my Galaxy S3 as I write this review! So as the title says my Ballistic exoerience was and is still very pleasent I am a dropper... I drop just about everything including my phone, and as anyone with an S3 knows it is a light and fragile phone! This case is wonderfull for anyone like me, I have even gone as far as to chuck the phone at a wall, yes I threw it as hard as I could and the corner bumper of the case caught the wall and it almost bounced back into my hand! Obviously this case is known solely for its balistic rating, but ive also found this case is good for grip, drops, VERY LITTLE waterproofing (such as is if your phone gets misted or a couple drops of liquid on it) NOT FULL SUBMERSION! other than that the case ads virtually no bulk like otterboxes and the color was exactly what was advertised! In conclusion I would absolutely reccomend this case to anyone!
5	1372723200	I read the reviews for many phone cases but this one came out on top. I have been &#34;in love&#34; with it since I put it on. Not only being really stylish, it makes me feel that the phone will survive a bit of a knock around if that should happen.
5	1372723200	The phone case was estimated to arrive on the 3rd of July, and it came in today on the 2nd! I was extremely excited. The case is cute and fits perfectly. It also feels very comfortable in my hand and I am positive it will last me a long time. Buy this phone case, way better than an otterbox!
5	1372723200	Love that its not to bulky and fits my s3 very well.Pros- fits goods and protects phone.Con- none
5	1372636800	I am beyond pleased with my recent purchase. It is brand new just as described and is an excellent case for my phone. I have dropped it multiple times and no scratches or damages!
5	1372636800	This product was what I was expecting and it does fit my phone. I would recommend this cover to everyone.
5	1372636800	This case is great especially if your like me and drop your phone alot, it's thick looks good and will give maxium protection to your phone...good qaulity for the buck!
5	1372636800	I had the Otterbox for my phone originally.  I need the phone out of the case to fit in my armband for workouts and it was such a hassle to get in and out of the Otterbox.  This case it so easy.  Plus it feels very comfortable and looks nice.  All around great product.
5	1372636800	I loved my incipio case, but it fit so tightly (like a glove) that the corners kept popping off. This one has a little more bulk, but it stays on great.  It fully protects the case from drops, so I like it.
5	1372636800	my phone fell like 3 times now... nothing happened ppl think i have the s4 because of the case  im in love with it
4	1372636800	I love the color, price, and how much it protects my phone. I would definitely recommend this item to others.
5	1372550400	love it.  I was trying to decide between this and the otter box and so glad I went with the Ballistic case.  Saved $$ and it works great.  Have already dropped my phone and no damage :)
5	1372550400	My sister and I bought our family these phones for last Christmas, five phones in total that all needed cases.  We ended up with one Otter Box Commuter, two ballistic sgs, one case logic leather-like flip case, and a hybrid case from acase.  All of the cases have protected the phones in their own way.  The otter box, in my opinion, is the worst as it makes the buttons hard to press.The Ballistic however, offers the same level of protection (maybe more) than the Otter, and doesn't have the button problem.  The entire screen is accessible, although the left and right sides can be hard to reach. (ie when you are moving an app to another screen)I have dropped my phone off my lap or sent it scuttling off the table onto the tile while moving something it was sitting on and nothing has cracked or stopped functioning. The rubber lip around the screen protects the screen from direct contact with surfaces.  The case plus a screen protector has got you covered for all except something narrow hitting your phone head on.The rubberized corners are great for shock absorption but can make sliding in and out of your pocket a chore. The case is easy to take on and off, but once it is on, there is no chance of it popping off on its own.End result: I would buy this again and have even considered buying another color. I do wish they sold the red and black version that is pictured on the box.
4	1372550400	I love this case protects phone really well. the only thing that sucks is that it does not protect the screen itsself. if anything hits the screen dead on it will break.
5	1372464000	When I first got my Galaxy S3 last Oct., I just purchased a normal case.  I could tell immediately that this would not be enough protection for it. Someone told me about Otterbox.  So I went and read a bunch of reviews on it and was not really impressed with what some people were saying about it.  Then I went and read reviews on Ballistic cases and almost all the reviews were quite positive.  I ordered the pink on pink Ballistic case and just love it!!!!  Went on easy - it even comes off easy (I wanted to try that since some people said it was hard to take off).  I've only dropped my phone a couple of times, and the phone wasn't damaged at all. I totally recommend this case.  I don't think it's that bulky, and I like the fact that it has the bumpers on it for the corners. As long as I have this phone, there will be a Ballistic case on it :)
5	1372464000	Great case for my phone. Case is 2 pieces, a flexible rubber cover that covers the phone and a hard shell that goes over. Case does not obstruct the buttons. Good everyday protection because I tend to drop my phone a lot. Very happy with product, prompt delivery, value. Amazon consistently hits home runs! This site is my first stop when considering any online purchase.
4	1372464000	I bought this case for my new Galaxy S3 in Fall 2012. I did not want to pay $50 for the other major brand of case so for the price on Amazon I figured this one would be worth a try. The case was easy to place and it looks good. It makes the phone feel very solid and it really doesn't add much bulk like the "box" case did when I had my iPhone. My phone is my lifeline as I drive a lot for work, use it for GPS, and make multiple phone calls a day to doctor's offices and such. I also use it often for reference when I need to look up side effects of a medication or something about a disease. Basically my point is I use it a lot. I have dropped it a few times and the phone itself has held up well which is the point of the case.It is currently 7 months after my purchase and the case still looks good. I don't really even see any scratches or anything at all. My only complaint is that some of the rubber has started stretching out and it occasionally gets pushed behind the phone exposing one of the corners. This makes the potential of phone damage a bit greater. Considering the price, though, even if I had to buy a new case after 9 months or a year it wouldn't be the end of the world.
5	1372377600	I got the item fast and it was exactly what I was looking for! Great quality! Color was very pretty!  Thanks!
5	1372291200	Perfect fit, love it, just as pictured. Gave it as a gift and they really like it and the price was just right!
5	1372204800	We have had our 3 cases for a month now and we still love them.  They protect well, but they don't make it too bulky.  Great price, fast shipping (thanks Amazon Prime)
5	1372118400	Bought one each for me and my wife and ironically we both did the accidental drop test in the same day, to a successful protection.
4	1372032000	Fits the phone perfectly. It is easy to reach all buttons and plugs on the phone. It is a bit bulky but will protect the phone quite well.
5	1372032000	This is the best phone case I've ever had for any phone. It has a great combination of slick (so you can still put it in your pocket), grip (never slips out of your hand) and sturdy (I've dropped it many time and nothing has happened-knock on wood) and its not as bulky as the otter box I considered getting.
4	1371945600	What would make it better is something to attach to belt, and or to have an easel.  I tried to put it into the holster (leather pouch) and it was tough going in and out.  Otherwise this fit well and seemed to offer excellent phone protection.  Even on the face of the phone.
5	1371859200	Ordered this for a family member. Phone case holds up great, snaps on easy without any problems, and seems to provide the same level of protection than other protective cases. Would recommend.
5	1371859200	I love this case so much! I made sure that I got it shortly after I got the phone so I wouldn't realize the damage that my children would have casued to my new phone.  I was so happy to get it.  I recently lost my phone and I am going to buy this one or one in another color! It is quite easy to remove it and get to the batterey but difficult enough that my children can't remove it.  Great design and I am very pleased with it.
5	1371772800	Love the case will be buying more in different colors! Like the fact it doesn't mess with the flash on the camera to where your picture has a tinted color like ones I've purchased in the past!
4	1371772800	I really love the look of this case and have already dropped my phone several times so it protects well.  The install instructions could have been a little more complete and the gel is a little loose but overall it is great.
5	1371772800	Ballistic is a good company and responsive but the case was way too big for this phone.  Perhaps it was just my case.  The blue is gaudy and did not like its toy-like appearance. The material is nice and would protect well if it fit.
4	1371686400	hi, I like the case. it is easy to put on and to take off. thank you very much. yea
4	1371686400	Works great a bit bulky for me since I tend to slip my phone in my jean pocket.Phone survived a few falls from about 5ft.Overall great just needed a thinner protector.
5	1371600000	I have purchased this case for my friend and mother and they both talked about how really good the case was. Of course it supposed to protect the phone from falls but unlike lower quality phone cases it leaves no scuff or scratch marks on the phone after dropping. I would highly recommend buying again.
4	1371600000	I like the cover on the phone without it my phone would slip out of my hands now I have a better grip when using my phone.  I like the color
5	1371600000	This case is great - it offers BIG protection and is very stylish as well.It installs very easily, and is very snug on the phone.  Plus it looks really cool!
4	1371513600	I love it and it is protecting the phone but the screen protector is being pushed up on the bottom corner. issue solved with a tiny bit of tape.
5	1371513600	I have this case since I got the phone. It's big, but then the Galaxy s3 is a big phone. I have dropped it numerous times and always hold my breath when I pick it up, but it is always fine thanks to this case. I do have a screen protector on it at all times and I'm sure that helps as well. I would put it up against the "Big Name" anytime.
5	1371427200	At first I bought this as a cheaper alternative to an otter box and I'm impressed with it, I've dropped my phone several times and it never gets hurt in fact it bounces, the only lack is a no screen protector, but one of those is only a buck and not a huge problem, overall a great deal
5	1371427200	Great case... Like it wayyy better than the Otterbox. Same great protection, not as bulky, and  no issues with the rubber getting all warped and falling off. Would definitely recommend..  And purchase another...
5	1371427200	Really works well. I love that it's two part so I can just use the silicone case if I want to but with the hard plastic backing, it feels even more secure. I've dropped the phone twice, once flat on it's back and once on one of the corners. Both were from a height of a few feet. Both times there was nary a scratch or injury to the device.
4	1371427200	I think this case will work pretty good for protecting my phone, I like how it doesn't have the built in screen protector like the otter boxes, but the soft insert seems a little too loose, I don't like having it move around much. Overall, I like it though.
4	1371340800	This case is definitely very protective.  The corner bumpers are really thick and wrap around well.  I really like the pink color, although it's definitely less purpleish than it appears on the site.My only complaint is that it does make the phone rather heavy and bulky.I have yet to find the case that is the perfect balance of protection and sleekness.I can manage to get my phone into my armband case for running, but it's really tight. My phone also no longer fits in the cell phone section of my purse when I have this case on.
5	1371340800	Durable cover that protects the phone well. The colors portrayed on the Internet were true in real life. I'm very satisfied with the cover.
4	1371168000	Love the color and sleekness! Fits my phone perfect and adds the protection needed! It extends my buttons out as well making it easier to unlock and control the volume.
5	1371081600	its big but save the mobile enough very good quality and easy to use and strong material color nice for my wife
5	1371081600	Item was correct and fits phone well.  These are great covers to protect your phone. I recommend buying one if you can.
4	1371081600	exactly what I expected.  Received it when I was supposed to.  Thank you very much for a great product.  I appreciate it.
5	1371081600	Case looks nice. It is well made and easy to put on. The case fits well and the buttons are easy to access.I even ordered another color.
5	1370995200	protects my fone well and is very stylish. also its not bulky so I can easily fit in my pocket.
5	1370995200	I have had this case for a couple of months now and I absolutely love it! it fits nice and snug and was easy to put on. I feel that my phone is very protected with this case and definitely recommend this case to anybody with a Samsung galaxy s3!
4	1370908800	Priced this product at stores in my area and it was expensive, looked online and it was much cheaper for the same brand.
5	1370908800	I have a habit of dropping my phone.  I dropped it in the grocery store and nothing happened.  Very happy with the product.
4	1370822400	I really love this case. I've had it for about a mouth now and I'd spend every penny again on it. I'm always dropping my phone and I have 4 children so you can imagine the things my phone goes thru. Well I can honestly say this case has saved my phone time and time again  AND I love the appearance of it.
4	1370822400	I love this phone cover its very durable and it's easy to put on and take off. It's two separate layers. Fits the gs3 very snug
5	1370822400	I love this case. It is sturdy and protects my phone perfectly. I am pretty clumsy with my phones, and this one is rather thin, so I am happy that I have protection for it. I purchased the garnet red SIII, and the colors work very well together. I would recommend this case, especially for those who tend to drop their phones alot, as I do.
4	1370736000	bought for my wife, this case is a bit more rugged than the SPIGEN SGP I got for my own phone. Plus it comes in pink which I guess is a needed option for her. I believe this case will provide more protection for the abuse I think her phone will endure. Great fit and ease of installation.
5	1370736000	This is the protective case my wife wanted for her new Galaxy and she loves it.  The price was great, shipping was fast, and the blue color makes it easy to find her phone--if you understand what I mean.
4	1370736000	I can't even tell you how many times I have dropped my phone and this case has saved my phone. I would highly recommend if you get a new phone that you get a good case for it.
5	1370563200	My wife bought this case.  It snapped on really quickly and looks really good.  The buttons are EXTREMELY easy to push.  This has great protection on all the corners.  It is pretty sharp, worth the $!
5	1370476800	The case is rugged, fits well, and the buttons on the phone are easy to push (unlike my old phone case).
5	1370476800	It lived up to the hype, wifey is a happy camper no more stopping at the middle aisle booths at the mall
5	1370476800	I am glad to have purchased this Samsung Galaxy S111 case. From the minute I put it on my phoneI could tell that it is durable. Its a great color and, looks good also. Fast shipping.
5	1370476800	Fabulous! I get some many compliments on this case for my galaxy. Fits perfect! All buttons are available on the outside. Very nice case.
5	1370390400	I have dropped my phone several times since putting on the case, and it hasn't acted any differently. Very pleased. The only thing I was surprised by is that I thought the hard layer covered the top, like the brand of cover my mom has for her Galaxy III, but upon looking at the picture again I had no basis to expect that. Despite that it performs very well.
5	1370304000	OK, I will start by saying that I never ever write reviews but this case has gone above and beyond.  Its survived and protected my phone in many falls but most recently I left my phone ON TOP OF MY CAR AND DROVE AWAY.  I didnt notice until about 2 blocks later and when I frantically retraced my steps, there was my phone in PERFECT CONDITION in the middle of the street. It must have fallen off going at least 30 mph onto hard pavement and there was not a single scratch.  Although my phone admittedly looks much cuter without a case (and I wish we had as many choices as iphone users), this baby is staying on.
4	1370217600	I recently replaced the otterbox commuter with this case. In less than 6 months my otterbox's tabs hinges gave out and the plastic part cracked and had a chunk break away completely. I swear I drop the phone more often because the cases are unwieldy. The otterbox had a screen protector, This one doesn't. I like that the ports aren't blocked better on this case. If you use the car mount the Otterbox will fit perfectly, while this one is a little too deep so you have to force it to snap in place. The back of the Ballistic case has more grip to it so the phone doesn't side around like it does in the otterbox. Unless you have large hands I believe the Ballistic makes the phone almost too large around, but I have X-large hands so it is just on the edge of awkward for me.
5	1370217600	I bought this for my Galaxy 3 cell and it not only fit perfect but has protected my phone for months, even with many drops. Great company and service.  I would recommend this company and product!
4	1370217600	Case is great but the color is very drab. Wish the color of the case looked more like it does on-line.
5	1370131200	There's nothing about this case that I don't like. My concern when buying cases, besides being leary of them protecting properly, is how heavy they will make my phone. Not a problem with this case. It's snaps on and off great, and protects the entire phone, and it looks great. Such a great buy! I would highly recommend this product.
5	1370131200	I read a lot of ratings before purchasing the ballistic case for my Samsung Galaxy III and already had an Otter Box Defender which I was content with but wanted something solid rather than rubber. I really like the fuschia color of the ballistic and have received many comments on my case. The only drawback is the fact that there is no protective cover for the USB and headphone area unlike the OtterBox which had a cover for both. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
5	1370131200	This brand case is a great product. Its quality made and designed for protecting your phone. I would highly recommend this case.
5	1370044800	Great colors.  So far I have dropped my phone once.  Case seems sturdy.  I would buy it again.  I do recommend to those looking to protect their phone.
5	1370044800	I love it, it works perfectly and of course i love the color. I have actually dropped my phone once and nothing, not a scratch on it.  Yea, great product.
5	1370044800	Bought it for my wife!  she loves it!  Beautiful color, awesome protection!  None of the problems that the otterbox created!
5	1369958400	We are very pleased with this case. When we finally upgraded to smart phones, we wanted to protect them. We read reviews on several different types before deciding on this one. My husband got the black and white one, and got the wine-colored one...and we are both very happy with them. We have already recommended them to others, and will do so in the future.
5	1369958400	A friend recommended this over the Otter Box and I do like how it is slick on the back, making it easy to get in a pocket. Feels like it is protecting my phone well. Highly recommend it.
5	1369958400	This case was a gift for my sister.  She initially had the Otterbox Defender for her S3 but the power button was hard to press with that so she opted for this one.  The pink and black case looks exactly how it does in the picture.  All the buttons function properly and she is thrilled with it.  Would definitely recommend.
5	1369958400	This is the perfect smartphone cover to protect from accidents and it looks great! I'm very satisfied with this product!
5	1369872000	This fits my GS3 very well. I had an Otterbox and I tore it up trying to get it back off once I got it on my phone!  This case is easy to put on and take back off, yet it protects the phone well.
5	1369872000	Love the case it protects all the areas that need it and the color pick I am in love with this color
4	1369872000	The Ballistic case is nice and sturdy, which is a good thing for me.  I've had issues with dropping previous phones and this case cushions the impact.  Also, the raised part of the case on the front prevents scratches when placed face down. The only thing that bothers me are the raised edges at the corners of the case.  While the raised edges are for protection, I have slight issues with pressing the menu tab at the bottom of the screen.  The is not a deal breaker for me, and I would recommend this case.  I'm planning to purchase a couple more of different colors.
5	1369872000	This is an awesome phone case at a great price.  Feels nice too ~ not too rubbery.  Highly recommend it.  Hope it comes in more colors soon.
5	1369872000	This case was worth the money. I would recommend this to anyone! It fits perfectly with my phone. No complaints what so ever.
5	1369872000	I love this case. It is awesome. My phone is fully protected and its still pretty :]I dropped it a bunch of times and nothing happened.
5	1369785600	One week after I purchased this case I accidentally dropped my phone on a marble tile floor from shoulder height (~5 feet).  My phone actually bounced, and did not have any damage at all.  This is why I have a case, and I don't think I'll ever take it off!  I love the blue color, and it has a much slimmer profile than I had expected.  Bottom line - this case protects the phone.
4	1369785600	This case isn't as ballistic as it is advertised, but it fits snugly. It also is a good looking case. Get it for style, don't get it if you want heavier phone protection.
5	1369699200	I have &#34;tested&#34; this case out many times and it is a great protection for my phone. With a 2 year old, my phone has been dropped many times in this case and every time it's been perfectly fine. My phone has always survived and has never crashed or dislodged the battery when dropped. I love how easy it is to take off to clean (something I find much harder with otterbox though do not have an otterbox for this phone). Unlike many covers that have exposed rubber that I have owned, this rubber doesn't move, feel lose, or seem to wear at all. I also love how it stays put when you put it down because of the material. I have been in many situations (car, sailboat, jungle gym) where I was sure my phone would fall from the angle it was pitched and it has always stayed where I place it. I would highly recommend this case. Plus... it's cute. :)
4	1369699200	protects the phone and shields the camera lens well. can get a little hung up in your pocket but like the bit of grip otherwise.
5	1369612800	Great cover for such a very great price, It is really a good bye for such a low price, In a way I think I could have cheated you.
5	1369526400	best coverrr  ever ....  is not  only  de color pink  looks super girlythe material  is  the best for my cell
5	1369526400	This beautiful case provides good protection for your phone if you should drop it on a hard floor--which, ironically, I just did before writing this review!  I love the colors-my favorites.
4	1369526400	The color is more of a purpleish pink...not a hot pink. I like the case though. It protects my phone just like it should. I would suggest buying it...maybe in a different color if you want a true hot pink color.
5	1369440000	I love the looks of the Ballistic and feel my new Galaxy S111 is about as safe as it can be....unless I leave it in the drawer. ;-)
5	1369440000	I shopped extensively to find a protective case that was well designed and allowed the functionality of the phone to be accessed. This phone case accomplishes both. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5	1369353600	fits like a glove, easy to install and seems to be rugged.I would recommend this item to others to buy
4	1369353600	I purchased this case and received it 5/28/13.  It really looks good on my phone and feels good in my hand.  But I have a problem getting the hard plastic part to stay in place.  The gel part fits really well but the plastic part will fit on the side with the volume control but doesn't fit on the other side.  I have removed and reinstalled it.  Am I doing something wrong?Update:Ok, ater working with the case for about another hour, I finally got the case to snap on to the other side.  It seems to be staying on now. The hard plastic part is a little more slippery than I thought it would be but overall I like the case.
5	1369267200	Shipping was fast on this case. Ive dropped my phone many times and this case has saved its life its great quality and protects very well i would recommend this case and repurchase it!
4	1369267200	I like the case cover a lot, however don't like the fact that it doesn't come with a screen protector, now have to get one of those.
5	1369180800	EASY to put on and remove. Buttons depress without effort. All ports match perfectly. The back of the case has a feel that keeps the phone from slipping specifically during the hot summer months. The COLOR IS BOLD AND TRUE TO THE PICTURE. Really like the corner bumpers and that the phone stays slim. Met all of my requirements.
5	1369180800	i love the rubber around the corners, how well the black rubbercase stays on the phone (even without the black/pink outer back case). i do wish it protected the front facing camera, and led indicator,
1	1369094400	I wanted a fun case for my phone and tried this one after the reviews.  My toddler dropped it on our cement steps and not a scratch--on the phone or the case. Fast forward a few months and it fell out of my coat pocket and shattered. Four months later, I fumbled and dropped it and it shattered again.  Going back to the otterbox.
5	1369094400	This case is even better than what I had hoped for. It has a nice rubber case which slips onto the phone (only black; in the picture you can see it on the edges) there is a hard plastic outer shell (pink and black), but I'm not sure what the third layer is that the description speaks of. Regardless, I like the way this case feels and looks and I recommend it.
5	1369094400	Perfect fit and easy to put on the phone.  Came in two pieces and enjoy the external buttons for volume.
5	1369094400	Great change from the otterbox. Protects without being too bulky, and I love the colors. I can fit it in my back pocket without it looking ridiculous and still gives really good protection from dropping.
5	1369008000	Case fit great.  I love the colors! Way cheaper then the otter box and I think it works better.  Next time I'm looking for a case I will order from this company again. Thank u!
5	1369008000	Love the color and arrived very quickly. The case fits very well and is easy to install and remove.The case also slides easily into my cell pocket in my purse with out getting stuck like some of the cases.
2	1369008000	The cover doesn't fit my phone right. The one side is constantly slipping off and I have to keep pushing it back on. Otherwise on all the other sides it fits fine, but on the right side, it just doesn't seem to want to stay. Not impressed with the amount of money I paid. I paid less than half this price for one that fit even better..
4	1369008000	case is awesome only down fall no one sells the holster by itself. Be  sure  that  you  know  this  is  only  the  case  and  nothing  else bummer!
2	1369008000	I love the color and look of this case, but it doesn't fit well with my screen protector. It doesn't have a built in protector and the rubber piece at the bottom keeps tearing up my screen protector. Had to take it off and quit using it because I want to keep the screen protector on.
2	1368921600	The case looks great and I like the color, but didn't fit properly on my Samsung Galaxy SIII. The rubber skin fit well, but the plastic part of the case that fits over the rubber kept popping off. I returned it.
5	1368835200	awesome product. similar to an otterbox. love the blue color. fulfills its purpose. i would highly recommend for a cheaper alternative to otterbox
4	1368835200	It is what I wanted a cover that would protect my phone from drops. the silicone case is thing around the corners and fits well. The plastic back fits over it and has a rubber back so it won't slide. the color is what it looked like in the picture.
5	1368748800	So far i have no problem with the case. It fits my S3 perfect and has protected it from any drops i have mistakenly made. Very happy.
5	1368662400	I have had my Ballistic case for for 6 months now and it still looks and feels great. My wife and Daughter both have Otterbox cases and the rubber is deforming. I read this in another review and made my choice based on that review. So far I agree totally. I will buy a ballistic case again when I get my S4.
5	1368662400	great case. bought it for my husband and he loves it. Easy to grip and not too bulky.cool colors and good price
5	1368576000	Im so glad I gave it a try. It is every bit as good as an otter box. It fits nicely on the phone and the buttons all work as they are meant to. Overall, I highly recommend this case.
5	1368576000	This is an absolutely perfect fit for the Galaxy S3.  It provides very nice protection.  The phone was not affected at all when dropped.  It has a nice feel to hold as well.
5	1368576000	I have gone through several phone cases that just weren't able to stand test of time. This case is cute, put together well. I would buy any case made by this brand!
3	1368576000	The case protects the phone but it could fit more securely around it.  I have to keep pressure on the edges when I am holding the phone with one hand.
5	1368403200	Works great! Fits snug and is not  bulky. Well crafted and can fit in my back pocket with no problem.
5	1368316800	I have a ferret who is obsessed with my phone. He will throw this phone off of whatever surface and stash it somewhere. Without this case my phone would not be able to survive him. Not to mention all the times I've dropped my phone. I also got it in the wine color and its such a cute color. I wish they have done like some pink and white.
4	1368144000	Fast shipping. So far the case seems good. The phone hasn't had a good fall yet, so I'm not sure about durability & protectability yet, so for now, I'm giving it 4 stars.
5	1368057600	Love this phone case, not too large and I have used it for a couple of months and it still looks brand new.
5	1368057600	Fits my verizon s3 perfectly... would highly recommend this cover! I thought it was going to be bulky but it is actually not that bad, i have already dropped it twice and no scratches or damages to my phone.
5	1368057600	i&#34;m so happy with this case, it is so soft and i love the color combination. I really recomend.thank You!
5	1368057600	works great, and has a great fit around the phoneThe bad:ZAGG Invisible shield pulled up in 2 days using this case, Not sure which one is the culprit
5	1367884800	I am so happy I got this case...VERY PRETTY! I was debating between this and the otterbox...so happy I went with this.  It's not as bulky as you think it is!!
4	1367884800	A great cell phone protector that I have had for 4 months now and does everything I need it to do. I have even dropped the phone with the screen hitting my floor but luckily the balistic case is raised enough for protection. Very happy
5	1367884800	I wanted to wait before writing a review to see if this product was a deal or a dud.  It's very definitely all thst it claims and I am very happy with the results I see on my face.  Areas of lines and particularly the areas of sagging skin, which  I didn't think it could help have been greatly improved.  I had been considering plastic surgery for the jowels along my jaw line, but since using Derma Wand I don't see the need.  I use it for a short time every day, but belive me, its worth it!  That's why I call it my "Miracle Wand!"
5	1367798400	This is my second Ballistic case. I bought the first for my Evo and it protected it the entire time I had it. I must have dropped that phone 20 times on concrete and it never broke or was even scratched. So I got it for my Galaxy S3 and so far so good but I am not in the least bit worried. These are fantastic phone protectors.
1	1367798400	DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR PHONE MY PHONE STILL CRACKED IN THIS CASE. DO NOT BUY BAD PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY
5	1367798400	Case looks to be made very well and should protect the phone jsut fine.  Can't say it does for sure and hope to never find out, but looks better and more protective than my Incipio case I had prior.  If you want a good sturdy case without alot of extra bulk to protect your phone then this one should work well.
5	1367798400	Got this for my girlfriend, who absolutely loves it. Givs it a stylish look, and keeps her from messing her phone up continously
5	1367798400	awesome product ....would purchase again and highlt recommend to any one of my friends and would suggest this site for purchase
5	1367712000	Love this case!  It was very easy to put on and fits the phone very well.  Great case for this phone, I would definitely recommend it!!
5	1367625600	I was very pleased with this item!  It fits perfectly and protects my cell phone well.  All of the buttons are easily accessible.
5	1367539200	Bought this for wifey.  She loves it!!All buttons work perfectly unlike the Otterbox Commuter series where it's hard to press the buttons.  You can even feel the tactile feedback of the buttons!
5	1367539200	it does pretty much the same thing as an otterbox but for much less money!! It has kept my phone safe many times!
5	1367539200	Arrived on time. Super easy to install! Protects the phone really well! I would recommend this case to anyone! I really like the extra protection on the corners.
5	1367280000	I compared the Ballistic to Otterbox Commuter and was happily surprised.  The Ballistic was more affortable, provides better coverage, and had more variety of colours.
5	1367280000	And on time what more can u ask! Will order more to swap in and out and mix and match. What a great product
5	1367193600	I struggled between the Ballistic and the OtterBox for my Galaxy SIII.  After reading the reivews, I purchased this product and am very satisfied with it.  It fits my cell tightly and all the buttons are easily accessible.  My Galaxy is red so I purchased the pink cover, looks very pretty.  I accidentally dropped my phone on our concrete garage but the case protected my phone and there was no damage, the case wasn't even scratched. This product is excellent and would highly recommend it!
5	1367193600	I have the Otterbox commuter case which is comparable.  I love that case as it is very sturdy.This case is just as good, but does not have port covers like the otterbox.It is just a preference thing I guess, either one will do the trick as I now have both.Great purchase and I am totally satisfied with protection so far :)
4	1367193600	I purchased this Item but haven't had a chance to use it yet. Price was Great and looks good. Try it out.
3	1367107200	I have the Otterbox Commuter case for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and wanted to try something new.  I loved the blue color that this came in.  I liked the reviews that I read about the buttons being easier to push then the Commuter. .  Unfortunately I have found that some of the reviews that mentioned that the back case cover does not stay on is true. I have had many times that it starts to come off.  I have removed and put back on many times thinking that it was not on correctly, but I think it is the case, it just does not fit the phone right.  Oh well, the color is great.
5	1367107200	I was looking for a case that would protect my phone when it slips out of my pocket, my kids get there hands on it, and handle the day to day ware things receive. This case does all that and more.The case does not add much weight to the phone however you can immediately tell the strength it brings. The rubber glove cover the corners nicely and the plastic firms everything together as expected.This is my first Ballistic case and will be my first choice in the future when I shop for a new one.
5	1367020800	I'm a mom to three young kids and I always have  my hands full. And usually drop something. I'm graceful like that.  This case,  in the nearly two months I've had it,  has saved my phone more times than I can count. In the future I plan to buy only Ballistic cases -  Mom approved.
5	1366848000	I finally feel that my phone is protected! I love the colors and texture! Great product! I would recommend to anyone !
5	1366848000	Purchased it for a friend after I had gotten one for myself it is a great item it protects the phone and it comes with a guarantee.
5	1366848000	It is awesome. It was easy to put together and I love the color. Thanks for such a great case.
2	1366675200	I thought this would be like other ballistic case I bought at the mall that included a molded screen cover this doesn't come with it nor does it fit this case the ones sold at the mall offer more protection.
5	1366416000	It fits. Easy on, easy off - that's important because my S3 doesn't fit inside my Belkin EaseFit Plus Armband for Samsung Galaxy S3 / S III with this case on. Buttons work just fine too. Would recommend this product.
3	1366416000	I love the color of this case. However the rubber case is a little loose at the bottom. So I don't know how secure I would feel if it fell.
5	1366329600	I really like this case it makes the phone feel sturdy and durable.  Great buy.  I have not dropped my phone thank goodness. Guess that will be the determining factor if the case is worth it.  For now it's great!
5	1366243200	Works perfect. Fits well. I work with students with special needs and on several occasions my phone has been taken from my hand and thrown to the ground and this case has protected it wonderfully. No scratches or anything
5	1366156800	seems I've dropped my phone more than I usually do! I thinks it's because I know my phone it's secure with this case!  cool!
5	1366156800	Best purchase I've made for my phone by far!  Super tough, super easy to put on and take off if needed.  Super protection and WELL worth the money!
4	1366156800	The cut is good so all buttons line up. I like the rubberry bumpers on the corner. I haven't dropped the phone yet so I can't comment on drop protection, but it seems to protect without too much bulk. The Galaxy SIII was hard to hold before, and this case cures that.
3	1366156800	the case is ok it would be better if it had a plastic cover for the screen. It serves it's purpose that is about it.
3	1366070400	The item was shipped and arrived promptly, was packaged correctly and appeared to be as was advertised, however i had to return my item due to the fact that it did not fit my phone. It says it fits the samsung galaxy sIII but does not in fact fit the phone.Too bad, i love the color of the case vibrant blues and it seems to been a very durable product.
3	1365984000	I bought this because of a few other reviewers who said the case was not too bulky on the S3.  I got the Galaxy S3 because it's slim, and sleek looking.  NOTHING about this case is slim. This case adds bulk and weight to a beautiful slim phone. I will be returning this case as it's not what I was looking for.  Gave it 3 stars as it seems like it would be durable, and the colors are very nice, as long as you are ok with the added size.
5	1365984000	I have the Basllistic MAXX for my SIII and my girlfriend thought it was really cool. we like to go geocaching with our phones but she is always worried about dropping her phone so this like rugged case works like a charm. fits nicely and looks good and now she doesn't have a heart attack when she drops her phone.
5	1365984000	We did a lot of resarch on phone cases and this one is the one that we liked the best.  It is easy to install and easy to remove if need be.  It looks great and is, so far, very durable.
5	1365811200	Perfect for a clumsy phone dropper like me!  I have dropped my phone numerous times and have not gotten one scratch, dent, etc! It does not include a screen protector.  But overall it is a great product.
5	1365724800	I love it his freaking case. When I got it, the color looked a little different and the feel wasn't what I expected, but as of now, about a month after the purchase. I love it. Switched from the crap otterbox defender to this. Great decision.
4	1365724800	Ballistic case for Samsung Galaxy SIII fits well.  It is lightweight and still protects the phone.  It has been dropped 2 times since installing the case and the phone is unharmed.  Nice looking as well.  I would recommend this product.
5	1365552000	I love my Ballistic phone case! It is just what I expected! I would highly recommend it to anyone. I also love the pink and black combination of colors. I learned about Ballistic through a friend who had a case from this company. When I saw her case, I asked her the name of it! Now I'm so glad I did! It also arrived much quicker than I thought it would. You can't go wrong with a Ballistic phone case.
5	1365379200	It is the perfect fit for my s3. I love it. i recommend it to anyone looking to protect their phone.
5	1365292800	I love my case! It protects my phone! Great! I dropped my phone and it bounced right off and did scratch or crack my phone!  I love it!
4	1365120000	The buttons are very easy the case is sexy I think it beats the otterbox commuter doesn't add much bulk just great but I would say I like the port flaps on the otterbox.
3	1364947200	This item was not as protective as I thought it would be when I purchased it.  It did come timely and otherwise is okay.
1	1364947200	I really wanted to like this case. It has a great, sturdy design, a smooth plastic back, and thick corner protectors. It is not bulky, and keeps to the slim profile of the S3. However, the back part does NOT stay on the phone. It constantly slips off, and the silicone portion gets bunched up. The left side of the phone fits like a glove - absolute perfect fit. The right side is a nightmare. The silicone doesn't stay on the phone, and the back part slips off, beginning on this side. Eventually, the entire thing is a crumbled mess.
3	1364947200	I haven't actually purchased this item. I have a question before I do. I'm not sure if I missed it in the description, but does this case have a built in screen protector like an OtterBox?
5	1364860800	This case adequately covers and  protects the phone (Thank goodness as I have dropped several times). I would reccommend this case to anyone who owns a Galaxy S3.
5	1364860800	fit great on my Samsung Galaxy III.  Great grip.  I was afraid of using the phone prior to getting the case since it was so slippery and worried that I would drop it.  Makes all the difference.
5	1364774400	This item went on my phone with out a problem. It's very durable. The color brings more attraction to ghe phone.I am very satisfied with this product.It arrived in a timely manner! I will be ordering from this company again. My personal ratings 10*s!!! Thankyou!
5	1364774400	If you're looking for great protection for the phone, the ballistic is perfect, it will definitely protect it! Great product!
5	1364774400	Bought this cover for my wife who just bought the Samsung Galaxy 3S. She loves it. Online review recommended this cover over the Otter Box. Really easy to put on and protects the unit in case you drop it. No were are bulking as an Otter Box.
5	1364774400	It's a sturdy case for my galaxy. The case is tough with a nice feel to it. I would recommend it
5	1364688000	This is my second ballistic. I have an H1 Hummer that rolled over my Galaxy 2 three times and only the  screen broke. I bought this one for my Galaxy 3 and so glad for the color option
5	1364688000	I love this case. I am so glad I bought it. For someone who drops their phone a lot this case is perfect. One of the best things is that it still fits in my pocket easily, not bulky at all!
4	1364688000	It's a nice case. The button spots are a little off though.It's priced right. Not quite as tough as I wanted. Would buy again.
5	1364601600	I did a little bit of shopping around and decided to go with Ballistic for my SIII's, One for my girlfriend and one for myself. I would recommend this case if you are looking for protection against falls, this case has proven itself a few times already.Aesthetics: Not the best looking case but better than some out there by far. I didn't want an Otterbox and I personally find these better looking.Size: It is a little bulky, it is a bigger case than just about anyone else's at work, so if you are looking for slim I wouldn't recommend a Ballistic.My girlfriend loves her case!
4	1364515200	I totatlly approve of this.  It works really well.I would recommed this to any samsunggalaxe user.You made me happy.
1	1364515200	Case arrived with a strong nauseating odor that did not abate with soap and water, leaving it out in the sun, nor applications of Fabreeze .in addition the hard shell did not stay in place over the silicone case - it kept popping off on the side. I do not recommend in the pink/burgundy!
4	1364515200	Good item. Seems to protect my phone very well. My son got one and he loves his also. Would  purchase this item again.k
5	1364515200	Great protection for the phone, even if a little bulky. The padded part of the case has reinforced corners, helpful in shielding from drops. The polycarb shell is nice but probably not needed. Color looks great.
5	1364428800	I absolutely love this cover.  It's a great color.  It does a great job protecting the phone.  I'm a huge klutz and am dropping my phone all the time.  It has protected my phone really well.  The only negative thing is that the hard part of the cover doesn't fit on as well as I think it should,  and it comes off on the side at times.  But it's not a huge problem.  More of an occasional occurance than a problem.
5	1364428800	This is great product. Fits my phone perfectly. I have dropped it a few times and has completely protected my phone.
5	1364428800	I love the case it works well and looks good.  Goes on easy and all the buttons work with the case on.
5	1364428800	Bought two, one for each of my kids and they love the cases!  Will purchase again when I upgrade my smartphone. I only wish that it came with a screen protector.
1	1364428800	Had this case for 2 weeks and my screen shattered underneath the case around the edges and ran across my screen...wish I had bought a life proof case
5	1364428800	Good product. Which I had of gotten this before I cracked my screen (twice) and had to replace glasss. Safe product protection
5	1364428800	This case fits the phone well without adding too much bulk.  It is comfortable to hold and aesthetically pleasing.  The buttons and ports are also easy to use and accessible.  While the texture of the material is comfortable and easy to grip, it does make it a little difficult to slide in and out of my pockets.  That is my only complaint so far, but I definitely recommend this product.
3	1364342400	The case is adorable, but adds a considerable bulk to my phone. Also, the sides have no grip and I feel like I'm going to drop it all the time. A disappointment, it'll have to go back.
5	1364342400	Fits the phone just right..  All the punchouts line up perfectly.  It's tactile in your hand - but not squishy.  I wish I had bought the other MAX model that has the clip so I can attach to clothing.
2	1364342400	Sadly this cover makes me sound like I'm in a wind tunnel when talking on the phone :(Other than that it's a good case (protection wise)
5	1364169600	I originally had an Otterbox Commuter but hated it because the buttons were so hard to press. I did a lot of research before purchasing this case, and I was deciding between this and the Incipio Silicrylic case. The Incipio didn't seem to provide the same level of protection as the Otterbox, but this Ballistic case does, and unlike on the Otterbox, the buttons are easy to push. I definitely recommend this case over the Otterbox.
5	1364169600	I love this phone case! No complaints here. Its very durable and nice looking. Dropped a couple times and just bounced off the floor without a scratch. Great purchase.
5	1364083200	Easy to mount, provides a good grip of the phone. I accidentally let the mobile fall and it didn't even show any scrape in the cover. Definitely, I'm recomending this case.
5	1364083200	It fit perfectly and protects the phone well.  It is also very slip resistant which is why we chose it but not as bulky as another brand.  It  has a built in screen protector too! A total plus.  I would recommend this cover to all S3 owners.  Its less expensive as that other brand and performs just as well.
5	1363996800	easy to put on. stays on. real nice cushion on corners when it counts. saved my phone a few times allready. love it
4	1363910400	Love this case. Isnt really bulky lightweight yet protects my phone. Only downfall it doesnt have a screen protector. You have the buy that separate.
5	1363910400	I drop my phone, ALOT.  My S3 has bounced off every surface in the past 6 months, NO damage. The case doesn't show any wear and tear at all, easy off, easy on.  This is the only case I would purchase, and WAY cheaper than Otterbox.
5	1363824000	this is a great product for the price!!! it also shipped very quick!!! love the color options that we were given as well!
4	1363824000	The color is not as vibrant as it looks in the picture but it works, looks a little cheap but I like it.
5	1363824000	This case protects my phone so good. I literally loved all the products i got from here. Its a must
5	1363824000	This case really protect my phone and it look good doing it lol This is the first case I purchased when I got my phone.  I liked it so well that it has been on the phone now for about 3-4 months.
5	1363737600	I got this for my wife's S3. Her last phone's screen was shattered after it fell with no case. This case was easy to put on, and it provides a good gripping surface. I like the corners that offer extra protection. The case is not bulky and the phone fits easily into a pocket. I picked this over the otterbox commuter as it had a better grip, was available in multiple colors, and and it was cheaper. Great protection for the money.
5	1363651200	This cover is EXCELLENT!!! It is reasonably priced, came in the mail in a timely manner, easy to open packages, and best of all----this is AWESOME!!! I really like the color of the cover and it protects my phone perfectly!!!! The only negative thing I have to say, and most of all to myself---duh..........you can NOT S BEAM with this cover on the phone. It will not go through it, so you have to remove the cover then S BEAM your photos, files, or what have you. BUT---STILL AN AWESOME COVER and when/IF this one ever wears out, I WILL buy another from the same company through amazon!!!!! Would HIGHLY recommend this product!!!
5	1363651200	Very affordable and easy to put on my phone.  Fits easily into my pocket as well.  Highly recommend this to all with a Samsung Galaxy S3
2	1363478400	I had high hopes for this case but it completely let me down.  First of all, it is really big and the corners are even bigger.  It makes it very difficult to put in your pocket.  Secondly, the silicone on the bottom portion stretches and doesn't stay on.  It gets caught on things and is really annoying.  I think there are other case out there that are better.
5	1363478400	I've only had this for a few days but I'm loving it so far. I had a cheap case on my phone before and feel much better protected with this one. The buttons are super easy to push and it doesn't make the phone too bulky. Love it!
5	1363478400	It works!.Dropped my phone on the face several times prety good. Would not reccomend putting it in your pocket a little akward.
5	1363392000	Very good fit, and easy to use the buttons it covers. Much better than the Otter Box I bought for my phone.
5	1363392000	I love this case for my samsung galaxy s3! It offers great protection without being too bulky and it even looks great!
5	1363392000	it seems to be very sturdy and comfortable i love the feel of the soft silicone and was glad it fit perfectly
5	1363219200	I bought this for my 16 year-old step-daughter, who is accident prone, after purchasing the Samsung Galaxy S3 for her last Christmas. It is rugged, has corner reinforcement (featuring a rubber under-case to hug the phone and a harder outer-case to withstand dropping....or as she somehow does--drops it while walking so it falls and she kicks it in mid-step). For it's purpose, it does the job and looks pretty cute so she is happy with it. It was about 18 bucks at the time, but when one is looking to protect a $500 phone (most of us do not pay that if we have a phone plan but...nevertheless...) so is definitely worth the expense. Personally, I have bought cheapie eBay $1 rubber cases from China which worked just fine for me, but I am not prone to the &#34;drop-kick&#34; like she is. No screen shattering, no nicks. Does a great job! And again, looks pretty at the same time!
4	1363219200	This is a nice case for your Samsung Galaxy III. It does add quite a bit of bulk to the phone but it looks like it will protect it well. I am not crazy about the colors, I really wanted just a hot pink case but this will work. Easy to get in/out of the case. It does not slide which is good but also bad when I am trying to get it into a pocket.
5	1363219200	Since the main one I ordered never came in I did a reorder but a different one.  It got here when it said it would and I love it.
4	1363132800	Cute, Sturdy, and not too Bulky!  The product arrived the next day, and it was exactly what I had hoped for. Well worth the price.
5	1363046400	Great item! I would definitely purchase again. Very sleek. Great access to all buttons and plugs. Fits my phone perfectly.
5	1363046400	I purchased this cover along with another ballistic in a different color. The quality is great, and so is the color. I received my purchase quickly too. I'm very satisfied!
5	1363046400	Very please with the delivery and how well this case protects my phone.  Due to the 'extra' rubber on the corners, I feel the phone will be better protected upon falling..
4	1362960000	Ordered this for the protection and let me say it's a definite keeper!  I only hope it doesn't stretch out like the Otterbox tends to do, if so it will be going back.  Easy to assemble and not very bulky.  It does add weight to the S3, however it's nice to know that in the event of a fall my phone will be protected and although i haven't dropped it yet, im pretty confident that it will offer the protection that it should.
5	1362960000	Bought this for my daughter who wanted pink, but not all over.  Looks and feels nice.  I feel comfortable that if she drops her phone with this on it will be protected. Makes the phone larger compared to my sons with his white UAG case.
5	1362873600	This is a beautiful case and I have got info on YouTube on how to properly install and use it.  I can't wait to find out if all the hype about this Ballistic Samsung Galaxy SIII/3 is true.  I LOVE IT!!  Will recommend.
5	1362700800	All the port holes line up perfectly - easy instructions for getting this on. Factory packaging and delivery were as promised. would recommend this and have to friends.
5	1362700800	I just love this case! It fits nice and snug. The buttons are easily accessible. There is enough thickness to the case that the lens is protected from resting against any surface yet slim enough to not be bulky. I can definitely say that my S3 is protected in this case. My 1 yr old has very sticky & fast fingers and has dropped it on our tile floor many times and the phone remains unharmed. The case actually 'bounced'off the floor! I have the blue case. I'm actually going to order the pink case for a little change.
4	1362614400	I like this case. It is nice. It was easy to install. It feels good in my hand. I like it ok
1	1362614400	The outer hard shell along the side slips off very easily...While getting s3 out of pocket itself,the outer hard shell gets detached from this case..Not a perfect case for your s3...Returned this product and got my refund..
5	1362528000	Originally bought a cheap cover; wanted better protection.  This one was less than twenty dollars, but it is as good as a Otterbox. My daughter has one of those, and it is very comparable to that.  I am very satisfied with this product, and would recommend. Price was very reasonable.
5	1362355200	Just what I need.  Every phone that I've had ends up with a crack in the screen from dropping it.  This case allows the phone to bounce when dropped and it never lands on the screen because the case overlaps the edges.  It's a little bulky, but it's not overwhelming.  I'm a small girl and I still put it in my back pocket when necessary.  Totally worth it.  I'm thinking about buying the white and black combo next to change it up a bit.
4	1362355200	Just got this case and I'm loving it. Fits the phone perfectly and its very easy to assemble. You won't be disappointed, its worth every penny.
4	1362355200	The case has a nice grip that keeps my phone from slipping out of my hands. That also means it doesn't slip out of my pockets very smoothly, which is a hassle, but better than the alternative of dropping my S3 every other week.Nice color, side buttons are responsive, and no problems making sure headphone plug is fully inserted- the casing leaves plenty of space around the jack.I still wish i could slide it out of my pockets more gracefully.
4	1362096000	i like that it does protect the phone very well. I am clumsy and I dropped my phone many times now. If I did not have this case, the phone would be all dented and scratched up by now. Good quality.
5	1362009600	I love my new phone cover!!!!! I am so gkad that I ordered it and it is like my other one I ordered but a different color!
5	1361923200	got it as a present for my daughter, she was thrilled, and is still using it today. says she cant find a better one
5	1361750400	I love this case for my phone.  It keeps the phone from slipping around when I am talking, allows me to plug in the charger or headphones WITHOUT removing the case!  The color is true to actual!
4	1361664000	this case is a fabulous color.  it definitely protects the phone, but the front does come over the top a bit and frame the screen.  This is a preference issue, as this might not bother some people at all.  Certainly an alternative to a Speck or Otterbox, and less expensive.
5	1361577600	Makes my phone look awesome and protects it from drops! Doesnt protect against water, but I am ok with that.
5	1361491200	This phone cover is a life saver! I have two kids and cannot tell you how often my phone get dropped!
5	1361491200	I have several different cases including an otterbox defender series and this is by far my favorite case. I like to change cases for variety and so they don't get worn, but I don't think I am taking this one off anytime soon. It fits well and allows all buttons and functions to work with ease. Recommend!!!
5	1361404800	I did my research and did NOT want a bulky Otter Box as it just makes the phone look too big. I paid less then $20.00 with shipping and it took 6 days to get to California. Easy to put on (less then 2 minutes) and I've already dropped my phone twice from about three feet. Once it dropped right on the back and no problem. The second was a corner drop and ZERO damage except a small smear on the rubber corner. Don't pay $30.00 to $35.00 in a store for something you can get here on Amazon for less then 20.00$.
5	1361232000	This case is amazing. I have a one year old that has thrown my phone to the ground many times. This thing is still like new when I take it out of the case! I cracked the screen on my original G3 when I had a previous case. So when I got it replaced I wanted a heavy duty case. This is definitely it! I'm almost afraid to take it out of the case!
5	1361059200	Bought an Otterbox Commuter case, received it in 2 weeks, didn't fit. and the volume buttons didn't work when put on.  Got a refund.Enter the ballistic.  This is tight fit, well protected, and adds just the right amount of bulk.Pros:-Decent Price-Protects the device very well.-Accurate holes and spots for charger, volume rocker, power button, etc.-Blue color matched well with my blue galaxy s3 :PCons:Not really a con but the side with the power button theres more silicon than hard plastic, however this would just be a preference.5/5
5	1360886400	So far so good no problems. It serves its purpose very well. I hope it lasts. I bought my wife one it worked out.
5	1360886400	This case fits wonderfully and protects my phone. I drop my phone a lot so I knew I needed a case that would stand up. I love this case and it stands up to all the drops.
3	1360886400	I like it I just wish it had front coverage.  I still worry that Im going to crack my screen but hopefully the screen protector I purchased prevents that.
5	1360886400	After several months of using this product, my phone has not suffered a scratch yet.  This is awesome because my phone has fallen from my hands dozens of times.  When I drop my phone (never on carpet, for some reason), it just does a little bounce and stays flat on the ground.  No external or internal damage is visible on my phone as of yet.  I like how the plastic bottom separates from the rubber top part of the cover.  It makes it easy to set in place.  I absolutely love the colors.  It is such a cute look for an affordable price.
5	1360800000	I love this case! It's a 2 layer case, so offers protection and it's sooo cute! The back has embossed dots. Love it!
4	1360800000	Pros: Love the color, love the fit of the case on the phone, love how easy the volume and power buttons are to press, and I have no doubts that this case will provide excellent protection for my S3. Cons: (OR maybe it is just my opinion): To me, the slick edges make it a little more difficult to hold phone comfortably during a conversation. And finally, (jmo,again) the bumper/corners sort of distort from the sleek look of the phone, so it appears that the overall shape of the phone is changed.
5	1360713600	I spent a fair amount of time looking for a case for my new phone.  This case is a good fit for me.  I did not want a case that would add a lot of bulk/weight to the phone (since the s3 is bigger than I am used to).  This Ballistic case fits the phone well and does not hinder the use of the buttons on the sides of the phone at all.  It comes in two pieces, the rubber piece that covers the entire phone, and a hard plastic piece that covers the back and sides.  I really have no complaints about this case.  It looks sharp, protects the phone well, and does not make my phone feel awkward or heavy.  The price was great too, under $20.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5	1360713600	Though it makes my phone bulky it protects it with out affecting the function. I definatly recommend this case to anyone
5	1360540800	I was scared that this case was going to be a little too bulky but it's perfect! It provides the protection it needs and it's cute! ;) Especially since my phone has been dropped a couple of times (thanks to the kids) but everything is alright. Highly recommend this case!
5	1360454400	Lets just get to the point, BEST. CASE. EVER. I've dropped it 3 times, all from about 6 feet onto pavement, and there isn't even a scratch on the case or the phone. So much better than an Otterbox.
4	1360368000	This case more than met my expectations. It's very functional and comfortable, plus, the colors are so right, and so me! It's not overly bulky like some of the good ones are, and fits in my pocket if need be. The buttons are all easily accessible as well. I've searched hard for a good case, and this one is perfect.
5	1360368000	I dropped my brand new phone several times and not one scratch.  Very durable.  It does make your phone Kind of bulky.  Great price .
4	1360281600	I bought one of these for my wife and granddaughter. It serves it's purpose well in preventing damage if dropped.
5	1360281600	This was by far the fasted package I have ever received. It fits perfectly too & I love the color... thanks sooo much!!
5	1360195200	It is a really great item, fits like a glove, easy to put on and offers great protection for my phone.  It is a great buy item. I am really happy with this product.
5	1360108800	Very durable..protects my phone..looks pretty..and not bulky!!!  Why do these reviews have to be a certain length..maybe that is why no one leaves them
5	1360108800	I bought this for my daughter in law and she loves it. It is not only beautiful, but very practical.
5	1360108800	This case is great! It's stylish and sturdy. I've dropped my phone a couple of times and the case has protected it well. No complaints about the Ballistic from me!
5	1359504000	I am very pleased with this case. The rubber and plastic covers went on smoothly, the case provides good protection.
5	1359504000	very nice case. Case stays on phone when my wife carries it in her back pocket. sides dont roll off
5	1359504000	I like this case! Its very sturdy and is exactly as described. I dont see any issue with the charger connection being exposed.
4	1359504000	I know that the ballistic case comes with a screen protector but there was no screen protector that came with this. My friend also bought a ballistic case and he got the screen protector, that is the only reason that i gave this 4 stars instead  of 5. This is a great case and will protect your phone from falls. I have dropped it many times and not a single scratch, the corners of the case are a thick rubbery material also the back is a very hard plastic. If you where to drop your phone it would most likely hit the corner and bounce off the ground. Also the buttons like volume and power are very easy to press. I am not sure if all of the cases that where sold by this seller did not receive the screen protector. This is a great case and I recommend you buy it.
5	1359504000	This cover is the best! ! I dropped my phone twice with this cover and didn't get 1 scratch on it thanks 2 my ballistic cover...will definitely purchase another 1 when this 1 wears out...
5	1359417600	Item just as described, I think this case will give me excellent protection.  I love the bright color, help me see it in purse and also from laying down at home and throwing out with paper or sitting on it.
3	1359331200	the case was nice. I just wish it had a screen protector.  but the case itself is pretty nice ok
5	1359331200	I like the way it feels in my hand. It makes the gs3 feel a little bigger and i like that because it feels paper thin without it. this case also has some good grip to it.
5	1359331200	Love it! Great color - much better than what is offered at local stores. Received on time with Prime membership!
4	1359331200	I love this case. A co-worker of mine had a similar one for his S3 and I decided to try it out. I think this one is a little thinner than what I had expected, but I think that will be okay. Super happy with the quality and how easy it was to put on the phone.
5	1359331200	Shipping was super fast!  The case is very durable and can tell its going to last a long time. Super great product at a great price. Very happy
5	1359331200	I purchased this for my daughter.  She been wanting a pink case and this was it. She was very satisfied with it. The delivery date was great.
1	1359158400	Does NOT protect the phone. I was unhappy with the Otterbox so i bought this thinking it had a front cover, which it does not. I dropped it and it cracked!!!! This is NOT the protector you want!!!
5	1359158400	I like it. Fits snug and easy access to all the buttons. Doesn't make it feel bulky.  Corners are well protected.
1	1359072000	I do not feel that this cover is not adequate protection, also no screen cover included, no belt clip. I think there are better options.
5	1358985600	Case came in on time. The case works great because I have dropped my phone on tile and it barely made a noise because it caught the rubber corner like it was suppose to. No damage what so ever. The only thing I could say is that it was not as bright of a pink as I expected. Beside that nothing I bad to say.
5	1358899200	Great case. I did some thorough research, and although I haven't dropped it yet, I am confident that it will protect the phone.  Also looked into OtterBox and Regular Ballistic and they looked enirely too bulky.  Love this one!
5	1358899200	I love this case. I got this for my new phone and i love it. When i drop my phone the rubber corners cause it to bounce and land so it doesn't crack the screen. This case has saved my phone from fatal accidents numerous times
5	1358899200	This is a great product! It fits my phone perfect and it provides the right protection I need.  I recommend this product
4	1358812800	it makes my volume button very touchy.kind of a pain but otherwise great case. Not too bulky. sturdy enough to withstand my 8 month oldchewing on it and dropping it day in and day out.
5	1358812800	I bought this case for my wife since she usually puts her phones through hell so far it has been great! its like 2 cases in one, it comes with the soft jelly glove that fits just right then the harder shell outer case to fit over the jelly part and the phone really looks protected. after seeing my wife's succes with the case i ordered one for me. The cases look good and not too bulky. the buttons are easy to access and not hard.
4	1358812800	Fits great and does not interfere with screen protector.  Easy to install and remove.  Protects well when phone screen is face down.  The is a little thick and the rubber corners on the case makes it a little difficut to put the phone into a pocket.  I still would recomend this case.
5	1358812800	Unlike my brother and sister who needs the defender, I needed and wanted something less bulky.  The entire phone is covered by a rubber backing and then 95% back of the phone is covered by a hard plastic case.I feel comfortable that if I were to drop the phone with the front facing forward the screen would not crack.  It's easy take on and off.  It does make the phone a little bulky but nothing like the defender.
5	1358640000	Not too huge but sturdy. Easy to grip.  love the pink color.  Easy to put on and it seems to cushion the phone great!!
4	1358553600	Protects my phone well. I have dropped it in the parking lot a few times and the phone has been fine no scratches or glitches. The only thing is that it adds quite a bit of bulk that other cases don't (cases that are more for looks than protection) but thickness is the price you pay for such great protection. The corners stick out and protect the screen. I like it.
5	1358553600	I wanted a case that would protect my phone but not be as bulky as an OtterBox and I LOVE this case! I really like that it has 2 separate parts that help keep your phone safe. I don't like only hard cases but the last silicone case I had got a weird film on the inside from time to time. This case doesn't do that and it fits the phone really well. You can easily access all the ports and buttons on the phone without the case interfering.
5	1358553600	Recieved on time and fits phone perfect. Also loving the color. It was cheaper and better than the case I bought from Verizon.
5	1358467200	I did a lot of research before purchasing the Ballistic SG0930-M775 SG for SamsungGalaxy SIII/S3.  I considered the otterbox and even some thin shell type covers.  My criteria (in order of importance) was: 1) protection level, 2) ability to use all aspects of SIII as designed, 3) overall attractiveness, 4) cost.  This cover ended being the best to meet my criteria.I've had the Ballistic SG0930-M775 for SIII for a couple months now.  I really like it.  It's a bit thicker than a simple plastic snap on cover but the protection has to be ten times better.  I can't imagine trusting the safety of my SIII to one of those thin covers that are little more that decoration.  The rubber bumper-like corners provide excellent drop protection.  It's raised enough to protect the face when the phone is facing down.  And the back is does a good job of protecting the camera lens and speaker. All buttons work flawlessly.  I honestly like the feel of the buttons on the cover much better than the stock SIII buttons because the cover has slightly better traction for your fingers..sort of rubber like.  I'm a guy and so I carry my phone in my front jean pocket.  There is a little bit of resistance when sliding the phone in my pocket due to the rubbery like cover.  Not enough for me to not recommend it though.  I've found it's easy to take the cover off the phone should you need to for cleaning or whatever.  I get a lot of compliments on the look, which is nice!  I highly recommend this cover for your SIII.
5	1358467200	I'm sad to say that although I only have had my phone a little less than 2 months, it has been dropped at least a dozen times.  One of the times it was the dreaded face drop.I'm happy to report that there hasn't been even the slightest amount of damage to my phone! I highly recommend this case. I really wanted a green cover, but this pink does the trick. There is an &#34;upgraded&#34; version that has a belt clip holder but I never would use it. I almost got it because it has port covers and this one doesn't, but I actually am happy that it doesn't. There are so many times when I need to plug in my phone one handed (I have 2 kids and sometimes I only have 1 hand free) and I'm glad I don't have to fiddle with a port cover. I would imagine that after awhile it would get worn out and fall off anyways.It isn't as grippy as I'd like (although that's not why it has fallen - 2 kids ya know) but at the same time the phone slides in and out of my back jeans pocket easily and doesn't pick up tons of lint.
5	1358380800	This case fits my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly.  I don't have any trouble connecting the charger. I have dropped my phone and it bounces! I'm not recommending that anyone intentionally drop their phone to test this out. The case adds a bit of bulk to the phone, as is expected of any case that provides adequate protection.
5	1358380800	I bought this to replace my Otter Box that only last 3 months. Price was great and it is a great case. I will buy another one when I get my phone upgrade.
5	1358380800	Just what I was looking for and great price. I haven't dropped my phone yet, hope I didn't just jinx myself, but hopefully will protect. Will sure consider buying another color...
5	1358380800	This is a very sturdy cover.  Very pretty and durable at the same time.  This will definitely protect my expensive cell phone!
5	1358208000	Good quality case and easy to put on my phone.  I didn't realize when I ordered that it includes a hard back to the case.
4	1358121600	I received this case 4 days ago and I love it so far!I only gave it 4 stars because I have not used it for long. I was afraid it would be bulkier but to my surprised is exactly what I wanted.Service: I give it 5 stars Fast shipping, no damage, great service.
5	1358121600	Truly protects your Samsung Galaxy S III from scratches or any phone damages that you get when you drop your phone. It also fits perfectly with the phone. Compare to a Otterbox cases the switch and volume button (on the sides of the phone) becomes hard to press, but with Ballistic you'll have no problem with this at all!
5	1357948800	When I first got my S3, I bought an Otterbox Defender case. I had read that the Defender was the best phone case on the market and I was paranoid about dropping my phone and breaking it since it's so thin and seemingly fragile.While the Otterbox WAS a GREAT case in the sense that it provided super protection from scratches and drops, there were some problems with it. First of all, installation and removal was a pain in the butt! I want to be able to easily access my phone. Second of all, the built in screen protector is impossible to keep clean!So I decided to search for a new case, and I found this one.The protection level is really good (I would say similar to the Otterbox), but it's more stylish, and MUCH EASIER to install and remove! I love this case! I've dropped my phone with it on, and it BOUNCED and ended up with NO DAMAGE to the case OR the phone. The color is also really nice (I have it in wine).The case feels nice in the hands, has a little grip, but is slick enough to easily slide in and out of a pocket, fits the phone PERFECTLY, looks great, and the price is right!!I would DEFINITELY recommend it!!
4	1357948800	I love the color, almost makes up for having to give up the smooth thin look of the Galaxy 3- I have 3 little kids who love to play with my phone and I can't chance them breaking it- this cover is sturdy and gives me a sense of security that'll prevent a disaster.
5	1357862400	My husband has an Otterbox for the exact same phone and I find that to be very bulky and cumbersome. This, for all of the protection that it seems to give, is still very sleek and not bulky! I like the combination of the inner silicone cover and then the plastic that snaps over to the top. So far, it all seems to be "clicking" together very well. As another reviewer mentioned I find that the Ballistic case gives as MUCH easier access to the buttons than OtterBox does.As a positive, the nerd side of me loves that it has a "Tardis blue" color to it.Update: August 2013Still loving this case. And while my husband has had to have his Otterbox case replaced 2x, I'm still going strong with my Ballistic. (His stretched out quite a bit.) Mine is SLIGHTLY looser on the bottom front, probably from me moving that part the most when plugging in cords and such but it's still great and hasn't lost its functionality. I should also add that I have dropped my phone QUITE a few times and the Ballistic case has handled it very well.Overall, still highly recommending it. And I actually just ordered it in black for my husband who's pretty ticked off that his Otterbox has gotten stretched out two different times.
5	1357862400	The case arrived promptly and it came in perfect condition, just as described. The color and the durability of the case is also just what i wanted. This is a great protective case for me, since I'm prone to dropping my phone. I would totally recommend this case to anyone!
4	1357776000	Love this case. Read some reviews that said the screen protector altered the view of the screen, but I have not noticed that. The only thing I found that the case alters is the palm swipe for screenshots: the case does not allow you to. The only reason I can think this happens is because the corner of the rubber part of the case covers part of the camera. Not entirely sure. But other than that, the case is great. Adds enough weight to the phone where you don't feel like it will break while you're holding it.
5	1357776000	There are cheaper ones and there are much more expensive ones. I think this one is definitely worth the price. It does great protecting the phone and looks pretty good doing it.
5	1357689600	I bought this after reading several reviews and this case meets all expectations and is a perfect fit for the phone...
4	1357689600	I like Ballistic products.  It keeps its shape better than the Otter Box Defender.  The color is a little off, but it still looks good.
3	1357689600	This case was not quite what I was expecting but it works.  The only downfall I see with it is the rubber around the ports is a little loose.  Not at first of course but I have had it for about a month now and they are a little loose.  On the upside, I did drop my phone as I was trying to put it in my pocket and it wasn't even scratched when I picked it up!
5	1357603200	I was debating between this and the Otterbox, but chose this because of the other reviews re: button accessiblity.  It's great.  My Samsung Galaxy 3S felt sort of delicate before, but now feels solid and snug in the case.  Would highly recommend!
5	1357603200	Fit my samsung glaxasy 3 perfectly. Highly recommend the Ballistic cases, yes they are bulky, but the are soft and actually easier/comfortable to hold the more streamlined harder cases.
5	1357516800	This has been a great and very practical product that would be of definite benefit to all who purchase it.
5	1357430400	Very strong  and sturdy, made strong, does not come off easy, worth the money, THANK YOU! All the reviews helped in making my choice, I love it, it fits nice..
4	1357344000	Light weight and slim fit make it a great buy for the price. Shipment was very quick and was as advertised.
5	1357257600	This case really adds style to my phone while protecting it as well.  I would definitely recommend.  It adds a little &#34;beef&#34; to the phone, but I really don't mind that.
5	1357257600	Fits my phone great and gives me the security that it is not going to slide out of my hand.  All the buttons and controls are easy to push.  Thanks.
4	1357171200	I received my Ballistic case in 2 days,WOW! It is very nice & the only reason I gave it 4 stars is I'm not crazy about the color. I'm looking for a lime green like this. I like the fit & it's not as bulky as the otterbox I had, yet it still is a sleek but protective case, now just make a lime green one, Ha! Terrie
5	1357171200	Bought this for my wife, she loves it. When our 2-year-old daughter drops the phone, this protects it very nicely. I use a Ballistic case for my phone as well, and we have zero complaints.
5	1357084800	I LOVE my cover!! For those who have small children who like to play games on your phone and occasionally have butter fingers, this cover/case is for you. The hard plastic outer layer gives added protection to the rubber layer and my phone has been dropped plenty times. It feels comfortable, I charge my phone with the case on all the time and it's not big and bulky like some other cases. It has feminine flare as well. I have absolutely NO issues with my purchase and am extremely satisfied with it. I highly recommend this product!
5	1356998400	My husband bought this for his phone and he loves it. We are clumsy and have lots of drops so this has and I know will continue to protect his phone.
5	1356998400	Exact color, fits phone perfectly. Its not too bulky, im totally pleased with the size.  The case is pretty sturdy, dropped the phone a few times its pretty safe
5	1356998400	This case is outstanding and my wife loves the color that I selected. It was good that it did not have the flap over the power connection which made it more convenient.
5	1356825600	I like the cover for the new cell phone of mine  color is true and how it protects the phone
4	1356825600	This case was an easy fit.  The only thing was that there was no cover for the charger on the bottom of the phone.
5	1356825600	I Love my case. Arrived promptly. Great color. I would definately order from this location again.I have sadly dropped my phone quite a few times and this case has gone the extra mile to protect my screen and phone
4	1356739200	It came right on time, that made happy. Love the color. I while have to order one more next time.
4	1356652800	I have this case in pink and black.  It has protected my phone 110%. Once while on the treadmill my hand got caught on my earphone cord and it yanked my phone hurdling it to the ground. My heart stopped thinking that my phone was wrecked because it was a nasty fall bouncing off the treadmill several times until the phone finally landed face down.  To my astonishment my phone had no cracks, the case took all the impact and yet the case too had no signs of damage.The case is a bit heavy and the bumper corners are my least favorite but it's designed to take impact and protect your phone.  I paid full retail price for my phone so you bet I wanna keep it safe!  You don't plan for when your phone drops out of your hand or even what part of your phone will receive the blunt impact so it's better to have a good case than regret it later.  I don't get compliments on the case but I've always been glad to have this case on my phone after I've dropped it.I also have not had any issues with my full size screen protector, it does not peel off.  The buttons covered by the rubber are easy to press and all the cut outs line up perfectly.
5	1356652800	This case in my opinion is super cute for these types of cases. I prefer this case than those fat bulky ones that you would buy at verizon. This case gives good protection.. if it falls on the corner it has the rubber so it kind of just bounces in a way. Would recommend this to everyone.
5	1356652800	Just as advertised.  Heavy duty yet looks good.  I am confident my device will not be damaged the next time I drop it.
4	1356652800	It's a pretty good case. Does the job and fit the phone nicely. Rugged and durable. Get another if i could.
5	1356566400	AN AWESOME CASE, WITH GREAT PROTECTION FOR YOUR PHONE. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHOSE PHONE IS WITH THEM CONSTANTLY. I HAVE MY PHONE WITH ME ALL THE TIME. FITS IN A PANTS POCKET (ALITTLE SNUGGLY BUT FITS) OR A POCKET IN YOUR PURSE/LAPTOP CASE. STAYS CLEAN AND NEAT, DOES NOT READILY PICK UP DIRT. I GIVE IT AN EASY 5 STARS!!!
5	1356566400	This is an attractive cover for my new Samsung Galaxy S3.  Good price, received quickly, and fits like a glove.  I haven't dropped my phone yet (and hopefully won't!) so I can't say how well this protects.I will be buying more colors!
5	1356480000	This case was a wise buy because it was most suitable for overall protection for my new phone. The first case I purchased was cute & had &#34;bling&#34; but did not have the protection for this phone.  The Ballistic case has complete protection for accidental drops or bumps.  It is well designed, I'm a satisfied customer!
4	1356393600	Pretty good case. Does what I need it to.  Makes the phone a littke bulky and hard to fit into the pocket of ladies jeans. But it protects the phone.
5	1355961600	I priced this exact phone cover in the store at mid-$30.  Got it from Amazon for around $20.  Great buy and I'd recommend it to any Samsung Galaxy s III owner.  I wasn't about to spend $40 for the OtterBox at Sprint, plus I've read that the buttons on the Ballistic phone cover work better than the ones on the OtterBox.  Very happy with this purchase and I would definitely buy it again.
5	1355875200	It really fits fine. have no problems with it. it feels secure at hand and no slippery at all.For me that I'm not too careful it is perfect, also the screen never touches the surface if u put it face down.I'm very pleased for what i got, also a fair price.
5	1355875200	The case arrived late and I was not happy about that.  However, the case looks exactly how it is shown in the picture. It was easy to put on the phone.  Easy access to the buttons on the outside of the phone through this case. I'm going to bejewel the back of the case to give it some sparkle.  Overall, this is a good case. No complaints.
5	1355875200	This case was a replacement from my last one, and was a huge step up in my honest opinion. I was reluctant to get it, because I thought it would be made of rubber on the outside like my last one, but this case has a very silky feel on the back that is withstanding many drops. I love the color, and even with the skinny jeans I wear, I have no issues with stuffing my headphones and sliding my  phone in and out of my jean pockets. I would highly recommend this case to any one out there looking at a case for their phone.
5	1355788800	I've tried 3 different cases for my Galaxy S3 and this one is the best. I seriously never want to take it off my phone. I had a flexable TPU case, which was fine but not really protective as far as dropping the phone (which I havent done)Then I got the Otterbox Commuter Case. I read the reviews about how it's hard to push the buttons for the volume and power... Its not just hard, it's impossible! I ended up returning the case because I couldn't access the buttons at all and it was really annoying.I had purchaced this case but in black for my husband's S3 and decided to get one myself. I love it. Hands down, best case. It's the perfect size, the color is exactly what I was expecting, it's not too bulky it's just right.So if your considering this one, buy with confidence. It's great.
5	1355788800	The case is perfect my phone doesn't look huge like most cases. I love the different shades of pink. Great case
4	1355788800	Fairly sturdy, however lacking the face cover that Otterbox comes with.  Need to buy additional cover for protection.  It will do for now.
2	1355702400	Okay, so I usually don't write reviews but I thought I would share why I would give this product only 2 stars. I loved this case at first! It protects the phone really well. I am a college student and with all the hussel bussel I didn't want to worry about my phone breaking, and after reading all the great reviews I thought this was perfect. One day when I was going to one of my classes another classmate accidentally knocked the phone right out of my hand (I was holding it at shoulder level and I am 5'5") and it fell on the cement flooring. It was completely fine!!! The case did the job! :) But my only issues are that 1) I have a Zagg HD Shield Screen Protector and the case is pushing the screen protector off at the top of the phone because it doesn't stay put. And 2) It does not easily slide in and out of my pocket. But otherwise a really good case.
5	1355702400	I really recommend this case, it has a great grab and fits perfectly.I had fw accidents since I bought this one but it always protected very well my phone.I strongly recommend it
4	1355616000	I would have given ot five stars, had it included a front protection screen. Fine cover for everyday purposes. The price was right.
5	1355529600	I like the ballistic case ,its not bulgy  ,it fits right on my galaxy s 3 , i like the two colors combine ,i was more than happy :-)
5	1355529600	It fits our Samsung Galaxy S 3's. price is right easy to put on and it really protects our phone.
5	1355529600	Great value & fast shipment! My wife loves the pink/wine color combination for her new Samsung Galaxy S3! Double protection!
5	1355097600	I had a Ballistic Hardcore case for the og EVO and I would toss it on the floor to show people how well these cases protect your phone.  This case is just as good. What I like best is that the phone survives when dropped in this case and it isn't too thick. The color is very nice. Give it a Googs if you don't believe me.
5	1355097600	This phone case really has saved my phone from tramatic drops! I have dropped my phone a handfull of times and there is not scartches! Does an excellent job!
5	1355011200	I was looking for a case that I know would protect my phone. I'm not prone to dropping things, but it happens when you have 3 year old twins. I was originally looking at Otterbox cases, but I just wasn't completely sold on them because of reported problems. I am glad I decided to go with this case. It adds a little bit of substance to the phone but not weight. Once the case is on, it's on, but is easy to remove if you follow the directions. I feel very comfortable that if I drop my phone, it won't shatter into a million pieces. I think the only negative thing I can say about this product is that the hot pink in the picture is just slightly more vivid than in person. But that's just cosmetic and I can live with that.
5	1354665600	A little pricey, but worth every dime. Fits perfect, protects my phone. Great grip. I received the shipment fast! No complain!
5	1354665600	Packaging opened with just the right amount of effort.  Within 45 seconds case was on phone, hint: put inner case on first then hard back shell- it is even faster.Very happy with the look and feel of theSG  case. Feel much more secure.I had previously purchased the LS smooth for wife's S3, a single piece- she likes it but I wanted a bit more. Couldn't decide if the Maxx was right for me. This case seems the right compromise.The hard case is a bit slipperier than the LS smooth but has a more solid feel. I keep phone in shirt pocket, the case easily fits and goes in and out easily.The extra corner padding on both LS and the SG seem like a good idea.  I hope I never have to find out how either case works.I have the pebble phone and like how the blue case looks.I  wonder if BALLISTIC sells an add on kit  to convert the SG to Maxx
3	1354320000	It's OK it does what it's supposed to do , but it's a fat girl that adores cake.  I want a skinny minnie that's durable for my phone.  Even still I don't like pink anymore it's an ick pink going for black, however it does protect the phone.
5	1354320000	I've dropped my phone on concrete and it just bounced. No damage.  Great protection for those who need it.  Color is bright and easily found. I would buy again.
5	1354233600	Very prompt delivery, item is exactly as described, fits my Samsung Galaxy S III very well. Feels like it really would protect my phone from damage if it got dropped. It actually didn't add too much bulk to my phone, which I was initially worried about. It also feels really good in my hands. I researched the Ballistic vs. Otterbox brands, and decided on this one due to less bulk being added. I'm very pleased with my smart phone case. And the dual-color pink/wine color looks really good.
5	1354147200	this case looks just like it does in the picture. some other reviews made me doubt if I would even like this case, but it is FAB. the rubbery inside softens the blow if you drop your phone and the hard outer part protects it from getting hurt if you have it in your purse. so basically, if you just got a new GSIII you should DEFINITELY get this case! MORE than worth it for the price! don't waste your money on those crazy $80 cases. you already spent enough on your new phone! ha ha
5	1353888000	Fantastic...................I have dropped my phone 4 times since I got the Ballistic and no issues at all....This is definitely the best phone cover I have ever owned.
5	1353542400	Very proud of my selection! Came in on time and was as described! It is a very durable phone case! Protects my phone very nicely! No complaints
4	1353456000	This case fits great on my samsung 3gs and is not as thick as the otterbox but still looks and feels like it will protect my phone if dropped.I gave it 4 starts only bc the back plastic is kinda slippery.
5	1353283200	This case is excellent in protecting the phone. I loved it so much I bought 2 one for my mother and me. It fits the phone perfectly and the color is beautiful.
5	1353283200	When you buy an SG3 or similar product, you should get the best possible protection for that product. I purchased the SG0930-M775 SG case and it has an excellent grip feel and combines an inner rubber glove like layer with thick rubberized edges and a hardened plastic case on the exterior. You put on each layer rubberized first, then hard shell and it gives you instant peace of mind and it's slightly bulky but not too much so and you can fit the phine comfortably in your pocket. I highly recommnend this product.
4	1353196800	This is a nice case to protect your phone. However the color was not quite like it was pictured. But I would purchase in a different color if available.
4	1352764800	It's awesome would buy again. I've dropped my phone in this case now a couple of times getting out of the car and not a scratch or damage to phone!! :-)
5	1352764800	This case is awesome. The phone is not heavy, I have access to everything on my phone. I have even dropped my phone a few times and have not had any issues. I have dropped the phone on its face and the case protects it enough where the screen was not even touched.  I'm extrememly pleased with this product and the price was great!
3	1352678400	Ehh. I guess you get what you pay for. This case is ok I guess. I just dosent seem to be of any real quality but I guess it does its job of keeping the phone from getting scratched.
5	1352678400	Love, love, love this case! It offers great protection without much bulk. It fits in my pocket and cell phone compartment in my purse. The screen isn't covered, but the case offers plenty of protection if you place it face down. The corners have an extra bumper guard protection.  Made of quality materials, doesn't feel at all cheap. The case is easy to remove if needed. The cut outs are perfectly placed. I was hesitant to get a case that covers the buttons, but they work flawlessly. The color is just as described...not a bubblegum pink, rather a rich fuchsia tone. Buy this one, you won't be sorry!
5	1352505600	I've had this case on my S III for about 4 months now. between my kids and I my poor phone has been dropped many times and this case kept it protected. It's really nice looking and has a textured rubber-y back to keep it from slipping when it's on your shoulder. I would have to say that for my case, the color is less of a hot pink and more of a purplish pink, not as vibrant as I was hoping for but that's ok. My favorite part is that it has a little bit of a lift so that when I put my phone face down the screen is slightly raised so that it's not actually touching the surface, therefore protecting it from getting scratched up. It's a nice case, I would recommend it to others.
2	1352419200	I purchased this case because it looked really nice and suppose to give your phone great protection. Oh but it doesn't the first time I dropped my brand new phone while in this case it shattered. The fall was about a foot from the ground. I was very upset. Buying this case was a waste of my money!! Buy an Outterbox!
5	1352160000	It's exactly what I expected and got here sooner than I thought it would! My phone and I love it! Thanks so much!!
4	1351987200	I purchased the pink balistic case for my samsung galaxy S3 and it has been perfect! I almost bought the otterbox case, as I've had luck with them in the past, but the ballistic case was much slimmer and slightly cheaper so I decided to try something new. I managed to drop my phone (from about 6 feet up) and not only did the case hold up, but there was absolutely nothing wrong wth the phone!! The only tiny complaint I have is that it does bulk up the phone- but not near as much as the otterbox.
5	1351987200	Looks nice on my phone. Fits perfect.Can tell it will protect if and when I drop my phone. Worth the 17 bucks easy.
5	1351728000	I did a lot of research on phone cases after spending so much on a phone i wanted to ensure my phone was well protected, this  case is great it fits the phone perfectly am very happy with my choice
5	1351728000	This is a great buy, smooth and it protects my Galaxy 111. I drop my phone a lot (slippery hands), so this is great for me.
5	1351555200	Great cover and easy to put on.  No problems with the buttons working like reported with the other name brands.  Provides great protection for my new phone.  LOVE IT!
5	1350864000	I don't know what to say except that Ilove it. It arrived in a timely manner and does not interfere with depressing side buttons on my Galaxy S III. Looks good too!
4	1350864000	I bought a Ballistic SG0930-M365 SG case for my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 and I bought a Otterbox Commuter case for my Samsung Galaxy S3.  The Ballistic case fits great, as does the Otterbox case.-Both cases are kind of difficult to remove quickly.  The case can probably be removed and replaced in 3 to 5 minutes.  If you switch out batteries or memory cards often, then this might be a concern for you.-The biggest advantage of the Ballistic case is the that the power and volume buttons are much easier to push than the Otterbox power and volume buttons.  The Otterbox power and volume buttons are still functional and it really doesn't bother me enough to switch to the Ballistic case for my phone, but Ballistic really did a great job on the buttons.-The biggest advantage of the Otterbox case is that it has a flap that covers the headphone jack and the usb/power cord jack.  This is good for keeping dust and water out of those areas.  The Ballistic does not cover those items.  This fact would not keep me from choosing a Ballistic case.-Both cases are similar weight and form factor.  The Ballistic case might have more padding on the corners, but I don't think that it would make a huge difference if dropped.  I haven't dropped either phone, so I'm not sure how either case would perform if dropped.BOTTOM LINE:  I would be satisfied with either case.  If you want easier to push buttons, then go with the Ballistic case.  If you want the headphone jack and the power jack covered up, then go with the Otterbox Commuter case.

5	1350172800	I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this case online. I am quite familiar with the otterboxes and thought that was the only brand which offered acceptable protection for people who actually want to hold on to their phones for some time. People have different reasons for wanting a case. Some may want  to add a bit more style to their phones whiled others actually want cases that offers protection. On the contrary, there are people who wants both style and protection. Then there are others who just doesn't want to add much bulkiness to a beautiful phone like the galaxy s3. Well guess what,  in the real world you just can't have it all. You can, however, have the best of both worlds with this case. It is stylish, slender, and protective.  You shouldn't be able to damage this phone at all. Unless you work as a Window washer or something that requires you to be suspended extremely high above ground. It seems like the case has to take a lot of beating before the phone gets damaged.The case doesn't offer a firm grip but it is not that slippery either. The ports are not covered which isn't such a bad thing. The button on the sides for the power and volume are surprisingly easy to press.  You wouldn't be disappointed if you purchased this case at all. Besides, it is much cheaper than most cases out there that claims to offer protection in style. Don't let the price fool you. It may be considerably cheap but looks and feels like quality.
5	1350086400	Picked this up for my wife, mainly for the color, and believe it or not its hard to find a *good* case in a pink (or pinkish in this case). This case is really sleek, and maintains the Samsung Galaxy S3's slender profile which is a plus. It's a solidly built case that should provide plenty of protection from scratches and  minor to medium falls. Best of all, the material allows the phone to easily slide in and out of your pocket. The only complaint my wife had was there is no protection covering the camera lens, which isn't really an issue.This case does not include a screen protector so we paired it up with the Rearth Ultimate Clear Plus Ringbo Screen Protector which I also reviewed and also recommend.Overall a great buy.
5	1349395200	no need to look any further for superior protection for your GS3! this case adds protection and style! i ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. it's a breeze to put on and you have nothing to worry about after that. case doesn't come with a screen protector so make sure you get purchase one when you order. you have access to all the ports and it doesn't block the home key or soft key buttons at the bottom of the phone. the case doesn't get hot after continuously using the phone, which is one thing i was worried about. i would definitely recommend this case to a friend, co-worker, family member...
4	1349049600	Just received today and I'm not quite sure if I like it. It takes away the chic slimness of the galaxy s3, and disappointingly the pink color is a lot duller than the nice bright pink you see online. I knew it was going to be thicker than gel case I had on it, but now it seems like a tank - way too big for my petite hands on an already big phone. But on the positive side, the case is extremely well made and I can see that my phone will be well-protected. I guess I just need to get used to it.
5	1348272000	At first I didn't know what case to get, especially getting it online because I just don't like to order online. But aftrt ordering my ballistic case I can say I'm very happy with it. Shipping was fast and got my case before the expected date.
5	1348012800	I had never heard of this brand and was going to go with the otterbox but im glad I got this one. It is really protective and is a two in one case. Very pretty and very protective.
5	1347408000	This is a really good case for the money. It offers excellent protection for dropage.  It does not interfere with the function of the o phone.  It looks good to.
4	1347408000	I tried several cases before this one. However I kept this one because of various reasons.This case offers a really good protection for my phone. I can drop it and it would be fine. The screen comes out in the front as well so that if I dropped my phone chances of cracking the screen are less. I also like how the corners have "bumpers".It has a nice grip to it so that it is less likely to slip out of my hands.It looks really good on my blue S3.The case is very easy to take off the phone and put back on.I wish the case covered the jacks (headphones, microUSB, etc). That is why I am giving 4 stars.So far the my favorite case for my phone.
4	1347148800	Finally after trying several cases -  This one fit the bill.  Built great and fits like it should.  I like it so much -  Thinking about buying a different color.  The only draw back from giving it a 5 star is I need to find a case for it that will fit in my purse.  I like to have my phone covered to protect screen from scratches and if I just wanted to carry my phone I could.  Any suggestions?
4	1346025600	Works just fine & looks great.  Easy to snap on.  It was just as advertised.  Makes gripping the phone feel more secure.
5	1345766400	Really protects your phone! Cover comes in different colors and available for different models. The cover makes it easier to hold your phone without slipping out of your hands!
5	1345334400	I bought this case instead of the Otterbox.  The reviews on the Otterbox said that the buttons were hard to push while in the case.  I bought my wife a Ballistic for her Galaxy s II and she loves it so I thought I would try it out for my new Galaxy s III.  Great case and the buttons work great.  Very Happy.
5	1345075200	I purchased this case to replace an OtterBox, I wanted something with the same protection that wasn't so bulky or rubbery you can't slide it in a pocket. This case is awesome, the corners are rubber and the rest is smooth plastic. The impact ratings are just as good or better than comparable cases and this one was under $20. I don't think it gets much better than that.
5	1345075200	This is an awesome case and and awesome color!! I shouldn't have to buy another case for a very long time, believe me if you purchase this case you will NOT be disappointed! It barely adds any bulk and I feel like my phone is really protected.
5	1343260800	Almost sent for the Otter but was worried it would be to bulky. Just recieved my Ballistic today. Fits good, feels and looks awesome is not bulky and my galaxy 3 feels protected, for way less $. When I first got my phone I put on the Invisible Shield in HD (which is lifetime guaranteed) from Zagg. Now on the go with no  worries. Hopes this helps.
