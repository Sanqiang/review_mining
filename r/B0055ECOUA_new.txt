5	1405296000	Easy to navigate
5	1405036800	It's one of the best I found and it's easy to browse and find verses
5	1404950400	It's the bible and it's easy to read! It's my dally devotion plus my nightly devotion! A must read for everyone! It's the truth the way the light to Heaven!
1	1404950400	Not easy to navigate.
5	1404864000	Can someone tell me how you would rate the Bible badly.  I guess if you are not a Christian or find fault with everything you might be in favor of a poor review.  I purchase this for my Kindle because of my vision challenges.  it is great to go to the chapter and verse in church and be able to read along with the pastor.  It was a great purchase.
5	1404691200	It may be a little hard to read as the translation is not in modern english, as we spaek today. This version was put together in 1611AD. There are Bible studys on line if you should need any help to understand the wording or meaning.
5	1404604800	I love to church on SundaysA very good book to readI love it and I'm 11The best book u can get
5	1404604800	I read from the Bible most everyday.  This is a great way for me to have God's word no matter where or when!  Thanks for making His word available in this format.  Worth every penny!,  RMHESS
5	1404432000	It is good  to have the Bible available in such a convenient format. The efforts to browse back and worth are difficult. Reading the Bible often involves cross referencing. Hard to do with this edition.
5	1404259200	Great bible for daily use
3	1404259200	First of all it is free.  That makes it hard to complain about.  The problem for me is that it doesnt always go where you tell it to go.  Pastors often go back and forth between books.  This app doesnt make going back and forth very easy to do.  You must first return to the table of contents.  Overall it is functional but needs to be more user friendly.
5	1404172800	The KJV bible very well made purchased as a gift to a new Christian. Leather bonded bible with a lot of extra notes in it for a student of God's word.
5	1404172800	Another good BIBLE to read!
1	1403827200	GRAEAT
5	1403740800	This King James bible was free. I use it a lot.It has the same search problems that all Kindlebooks have (as far as I know)If you flip page to page, that is smooth.If you want to skip to another page, verse, chapter,items from the contents, etc.---that is very difficult.I paid for several other books and all have this problem.So I don't take away stars because the Kindle bookinterface is clunky.This is a great King James bible for you---and it is free.
1	1403654400	This is terrible mittis advertised as complete but it is not complete. It only goes to the book of Philippians and stops. I wouldn't even given  it a 1star if I could have submitted it that way
5	1403395200	I do like the easy navigation features and the ease of reading without losing your place.  A great tool to have.
5	1403136000	Great buy would recommend anyone to buy.  The bible right at my finger tips. It doesn't get any better than that!
5	1403049600	What can you really say about the Bible???  Have it on my iPad2 as a reference book.  Need I say more?
5	1402876800	best book ever if you need help in your life ,,a healing in your soul this is the word to help you
4	1402876800	I was looking for a basic bible to download to my Kindle.  It's very easy to navigate through.  I enjoy reading God's word.
5	1402531200	One of the best e-books available at this time. I compare it with other Bibles and find that this KJV is just what a student needs in his e-library.
5	1402185600	Down loaded this to the kindle app on my IPad. Works fairly well. Wish the navigation was a little better though.
5	1402012800	I love having the ease of searching for verses, especially with the Amazon APP on my phone I can read anytime...
5	1401926400	The best book I ever read. May this Bible lead you to salvation. May you find true peace and happiness as you take the time to read GOD'S WORD.
2	1401580800	I have the (Tecarta Bible) on my Kindle Fire. When I did an Galaxy Tab 2 App Search for .... (Techarta Bible)  this is what came up and I bought it hoping that it would be the Same as my Tecarta Bibles on my Kindle. However this Item is what I Purchased not knowing that it is Different and Inferior to the Tecarta Bibles that were on my Kindle. After the Tecarta Bible that I put on my Kindle this App just does NOT live up to the Tecarta Bible on my Kindle Fire. Also after I purchased this Item I never did see anything about it being Associated with the Tecarta Bibles that are on my Kindle.
5	1401148800	IT MAKE IT EASY TO HAVE YOUR BIBLE WITH YOU. YOU CAN ADJUST THE SIZE OFTHE PRINT ANDONCE YOU GET IT,IT EASY TO FIND YOUR PLACE AND OVER ALL  ILIKE IT.
3	1400803200	It's very readable but a little hard to get back to the table of contents. Also, I wish it was more searchable.
2	1400544000	I couldn't get this to show up on my Kindle keyboard. I downloaded it through Whispernet and twice using my USB. It shows the file in my Kindle documents, but it doesn't show up on my actual Kindle screen. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, or if it's just me.
5	1400284800	I use this version in my Bible study and Sunday School study most of the time.even if i'm travelin i take this one with me.just try it to see if you like it...lovetaya
5	1400198400	So easy to use, can find the books fast, love it. Would tell anyone that it is a good app.
5	1400112000	I love this for my kindle ............ I can take my bible anywhere now...... I don't have to take my Bible on trips and wonder how I'm going to fit it in my suitcase. What is even better is I put my kindle in my purse and read it on my flight .... what could be better then that? I cant think of thing! Giggles......
5	1400112000	This book _ everyone on earth should read it, praise and worship our Creator and be saved  by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Amen.
4	1399248000	This version is nearly perfect for Kindle Bible readers. I purchased another KJV Bible for use on my Kindle it was so frustrating to use, but not this version. I highly recommend this Bible version for anyone using Kindle.
5	1399075200	The Book is perfect. This Book is for everyone, and will answer every need , every question, every desire. The book gets better and better every time I read it ! Just hold it close to your heart.
5	1398988800	I love the bible. I read it every day. I think everyone should have a bible because:  it is the: B-basic, I -instructions, B-before,L -leaving, E-earth. It is the only guide we have to go by.
5	1398816000	so easy to read the bible on my kindle, love it, greatest story ever told. perfect for the kindle, praise God
5	1398643200	This bible comes in handy for me to take with me to church and just to have around the house instead of having to carry around the book. Having it on kindle is less for me to carry.
5	1397606400	its an electronic bible, what's say.  I put it on my kindle and like to read while hunting.  very convenient.
5	1397347200	What can I say, but a good read. wanted to put a good book in my husbands reader so I bought him this book :)
5	1397174400	We all need to read this BOOK and try to understand it.  It came from someone who loves us all.  You don't have to believe in it to start it but you will after you get done.
3	1396483200	I hate not to rate The Bible 5 stars but as far as a digital version, this one is okay.  Nothing special.
5	1396137600	During our radio based Bible Study I often use several Bibles and reference books. I reserve this Bible for my scripture reading on the radio mostly because It opens up where we left off so I never loose my place from one session to the next. The verse to verse search works well and easily. just type the first 3 letters of the book and enter the verse numbers separated by a dot (REV3.10).
5	1395964800	Great for the Bible lover in all of us. This Kindle version is very good and I give it 5 stars
4	1395878400	I have to learn to navigate this Bible so that I can use it in church and Bible study. Got it because of the reviews and the price. Hopefully this the one.
2	1395532800	I thought it would be nice to use this bible because of the Search feature advertised. Then, when I downloaded the app, I realized I cannot use the Search feature on Kindle Fire. If I'm wrong, please let me know because I would like to use it if possible, but I couldn't figure out a way to just start typing the book of the bible. I think because of the differences of the Kindle versions, applications that are supposed to be made for Kindle should specify on which versions of Kindle the app will work.
4	1395187200	I find it very easy to scroll and to find definitions.  I really use it a lot.  I would definitely recommend it to a person interested in reading the bible daily.
4	1395100800	I, choose the rating because it's a good Bible and when  you press a word you need to be defined it will.. I like it as a backup. Good Bible to the audible Bible I downloaded for free.
5	1395014400	When my aunts bought my grandma a Kindle for Christmas, she immediately wanted the Bible on it. At first, I put one up that wasn't as organized as this one and she didn't like it. But when I downloaded this one, she loved it. Definitely worth getting.
5	1395014400	First time I am able to have the bible with me without carry a book, The font is easy reading and convient.
1	1394668800	ok to just read cover to cover. extremly hard to manuver for study. can't go back and forth from old/new testiment easily
5	1394668800	This book is everything I expected and more.  I can search for anyghing I want to see with a few keystrokes.  It's great.
5	1394323200	I have within the past year joined a bible study and this version has helped me to gain very useful information in a easy to read and understand format.
5	1394323200	Great way to read the bible any where you are any where you go. I love to read verses before I go to work sitting in the car, sitting in the doctors office, any where.
5	1394323200	holy bible  for the kindle is very good, i am pleased. i can jump around and find what i am looking for.
3	1394323200	If I could I would return this Bible.  I like the red letter when Jesus is talking.  This bible is not red letter and it is to much money.
5	1394323200	This book has been clear and concise. I personally have found nothing wrong with it and recommend it to all believers.
5	1394064000	No group of even the brightest individuals could have written this book, even if each one had the intelligence of a million Albert Einsteins. It is GOD'S word to us and we ignore it at our peril. I  love it's conservative format which I find extremely expressive. I wish I had another hundred years left to study and read it. A full understanding of the BIBLE no single man will ever achieve. A book which fully deserves it's place as the best-seller of all time. It's all about JESUS CHRIST, from Genesis to Revelation. lou.
3	1394064000	It was very easy to use, and helps me study my bible witch some time was hard to do. But this is much better.
5	1393804800	Anyone seeking to further their spirituality will find this book one that is 100% responsible for bridging us every need for spiritual growth to cover the sins of this world to find everlasting salvation. A book everyone should read, highly recommended.
5	1393804800	It's the word of God. That's what's most important. I have accessibility to the word when I need it. Amen to that.
5	1393804800	As I read this language of the scholars of 1611, I realize that I am in a much more poetic realm than we are living today.  I feel that I am in the presence of a very old and learned scholar that can enrich my life with just a comment.  There is peace within these covers.
5	1393718400	The Word of God is always worthy of reading when faithfully reproduced! I replaced it with a NAS version because, While I was raised on the KJV, I years ago purchased a study Bible - NIV version - and found I had become so accustomed to the use of current pronouns that now reading the old thees and thous was a distraction.
4	1393718400	I've tried several KJV on amazon, and this looks to be one of the better ones, if not the best.
3	1393632000	It is a nice bible with well-designed basic navigational features.  Not exceptional, but useful.  However, I incorrectly thought it included the Strong's Concordance - that's my fault, not this bible's - so I returned it for refund.  Compare with "The King James Study Bible [Annotated]."  For just a couple bucks more, the latter's navigational features are also very well-designed and, furthermore provide a Strong's Concordance and Dictionary linked and easy to use.  So if you are considering this one, you may want to look into that one instead.I wanted another affordable bible/concordance in addition to the one mentioned above.  Didn't really find one, but did find something else I've always wanted in a print bible, but never ran across affordably.  A Greek interlinear bible, with Strong's Concordance, well-designed and hyper-linked for just 2.99 currently, which lets you easily do Greek-language study word-for-word of Old and New Testaments.  Titled "The Complete Koine-English Reference Bible," it uses Textus Receptus as the source text.I am not associated with any seller or publisher, just a bible student who keeps down-loading bibles and aids and feel these two works are superior to most of the affordable choices, which can sometimes be downright dismal - regardless of price.  I return the ones I don't want and keep the good ones.  The bible under consideration here is a good one, though I think another is the better choice, but if all you want to do is read, then it's a good, affordable choice..
5	1393372800	I like that it said it was written by God.  Who else would give man the opportunity to put down the history of man's guidance to follow the teachings of God and his Son, Jesus Christ
5	1392940800	I love having my bibles readily accessible on my devices.  I have it on all my kindles and iPads and phones
5	1392940800	I believe every word in the Bible rightly undivided. The Word of God is the same today, yesterday and forever. All things will pass away but God's Word will never pass away. I believe all people should read The Holy Bible. Men will fail you. But God will not! The Word of God is the best book one will ever read. Sincerely, Minister Vickie Dianne Showers
5	1392940800	easy to read and navigate . I would definitely recommend to everyone. There are several versions out there but this one suits my needs perfectly.
5	1392854400	I am thankful for having the Holy Bible, I can take every where I go.  I also thank amazon. I will continue to order things that I like.
5	1392854400	I use another translation mostly for Bible study, but I love having this one handy on my tablet for comparison.
4	1392681600	I love that this e-Bible was only $.99!  What a buy.  I have an older version Kindle and thought it would be difficult to navigate but it is not. Instructions are listed and they work.  The problem I have is that the Table of Contents is at the beginning of the Bible, but I have not found a way to get back there with my keyboard. When you get to the end of one book, there is a TOC for the next book only, not the whole Bible. I go to Genesis 1 (gen1-double click enter) and page back to get the TOC at the beginning of the Bible.  Not a big deal since I can go to any book, chapter and verse I want by typing it, but it would be nice to access the TOC at any time from any book in the Bible.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  Maybe I am just missing something and there is a way I just am unaware of how to get to it.  Anyway, what I have read and looked at so far, is the legit KJV.  I wanted this for Sunday School and church but can really use it anytime anywhere. It is a nice version in my opinion.
1	1392508800	The search function does not work on Paperwhite.  Message returned is &#34;Title not yet indexed&#34;  Search works fine on my PC, but it is a bit bulky to carry to Bible Study.  Very disappointed
4	1392076800	It is easier to navigate between chapters of the Holy Bible. Select the scripture you want to go to read.
5	1392076800	This matches the binded version of KJV. I use it often. I like the search features that work with the Kindle because it allows me to find the different chapters and verses quickly.
2	1391990400	It is difficult going from one book to another, & there seems to be no instruction as  to how to expedite the search.
5	1391817600	THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT U WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF READING, THIS BOOK KEEP U INTERESTING EVERY TIME U PICK IT U[ SO GET ONE AND READ IT EVERY DAY U WILL LOVE IT.
5	1391817600	It is a easy read plus it breaks the termology down so you can understand  God word  better. I enjoyed reading his word. It has seen me thru a lot.. Bynum
4	1391731200	I'm reading thru the Bible, as I have done for last 13 years.It is nice to be able to return to the chapter that you left off with.
5	1391472000	I truly enjoy KJV Bible.  It is easy to read and so very easy to find what I am looking for.  I can go directly to any book I select.  I can use it in church to follow along with the service without disturbing anyone with flapping pages.  I am truly thankful that I was able to acquire this Bible because I can carry it with me wherever I go.
5	1391472000	This has a great layout on my iPad!!! The TOC is great gets me right to the passage that I'm looking for
4	1391040000	This Bible is easy to navigate through various scripture for a study.The ability to find word definitions any time you are reading is fabulous.I like the ease of the highlights and notes for specific passages.
1	1390867200	Hard to find the the verses I wanted.  Couldn't use it bible study, took to long to go through it.  Deleted it from my kindle.
5	1390348800	I have several KJV of Holy Bible on my Kindle and this one is really helpful in finding verses I am looking for during Bible Study.
5	1390348800	I use this alot...love being able to flip thru and find scriptures easy.  I use it in church and bible studies.
5	1390262400	This edition is very easy to read on the Kindle.  I can go from one book and verse by using the table of contents.  The Kindle makes the words easy to see and easy to go from page to page.  I recommend this version for daily reading and reference use.  It works quite well for the Kindle.
5	1390003200	This works so much better than the last one I had on my Kindle. The last one you couldn't pull it up. It was hard. This is so much easier. I recommend it highly.
5	1389744000	What can you say? Best book of all time! Nice to be able to carry it in my little Kindle.
5	1389657600	The bible is a book that can be and to often is given to personal interpretation.  The availability of different  translations offers better clarity and removes the personal, fleshly, soulful interpretation and the spirit of the text comes through.
5	1389571200	Makes me feel uplifted, I understand it a lot of the versions I dont understand.............awesome download keep it on hand
5	1389484800	love it.best everfor kids to adults it is awesomeyou will be very very pleasedmust get it.
3	1389398400	It started off great and I still like to read it on my laptop or Kindle but when I try to read on my phone it takes forever to load.
3	1389312000	Good but it doesn't get to particular passage in a easy fast way. Otherwise the word of God is always good.
4	1389139200	4 starts because its quick and easy to get to the verses.  needs more functionality to get around though.  This is recommended for those that just need a bible with no frills.
4	1389052800	I downloaded the KJV Bible onto my Kindle and then IPad so I could read it with ease. I take it whenever I am going to be waiting anywhere (doctor's office, babysitting, etc.) I had determined to read the Bible more and this has enabled me to do so.  The King James Version uses quite archaic language, but I don't mind it.  I love the ability to jump to any chapter of any book, and also to use the Wikipedia function to explain passages.  This was an amazing buy for the money.
3	1389052800	I can look things up faster in my book Bible because I've doing it for 70 years, but the kindle is lighter to carry and I'm 81 years old so that is a help to me when I take it to church.  If I had learned to use the Kindle 30 years ago it would probably be wonderful.
5	1389052800	I have the Life Application Study Bible which I love, but sometimes the newer versions lose something.  Some verses just don't mean the same in the newer bibles.  I like being able to switch between the two bibles
5	1388966400	Discovered that Church is not the place to learn how to use this.  will probably need to practice and get to know how to use at home.  lol
5	1388966400	This is the bible, I have good knowledge of the bible so the KJV version doesn't bother me, I have all translations and I just wanted this for my kindle!
5	1388880000	Easy to learn and read!! A handy tool for studying God's word and finding verses easily. Good to take along.
4	1388793600	Not as well designed for my satisfaction.  Does not satisfy me as my most used bible though a few things I find a bit better than my othe bible offers.
1	1388707200	Kindly press your beautiful buttons and go to Genesis chapter 21:1; Read: (I'm copying and pasting) And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.21:2; For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.What did The Lord do to her? You decide. Read more:Don't go far, Genesis again: 19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and histwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.This is called The First Book of Moses, Genesis!And you're happy how you can click the buttons and go to the chapters and verses! Can you read this junk to your children? And to your daughters? Is this how God Almighty speaks about His Prophets? Is this word of God?And I haven't read the rest of the books. There used to be 80 books, now there are only 66; 14 books are omitted. Those words of God Almighty (May He forgive me for even saying this) were not important or no good. And you call it "Holy Bible"!
2	1388707200	The Kindle edition of this version of the Bible is little hard to navigate.  Trying to jump back & forth between the Old & New Testament is jerky.  I prefer the actual physical version of any translation of the Bible.  I have about 8 different versions in hard print.  This version is great to have at my fingertips just reading in my down time.
5	1388707200	God's Word will stand true forever!  I love reading my Bible everyday, and I would strongly encourage that all of God's children do the same.  God bless.
4	1388707200	An over-rated book that has some lessons for an older time, but largely irrelevant in today's day, except for Part II.The lessons of the New Testament about helping the poor and putting others before yourself seem largely ignored by followers of this book in today's modern age. Perhaps people need to re-read it.But as I said, Part I, (The Old part) has way too many lessons that just no longer have any relevance for today such as slavery, marrying your brother's wife when he dies, taking concubines and many other things in this book like selling your daughter into slavery, well, perhaps this book needs a good edit to keep up with modern times.But like I said. Everyone should re-read Part II. Seems a lot of people missed the point entirely.
5	1388707200	brought it for my mom on Christmas along with the E-reader. Great purchase, love this buy can't wait to purchase it for myself
5	1388534400	I love to hear Dr jeremiah preach and could not wait untilhe introduced the new bible with a standard text but with his notes and explanations.
5	1388448000	Easy read. Completed in 1year. Plan to re-read. Love This version for Kindle. Will recommend for everyone who enjoys reading the Word of God.
5	1388361600	Our twelve year old son really likes this Bible.  He is able to take notes during the service on his Kindle e-reader and the notes are stored right there in his Bible for further reference.  He is able to search verse by verse, which makes navigating through the Bible a cinch.
5	1388102400	Its the only book in life that one needs to handle all that life throws at us. I do like to read many types of books, but this one is the most important.
4	1387929600	I really wish I could do a topic search with this but I usually know where I want to go. It is nice to have access to the Word when I need it!
5	1387843200	I love the fact that this book for the Kindle was only a dollar.  I go to church regularly and this is a great alternative to carrying around my big bible.  It is very easy to go to different verses and scriptures as the Pastor preaches and has us moving all through out the bible.
5	1387238400	I love the talking feature. chapter and verse are easy to get to also.  And it is gods word so easy to read in this format
5	1387065600	Great kindle book . If you love the word of God you will love this book.read the word. I made a commitment to read the word in a year this made it a joy.
5	1386892800	This is God's Holy Word.  Every word is true.  It tells you everything you need to know about God, The Father; God the Son, Jesus Christ; and God, The Holy Spirit.  John 3:16 says "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."  This book is the Living Word.  It can change your life. It changed mine.  God had a plan that His Son would die on the cross for our sin,  He was buried , and on the third day Jesus rose again.  This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Accept Him as your Savior and you can have peace and joy and so much more, and one day a home with Him. This is the most important book in all the world.  It tells the past, present, and future. You can trust God's Word.  He never lies, He always tells the truth.  He always keeps His promises. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.  He never changes.  God did all this for you because He loves you.
5	1386460800	It is easy to use and an invaluable reference when needed. I would recommend everyone who is a Christian have this on their Kindle.
5	1386374400	This book is immune to our assessments!Wisdom is irreverent to criticism.  It is what it is.  It could never harm your concept of life.What can I say?  Try to dive in with reckless abandon.
3	1386374400	I chose this Bible for Kindle because it was favorably reviewed.  However, I found it hard to navigate and search when compared to a couple other bibles (ie King James Bible KJV).  Not bad, nor great.
5	1386288000	It's a excellent version of the Bible.  I have at least three other Bibles on my tablet.  I like this one for readability.
5	1385769600	candy crush is exciting and fun my children and grandchildren play the game and they are simply crazy abut it. The Holy Bible is very interesting and I do love reading the word of God, It is enlightening and informative of how we should live our lives
5	1385596800	I really liked the author of this book. His work is very inspiring and a good guide to live by.
3	1385510400	In comparing the King James Version to Hebrew translations, the KJV is lacking in it's translation of a lot of Hebrew words.
4	1384992000	I consistently would give The Holy Bible five stars. The four star rating concerns the narration. I have yet to find a version that pleases me. The woman reading Psalms leaves the impression that English is not her first language. I would enjoy listening more if only chapters were included in the narration, not verses. Haven't used it long enough to comment on the navigation. Wonderful price, $.99! Thank you.
5	1384905600	Amen my brothers and sisters. Can I get a hallelujah from the congregation? HALLELUJAH I have to write six words.
5	1384387200	This is the best book to ever read I love the Bible I wish other teens would be where I am right now instead of doing drugs and etc.
4	1384300800	At first, I balked at having to PAY for a e-reader version of the bible, but I decided to try it, based on the reviews and number of purchases, and its totally worth the price of admission.  It has a good reference chart, and its formatted great for searching on a Kindle.
5	1384041600	I would like to get more servos.. all was sent in time and would do it again....Everything was  great..thomas
5	1383782400	Nothing really needs to be said.  This is The Word.  This is The Book.  If you haven't read it...your loss.
5	1383696000	If u love the Lord than u must read this book if u haven't already thank God for everything. we have
4	1383091200	Works as advertised and did was presented verry to my I pad. I was able to read right away.  Could be fun to rate but it is frustrating counting words.
5	1382918400	I'm so glad to have a bible with me all the time.  I would recommend this for all my friends to get so they can read the bible anytime!
5	1382659200	Very easy to navigate through - love it!! I am able to use it in church and following along as the Pastor changes passages.
4	1382572800	Holy BibleThis book is the awesomest book I ever read and is always the best book you will ever read.Because it's the best book because it tells the truth
3	1382400000	A little difficult to quickly select multiple passages at the same time.  Takes to long to search selected verse. Average.
5	1382227200	I would recommend this kindle book as it is easy to navigate and user friendly.  It is an excellent book!
5	1381104000	This bible was ok but I actually found one I was looking for which goes real well with the Kindle
5	1381017600	didn't like the number of reviews had to change it. but this is a book that can never lead you wrong or disappoint you , but this is a book that can never lead you wrong or disappoint you nor will
5	1381017600	It's nice to have the Bible in my kindle.  I can carry it any where I go.  It certainly is lighter.
5	1380931200	God's Word is the best writing ever done and should be read by everyone. KJV with search every verse navigation makes this easy on Kindle Touch.
5	1380931200	I use my Kindle version of the Bible every day.It is almost as good as &#34;hiding His Word&#34; in my heart.
5	1380931200	I love this version of The Bible for Kindle. My problem though, the description says it is Xray enabled but when I open Xray, there is nothing there? Anyone else? I'm new to Xray by th way so it could be me :)
5	1380931200	LOVE HAVING THE SCRIPTURES ON THE SMALL KINDLE.  SO EASY TO TAKE TO CHURCH OR READ  AT HOME.  EASY TO PACK FOR TRIPS.
5	1380672000	We have maybe 30 bibles in print that we have accumulated over the years.  The oldest was printed in 1871 in Scotland and is huge.  We have several translations but I was raised with the KJV so I am more comfortable with it although sometimes it helps using several translations to get the most accurate interpretation of a verse or passage.  Often when conversing on-line with friends and acquaintances,  I need to look up a verse and having the Scriptures on my laptop is great.  I have it on a reader but sometimes my wife has the reader and I don't know where it is.  I'd recommend this product to anyone wanting the KJV on their PC, laptop or reader.  I is appears to be one of the most popular versions at Amazon and it works for me.  Amazon provided the PC Kindle download program for free so this is a no brainer when considering the purchase.
5	1380499200	I love the word of God!!! People often say that they wish life came with instructions... Well, it's right here in God's word!  I love having it with me wherever I go!!!!!
2	1380412800	Not what I expected.  Was looking more for what the Skeptics Annotated is and thought that was a bit of what I was getting with this.  Will use it for reference material only and then just delete.  Again, not what I expected from the descriptive write up.
2	1379894400	I was excited to receive this kindle bible, especially after reading the raving reviews about the navigation. However, I was greatly disappointed when I tried the methods mentioned in other reviews - to type the first 3 characters of the book then the chapter and verse like this: mat24.1. This DOES NOT work on the kindle fire (not HD). And the table of contents, contrary to what other reviews have stated, DOES NOT have chapter and verse, only links to the start of the books. So to get to Matthew 24, I can choose MATTHEW from the TOC, then have to page ahead to chapter 24 (I didn't count the number of pages). Needless to say, I will be looking for another version of the King James bible.
5	1379635200	Since I have a leather bound bible, I thought this would be a great idea to have it in electronic form, and so there I am and I love it, not only is the scripture in my heart but now it's also in my Kindle! Yay me!!
4	1379289600	It's so convient to have this on my kindle.  God's word is amazing. I wish there was an easier way to access the chapters on the kindle.
3	1379289600	It was okay.  I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that aren't needed it seems like a waste of my time and the person that has to review what I wrote.
5	1379203200	I wanted the KJV bible for my paperwhite and after reading some of the reviews, I ordered this one.  The navigation is very nice and easy.  I take it to church with me and I can find scriptures fast.  Some of the reviews give very good instructions that helped me out alot.  I recommend it. The dictionary is great and I love everything about it.  It is not a study bible but is what I wanted.  I can use other study books with it.  I love not having to flip through all those pages and carry a book bag.
5	1378857600	It's the Bible!!! You can never go wrong with this book! Putting it in a Kindle format is brilliant. Amen!
5	1378857600	The perfect Word of God, fast delivery, product was received as described, would be happy to download for my other platforms again in the future!!!
5	1378857600	What can I say about the Bible other than the books in the Bible contain the greatest stories ever told - compelling, historical and at the same time current.
5	1378512000	It's the REAL Bible, the KJV with all the beauty of phrasing and close meaning to the original Greek and Hebrew text. I love this Kindle version because of it formatting and ease of reading on the Kindle app for the iPad. I see there is a version out there for the Kindle only that has reference at the top of every page which shows you which book and chapter you are in, which this version does not have. I think that would be the only recommendation I would make for this excellent Holy Bible - King James Version.
5	1378339200	For understanding and study, my preference is the New Living Translation, but for the majestic 17th century prose, I sometimes refer to the King James Version. This Kindle edition is quite good, and it's simple to navigate. There's one page titled "Search Instructions" to get you started, and that's all you need, really; the rest is intuitive. The Kindle formatting is excellent on my Kindle Fire HD 7". Jesus's words are not in red letters, but in context, it's obvious when he's speaking.Note that the Biblical apocrypha are not included in this version.
5	1378166400	Having the Bible available to easily take everywhere with me is great.  It is a must have. I find it easier to pick up and follow rather than carrying the Good Book itself.  I read scripture more often now.
5	1378166400	I have enjoyed having the King James Version of the Bible with me when I am out and about and have to wait for some reason.
5	1378166400	This is the most important book that has ever been written. I love God's word.  I would rather read it than any other book.God's word is precious in every way.
3	1377907200	It take to much to get to the table of contentsor to book chapter/verse.needs to be easier to navigate
5	1377734400	I use this everday when doing my devotional reading.Trying to get savvy so I can take it to church,the pastor moves fast at times.
2	1377734400	The print was not that large and it didn't have a concordance or index a good idea but I didn't like it
3	1377561600	Of course, I can't argue with the content; a ripping tale of love, betryal, & redemption set against the firey background of the middle east. But the navigation and search helps are a bit clumsy.
4	1377561600	Haven't had much time to use but definitely easier to get around in than the other Bible I have on my Kindle.
5	1377388800	This is the best version I could find that only costs about a dollar for the KJV of the Bible, that has an index that contains both the book AND chapter (interactive, meaning you can just click on the link to get there fast).  Some others had just the book links, and some had none.  You really need this feature as a minimum, (BOOK and CHAPTER) if you're going to use this at church or even use it to study at home.  5 stars!  And thanks, Amazon, for letting me return the other ones!
5	1377302400	I love reading the Bible, it is always very interesting. Many, many stories to lift your spirit and give you hope.
1	1377129600	Thought that the Search Every Verse Navigation would be great to use, but it doesn't work on Kindle Fire HD... too bad!
5	1377129600	Now I have a"portable", smaller reference book. My study Bible was getting fragile and worn. I wanted a new Bible, not one of those fancy, upgraded ones. I wanted His words the way He said them and the way the words were written by those who knew Him. The "King James Version" is the only true Bible. I am new to the Kindle life(just got it), Now,I can study and take notes and enjoy. Thank you,Amazon, for the quick download,for the availabilty and for the affordable price.
5	1377043200	What's not to like?  It is easy to read and easy to follow and on my Kindle I can find the meaning of words that I never understood before.
5	1376956800	Scriptures are very easy and quick to find versus the book form. I love it. I use it everytime I go to church now. Others have raved about how they would like to receive the bible in this form. Thank you Amazon for the purchase. I don't think I could ever live withou it now.
5	1376697600	I use this book daily, and it makes it very easy to understand what you're reading. I have the same Bible in hard back as well.
4	1376611200	This is easy to use in church because you have a small Kindle not a big bible.  If you don't know the chapters the Kindle makes it easy to search.
5	1376611200	Easy to use and to find specific passages.  I prefer the King James version over all others.  Eliminates having to hunt for passages.
4	1376524800	Fantastic way to get in some good reading when your schedule doesn't allow you to on you average day. I can listen while I am driving or through by blue tooth ear while I am working.
5	1376352000	Nice cheap Bible to give as gifts. Words were not to small. Would order this again from Amazon. Good price.
5	1376092800	if you are used to thous and other words done in that time era and have an understanding of these words then its good reading otherwise nkjv is recommended.
5	1376006400	Nothing like a digital KJV app, that doesn't require that I get on line in order to read. YouVersion is an app that I highly recommend. Not only can you read, you can be read to! And it is not some monotone digital voice like Microsoft Sam, it is the voice of a real human, who has a very pleasant voice. But, you have to have some sort of connectivity in order to listen.
5	1375920000	If people would read the original King James version they would find that the same words and spellings appear there. I am reading from a print version that is over 40 years old and this at the same time. So far it is accurate.
5	1375574400	Such a  fantastic lay-out.Extremely easy access to both chapters and table of contents. Of  course, the inside content is incomparable. Words are calming and add direction to your  entire life. Highly recommended.
5	1375401600	Love it. I am reading the Bible more frequently now. The best $0.99 I have spent This year ... .
5	1375228800	Loved the quality and shipping speed!!! Excellent doing business with y'all!!! Will most def. do more business with y'all!!! Thanks!!!
5	1375056000	It's the Bible!  The best book ever!  Get it and read it. What more can I say.  You won't be disappointed.
5	1374710400	It is a real bargain to purchase. It is easy to use and fast going from one booik to another.
5	1374537600	This is the Bible to read, I enjoy the Kings James Version. There are no dislikes with this book, read this book everyday and be blessed.
5	1374537600	Bought this for the Kindle Fire to have on hand to read whenever I wanted. That pretty much sums it up.
5	1374451200	I choose this rating because this is the true Word of God and is without error. I like this particular  copy because of the ease in finding verses. That is important to me..
5	1374451200	Very good.  I have been trying to learn how to easily move from one book to another, but I am sure I will be able to move around when I get used to it.
4	1374278400	I love to be able switch between verse texts for context comparisons of similar issues.  Thank you for making it available for my e-reader.
5	1374278400	The Bible should not only be read.  We should apply it's principles to our lives, and keep the commandments of God.  This is the only way we will receive eternal life.  Jesus is the way!!!!!
5	1374019200	I loved the ease of finding specific chapters and verse. I can do my bible study with the grace of his words.
5	1374019200	I have been very Happy with this translation, it reads the same like my other Bible, only without the  worry of pages coming out!
5	1373846400	A nice app of the King Jemes bible. Easy to find various passages. Used it at church, worked great  I recommend this.
5	1373760000	It is so easy to start may day with His word. Thank you for this version. This is exactly what I was looking for. GOD IS AWESOME!
5	1373673600	The greatest book ever written! This is the first time I've read it on my kindle and I really enjoyed it. I like the way you can find the definitions to words and places so easily.
5	1373328000	I particularly like this version of the Bible. It is easy to understand why it has remained popular over the years.  It is accurate and easy to understand.
5	1373241600	Very easy to follow and chapters are in all in front of you. Love the red highlighted words. Very good resources
5	1373241600	GREAT BOOK TO STUDY AND READ. SHOWS JUST HOW MUCH GOD LOVES US AND WANTS US TO BE IN HIS WILL AND UNDER HIS WING.  EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND ONCE YOU INVITE THE LORD JESUS INTO YOUR LIFE. THERE IS A VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FOR LIVING THE WAY WE SHOULD AND ENJOY THE BLESSINGS HE HAS STORED UP FOR US.  IT WILL ENSURE US ETERNAL LIFE WITH JESUS.
4	1373155200	I'm getting to be an old-timer maybe that's why I still have space the beauty of the KJV.  The search features are nice but the reason for having a KJV available is its mastery of Old English.  In the context of those familiar with the Bible there's no substitute for this being the publically read standard.
5	1373155200	It's the original KJV. It's not as user friendly as I expected, but it's a Bible, so there's not much to say about it except the Kindle version is easy to use, but I had to buy another version that is better than this one. I am glad it is here for a backup though.
5	1372982400	Our church is celebrating its 150 years anniversary next year. Our minister has encouraged us to read he entire Bible this year in preparation for our celebration. It is so convenient to be able to take our Kindle with us so we stay current with our readings.
5	1372723200	I love having it on my kindle now - easy access for trips and more.  Wish I would've bought it last year.
5	1372723200	The Bible is the true word from God. Everyone can find comfort and assurance in these Holy word. God is always with us and will never leave us!
5	1372636800	For most of us who study the bible, the King James Version is the first version to which we are exposed and most familiar.  All other versions that we use or study is subject to comparison to the KJV.  It is our foundation or base for all bible study.
3	1372636800	I gave it three stars because, I don't like the layout book name chapter and verse all run together that's not good for me.YES I would recommend this bible because we all have different likes.
5	1372550400	a great version of this book a great buy i encourage you to get this book now go get it
5	1372550400	Well I love the book it really thinks plot should be good for kids. Kid need help from God and he will help them. God bless America and the kids and their parents. It will be good for kids and adult to learn about how the Lord is great to all people. If you want more about God you can buys an app on Kindle, phone or computers. And the Lord be with all God's people. AMEN. Hey have you ever heard about the Bible movie well get the movie it's a great movie well get the movie okay. You will learn about every person in the movie. Theirs  details about them and facts about them and culture about them. So if you need a Bible get the Bible app. So the more you keep reading the the more he love you so much that I have to go back and trust him In God.
1	1372291200	Does not work well on my Kindle. It freezes up and completely stops responding. This item was a total waste of money.
4	1372118400	I have read the King James Bible for many many years, and needed to find one that is in electronic format.  This one filled the bill for me.  It has a searchable contents, and is very readable.  I especially like the dictionary connected to it.  Very nice product.
5	1372032000	i chose this bible because it's easy to find the verses and scriptures with the table of contentsi recommend to anyone.
5	1371945600	This was the best bible I have read. I recommend this book to anyone that is Christian and that you will love this bible
5	1371686400	This version is one of the easiest to read and has side notes that help you understand certain stories. I recommend this version of the Bible for beginners who want to learn more of about the word of god.
5	1371686400	The bible alone is all we need. to have the option of reading or being read to is phenomenal. this app is awesome on so many levels. God is good and so is his word!
4	1371600000	It is so convenient for me.  Anytime I am in the need to consult or refer to the word.  It is there at my disposal for me to learn and enjoy the word of God.
4	1371427200	A great Bible in the King James Version. Although I also ordered the Women's bible, sometimes I just want to read the King James version.
5	1371340800	or forever. God is the way the truth and the life. Make a good decision people and read the bible
4	1371340800	Liked the verse search feature.  Prefer newer translation for general reading. Easy to carry to group meeting.Will try adding notes during study,
5	1371340800	I love the king James version of the bible,(aka God's word):-) I love it's poetic wording in some of the old testament books like song of Salomon. Love the wording it's easy to read; if you've been through 6th grade lol.
5	1371254400	I use it every week to outline my lesson. I can attach my outline notes to each verse and I'm on my way!
5	1371168000	I am getting up in years and it is so nice to be able to make the print as big as I need so I can still enjoy reading my Bible. I believe the KJV is the best because every time the noted preachers want to prove what they are saying, they always have to go back to the KJV
5	1370995200	BEST BOOK WRITTEN FOR YOUR SOUL TO BE BLESSED IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE SO THAT WE LEARN WHAT GOD'S PLAN ARE FOR YOU.
5	1370908800	I'm not a Christian, but felt I needed to read the book to know exactly what all the fuss is about. While I will never be a Christian after reading this, I like the Kindle version of this.  It is very easy to navigate and if you're a hardcore Christian, I'm sure you'd love to be able to take it with you wherever you go. There are no typos like other Bibles I have downloaded, also. It was a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but I would recommend it to others.
5	1370822400	This KJV Bible has easy verse access, with the first 3 letters of each book being used (with Philem being the only exception).
5	1370736000	Quick and easy to get to whichever Chapter and Verse I need to find...even during a church service! This was worth the purchase because I use it all the time!
1	1370563200	This digital Bible would not work properly on my Kindle Fire, which I  purchased from Amazon several months back, but not as much as a year.  I cannot turn the pages when I get to a chapter in the Bible, but get a message that &#34;Kindle not working&#34;.  I have tried several times to no avail.
4	1370563200	this is a good read. I do wish it was more flexible or should I say easier to move around in. But it is good to have it and I have enjoyed being able to take the Bible with me no matter where I go.
5	1370563200	I love reading the word, spritually it moves my soul and i am at peace with the universe.The bookmarks, pages forward, backward gives you easy assess to where you need to be.
5	1370390400	This edition is very easy to read. This digital copy is easy to navigate. I would recommend this to friends.
4	1370217600	Recommended for ease of use. I know there are several translations but only one KJV. To me like anything after being translated to many times by so many people it is never the same. A lot of people like some of the other translation because they say are easier to understand but God helps me with understanding. Have a great day and God bless!
4	1370044800	Always so handy to have the Bible on my Kindle. Easy access to Gods Word at a moment! Good tool to have!
3	1369872000	Could have a little faster and better search method. Would be better if you could highlite on a chapter and verse for quicker results.
5	1369872000	I love having the bible right on my phone - whenever I need to look up a verse real quick it's right there.  :-)
5	1369785600	I needed a KJV Bible for my Kindle & it's awsome! It's God's work, what more can I say about it? Get a Bible, read it, apply it!
2	1369785600	I truly like this version of the Bible and would use it often; however, the App frequently freezes or does not open at all on my Kindle Fire HD. Actually, in an effort to use the KJV Holy Bible, I purchased this app twice.  Unfortunately, I am still not able to use either of the downloads successfully.
4	1369699200	A nice understanding of GOD'S  WORD.i like the old english especialy in the psalms.i would  recmmend this for people who study the WORD of GOD. THANK YOU
5	1369699200	I love this bible, it lets me take it to Church and I can look on my kindle and go to the Scriptures. Love It!!!!!!!
5	1369612800	this product seems useful ...the charging port on my ipod broke shortly after I bought so I hope that this was not the cause
5	1369526400	I love having my bible on my Kindle.  Great for bus rides, waiting for appointments, in church.  So easy to find passages; no fumbling through pages or unwieldy heavy volumes.
5	1369440000	it has taught me a lot about life and what it means and how to see other people at their worst and their best.
5	1369267200	Still reading. It is the best story that has ever been wrote. Every one should read it and have a copy!
5	1369180800	Would recommend this easy to navigate version of the Bible!! Purchased it for my mom and she loves how she can bring it in to read with ease!!
5	1369180800	This is my reference for each Sunday morning service. I use this on my Kindle and I enjoy it to the max.
5	1369180800	This is my first time ordering for my kindle white and I used it at church for the first time,  It was easy once I learned it
5	1369094400	I have recently started reading my Bible more  and it's  the one mos used at my home church, I find it very easy to follow and understand
5	1369008000	Love this version of the New Kings James Version through my Kindle Fire.  You can quickly find the book you want just by typing in a few letters..It then takes you to the book in the Bible that you want and then you just enter in the chapter..  So quich and easy..Love It!!!  You must buy this Bible, you will love it!
2	1369008000	At first, I thought this Bible would be great.  Until I tried the search feature.  It was always really cumbersome and it only worked about 1/4 of the time.  I had to keep trying and trying to get it to find the verse.  Then Amazon auto-upgraded the OS for my Kindle and the search feature stopped working altogether.  It kept saying it wasn't indexed and I never could get it to reindex after the OS upgrade (I guess this Bible isn't compatible with the new OS).  I finally gave up and purchase a much less expensive Bible for my Kindle.  The search feature works great and I like it much better.  I gave this one 2 stars because it's KJV and I didn't find anything wrong with the text itself.  It was only the search feature that didn't work well.
5	1369008000	I love reading the bible and I am trying to read a chapter everyday. I recommend this Bible to everyone
2	1368835200	was not able to bring up any book or verse in this bible. would like to return for refund, was  worthless since i could not navigate in the Bible.
5	1368748800	The greatest book to ever have -  the Holy Bible! And for being a minimal $.99 download, I would say you can't beat it. So there's no longer an excuse NOT to have a Holy Bible on hand! It has everything you'll ever need for your salvation and for everyday living. The greatest how-to book ever!
5	1368662400	What can I say. It is the King James version with the old english style and just what I expected.
5	1368489600	This is the only version of the Bible that opens promptly. It is also very nice that you have the book, chapter and verse available at a glance. VERY NICE. I read it a lot, so it is nice to see so readily where I left off.
5	1368403200	Just what I needed for Church. Print is the size I need.The compact of the Kindle and the size of print is excellent
3	1368316800	If you want an easy to use bible in King James then this ebook is just fine. Easy to navigate
5	1368230400	So many people are into newer versions, I sometimes feel left out. Then, i find a verse the Bible teacher reads from his new edition and my old King James says it much clearer!
5	1368230400	It is very usable and easy to find verses that i am looking for. Also like the definitions that are shown on almost every word. Am also able to jot notes on verses as well as highlight verses that &#34;speak&#34; to me. Very usable!!!!!
5	1368230400	I found this version to have easier access to the scriptures when you need to find them. I always prefer the King James version especially on my Kindle.
5	1368230400	This was the first book I got on my new kindle fire. This is really the beast version of the Bible to have. There are a few ancient words in here but it's good for the mind.
5	1368144000	The only book that really and truly has it all.  Vividly explains what Heavenly Father expects from the reader to understand &#34;Right from Wrongs.  It provides the directions to live a moral life, listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit in making better choices in this world.  It has the keys that will allow you to return with the Son of God, &#34;Jesus the Christ,&#34; to live with our Heavenly Father.  There is a good reason those of us willing to take an oath place our left hand on the Bible.
5	1368144000	Quick, concise, great job, just what I wanted, the best book ever written.  thank you very much for the book.
5	1368144000	What's not to like about the world's most famous book?  This application is not as interactive as I thought it would be, but if you memorized the books of the Bible in order when you were a kid, you'll handle it.
5	1368144000	Very easy to use. I use it in an android, so some of the kindle features don't work, but still easy to get to an from  passages.
5	1368144000	How do you get there, You have to read, Christ tells us, He is the way, the true and the light
3	1368144000	The Holy Bible, King James Version with every verse navigation is an update on the original King James version. While it retains the cadence the verses hold that to this day everyone can recite, I found that I prefer the original King James version. It could be that I grew up with the original and referred to it often. I thought that maybe downloading this version to my Kindle would comfort me and in some ways it did. Also, I found the every verse navigation a little irritating. While this is a helpful tool for some, for me, I found it glaring while reading a verse and would rather it be left out. To conclude, if you haven't read the Bible lately, this King James version is a decent reconnection to an old narrative in human history.
5	1368144000	Love being able to go to different sections of the Bible...love everything about it...very pleased...you won't be disappointed...give it a try...
5	1368057600	This download to my Kindle was no doubt easy and the price really good.  Very nice to be able to listen and read along with while at church.
4	1368057600	I could not search with the tablet that I have. Bible was very good. I think this is a good starting bible.
5	1368057600	still getting use to it, have not taken it to church as I still have to stumble to find the book I need to read for my Sunday school lesson, I plan on using it at church soon, only it does not have concordance when I need to have a verse reference then I turn to my regular Bible.
5	1367971200	Wonderful book, with good information. Will recommend this site to all my friends and family. Great job Amazon. Thank you for your site.
5	1367798400	It's always nice to have your Bible at the ready and having it on my ipad is great!  I love the Lord!
5	1367798400	I LIKED THIS.  IT WAS VERY HELPFUL IN BIBLE STUDY AND IT WAS GAVE ME SOME GOOD ANSWERS TO GIVE TO OTHERS.  THANK YOU.
5	1367712000	If you could only have one book in your life I hope it would be this book.  We am especially blessed to have the Bible on our Kindle.
5	1367712000	This one is very easy to navigate around I enjoy being able to carry the Word along with me on a daily basis.
5	1367625600	I chose this version of the KJV of the Holy Bible because of its functionality. I sampled several versions at the same time for comparison purposes, including one left by my wife when she gave me her hand me down Kindle.I my opinion, this version offered the easiest navigation to find selected passages in a timely manor.  It provides search capabilities, hightlighting, dictionary, search of other reference sources, and the opportunity to correct erroeous entries;  all to help you better understand the meaning of scripture.I think this is an ideal application for devotional and worship reading; light weight, convenient, capable of holding your Sunday School Commentary, all in a single package.Why, do I wish I had a: &#34;KIndle Fire&#34; (remember, I have a hand me down Kindle), faster navigation, color,  better internet.
5	1367625600	Bestselling Author also gave us "The Light", "The Truth", and "The Way". Also the Author of "Our Salvation". Truly, truly a must read.
5	1367539200	It's the Bible. What can I say about it that hasn't already been said! It is a great download product and I'm very thankful that it was available as a free offering.
5	1367539200	I really like the translation very much.I will recommended it to some friends and encourage them to sample it for themselves.
5	1367539200	HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH THE BIBLE.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS VERSION AND USING IT ON MY KINDLE IS SUCH A HUGE BONUS.
5	1367452800	Anyone who's thinking of reading the Bible isn't going to need a review for it. The King James version is the standard/historic text, and I've grown used to how it reads vs. other more modern interpretations.
5	1367452800	I never thought to get the Bible for may Kindle.  But I went to Easter service with my daughter and practically every younger person at church had the Bible on some kind of electronic device. So, I thought this is so easy nothing extra to carry since my kindle fits into my purse. I love it.
5	1367452800	I have always used this version of the scriptures and prefer reading it the way it was originally written.  This was just a download of the version I carry.
5	1367452800	Words of advice, support and love.  Words to guide our lives' paths.  Words to comfort us in those difficult circumstances that we all inevitably face.
5	1367452800	The Bible is the alchemical text that describes and demonstrates our ongoing relationship with God. I appreciate the old King James presentation, feeling it is a bit closer to the original translation.
5	1367366400	What else can I say, it's the Bible, and I'm not finished with it yet.  Actually I am  still in Genesis!
5	1367366400	This is the Word of the Living God presented with some more details, readable and comprehensible. I love It. Thank God for those who publish this One.
5	1367366400	Easy to use navigation of the Chapters,Easy Search like Gen1:12 is how you search or which ever search.Gets you closer to the word of God.I don't feel this Bible has text taken out of it like some do.For 99 cents wasn't such a bad download.I love that while your reading their is instead of say chapter at top it shows it like thisPRO18.16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.You can easily go to the Table of Contents of the book and go to any Book or Chapter or versewhen you press Menu---Go to----down to Table of contents--Enter than you get All the books. PlusIt even has If you go to each Chapters Heading it will show you what each chapter is about in wordsof definition. I love the definintion of it too. The Holy Bible is a book to read and can entertain you for hours.No matter how long you've read it, you'll always run into something you've never seen before when god is pointingyou to knowledge.
4	1367366400	I like it very much.  The only problem I have is getting from one chapter to the other.  Even when I type in the codes for each of the chapters I haven't gotten them all memorized to be able to get there quickly.  Other than that I do like it and would recommend it.  I just have to get to know the functions better.
3	1367107200	Great but the search is way too hard to use. It should be easier. As a source for the Bible it is great having it condensed and easy to carry!
5	1367107200	No matter how many versions are out there, nothing reads like the King James Version with the cadence and beauty of language.  I know a lot of people want to read in today's language, thinking this is too hard to understand, but nobody updates Shakespeare, and I find that difficult to read at times.  It's something you learn to do.  The scholars who created this version spoke the ancient languages as well as their native ones and each word was gone over at least 14 times each.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to read God's word.  Children used to be taught to read using this book, so how hard could it be?
4	1366934400	It is fine, but it is not as easy to move through quickly as I had hoped.  I am trying to learn more about the extras.
5	1366934400	The name on the cover says, you can't go wrong having me in your library. This version is easy to use.
5	1366848000	Awesome !It allows more ways to study the Bible in one device.it saves space on your bookshelf and desk. You have daily devotion as well. It has different translations available in one location which will increase your understanding of the scriptures.
1	1366761600	the one thing i dont like is having to pay for it if its that cheap why not make it free
5	1366588800	I love the easy way it is to switch between different books and chapters . Also between the old and the new testaments. Sometimes I am all over the bible when I'm doing my prayer studies. and with this version it is very easy to do.
5	1366502400	I choose this because the Bible reveals everything.I luv Jesus. This the best. I luv reading but this was the best by far.
5	1366502400	Wait a moment you guys do know God ,Jesus and the lord? Just askin cause it is important to know
3	1366502400	The concept of search every verse navigation does not live up to my expectations as a study aid.  I find hard copy to be much more usable
5	1366502400	This is very handy to have the Bible at your finger tips. Easier to carry. I think it is wonderful that I could get the KJV of the Bible for my kindle. It is the only version I use. Thank you.
5	1366502400	This is a great, I keep my Kindle with me all the time so now I can read The Word whenever I want to.
5	1366329600	The kindle is so easy to carry with my appointments.  And there is no better reading than Gods Holy Bible.
5	1366329600	I am using this Bible to look up verses quickly for our children's ministry devotion book.  Works great with Kindle Fire.
4	1366243200	This version is used in my Church Bible Study class.  The language is readable and understandable.  Search for specific verse(s) is simple.
5	1366243200	Easy navigation and text is great. and it was free too I have two kindles; one Kindle and one Kindle fire this worked great on the original, I have not tried it on the fire though. :-))
5	1366243200	I like this very much it's great for kindle easy to get around fast to find what you're looking for.Yes I would  recommend this Bible
5	1366243200	I really love the KJV Bible on Kindle Paperwhite. It took a while to adjust to the format, but I'm doing better. I wouldrecommend  this to my friends who have Kindles.
5	1366243200	Great version, easy to use. Searches are fast and text is easy to read. Works well with Kindle app thet is available for Android tablets.
4	1366156800	I wanted a Bible with the text I grew up with and memorized most of my childhood Bible verses...  And now I have it electronically which is very convenient.
5	1366156800	Love this author!!  :-)Given the accessibility of my Kindle, I was delighted to add The Holy Bible to my library.
5	1366156800	How could anyone go wrong with the Holy Bible.  So nice to be able to take kindle and find the books so easy and also easy to enlarge the letters.
5	1365984000	This version of the bible is great. It's been very easy to use on my kindle. The price is also right.
5	1365811200	It is a good Bible to read. you would like is. I hope you enjoy it and learn about more about God.
3	1365724800	So this book is about a guy who creates a universe and becomes so disappointed in his own creation that he forces his son to live in it for 32 years, and then he kills his son.  It's kind of long, but there are some exciting parts about getting to kill children who backtalk, talking donkeys, and creatures called angels who are made up of 4 different animals with 4 different heads.  I wouldn't recommend this book for children because of all of the violence, but if you like fantasy, you might enjoy this book.
5	1365724800	How do you review something that doesn't end and is exciting, consoling and heart wrenching all at the same time.  I read it constantly.
5	1365638400	Just as expected.  Once again Amazon does not fail.  Another great book for my collection and a great experience.  Thanks, as always!
5	1365638400	The King James version has always been my standard and I really enjoy having it on my kindle device. It's great for quick and easy reference . It's also right there when any free time pops up for reading.
2	1365638400	With all due respect to the author, God, the KJV translation is quite archaic and difficult to read and understand. Much more research has been done since the time when the KJV came into being and theologians are much better equipped to translate the original documents. I tried the New American version and found it to be infinitely easier to digest.
5	1365638400	I love this book! It is very manageable, and I like the fact that you can search the scriptures more easily.
5	1365552000	I really like the way you can navigate to an exact verse and chapter without having to thumb through an entire chapter just to get there.
5	1365552000	Easy and fast to download.  No garbage attached to the download.  Easy to find verses and to use search mode.  I like having the Bible at my fingertips.
5	1365552000	I have two versions of KJV, I am not sure which one I use more than the other one but this one works fine as well.
5	1365465600	i bought this to read on my tablet when carrying my Bible is not convenienti highly recommend buying an app for your phone or tablet
1	1365465600	This book has not been indexed yet, I can't even search for any word thus the description is totally fake.
5	1365465600	I bought this and downloaded on my Kindle. It has been wonderful to have with me all the time and read when I want to or need it.
5	1365465600	I love this bible.  I use it in church every Sunday.  Easy to use and search the scriptures. Very great product
5	1365465600	God is always by are side day or night.This book is a great way to learn about God.And one of my favorite places in the bible is John 3:16
5	1365465600	Well Done as to access and wonderful reading I enjoy it very much daily and it is my constanct companion
5	1365465600	I like this because it is not as bulky as my bible and when I compared it to my printed bible(book) it had the same meaning.  I would recommend this to anybody that needs their bible on an electronic device.
5	1365379200	This is so convenient! And the navigation is great!For the simplest, surest navigation I can just go to the Table of Contents and page forward to the Bible book I want, and from there I can also select the chapter I choose. Or I can just select the book, and it starts at the beginning of the book, with chapters to choose from there. I can use bookmarks to get me wherever faster. For example, I bookmarked the Table of Contents page that get me to the New Testament faster.And Thanks to Kindle, I have many choices for font size as I read my Bible.And Thanks to Kindle, their dictionary navigation makes it so easy to learn and understand new words!What a Blessing! And it's all FREE!  Thanks Kindle!!! :)
5	1365379200	I use this all the time at church and work...I don't have to have internet to enjoy Gods holy word...Thanks Rhonda
4	1365292800	The whole book and everything was good and I love this book forever in my life and God means to me I love him
5	1365206400	The bible is the most read book in the world and no wonder. I am using this version to develop a training on religious beliefs and it was well worth the purchase.
2	1365206400	Having trouble moving from book to book and from old to new testament. It shows a table of contents, but starts at the old testament and I haven't figured it out as of yet.
5	1365206400	I have this Bible on my kindle and really enjoy it.  I like being able to mark the verse I want to go back to.
5	1365206400	The large (but not too large) print is perfect, the book is not too large to carry with me, and the price was better than the others I had looked at.
4	1365206400	I am happy with it. I found it to be easy to  read. It is also easy to find what you were looking for.
5	1365206400	Anytime I get the King James Bible in its entirety without download errors I like it. I can read when I want, but also use it for referencing.
5	1365120000	I like the way it was formatted for the Kindle.  You can easily turn to the chapter and verse you are looking for.  I like the King James Version even though some other translations are easier to understand.
5	1365120000	This item is easy to use and logically arranged for quick and easy browsing. the only improvement that I would like to see is more integrated interaction with study notes.
5	1365033600	The Love Test1. Can you love people who don't love you? Matthew 5:462. Do you love your enemy and treat them right? Luke 6:273. Do you love the praises of men more than GOD? John 12:43
5	1365033600	My daughter (12 years old) and I find it very easy to navigate search and highlight verses with this version
5	1365033600	I love this Bible! It is the best version to read. I like how you can just chose a book and chapter and it will go right to it.
5	1364947200	Americans have more Bibles then any other place in the world. We have access like this as well as the paper volumes. I like my kindle fire and being able to read the Bible almost anywhere I am.
5	1364947200	Good copy, no commentary, or self dialog, or what he &#34;thinks&#34; it says . Good version of the Bible!!!! AMEN.
5	1364947200	My wife and I are using it more and more.Still hanging on to our hard copies, some things take time to adjust to.
5	1364947200	Really enjoy having the Bible on my kindle as I have problems reading my regular Bible because of lighting sometimes.
3	1364947200	Correct me if I am wrong but, I thought all King James Version bibles were printed with the LORDS words red. The one I grew up with did. But,it was the only one I had read. So on that note,I may be wrong too. Other then that,I like it.
2	1364860800	I have used other KJV Bibles and this one is very old styled.Not what I was expecting and will probably never use it again.
5	1364774400	I could wright a long winded review with words like amen and halelujha (sp?) or bless you but really? a review on an e-book??? and the bible??? what is there to say. got it in like 70 seconds!
5	1364688000	This is honestly the best book ever as being a saved  Christian so as being a child of God I feel as if everybody should read the  bible Happy Resurrection Day
5	1364688000	I loved it! It was very spiritual. It made me feel so much closer to God. I hope you like it too.
4	1364688000	although not needing Wi-Fi it could use a search like Romans 10:17 but it has quite a grip on things like a real bible
3	1364601600	Like the ease of getting to  Books and then chapters.  Can easily get back to something you may want to reread. Plus, its big enough to see.
5	1364601600	I was excited to find the KJV in Kindle form and even more so that it has the capability to search. Although searching is a great feature, I still find it a slow process on Sunday's when I'm in service to look up a verse. So I've gone back to the good old leather and paper version.However on the bright side, it's nice to be able to pack a slim Kindle in my bag everywhere I go.
5	1364428800	The Greatest Book every written. More people should read the book. There are all kinds of books in the Bible.
4	1364428800	This is much better than the other one I bought. Every verse has location so you know where you are at all times. Easy to move to another location.
5	1364428800	I never tire of reading it.  It is my Munufacturer's manual, the perfect guide.  I give it ten thousand stars!
3	1364428800	but it will do in a pinch. this version was down loated by my daughter. i will keep it on my kindle
5	1364256000	I am enjoying the Bible.  It is a rather hard read at times but that is to be expected.  I woud reccommend it to  others
5	1364256000	Everyone should try reading the Holy Bible.Guide book to life and healthy living. Prayer is the Key but Faith Unlocks the Door!!
5	1364169600	This makes it much easier to find the verses as the preacher speaks.  Though I would like to be able to search by phrase too.  Maybe the next upgrade.  You know, when you remember 'sow the wind, reap the whirlwind' but don't know where it is.
5	1364169600	it downloaded quickly and cleanly and eceeded my expectations. i enjoy my Kindle books and have the comforted of knowing i can have any book and the tip of my finger at anytime
5	1364169600	My mom and brother loves this ,they read it every day!They love the fact that they don't have to carry the whole book with them anymore they just tuck and start moving with GOD word.
5	1364169600	I have enjoyed having the Bible on my Kindle. It is easy to find the the scripture you want and easier to read since the print is larger.
5	1364169600	I use as a reference book all the time.  Who would not like to read the Bible.  I hope this book is in every home
5	1364083200	The best one in my collection as far as being able to quickly go from one verse to another and all around good.
5	1364083200	What I like most is when you high light something, it shows you what book you are in as well as the chapter and verse.  It high lights in yellow.  You can put all the notes you want by a word.  I just found out that you can highlight a word and go to &#34;more&#34; and you can get that word everywhere in the Bible, if you want to do a word study.If I could ask for even more, it would be to be able to have more different colors to high light with. (like blue, green, orange, pink, etc.) for different subjects.  Also to be able to underline certain words.  But it's the best I've found so far and I've already recommended it on my FB.
5	1364083200	I am very happy to have this on my kindle. No more carrying around heavy Books. Very easy to use
5	1364083200	I love it.  Very easy to read.  Easy to access. I've referred it to all of my friends.  Good deal.
1	1363996800	I purchased it to read to my father during the last days of his life on earth. He was very Catholic.
5	1363910400	Nothing more to say.  The Word is powerful and I like having it at my finger tips.  It is God
5	1363910400	Great stories form great writers. I found it refreshing to read from the earlier english. While the modern english bibles are easier to read, the KJV has the poetry and rhythm that for me makes it more real and comforting.
5	1363824000	Love having this in a form that I can carry to church in my purse, and also can enlarge the print as needed.  No big bulky item.
4	1363824000	It is great to be able to have my bible on my tablet when I'm on the go. One of the best advantages is the ability look-up words and phrases. The &#34;Search Every Verse&#34; feature has eluded me. I can search for words and phrases but &#34;search every verse&#34;? I haven' t seen that one.
5	1363737600	I like this product because it is portable. I can enjoy my Bible anytime, even when a wifi connection is not available.
5	1363737600	I wanted the Bible verison on my Kindle because sometimes I don't carry my Bible and it is very convenient to have.
5	1363737600	I downloaded this digital Bible last night when I really needed it. I had left my physical Bible at work, and just needed to do some reading to lift me. It is and was a blessing. I greatly enjoy the King James Version. Thank you, to whoever made this available.Have a blessed day!
5	1363737600	I now take my Kindle to church!  It's fast, easy and convenient!  Love the King James Version!  Would recommend it to a friend!
3	1363737600	Not the easy Bible to use.  It is hard to look verse up and us the other features and I know it will be used.
5	1363737600	Good Bible for our daughter to use for Bible class and is holding up good for a child to use.
5	1363737600	I use this app very often and find that its easy to navigate.  I would recommend this app to others for reading on the go or for casual Bible reading.  I haven't researched on this app so I can't speak for that aspect, but I enjoy doing my daily Bible reading with this app.
5	1363737600	What can I say.  I downloaded the Bible to my Kindle.  I love it.  My husband and I both take the Kindle to Bible study and church now.
3	1363737600	It's a little hard to locate passages quickly or to move from one book to another.  The search function takes FOREVER!  Would like for it to be formatted like the written Bible--instead the verses all run together like paragraphs in spots. (The verses are still noted--so this is not a big problem.)  Would really like to see a &#34;red letter&#34; version.  All in all it works--I do use it, but it could be improved.
5	1363737600	God-  really is a good God isn't he?Love being able to read his word on the go-Totally blessed.
5	1363564800	The most awesome book ever printed...too bad not ten stars above it!! So handy to have on  your Kinlde to have wherever you are.
5	1363564800	nice to have my bible in my pocket for instant retrieval of verses or research on information contained in selected books
4	1363564800	It was just like the regular Bible but so much easier on the Kindle...Enjoyed it very much I think everyone will enjoy it..
5	1363478400	It is a joy to have a bible that I grew up with on a tablet that is easy to read and enjoy!
5	1363478400	What can I say, the writer is absolutely the best and the writings are something I try daily to live by.
4	1363392000	Search capabilities are a little odd. w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
4	1363392000	I do wish they would give some example on how to organize.  I picked my own way.  There is no instructional how to maneuver through the program.
5	1363392000	I found this Bible ease to navigate, I also like having the definitions at my fingertips. I would recommend this version to anyone looking for easy to use. The more I use it the more I like it
5	1363392000	I don't know of any other book that needs to be opened and read. I have read the Bible for over 28 years and I learn something new every day.
4	1363392000	There are occasional formatting problems but for the most part it's great.  And as regards the formatting, well I suppose it would be inconsistent to not be forgiving.....
5	1363305600	I enjoy reading the Bible. You can learn a lot about the we are to live our life's. It also can be used as a guide for our life.
2	1363219200	The translation is not accurate and poorly accessibility for use.  I ended up purchasing another product which is very satisfactory.
4	1363132800	The Holy Bible KJV was very easy to navigate. I like how easy it was to find scriptures and how my place was saved for studying.
5	1363132800	I am reading through the Bible this year and this version is a great help in understanding the great words.
5	1363132800	i mean its the bible kind of hard to mess that one up.  Im sure to enjoy it more when I get my kindle hd
5	1363046400	This version was simple direct and able to download into both my Kendle and into my iPad.  Easy to jump from page read and to home page to see the books and chapters
5	1362960000	King James is the only tranlation I will use because of the witchcraft used in all of the other modern translations. This one works well for searching out what you are looking for. Gods word is the only source of true knowledge worth knowing.
5	1362960000	I chose this rating because it is the Bible.  I like it because it is the Bible.  I would recommend it because it is the Word of God.  What better book to recommend to a dying public than the Living Word, the Bible.
5	1362873600	The Word of God is the will of God. Wondering what God's will is for your life? Read His Word. Need help? Find me on Facebook.
5	1362873600	Love the author! I know He spent a lot of time and effort compiling all the wonderful works it contains.
5	1362787200	Used for Bible study at church and share groups. The Kindle is had to use since I have the original version.  It would be great to have a mechanism to trade in old Kindle for a new version.
3	1362787200	I have used it and it has everything in it that I love. Very educational and can help you learn things.
4	1362787200	have a few issues/quirks with the functionality at times, but I enjoy being able to look up something on the go when I don't have my bible with me.
5	1362700800	I love reading the truth, now I have it with me at all times.  So I can access it when I need it.
5	1362700800	It's the Word of God as we have read it in English speaking countries for 400 years. Though I prefer a different version for my own personal study, this has been very helpful to have at hand for whenever I wanted to check something out.
2	1362614400	The verse search feature doesn't work on Kindle fire HD, all you get is a location number, anywhere between 1 and 37320, but no verse addresses can be typed in???
5	1362614400	What can one say without risking eternal damnation!! Having this on my Kindle is the best! I can read Psalms on my way to work to help me get my mind in the right state to deal with the daily B.S.
5	1362528000	I love using the Kindle to take the books with me. I love the Bible and what it means. I will be more than glad to recommend this one to any other person for constant reading and support.
5	1362528000	What can i say, i love this app, It work's great and i have no complaints. It is very easy to use and it has brought me hours of enjoyment. I would recommend this app to all.
1	1362528000	This book should never be read while wearing rose colored glasses and should also contain a mandatory disclaimer that many of the rules promoted are actually detrimental to humanistic values.
5	1362528000	I gave this book a 5 star I am able to learn my books of the bilble which is very important to me.
5	1362441600	I downloaded it loaded it on my Kindle which I always have with me.. easy to use..convenient to carry .
5	1362355200	It was our first time to ever use a bible on our Kindle Fire.  This app is simple and easy to use, and you can't go wrong w/using the KJV.
4	1362355200	Its hard to navigate but otherwise it isn't to bad.  I would recommend it to other readers if they were interested in a Bilble for their kindle
4	1362355200	Helps in studying and understanding what I am reading. Searching is great for every verse that I can learn what the meaning of each one is.
5	1362355200	Good book and very convenient to search verses.Worth the price.Very convenient to read it in my kindle DX.
5	1362355200	Daily reading of our Bible helps us grow in our faith, this Kindle Bible has helped me do it much faster,I am looking forward to carry my Kindle to my Sunday Service
4	1362182400	It could use more search options, but over all, it's a good program. I would still recommend it to anyone to download.
5	1362182400	I LOVE having my Bible on my Kindle fire!!! Very easy for reference and study! It's a great asset to my book collection! The Most important knowledge I read daily!!!
5	1362182400	This is God's word, so obviously it is AWESOME! Thank you Amazon, you couldn't have provided me anything better than this! I am so happy to have HIS word with me everywhere I go, right on my tablet!
5	1362096000	As always God's Word is a 5 star at least.  This is a good Bible on Kindle and well worth the price.  You'll be glad you began reading it for sure.
5	1362009600	the holy bible is just as good as reading from the actual book form, but very convenient. I love it.
5	1362009600	This is one of the unintended funnies of amazon.com rate-it system. I get to rate the King James Bible? OK, some really boss characters, wild plots and sub plots, rousing conclusion. Get this one, it has been a smash hit since King James!
5	1362009600	This is for my Kindle and I am grateful to have this avenue to read it when I travel without having to bring my big Bible with me.
5	1362009600	Great version, easy guide, easy to use, love the maps, loved the cost, easy to read, the search is great
5	1361923200	I love that I have this on my kindle that I can use in church, at work or anywhere that I want to.
5	1361923200	I enjoy reading my bible reading. I was given a tablet for Christmas and I can read in bed even in the dimness of the room.
2	1361923200	Good story but kind of mixed up. Not plausible either. The description does not label this "fantasy" but it clearly is. Also, not fit for young children or the mentally unstable.
5	1361836800	I like the grander English usage to compare with the more modern versions of scripture as the comparision helps to clarify the passages being studied
3	1361836800	I like the tools to search and to find Bible verses.  The complaint I have is that you can't turn back to pages you have read while reading.  Overall it's pretty good.
1	1361836800	While the English is good, it strays highly from the original texts of Greek and Hebrew.It still attributes the Gospels and some of the letters to falsely assumed authors, when these are mostly anonymously written. The two genealogies still don't match up, though I know that changing the text to match would be forgery. The Genesis account claims people lived to be 500, even 900+, years old. There are talking snakes, donkeys, and 7-horned beasts. Each resurrection story differs on who is actually at the grave. Mark still includes a resurrection story, when the oldest of original texts do not include it. The supposed letters of Paul differ on theology: In one instance he says there is no difference between woman and man, but in 1 Timothy he essentially tells them to STFU. In Numbers 31, their god tells the godly to kill all men, women and boys, but to kidnap and rape the little girls.This is a horrible collection of barbaric books, and should not be considered a moral code. The complete collection (which spans 2000 years of fables, commands, murder, rape, revenge, cheating, and myths) is horrible and should be discarded immediately. However, ALL should read this silly book before burning it. You will not get pass Leviticus without spewing.
5	1361836800	Wanted to have a good Bible on my Kindle. KJV was not my first preference but since I couldn't afford the NIV I got it. So appreciate having the entire Bible available in such an easy to carry way (Kindle)
5	1361836800	I only use the KJV and thank GOD HE preverved it.  I think that every born again Christian should use it Only.
5	1361750400	WHEN DOING MY STUDY FOR THE WORD OF GOD IT HANDY WHEN I'M ON THE COMPUTER TO FIND WHAT I WANT QUICKLY.
5	1361750400	Easy reading, I like the being able to highlight the notes. This is the best virtual book I've ordered yet.
3	1361750400	I do not necessarily feel there is anything wrong with the book as I just have difficulty understanding the translation and who like to find another version of the bible I would be more comfortable reading.
5	1361750400	It is great having the Holy Bible on my Kindle. This is a great read, you can't go wrong with the Bible. So much power on my Kindle, this is a must book to have.
5	1361664000	Plenty of choices old and new easy to read and understand. I would recommend this book to all my friends..I love the format easy to follow.
5	1361664000	Everyone should get this book. It's easy to navigate, read and understand.I recommend to those that may be looking for a bible they can understand
5	1361664000	Great on my daughters kindle fire, she can take the Bible where ever she goes. A great app for everyone's kindle fire.
2	1361664000	There is no table of Continent and it is more difficult to navigate than any other Bible that I have on my Kindle.
5	1361577600	This is the authoratative Word of God! There is no comparison of any other book that is factual and describes the God people are looking to know. This is truly God and His Son revealed in the KJV Bible!! Buy it and get to know who God really is-God manifest in the flesh in Jesus Christ!
5	1361577600	Just what I needed - a Bible for devotions while on vacation without having to carry my personal Bible and risking having pages torn, bent, getting wet, etc., while traveling for 16 days. It will be a great way for me to look up my highlighted versus as well for reference.
5	1361491200	Thankful to have this Bible version added to my kindle, this format is simple to navigate. Would recommend it to any who are trying to decide which Bible to download.
5	1361404800	It does great on our notebooks.  My husband has macular degeneration and he can enlarge the type and change the background to black and see the words very clearly..
5	1361404800	Great reference Bible and easy to use  has great resources very complete and extremely helpful for those doing bible studies or research
5	1361404800	This is a good bible to download. It is easy to use and has a lot of useful data for research.
5	1361318400	i love this bible to take to church. i can high light the pastor's message and make notes in it.
5	1361318400	I carry my bible but while commuting on the train find it hard to hold on and turn pages; downloading it to my nook made it so easy to read and turn the page one handed. thanks
4	1361318400	I downloaded this to my kindle for only $0.99. A great buy and I use it alot to read the bible. I have several translations on it.
5	1361232000	I am still learning how to get around in it.  But I love having it. It is great having the bible with me where ever I go.
5	1361232000	Overall great experience cheap easy to use good layout. One thing that is tough in selecting media like this is indexing the Bible is a large Book as far as pages and indexing is important when your trying to do a quick search i would give this version a 10/10 I hope this helps.  Greatest Word every given
5	1361232000	I can find each book and chapters easily.  I love how easy it is to change the size of the print.  I can read God's Word anywhere.  I recommend this KJVBible to everyone who loves to know Jesus Christ personally.
5	1361145600	Easy to navigate and life changing. There is no better book written. Everyone should really read it and see what it does for them.
5	1361145600	I am very into the history and my own ability to understand what it  is asking me to do.and I just injoy the reading
5	1361145600	I love this version of the Holy Bible. King James version that is. You can search for every verse.go to any chapter of the Bible. And it was like .99 cents from Amazon! I use it on my Kindle keyboard style ebook reader at church. Although I still have my Bible with me. Don't give up reading the Bible through the book cause it will bring you a sense of enjoyment and comfort. I definitely recommend this and Amazon. You want be disappointed.
5	1361059200	This is a very worthy edition.  I like the way I can move around from Chapter to Chapter.  I use it on a daily basis
1	1360972800	I learned that you can learn many things in the bible but mostly love, Faith , and the belief of God. U must have Faith in him an  d remember he will always love you and be there do you. Naruto the first time in English dub to get free books free games in English dub too. Thank you!!!!!God is wonderful to me I love church and learning about Jesus./(**)/ |(**)/ ANIME IS AWESOME!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!
4	1360972800	Very good; easy to search or locate chapters. I only wish you could mark or highlight verses on page or make notes.
5	1360886400	In this book you will find a real life . A life where there are no lies except by Satan ,but God never lies,you can always know you are loved completely.
3	1360886400	Good Bible, however I wish the sarch function and process whs mire efficient and effective. Otherwise, great Bible for service
4	1360886400	I purchased this Bible as a reference for me on my Kindle.  I'm not a big fan of the KJV, but I did like the search feature that it uses. I use this version as a comparison for some other versions.
5	1360800000	I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an excellent Bible resource. I use this product on my phone for easy bible reference and I can't imagine what it would have been like without it
5	1360713600	I love reading the Bible, this is a good version. I encourage people to read it, and if you cant understand it, find someone to teach you. It holds the way of life.
1	1360713600	This book is horrible. It makes no sense, is full of contradictions, seems cobbled together and the main character, yahweh, is horrible; always killing, helping to wipe out entire races of people and soooo full of himself. It stinks. Total waste of time
2	1360713600	I see none of the tools that were promised to aid in studying,  I thought there was supposed to be a complete and easy to use concordance
4	1360627200	I've become accustomed to doing my Bible study on the internet and was searching for an edition to down load to my Kindle.I like that I can go to any specific book,chapter verse; but I also thought I was getting a concordance with this edition.  So I was disappointed not to find it.However it IS the Bible and I can use it until I find a better edition with a concordance in Kindle.Vondi Howe
5	1360627200	Everyone needs to read this book,,,,,,all your answers are in the book.  A guideline to all your problems and how you should deal with them.  Trust in the Lord is the biggest thing and the Holy Spirit will do the rest.
5	1360627200	I bought this for $.99 for my Kindle that I received as a Christmas gift.  It is FULLY searchable, and just a really great way to carry God's word with you.  Makes it so user friendly, it's unbelievable.  Would HIGHLY recommend for anyone who wants to carry Scripture with them without the weight of a big, thick book!
5	1360627200	A must for all. The first thing I thought about when I got my kindle was getting the Bible. I'm glad I did. I have It with me always.
5	1360627200	I loved having the Holy Bible (KJV) at my fingertips on my Kindle.  It was so convenient to use and I have been very awed by the ease in searching scriptures and being able to go to my favorite books, verses, and chapters.
5	1360540800	This bible was really good and I think you whom are reading if you should consider this one if u want the king James version and if you have one dollar.
5	1360454400	I LOVE my Kindle Bible! I can type in a word from a verse I wish to find and it will give me parts of verses throughout the Bible from which to chose . Also, I can hold my fingeron a word and it will give me a definition. My granddaughter and the kids in my Sunday School class are more likely to to pay attention to the lesson being taught if they can read it off an electronic device.
5	1360454400	We liked the low price of this Kindle Bible in KJV.  WE like that the author is listed as &#34;God&#34;, which is true, but cool to see on the Kindle listing there.  You can scroll over any word and get a fast definition to help with better understanding of the KJV.  Highly recommended.
5	1360368000	Can't go wrong with the Bible.  It is really good to have more than one version/paraphrase of the Bible.  Not disappointed in purchase.
5	1360368000	GREAT. Everyone should read this and learn what the love of God is all about. It's actually nice to have it on my Kindle Fire.
5	1360368000	I am fairly new to using the touch Kindle and needed something that was super easy for me to use and this fits the bill.
5	1360281600	It was a very good value.  It was a gift.  The price was very good.  Amazon is the best place for purchases.
5	1360281600	Use this version in church. Easy to find books/chapters that the pastor references. I no longer find the place when he's at the end of the passage.
5	1360281600	I just recently downloaded this Bible an am enjoying using it. I am still learning how to find various passages an like the ability to change the background to make the reading easier to see depending on the lighting I have when I am reading. Thanks for making it easy to download to my tablet.
5	1360281600	How could I not give this a 5. It is will always be in my Kindle when needed. I let my Mom read from the Kindle and she is sold.
5	1360195200	Always a great read anytime of the day!so covienent to have the bible light and at my finger tips.
5	1360195200	This is the first time I used kindle for Bible.  It's so easy to find verses  and you can highlight.
5	1360195200	The KJV kindle version of the Holy Bible is very nice to have when you want to do some scripture reading, fast to look up the verse u want.
5	1360195200	The best book that you could ever read!!!! The Book Of Life. It will answer all of your problems that you have in life.
5	1360195200	The KJV is what I grew up reading. The newer versions are good for studying & maybe helping you understand scriptures, but I will always stick with the KJV for my main reference.
5	1360108800	I love knowing that my Kindle has not jumped to a different passage than I wanted to read.  Each verse is abbreviated so that you KNOW you are reading exactly where you want to be - example:  GEN1:12 for Genesis, Chapter 1, verse 12.
5	1360022400	I can always have my complete Bible with me, I love this! I have definitions/ anytime without getting more books and can access any verse anytime.
5	1360022400	I like how they put all the chapters at the very beginning of each book.I didn't find anything I disliked.I would tell everyone to get this book!
2	1359936000	Its true in its written form, however if I'm using it during a sermon there's no way I can keep up with 2-3 different passages of scripture! It takes an act of Congress just to go from let's say Mark to James! To time consuming and the search engine needs to be Biblical based not secular!
5	1359936000	I really enjoy taking tablet to church so that I can find my bible references much easier than before. Wonderful!
5	1359849600	I chose this rating because this was a very good buy. I recommend this to church going adults okay you
5	1359849600	It is very easy to read on my Kindle.  It is easy to find the scripture I am looking for.
3	1359763200	5 stars because it is the word of God, but three stars because it is so hard to navigate on Kindle Paper white. It takes so much time and patience.  Not recommended for Bible studies or Church where looking up and keeping up with Pastors' reference to verses are needed.  Other than that, it was free for me, so can't complain.
5	1359763200	I like the easy reading and the price. It is easy to get to the differant chapters and verse. I would buy it for my laptop and desktop.
5	1359676800	Excellent download if you are KJV user...  can take anywhere.. Has  sync and search functions along with notes and highlighting....it is quick and very easy to use.
5	1359676800	What more is there to say.  This is &#34;The Book Of Life&#34; for me.  I read it daily and I try and apply it to my life.
5	1359676800	What can anyone say about the Living word of God.  The King James version is the gold standard of all Bibles
5	1359676800	This was purchased so that I can have quick current access with my church school class.  The younger generation likes being able to access on the computer.  So I try to have what I can available for their use.
3	1359590400	It's OK, a little harder to search through then I had hoped for,  Overall I would recommend the purchase to others.
5	1359504000	I know that there are other versions of the Bible, but I love the King James Version to read, it just flows so much better than any other. And It has answers to all the questions if one just reads and looks and thinks on what they have read. It has love stories, war, good and bad people, poetry, and future events
4	1359504000	How can you pass up a chance to review the Bible? I downloaded the Bible because it's a core volume of Western culture and I hadn't read it in a long time. I chose the KJ version because I remembered the great language. So far it hasn't disappointed, though I am only a couple books in. I have to admit that Genesis and Exodus were a lot more interesting than Leviticus, but I am determined to read every verse. Forgot how macho the old testament God was. Kept hardening Pharaoh's heart just so he could show his powers with one more plague!Having the Bible on Kindle is great because in case I forget how long a cubit is, I can go to the dictionary or to Wikipedia for more info. X-ray would be fantastic, given all the names--maybe there is an x-ray version that costs more.It was worth downloading just to have it show up in my library listing as The Holy Bible, King James Version, written by--who else?--God!
5	1359504000	This is a great download for the kindle. It is very easy to navigate and search for what you want.
5	1359417600	There's too many things to do around home, so I use time at church to read the Bible. Our church 'pew bibles' are the 'New International Version', and my only bible at home is the 'Living Bible'. Confusing going back and forth. When I found out that the NIV version was available from Amazon for my Kindle Fire, i downloaded it. I wanted the King James version for comparison, and it's also the bible I grew up with, (my son still has the King James Bible I had in the 3rd grade, 1943, and passed on to him and his family) so I've downloaded it also. The newer versions of the bible simplify some of the language, but going back to the original sometimes puts more perspective into the meanings of the passages.Thank you Amazon.
5	1359417600	it is wonderful , i always had trouble read my regular bible because of the print and poor eye sight. now with my kindle and the king james version no problem.
1	1359417600	I  could never down load this Bible. I have tried several times, and I get charged for it, but it will not download. I have had to call each time for the credit.  Could  you please check this out because I would like to order this Bible. Thanks.Elizabeth.
5	1359331200	This was an awesome purchase! I love that you can highlight and add notes! I'm glad Jesus is coming back for his children!
5	1359331200	To be able to have the entire bible on muy tablet is really a joy. I can read anywhere.Only drawback is pages are not numbered.Love the bookmarks
5	1359331200	It is awesome to have the bible right where I can access it any time, anywhere, even at work when have time.
5	1359331200	It's the Bible! I feel almost weird rating God's book. It's wonderful and easy to read. Had a little trouble finding the books of the bible but that's just because my Kindle is new.
5	1359331200	I purchased the Kindle and the Holy Bible for my husband for Christmas. The Bible is easy to read and to navigate to and from different books and chapters.
5	1359244800	I downloaded this for .99 cents and it is wonderful.  I can enlarge the lettering so I can read it more clearly and it is very quick to locate book and verse.  I love it.
4	1359244800	Love This version! It is easy to navigate and the highlight feature is Great. I love being able to highlight favorite verses. Also, I am so happy that I can make notes and as a student of the Bible I love the fact that I can access those notes for clearer understanding. Easy to navigate as well. Great Bible for my Kindle Fire HD....Always have God's Word with me!The Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV) with Search Every Verse Navigation
5	1359244800	No matter the so called defects, its a bible. Deserves 5 stars. TOC does wosk, every verse says book, chapter, and verse. (example: GEN3:8)Must buy. worth it.
5	1359244800	What can I say? It is the bible.  I like the king James version because that is the translation  I grew up with.  The familiar words are comforting.
5	1359158400	The Bible I like the fact that I can carry a Bible even if its a digital edition. fast search
5	1359158400	I would not even attempt to rate God's Word.  Just read it and apply it to your lifie.  You will be a better person for it.
5	1359158400	Whats to say, its the greatest book ever written and I highly recommend it to everyone, especially people who have never read it before.  If you can't understand it, seek out people who can help you,
5	1359158400	Very easy to read and understand.  I got this for my Kindle Fire and find that I can read it or use the audio and it's great.
5	1359158400	Incredibly easy to use and find verses you want to read.  I was completely surprised at how the kindle reader could accomodate the bilble.  very satisfied.
3	1359158400	I like my KJV Holy Bible reading, but why does it have to repeat every chapter and verse for each reading?
5	1359072000	This works great on my Kindlle Fire HD that I got for Christmas.  I take it with me for Wednesday night prayer service
4	1359072000	This certainly appears to be a good choice and I am sure I will continue to read it.Since my Kindle is usually with me at all times, this is a plus to have my Bible handy when I choose to read some more or to look up a passage as I want.
5	1359072000	All pro's no con's, it is one of the better free apps for bibilical use. Very well put together and easy to use.
5	1359072000	i love my kindle bible it's perfect and i dont have to carry my actual bible :) every where !
5	1359072000	i don't know what to say but I love it it has good illustrations in it and easy to go from chapter to chapter.
5	1358985600	This is a very easy read.  You can find what verse you want very quickly.  I would say it is a success.
5	1358985600	I have enjoyed reading the bible on my Kindle beacause it is easy to read and navigate.  I would reccomend this to anyone who has a Kindle...
4	1358985600	At first, I had a hard time navigating but it's not that bad!I would recommend this book to anyone looking to have readily available, especially in church.
2	1358899200	I brought this looking for a searchable bible and had trouble doing so.  You have to use the search option on Kindle in order to do search.  It is acceptable.
5	1358899200	How can you go wrong?  It's God's Holy Word!  Read it and know how to have eternal life.  On Kindle you can take it easily anywhere you go.
2	1358899200	I purchased this KJV Bible for my Kindle Fire. It is &#34;Optimized for Kindle.&#34; I needed the KJV for a project and was attracted to the fact that it was optimized for Kindle. However, this is not exactly what I had in mind.I am familiar with Baker Books Holy Bible, GOD'S WORD Translation (GW) which has direct verse lookup and book and chapter navigation. This option does not work on the Fire, only the e-Ink devices, but it is kind of a handy way to find a chapter and verse on those Kindle devices. I was hoping that the KJV &#34;Optimized for Kindle&#34; would be similar, except that I had hoped it would work similarly on the Kindle Fire.Well, it isn't. Instead every verse is preceded with three letters of the book title, followed by the chapter number, a period, and the verse number (all one string, e.g., GEN10.1, GEN10.2, GEN10.3). Furthermore, every verse has a line space between it and the next verse, throughout the entire Bible. Yikes!The idea for the search, at least on the Kindle Fire, is to bring up the search box, type in, for example, gen1.1, click on &#34;Go&#34;, and then receive a list of every occurrence of gen1.1 in the Bible. Thus the find report brings up GEN1.1, but also GEN1.10, Gen11.1, Gen 11.22, etc. That's for Genesis.If you wish to search for 1 Corinthians 1:1, you bring up the search box and type 1co1.1, click on &#34;Go&#34;, and then wait while the search function begins with Genesis and goes through the entire Bible until it finds all instances of 1CO1.1, 1CO11.1, etc. This takes more time than you might have if you are listening to a sermon and want to keep up with the pastor as he moves from place to place in the Bible.In my opinion, at least for the Kindle Fire, it is better to purchase a Bible version without this kind of search function and just use the provided Table of Contents. Unfortunately in this particular MOBI file, there is not one link to go to the Old Testament and another link to go to the New Testament. If you want to go to a New Testament book, you must first page through all the Old Testament books, each book with chapters listed. So some time is taken here. Still, it seems faster than using the search feature that requires typing in book letters, chapter number, and verse number.Maybe this works differently on an e-Ink Kindle; I don't know. But for the Fire, I say stick with the non-optimized version and move around more quickly through the Table of Contents feature. And, hopefully, other versions will keep the text in paragraph format, instead of disrupting reading with each verse as its own paragraph.I have downloaded several other Bible versions for use in my studies and writing. I find this &#34;optimized&#34; version to be the worse of the lot.
5	1358899200	GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, I love it! I take it to bible study. You don't need to know where to find the books of the bible. No More Page turning!!!!!!!!
5	1358899200	I love this app!  It has so many time-saving features that I love!  You can highlight words or entire passages.  When you select a word (any word), you have the option to search within the Bible, online, wikipedia, etc.  You can add your own notes to selected passages, etc.  I love that you can bookmark your page.  The next time you open the app, it automatically goes  to the place you left off.  It is very enjoyable!  I find it very easy to lose myself in God's word!
5	1358899200	God's True Word! If only this bible had Jesus words were in red, it would be great, but definitely five stars!
5	1358899200	Love having God's Word on my Kindle. So easy to read. Like the book marker and the lighted part. Thanks
1	1358812800	(This review applies to all editions.)Choosing a holy book is harder than choosing a romance novel. To help you choose, I will compare this one to another best-seller in this category, the Quran. These are the two holy books that get the most buzz around here.Based on all the marketing hype, I expected these two books would be really different. All readers like one or the other, never both, and they all HATE the other book. However, these two books turned out to be a lot more similar than their marketing led me to expect.For example, to judge from the marketing propaganda, many men choose a holy book based on how many virgins or wives they can have. If you are one of these men, you might think the Quran is the obvious choice for you. Not so! Buyers of the Bible can have lots of virgins too, and also multiple wives and plenty of sex slaves (called concubines in these holy books, which have their own special code words for dirty stuff). Abraham, a main character in this book (and also, coincidentally, in the Quran), had children with several concubines and a slave girl, while he was married to another woman. Lot even had children with his own two virgin daughters! No prudes here! Jacob, father of the twelve tribes at the center of the Bible plot, had two wives and two concubines at the same time. Solomon, another of the book's heroes, had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. Virgins are hot property in this book just like in the Quran. That's why the main character, Yahweh, always orders his followers to collect virgins after committing genocide. (One time they collected 32000 Midianite virgins!) I haven't done a virgin-by-virgin count, but my impression is that this book's virgin count is right up there with the Quran's.It's tough to keep women under control, so if you are a man, it pays to buy a holy book that puts the fear of god in your wives and lovers. Again, men might think the Quran is the clear choice here. It is full of instructions for stoning rape victims and non-virgin brides, and for beating wives. The Bible PR team thinks this would hurt US sales, so they like to give the impression that the Bible is different on this score. However, it turns out that the Bible says pretty much the same thing:"If ... the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die." Bible, Deuteronomy 22:13-21"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city." Bible, Deuteronomy 22:23-24So male buyers, you don't have to go with the competition if you want to stone women. There is an important lesson here: DON'T LET THE MARKETERS FOOL YOU! Read these books for yourself before you decide on a purchase.If you are a woman, there is not much to choose from here. My advice-- just buy the holy book that your husband or neighbors buy. And after you buy it, study it hard.As a bonus feature, whether you are a man or a woman, you can use this book to control your children, as it tells you to kill them if they talk back: "Whoever curses father or mother shall die"  Bible, Mark 7:10. What teenager wouldn't behave, with that inscribed in big Gothic letters over his or her bedroom door?Sometimes, abortions are necessary to save the life of the mother, and abortions can ensure that people don't have babies they can't raise. If you listen to the marketers, you might be thinking the Bible is a poor choice if you want to be flexible about abortions. But here too you would be wrong. Remember, DON'T TRUST THE MARKETERS, read the actual book before purchasing. The Bible is actually big on killing young children (see above) and unborn babies:"Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones." Bible, Psalm 137.Yahweh also kills virtually all the pregnant women on earth (along with their unborn babies) in a big flood. He also repeatedly orders people to kill entire nations, including all their pregnant women and their unborn babies (of course, saving the virgins--see above). Sometimes he gets mad when his people don't kill them. So apparently this is all ok with him.By the way, when this is mentioned to Bible marketers like William Lane Craig (from the "Evangelical Christian" marketing firm), they respond by saying that Yahweh did the kids and/or unborn fetuses a favor, because they go straight to heaven. Here is what WL Craig says about baby-killing, from his website:"... if we believe, as I do, that God's grace is extended to those who die in infancy or as small children, the death of these children was actually their salvation.  We are so wedded to an earthly, naturalistic perspective that we forget that those who die are happy to quit this earth for heaven's incomparable joy.  Therefore, God does these children no wrong in taking their lives."So apparently abortion and baby-killing is not only ok, but BETTER than having kids that might grow up to break some rule and not go to heaven.Another thing to consider in any holy book is its treatment of "days of rest". Those days are nice, but sometimes you might need to cook or turn on a light or lift a rock that falls on your foot. So again, you want a holy book that is flexible. Here I am afraid you are out of luck, as both these books say you should be killed for doing things like that:"They found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. ... And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones.... And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses." Bible, Numbers 15:32-56What to do with people who criticize your purchase? It can be uncomfortable to be ridiculed for buying the wrong holy book, so I highly recommend buying one that tells you to kill anybody who bought a competing title. Again, marketers would have you believe that the Quran should be your choice here, but I found the Bible has this department covered just as well as the Quran:"If there be found among you ... that ... hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them ... Then shalt thou ... stone them with stones, till they die." Bible, Deuteronomy 17:2-5"They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."  Bible, 2 Chronicles 15:12-13One downside to both books is the number of weird rules you must obey (e.g. no planting of two crops in the same field, or wearing clothes made of two kinds of threads). But don't worry, the Bible is so long that nobody actually reads the thing, so you can plausibly deny you ever saw those parts, or deny they exist. If that doesn't work, you can always say those parts were mistranslated.I have to warn you that there is a confusing change of the rules toward the end of the book, as noted by many other reviewers. Not to worry. The main character of that section, Jesus, says: "For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law [the rules in the first section]..." So as long as the stars are still shining at night, I guess you can pick your rules from either section. Polygamists and virgin-lovers will want to pay most attention to the first section.I conclude that because of their similarity, it is tough to choose between these two holy books. Their prices are also about the same, $5 to $15 + a chance at eternal damnation. Luckily there is one important difference between the Bible and Quran. You are not allowed to burn or destroy the Quran. On the other hand, after reading the Bible you can use the pages as tinder to light campfires or fireplaces, or use the whole thing as a doorstop. In this reviewer's opinion, that tips the balance in favor of the Bible over the Quran.As an alternative, you might reconsider this whole holy book genre. These books don't get updated very often (the Bible's last update was 2000 years ago) so you may prefer something that incorporates all we have learned about the world since then. (For example, it turns out the world is not flat, the earth actually goes around the sun, and humans and animals didn't just appear magically all at once!!!) I see Richard Dawkins' "The Magic of Reality" is available on Amazon; that might be a good place to start for holy book fans who want to catch up on some of the really exciting post-Bronze-Age developments.
5	1358812800	This was an excellent purchase.  I use this daily and I can carry it with me so that I may check references.
5	1358726400	I choose this rating because I am thoroughly enjoying using this product I bought in December 2012.  My only drawback is that the chapter numbers seem a bit too close and it is sometimes difficult to press the right number.
5	1358726400	First, I love the KJV of the Bible as the language is very poetic.  That being said, I wasn't sure how I would like it on my Kindle.  As it turns out, it is wonderful.  I can find any verse or reference so easily, much more so than in the printed version.  This is a real gem for anyone who likes to research contents of books in the Bible, verses, location of quotes, etc.  One is armed and ready for any Bibical discussion pro or con.  As I said, I love it.
5	1358726400	This tells how NOT to kill any one who does not agree with you.This is the best information about life.
5	1358726400	This is a great version of the Bible.  The text is very readable.  I am also able to quickly find chapters and verses.
5	1358640000	The Kindle version of the Holy Bible is an excellent resource.  It's a convenient tool when reading another spiritual or inspirational book or article.  This enables me to search the table of contents and select any referenced passage of the old or new testament.
5	1358640000	Great version. I can have my Bible with me at all times by having this on my Kindle. Very happy.
5	1358553600	I use this when I go out or while waiting for my son to get out of school. Although, I still carry my bible when I am in church, this is a great way to study when you are out and you don't want to damage your bible and cause it wear and tear. I recommend this to anyone who studies as deeply as I do.
5	1358553600	I chose five stars because this bible app is great, spreading the word of Christ. This book is great for ages 4-10.
5	1358467200	I love taking my kindle to church.  The scriptures are so easy to fine and easy to read.  I would recommend to everyone.
5	1358467200	LOVE HAVING THIS ON MY kINDLE WITH ALL MY OTHER BOOKS .  I CAN READ MY BIBLE ANYWHERE AND I KEEP IT IN MY PURSE.
5	1358467200	Great bible to have on the kindle. I have read the entire bible and hope to read it again soon.
4	1358467200	it is not as complete as i would like for it to be for a complete study guide. It is a good copy of the Bible.
5	1358380800	I have been using this since I got my Kindle. It is easy to use and I really enjoy it. Read it nightly and use it during service to follow along with Pastor
5	1358380800	Have been well satisfied for the most part with the lone exception of navigating to verses as in a concordance.  This may be more than was advertised or it may be that I just have not figured out how to accomplish this.
5	1358294400	Great version of the Bible.  KJV is the closest translation to the Hebrew Bible.  Definitely would recommend this to others.
5	1358294400	i got it because it was king james version and it has all i need.i got it for my kendel.
5	1358294400	The Holy Bible gives me all what I&#8217;m looking for in the word of God. Thanks for having EBook edition.
5	1358294400	I read this daily and use it at church service.  I love reading the Bible and this is a good one.
5	1358294400	I choose this rate because I'm a Christian and I love reading this also it gives me advice about the world
5	1358294400	nice to carry alight kindle instead of a heavy bible LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
5	1358294400	So wonderful to have this version available for Kindle. Worth taking a look at, or to simply download and trust the contents accuracy.
5	1358294400	My Kindle goes with me almost every where I go...just in case I get free time I'm ready to read or play a game.  It's a comfort to have a bible so easily accessible.
5	1358208000	This was a great addition to my Kindle Fire.  I like that each verse is noted with chapter and verse.  The Table of contents is great because you can go to the book of the Bible and then choose the chapter you want,  I like that search only requires the first 3 letters of the book with the chapter and verse seperated by a period however the period requires you to switch the layer of marks to access it.  I compare other versions to this resource an find its search superior so it has spoiled me.  This is in addition to the ability to search by a remembered phrase in the verse.  I may use other versions but go back to this one because it's the one I grew up reading and memorizing therefore I remember the phrases of verses when I search for a loved scripture.
5	1358121600	I can read while in bed with out disturbing my husband! I can also find the books of the bible easily. I would recommend this to everyone!
5	1358121600	Easy to use and very simple to download on the two Kindles we have.  Easy verse look-up and has word definitions right there.
5	1358035200	Good.....lot of gadgets to help me with.....more understanding and better to read..better optimism for the kindle fore hd..very good bible
5	1358035200	very easy to navigate using my kindle fire hd. i only use the kjv, it is God's preserved word. easy to memorize. greatest book ever written.
5	1358035200	What can I say.  The service was great and I have had no trouble with it whatsoever.  Thanks for such great service.
4	1358035200	Worked well, then locked up on a scripture search. Required new and expensive batteries. Still hesitant at times, but the keyboard is very user friendly!
5	1358035200	easy to navigate.  really enjoy the feature that lets me find the meaning of words.  would recommend it to everyone
5	1358035200	I like the bigger print on the pages.  I like the clear, concise way the books are written.  Sometimes it's not easy to decipher the text.
5	1358035200	love it! Just what I was wanting. I find it convenient.  The best ever. Don't know what else to say.
5	1357948800	love having this for my ipad and phone,  which I bring to church and follow the scripture without using their bible
4	1357948800	Very well pleased with the ability to change chapters and verses.  It is easy to read on the Kindle Paperwhite and I enjoy following along in church.  Recommend.
4	1357948800	I really like this version.  I am still learning about it but I do like that it has the dictionary to help me with words that I am not certain of their meaning.
4	1357948800	This is a great Bible with verse search on my Kindle for PC. The words of Jesus Christ are so important and weigh a bit more than the words of others. The words of Jesus Christ ought to be in Bold or Red. I found another Bible however it is only the New Testament. It is written without the verse numbers so it reads more like a book or novel. It's in Paragraph format of the King James:The New Testament of the Holy Bible King James Version (KJV) Easy Reading Edition in Paragraph Format [Verse Numbers Removed: Verseless Edition Jesus Christ Words in Bold and Red (Red Letter Edition)]. It has the words of Jesus in Bold AND in Red. Hope you like it! Enjoy!!
5	1357862400	The Best Book of all time, I love the Bible because it has precious promises from GOD and HE always keeps his word. We might not understand all His ways but we can trust HIm to do what is best for us at all times. And best of all when we leave this world,( as we all will), if we have believed in and trusted HIM he will take us to Heaven where the streets are paved with gold. There will be no more sin and suffering, broken hearts or death there.. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.read JOHN 3:16Thank you Amazon.com, for making this book available to us.
3	1357862400	This is good for daily reading. I like it but i enjoy having study bibles more. They have more details, and explain more about each verse.
5	1357862400	I love it....easy to use.  I use it at home and at church.  I would have liked Jesus talking in red like my bible is but overall I love this on my Kindle.
5	1357862400	This is a good version of the Bible.  I enjoy reading it daily.  Of course, I always enjoy the word.
5	1357776000	Love being able to keep my place in reading..I can look up verse, chapter...Easy to read, wish it had the audio version..Thank You
5	1357776000	The king James Bible was easy to read. It was easy to get to the verses and to the Chapters I needed.
4	1357776000	I really like this version because it list the books, only I wish under each book you could go to chapters.
5	1357776000	The greatest book ever written, lots of concordence and historical referances to biblical facts. A good resource for faith based study!!
5	1357689600	I like playing the game and I very much enjoy reading my NIV Bible. It was so easy getting these products and I am new at Kindle fire!
2	1357689600	I never could get the search by verse to work. Even when I used the examples given in the instructions I would receive a message 0 results for this entry. Frustrating.
5	1357603200	This is a very nice version at a great price. It has some very nice features that are easy to use.
5	1357603200	I purchased this Bible and downloaded it on my tablet so I can have easy access whenever I wanted to have it. This is PERFECT and so easy to read!
5	1357603200	I am very pleased with this e-book Bible.  It is very easy to navigate , easy to high light , and easy to take notes.  I recommend it highly
5	1357516800	For a King James Version to be used with a kindle touch I found it good and no problem to use. Just read the instructions.
4	1357516800	Great bible for Kindle. Wish I had known that the Kindle Fire was not as easy to use, wish I could navigate easier.
3	1357430400	While this version does reference+/-?? It does not have Jesus's words in red. Therefore it falls short and I don't recommend it.
5	1357430400	who would not enjoy this book, It is very easy to read and understand what you have just read. enjoy
4	1357430400	The Holy Bible, what's not to like?  I enjoy that I can quickly and easily travel from one chapter/verse to another.  When I hear comments on a verse on radio or tv, I can quickly look it up.  Love that!
4	1357430400	A wonderful rendition, particularly for academic study. . . easy to reference and annotate.  Can't beat the price for an English language classic.
1	1357430400	I didn't realize that this book contained the Apocrypha. The description mentions it vaguely (but not by that term). I only wanted to read the inspired Word of God. If you aren't Roman Catholic, this isn't the Bible for you.
5	1357344000	Having the wordof god always is a great way to relax,and think about all the wonderful things that our creator made for us.
4	1357344000	I have found this version of the KJV bible easily searchable on my Kindle Fire.  Navigation is easy and the format is good.  The only negative that I have found is that there is no concordance or study tools, as most printed bibles have.  Adding those tools would make this version a valuable and highly portable study bible.
5	1357344000	I love being able to read in large print with no glasses and easily go to the passages I want to read that day.
5	1357257600	I love this bible because I can learn about Jesus and God.  It is easy to use, so anybody who can read will find it easy to use.  I like being able to keep my place by highlighting what I have read.
5	1357257600	How could you not rate the holy words of God as fantastic.  I love having this on my Kindle so when a verse comes to mind and I can't remember it all I can look it up very easy.  No this does not replace my Bible I carry to church or my study Bible.
5	1357257600	Love having the Bible on my Kindle. It is easy to read and easy to find the scriptures I want.
5	1357257600	It is a book every one should have.  And it is great to take your bible with you for reference.
5	1357257600	Works well on Kindel and study guide I use and I use my NIV  and the KJV to see the differances between them when doing Bible Studies.
3	1357257600	i wanted something I could carry with me in my purse and this is good..i wish it had more than just the Bible verses..i  was looking for more reference....but it is still good to read...
5	1357171200	I chose this book because it is the bibleI chose this book because it is like fullI chose this book because it is of Jesus
5	1357171200	My husband bought me a Kindle for Christmas. This Bible download was just what I was looking for. It is always and will always be the greatest book ever written! I bought it because I'm gone alot or quite busy and I can use this anywhere. We traveled to see our son and his Family at Christmas and I was able to use my Kindle and read my Bible while traveling. This is a great KJV of the Bible.
5	1357084800	My boyfriend and I love to read the bible to each other as we take long car trips, having this available on my kindle was wonderful as we drove all over the state the last few weeks.
5	1357084800	what can I say, it's the Bible and it is great to have it with me all the time so I can read it where ever I am.
2	1357084800	A typical King James version of the bible that is not always the easiest to read or follow.  A contemporary bible is simplier to read and understand.
5	1357084800	This book is the manual for your life and the answer to all of life's questions.It is all you will ever need.
1	1357084800	I was excited about the search capability, but it does not work on my  version.  Executing a search as instructed in the first pages just yields the error message &#34;this title not indexed yet&#34;  i never got to experience the slow search some of you speak of because i cant get it to search for anything.
5	1356998400	The number one best selling book. My favorite book to read to get through life in good times and in the bad times. He is with me always.
5	1356998400	Love this app, we use this in church every sunday, my son has a hard time reading so this inspires him to follow along and can also look up words he doesn't understand
5	1356998400	I NEEDED THE KING JAMES BIBLE ON MY KINDLE PAPERWHITE, BE CAUSE I AM LOOLING MY VISION. I ALSO DOWNLOADED IT IN AN AUDIOBOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO READS THE BIBLE OFTEN.
5	1356912000	Love being able to read the Bible on my kindle.  Still need to find the search a verse that came with the book on my old kindle.
4	1356912000	Easy to navigate, and no 'opinions' from anyone else.  It's a Bible, what else is there to say? It's great!
1	1356912000	MAKE SURE YOU GET THE PURE CAMBRIDGE EDITION OF THE KJB, THIS IS NOT IT. ONLY THING I LIKE IS HOW IT IS OPTIMIZED FOR KINDLE.
5	1356912000	I like this product it was what I was looking for plus a good price will use it allot thank you
5	1356825600	I would recommend the King James Version of the bible to everyone. It is an excellent version of the bible. Love Jesus forever.
5	1356739200	I got this because it was free on the Kindle.  The search feature is great.  I like the King James version because I have to concentrate & slow down to get the meaning.  The modern translations are to familiar & I can easily just zip through familiar passages.I recommend reading the Bible with an intent to encounter God.  It is full of paradox & without the Holy Spirit it is easy to get enmeshed in a religious spirit that embraces certain doctrines while ignoring the counterpoints.

4	1356480000	I liked this bible for bible study and reading along in church. It is very portable and the accompanying word search is great.
5	1356480000	The reason I rate this book 5 stars is because it means everything to me. I think everybody should get this book.Read This Book And Your Life Will Change!!!!
5	1356480000	I love having the Bible on my new Kindle. I can study the layout, which is very good, access the sections I need to read easily.The Kindle allows me to read the Bible more frequently as well as carry it with me everywhere..
4	1356480000	Useful, and user friendly with Kindle.  I prefer other translations except for the psalms, many of them I memorized as a child, and still like the  style
5	1356480000	I am becoming a KJV loyalist! Other translations are good but I always see and feel more in the stories and messages in this version.
5	1356393600	VERY WASY TO USE I LIKE IT BECASUE IT WILLREAD FOR E AND I CAN FIND VERSES EASYYES I WILLRECOMMED THIS ITEM
5	1356393600	having the Bible on my kindle is so nice --- no need to carry a paper Bible --- which can be bulky and heavy --- and I have the Word of God with me at all times
3	1356393600	Bought this after having read and loved the author's award-winning late work 'Quran', but this book did not meet my expectations.While the book is full of interesting, captivating ideas and tableaus, this brilliance is offset by the repetitivenesss (could use a good editor), the inadequately developed characters and the lack of consistency, which latter leads to an episodic, chaotic narrative, making it hard to follow overarching themes and problems throughout.I tend to regard this book as more a somewhat-hasty demonstration of the author's uncanny capabilities than his magnum opus,thus I am still going to be  waiting eagerly for his next book.
5	1356307200	I had wanted to go back to the KJV, the translation of my youth, and am happy that I did.  I like being able to search for passages during the Sunday morning service, it does not take any longer than a hardbound Bible.
1	1356307200	If someone is going to advertise a "Holy Bible KJV" then by all means make it a true "Holy Bible KJV"!  What you are selling here does not contain the "original" wording of a true KJV Bible.Below are a few examples:In Joshua 19:2, many publishers have changed the correct wording from `or Sheba' to read `and Sheba.' While textual critics may want to spar over the view that the Hebrew word allows either of these combinations to be used, from a pure English position - the word `or' is not the same as the word `and.'In 2 Chronicles 33:19, the use plural `sins' instead of the correct word of `sin.'In Nahum 3:16, is another alteration to the text. Some King James Bibles correctly use the word `flieth' while others have been changed to the word `fleeth.'I hold every word of the KJV Bible to be "God's word" and true.  When someone makes changes to it (small or big) - then it makes me wonder "Why" is there a change to the original - and then can it still be called a  "KJV" since there are now changes?
5	1356220800	Remember how thin the pages are on the King James Bible  I always had trouble with my thick fingers trying to turn the pages without messing them up. I love the convenience of having my Bible in my pocket and in the palm of my hand. It is so easy to search and find a book and chapter with a swipe and tap of a finger. I love it!
5	1356134400	These books are sovereign inspirations of  I our God through revelations of men of God. I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour who sacrificed his life to save the world from sin and to those who believe they shall have everlasting life.
5	1356134400	it is easy for a first grader to understand. My husband has a problem understanding the Bible and this one helped him  A LOT!
5	1356134400	Glad to put the Bible on my Kindle.  I am a full time student and now i dont have to carry another heavy  book. I have my Bible on my Kindle. great
5	1356048000	I got this b/c it is easier to carry to church. I was surprised by how easy it is to use.
5	1356048000	I'm so happy to have all my Bibles in one place and have the ability to cross reference so quickly.  I have my versions and study on my kindle fire hd and my iPad.
5	1356048000	When we look at the things going on in this world why would you not have this in your home?
5	1355961600	I chose it because it's free, I recommend the bible for every day reading and meditation, For it is Power!
4	1355961600	it is the true and only Bible. it has the word of God with out error, and it has weathered the test of time.
1	1355875200	I like to read the Bible, but the Kindle version is not easily navigated.  I will keep it and hopefully learn to navigate it better.
5	1355875200	I find this Bible easy to search and use it often at church. It is a lot easier to carry than a paper Bible.
5	1355875200	I so happy to have a Bible on my tablet, its great for Bible school and it makes it easy to find text in Church; no more fumbling for text.
3	1355875200	lot of spelling errors, and some of the words have been changed.  Easy reading and it is in good format
4	1355875200	I use the KJV as a study Bible because of the word study references. I used it on my Kindle. I give it a 4 star rating because the Contents and look up feature is sort of cumbersome. It is necessary to go to &#8220;Contents&#8221; then view up to 15 pages of books / verse to get the desired verses. That is probably more of a fault of my Kindle without a physical keyboard than the book itself. Rollei
5	1355788800	happy with this. easy to figure out on my kindle. I am able to find any chapter quickly. I love the King James version.
4	1355702400	I accidentally ordered this version thinking I was getting the NEW KJV, but I am happy with it.  I downloaded it to Kindle, and I find it fairly easy to navigate, but not as easy as I would wish.  On the whole, it serves my purpose.
2	1355529600	It will no open on my Kindle Fire, always get an error message, so I would not recommend this for a Kindle
3	1355529600	I found this one hard to navigate with my Kindle and finally ordered one that was designed for the Kindle.  It is still difficult but not as difficult at this one.
3	1355529600	I don't like when it reads to you, it reads the verse numbers. Wish they were able to be hidden.
5	1355443200	This KJV Kindle version is set up to allow for reasonable ease of navigation as allowed by the type of Kindle I have (just the basic Kindle). That is what I wanted.
5	1355270400	It is very easy to move to different books and chapters of the Bible. The special reading version is a woderful feature. I can share verses with a small group of friends without saying a word. I have recommended this Bible to several people.
5	1355184000	I was a little concerned weather I could navigate through the books on my Kindle but it is very easy to find the book, chapter and verses I am looking for.  I love being able to carry it with me where ever I go.
5	1355097600	easy to navigate through. clear very plain printing.great price.love the king james version of the bible and this is a very good one.
5	1355097600	I love the KJV Bible and would recomend to any of my friends family and anyone close to me. It offers soul food
5	1355097600	t is easy to find different passages in it and is easy to follow along with would recommend for all.
4	1354924800	this is very easy to read and find all the books with ease i would recommend this book for all ages.
5	1354838400	The easy of finding the book, chapter & verse I want to read is great.Alot easy to find the passage my pastor or Sunday school teacher is talking about, I can focus better on what their saying rather than flipping through the actually Bible book  looking for the section their discussing.
3	1354838400	This bible was ok. But I found another one that was much easier to find the scripture and navigate and search..
3	1354752000	I like the book chapter at each verse, still cannot bring up keyboard to go to a specific book chapter verse.
5	1354752000	I am very happy with this and would purchase it again it is exactly what I was looking for.. :)
5	1354752000	It's The Holy Bible, what more does one have to say about it.  I ordered this for my Kindle and just love taking it to church. I feel so high tech when others are flipping through the pages of their bibles. I think I paid $0.99 for the Kindle version and it's great, worth every cent.
2	1354665600	I didn't really like this product because you couldn't actually search for what chapter and book you wanted I had to scroll just to find which page I wanted I couldn't just look up the book and chapter by just searching... It's not that great peoples.
5	1354579200	I use this when I am out and about and want to read the word it's perfect on my HTC Evo phone, easy to get from book to book with just a tap of your finger
5	1354579200	This has made it easy for me to study for my class any where plane office and it really nice to have large type set for the easy of reading
5	1354492800	I really love having the KJV of the Bible handy to read at any time on my new Kindle Paperwhite.  Thanks Amazon.com.
5	1354492800	Consider these twenty more words that say the same thing as the title so amazonn  will stop asking for a rating.
5	1354406400	I really enjoy this product. I would definately refer you to my friends. Thanks for your great service. Have a great day!
5	1354406400	Very pleased with ease of moving from passage to passage for comparison and then  back to originalpassage to continue reading
5	1354320000	I don't read everyday but I do read often.  Especially when I need a pick-me-up.  Psalms 23 and 121 are my favorite reads.
5	1354233600	its so easy to move around quickly in this bible. the holy bible king james version . i thank you for the offers of many selection.
3	1354233600	I Like this version the only complaint I have is the table of contents. I think it could have been formatted different.
5	1353974400	Although I use the New American Standard for serious study, I love reading the beautiful language of the King James, especially the Psalms. Hence, it was a &#34;must&#34; among the three Bibles on my Kindle.
1	1353974400	I do not like that the Table of contents does not come up each time it is opened. It wil bookmark but there are times when I may not be reading in order.
5	1353801600	It's still the word of God but not easy to get around in it. I have the kindle keyboard and its quite cumbersome to get to different passages using the keyboard.
5	1353801600	I down-loaded this version to my Kindle.  I love the poetic verse of King James.  Now I can tote my Bible with me on my Kindle and read whenever I want to.  I don't have to have multiple books, just my Kindle, with my most important book, my Bible!
5	1353801600	The Bible has the answers to all your problems. Seek God's blessing and through prayer and worship you will get what you need. Love yourself and others so God can love you. Don't lie to yourself for God knows the truth instead confess and repent for all would be forgiven. Follow the right path to the promise land and with God's guidance you shall get there. Those are some of the lessons I learned in the Bible. As a Nigerian pastor's daughter I was raised to know God. In getting too know him it once made me cry when I realized how much God loves me. He loves you too for we are his children. Read this Bible and you shall be on the path to success. May the good Lord Bless You. Amen.
5	1353715200	It is so much lighter than carrying the paper version to church.  It is good at searches but it is slow to find a book, chapter, and verse int he new testiment.  I just go back to the front and find the book and click on it there.  Much faster than the search.  But I love the large print; nice for us older readers.
5	1353715200	It's great to have the bible on my kindle.  When I'm in church I turn to the scripture and read along just fine.  When I'm home I can do extensive bible study making notes and highlighting scriptures as I continue.
5	1353628800	This the first book everyone needs to read from each day. There's are love stories, stories of a mothers,brothers sisters and fathers love. War, good and bad guys.
5	1353628800	I am very happy to have selected this product.  It is user friendly and very easy to read on my kindle fire HD.  I use it on a daily basis and it is very convenient for use at home or when traveling.
5	1353542400	id like to have option to take notes or bookmark verses but other than that great. thank you silas billington
5	1353369600	It is wonderful having the Bible on my kindle.  I'm able to pull it out anywhere and read God's word.
5	1353369600	I have many printed versions of bibles, in several shapes/sizes/editions. But always keep coming back to King James Version. The flowing, musical versions of psalms and some of the well known passages in the new testament, sound so much better in old English than in the modern translations. The amazon price is really good for this version of Bible.I wanted the Kindle version, since I read mostly on Kindle/computer now, and only read existing paper books that I own.If however, you want it free, here's a link.[...]This is possibly the only book I give 5 stars too, all others come to 0-4
5	1353369600	I have been using this in church and it is easy to use and make notes with. I would recommend
5	1353369600	This is great I can make the font any size and my mother is able to read the Bible again.
5	1353283200	It's the living word of God.  Follow it's words which are the words of our Lord.  Let him lead you.  Amen.
5	1352937600	There is no other book that will show you how to save your soul from hell. Jesus Christ lord of all. There is no greater name. We praise you lord.
5	1352851200	Received on Kindle, I added this to my kindle for travel.  Have not used it enough to rate it. Thanks
5	1352851200	I give this product a five star, I could easily navigate through this book, without interruption or confusion.The Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV) with Search Every Verse Navigation
4	1352851200	I find that this version is not so easy to maneuver as other versions that I am used to.  I don't use it very often.
5	1352764800	My dad is going blind and I found a Kindel Fire on Amazon. He misses reading his Bible most so that's what I downloaded first. He loves it and is now able to read with my mom every morning.
4	1352592000	I never had a particularly photographic memory. This is a wonderful way to find the tip of your tongue but, "lost in space" verses.Seek and ye shall find
4	1352505600	I am pleased with this book. It would be nice to have Jesus words in red.I like table of contents.  It would be nice to have a few cross-references. I have several versions but kjv is my choice.
4	1352419200	Convenient search by book and verse. Works well on IPad. Easy to carry to church. However it lacks a good topical index.
5	1352246400	Very useful with good features. Has word definition's, bookmarks and if I get tired of reading I just let kindle read to me.
3	1352073600	Love the book, just wish I could go from Book/chapter/verse  a lot quicker. Too slow to take to bible class.
5	1352073600	This Bible is PERFECT for Kindle use. The search is sooooo easy to use! Actually, many people use Bible apps on their cell phones because they're quicker than flipping around a couple thousand Bible pages and this is actually quicker than the app on my cell phone. Anyone who struggles with this clearly has not taken the time to figure this out.It might be confusing at first, but when you figure it out, you'll be the fastest person in church. ;) When I'm in my Sunday youth group, I'm generally the first person to find a verse because rather than flipping through a large book or having to scroll around on my cell phone, I just type in the first few letters and I'm good to go. It's also helpful in searching for particular verses when you know some of the words but don't know where it's found.I don't know what other people are talking about with only being able to use the table of contents. I NEVER use mine because searching is so incredibly easy!And since every verse is labelled according to book, chapter, and verse, I always know where I am without having to scroll around. This is also the reason why it's so easy to search.The only thing I don't like is that occasionally I want the built in reader to read to me. Since every verse is labelled, I have to hear "GEN1.1 In the beginning..." with every verse, which is kind of annoying. I can't really blame the Bible for that one, though, because that is the reason why searching for verses is so easy in the first place.
5	1352073600	My gosh one of the best yet. I can read the Bible without even getting out the book. I can just grab my kindle and read with ease. Thank you kindled fire
5	1351987200	I rate this KJV 5*!It's the traditional Bible with which I'm most accustomed.I especially enjoy the research part of this Bible which is most convenient for those of us who do daily Bible study.
5	1351900800	Easy to read. Easy to find verse and chapter desired. Love having such easy access to the word. Would recommend for anyone wanting to read the word of God.
5	1351900800	l love this book.it is so great.everyone should have one of these magnificent bibles . kindle books are something  that you can take everywhere and the bible is one of the best
5	1351900800	Love this product, gives me access to read the Bible sitting in class, in the car or wherever I may be.  easy to follow features, awesome product.
5	1351728000	I find this Bible Edition very easy to use, especially when looking for a particular bool, chapter and verse. I use this edition when I am traveling it is easier then carrying a hard copy
5	1351641600	Loves the text and easy to read, its easy for him to access since itsan app for him on his ipad. Loves how it always stays right on the pagehe left previously.
5	1351641600	How does one review the King James translation of The Holy Bible and not think that this is the greatest story ever told?  Everyone should download the good news!
5	1351641600	I enjoy being able to use with my tablet, G r e a t  B I B L E ;
4	1351468800	This kindle version of the Bible is very easy to use.  Navagating around is simple and fast.  I highly recommend this Bible.
5	1351468800	This is a wonderful bible.  Each verse of scripture is identified.  Navigation is quick and easy.  I like the fact that I can read or listen to a passage of scripture.  If you're searching for a KJV kindle bible, this is the one to purchase.
4	1351468800	I like the kindle version of the KJ bible, it is easy to navigate and the price was right!!! I would definitely recommend to others to buy.
5	1351123200	It is so simple to search and go directly to the different books of the Bible. Of the chapters that I have read it appears to be perfectly done in accordance to my actual hand held Bible.
4	1351123200	First off, its very nice to have the bible on that go in a small size.The search feature is not all its cracked up to be, but i'm using a smart phone and not a kindle, so maybe its better or worse i don't know. Either then that, I have no complaints with it.i do recommend this to anyone who wants to bible in a travel size. download the kindle app for you respective device and buy it ;) its worth the $0.99.
4	1351036800	Once you read the directions (a must) the Search Navigation is very easy to use and I am a fan of the King James Version of the Bible.
5	1350777600	I was very pleased with this Kindle book - there are times I can't carry my Bible with me and this is much easier. THe indexing function makes it quick to find verses. Well done.
5	1350518400	I purchased this Bible from Amazon to use in my Wednesday morning Bible reading class. I have found that the display on my Kindle is so easy to read, and the Kindle version of this Bible makes it so easy to move around to the different books of the Bible during class. I am loving my Kindle and this Bible,
5	1350432000	I downloaded this version of the Holy Bible because of navigation of verses capability.  We are taking a Bible study course at our church and I felt that it would be helpful.  I use it frequently and find it easy to use and navigate.  I am very satisfied with it and especially with Amazon for making it available.
5	1350259200	I enjoy having both the NIV Bible and the King James Bible on my Kindle as it is easy to switch from one to the other.  Most of the Bible verses I learned in Comformation Class were in the King James Bible and it is very reverent and special to me.I was happy to get these from Amazon.
4	1350172800	This is a wonderful book of course...It did take some time to navigate on kindle....I think instructions could be simplified. I am a new kindle user so I was learning how to navigate kindle and there were some unusual ways to navigate inside the KJV...Once I became accustomed to moving about and searching , I think it is a wonderful resource.
2	1349827200	This product while good is still too slow (is it the Kindle or the product?). You can search for another text but it takes way too long. You can go back to the table of context and find the reference you need long before the search is over. I have a little electronic Bible that is way faster and gives you more options for searches than this. Not a good tool for serious Bible readers/searches.The Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV) with Search Every Verse Navigation
5	1349827200	There is no version better than the God Inspired KJV. The KJV is the absolute Word of God and all the other versions "water down" and leave out key text. Great read!
5	1349827200	The Incomparable Word of GodNowhere else in the world can there be found prophesy, a plan for the salvation of created mankind, and the fulfillment of that prophesy and plan. In my Kindle I carry this comfort with me everywhere I go, accessable to me anytime I desire it. Just think of this, there is no such thing as death for those who believe in the shed blood of the Lamb of God. John 3:16 For God so loved the world, He gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. When I am weary I recall and read this Psalm of David. Psalms 23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. These two passages are the anchor of my life and have seen me through much doubt, confusion, and personal tribulation. I hope you will read the Bible too, and find salvation and peace such is only known to sleeping infants and sleeping kittens.
5	1349654400	This book is awesome and very informative.I am amazed with this book and i would definitely recommend this book to everyone and sure it will be useful for your life.This is my favorite bible available for the Kindle!!!
5	1349654400	I am truly enjoying using my Holy Bible on Kindle.  It is so easy to carry with me and use it whenever I need to.  While there is nothing like holding a real Bible in my hands, this is very convenient when I am on the go.  I especially enjoy it on Sundays in church.  It is quick and ease to use.  Great idea.  Great product.  It fits right in my purse; therefore, I don't have to carry the extra book carrier along.  I am really enjoying my Kindle Holy Bible.
5	1349568000	This is super Bible program.  It works well on my Kindle Fire HD, having just returned from a retreat and used it all weekend.  Easy to go from one book or chapter to another.  Because the screen goes blank after an interval of not using it, I found it useful to put my pinkie on the screen and move the page back and forth slightly every so often to keep the page up and running. Love it.
4	1349481600	This version seems very accurate and is easy to navigate the verses.. Love this version for the Kindle.  Would recommend this version to my friends and family
5	1349308800	This Bible is a wonderful guide  to daily living. It tells us how we are to present. Ourselves before those we come in contact with in our walk of life.
4	1349222400	I bought this Bible because I use the Kindle Fire outside of North America and as such I could not purchase any Bible app. I am pleased with this purchase as I am able to use the bible as a book on my Kindle and get all the functions such as highlight and note which functions that are useful to me.
5	1349136000	I was extremely happy with this purchase. It was easy to find the scriptures I was looking for especially during church services.
5	1349049600	It is wonderful and very easy and fast to find any book or any verse in the Bible. I have another version that does not have this feature and it is cumbersome. Also I like the chapter and verse is at every paragraph so you know where you are in the Bible.!
4	1349049600	One of my friends has a Kindle with the keyboard and she didn't like the Bible she had because it was cumbersome to navigate.  When I read that this one was easy, I got it and I love it.  It really is easy to find verses and maybe easier than her Kindle as I have the plain, simple one.  It was helpful in one of the reviews I read that once you put in the verse you want, hit your center directional button twice.  That is what I do and it's great.
5	1348963200	This is a great version of the bible! Certainly a must have! :) It was very easy to search on my Kindle! :) I recommend this to anyone searching for a good version of the bible, or just for some daily encouragement! :)
5	1348963200	Very easy to find books, chapters and verses....  I love using my new KING JAMES KINDLE FIRE BIBLE..  Love the hilights.
5	1348531200	I am reading my Bible from brgining to end, but with arthritis in my fingers it is hard to hold it in my hands when I read. I decided to get the Kindle version and couldn't be happier. It has saved my fingers and made reading so much nicer.
5	1348444800	The Word of God will bring Life to all.  Bible study is necessary for every Christian ("Study to show thy self approved").  Kindle makes it easy to bring the Word every where you go.  I enjoy this very much.
5	1348272000	What more can I say? I love my Kindle. My Strong's Exhaustive Concordance weighs 2 to 3 pounds and the print is small. Paid $40 for my Bible 30 years ago. Now I have both in one affordable light device with large print.
5	1348185600	It is easy to search and I use the text to speech so that it reads to me while I am driving the car.
3	1347840000	While you can look up any verse with this edition, you cannot "page" to read any verses after or before it.  To do this, you need to go the the table of contents, select the book, the chapter, and find the verse.
2	1347580800	I did not like this bible as I wanted the NLV version and could not find it. I settled for what I thought was the right version but was disappointed when it wasn't the one I wanted.
2	1347494400	I don't really like the setup of the pages and index. The chapters kind of run together and there's not a clear, professional separation between them. It would be nice if the pagination were a little sharper and better contrasted.
4	1347148800	I purchased this mainly so I would have the bible look up things when I came across verses randomly out in the world.  It is very fast to look up what you need!  I also use it at church in place of bringing my family bible around.  I find this is lighter and I never for get my phone.  Great addition to my collection of growing books.  Thanks Amazon!
5	1347148800	I love no other book than the holy bible, whatever u are facing its in the bible to read and give u comfort
5	1346976000	Very easy to navigate. Easy to get the meaning to something you dont know. I can have my Bible anywhere I go. Still dont take the place of the real thing but God put things here to help us know His word.
5	1346889600	I had tried a couple other Bibles for my Kindle, but found this one to be much easier to navigate.  I like having the Bible with me whenever I want to read it, and this one is the easiest to use that I've seen.
5	1346889600	Truly a great book for free>it met my expectations and beyond.If you really want a great Bible to read on your ereader this is it.
5	1346889600	its a pretty good version of the bible. i think the search every verse navigation was really cool and helpful.
5	1346889600	I like this version because it has the new and old testament. But some links on the litature section on the index on a iPad will not work. I have no problem on the iPhone.Nonetheless, it works great
5	1346889600	Great price, downloaded quickly, and it's the Bible.  What more can I say?The process of loading and using is easy.Bob
5	1346889600	As always the KJV is wonderful. What other book can you read that when you need them, the author is there?!
5	1346889600	this book is easy to read and understand, i like the way it is worded,you can easily and more quickly go thru a chapter , before you know it, you are finished. plus  the retention span is great! I have a regular KINDLE and would like to read and read, and read, but there is no light on the window. Just imagine,wanting to read the bible every chance you get and enjoy doing so!
5	1346889600	Excellent, easy to read & understand, as an e-reader I can make the font as big as I need to without having to invest in a "large" print version.
5	1346889600	This is a great way to be able to study the bible everyday. I can search any word and then read every scripture involved, such a wonderful tool.
5	1344556800	I have enjoyed my Kindle King James Bible very much.  I appreciate that you can enlarge the size of the letters for easier viewing for my elderly eyes.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a Kindle.Thansk so much. Very much worth the price I paid for from Amazon.  Very pleased customer.
5	1344211200	Great, provides me with scriptures at my finger tip.  Makes reading the bible easier, because I can find the scriptures faster than leafing through my personal bible.  I can also share the viewing of my scriptures by making the font large enough to share with those who may have forgotten their bible or reading glasses.
5	1343952000	Great Bible tool!  Extremely easy to navigate and fast response when searching for any verse or keyword.  I keep this Kindle version next to me at all times for easy access in moments of need.
5	1343779200	THIS WAS MY FIRST DOWNLOAD FOR MY KINDLE. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE. I LOVE IT.I'M ABOUT TO DOWNLOAD MORE TITLES.
5	1343692800	I have been searching for an e-reader KJV Bible.  I have tried many, but this one is the very best, in my opinion!!  Enjoy!
3	1343606400	Love it.  Great to just read through.  Not the best option to use trying to follow someone giving sermon or lession.  No easy way to quickly look up a particular passage without scrolling around.
5	1343520000	I was looking for a KJV download for my Ipad and this one is great-simple to use. The price was right too!
4	1343347200	I really like this app for reading my bible, its easy to use and you can change the font and screen color(I use it on my kindle fire), You will definitely like this free bible app.
5	1343174400	A friend introduced me to Kindle and using an e-reader due to my vision problems and arthritis in my hands.  She said I could get the Bible downloaded and when I saw how wonderful it is to see and use, I just love it.  I also like the ease of obtaining books, though at this time I have not added any.  I hope to in the future and I know Amazon is the place to go.  Thanks.
5	1341619200	I have been reading the bible everyday now. I am hooked because on the kindle on my cell phone allows me to change the font and text size as well as read it at any time that I want. I love to read the bible and now I get to read it at any time..any where. Awesome.
3	1340064000	My wife isn't thrilled with my selection because it's not the NIV version. I've gone back to look for the NIV version, but haven't had much luck finding it. So I guess I goofed! In addition navigating the book is difficult and requires going back to the beginning to find what you are looking for.
5	1339372800	I am a biblical historian, so it's important that I keep a copy of each bible at hand whenever I need to reference a verse. Naturally, the Kindle has made this a lot easier for me, but not all bibles available for the Kindle are "user friendly". This KJV bible is incredibly easy to navigate, and with that being the utmost important thing for people in my field of interest, this version deserves a full 5 stars.
5	1339200000	I recently purchased the Holy Bible, KJV for my kindle, and was extremely impressed with how easy it is to navigate through and to certain passages.  It is by far the easiest navigation I have ever come across with this and similar products.  I recommend it for anyone who thinks that easy navigation would be nice to have.  Hope to see more products like this!!
5	1339027200	I READ MY BIBLE DAILY, AND I LOVE THE KINDLE VERSION.  I LOVE HAVING IT WITH MEWHEREVER I GO AND WHENEVER I NEED IT.  THANKS TO AMAZON.COM
5	1338336000	Leave it to technology to make the most important things in life easier. I never thought I'd be able to carry an entire legible bible with me wherever I go. And it's so easy to find your way through it. Great job.
5	1338336000	I love this version of the Bible. It is also very easy to read and go to wherever I want in the e book thanks to the kindle.
5	1338336000	The King James bible is so easy to navigate because I can find all my verses faster. I would struggle with a physical book, but this e-book makes it easier to find quotes. I can see much better than reading my normal bible, and it's easier to pick up where I left off.
5	1338336000	This is one of the most friendly Bible I have read so far. In fact the Kindle Edition is so easy to read that even a child could make out of this an enjoyable read.
5	1338336000	I am so glad to find this  book. It is the best bible book for Kindle I have ever owned. It is wonderful to be able to navigate so easily through the bible. I would definitely recommend it.
5	1338336000	This is by far the easiest bible to read on the Kindle. It has excellent navigation giving you more time to read and less time faffing about. 5 stars!
5	1338249600	I had been reading the same bible faithfully for the last decade before I bought my Kindle and purchased this bible. Absolutely the best KJV bible available for the Kindle. Incredibly easy to navigate, and by the far the easiest available for the Kindle. 5 stars.
5	1338249600	This book is awesome and very informative.I am amazed with this book and i would definitely recommend this book to everyone and sure it will be useful for your life.This is my favorite bible available for the Kindle!!!
5	1337644800	This Bible is great for the e-book.  I like the way that it is formatted with the book and verse to the left side of page just as the paper bible is set up.
5	1337385600	This book is true to facts, because it is the written word of God. The word of God can not be disputed. This book is great and easy to use.The Holy Bible, King James Version (KJV) with Search Every Verse Navigation
5	1337385600	While there are free versions available, none of them really had the superior search feature that this one does. IE you want to go to Psalm 23:1. If like me you have a basic Kindle, you hit the "keyboard" button and enter "psa23.1" and it will take you straight there.While this does cost money (I paid $1.69 for it), it is minimal compared to the benefit you will receive.
3	1336608000	Most of this seems to be in order except Colossians 1 Thessalonians 2 Thessalonians 1 Timothy 2 Timothy Titus Philemon Hebrews James 1 Peter 2 Peter 1 John 2 John 3 John Jude Revelation all seem to be missing from the table of contents. I suppose navigating to everything else is simple but getting to these books is going to be an issue. We're talking about 1000's of "Kindle pages" here, have fun with that.
4	1335398400	This eBible has GREAT navigation!! All the chapter numbers are listed at the beginning of each book, so it's easy to choose a book from the table of contents and then go immediately to the chapter you're looking for. And at the end of each chapter is a link to go back to the beginning of the book you're in, so you can go back to where all the chapters are listed and immediately choose a new chapter to go to. And at the beginning of each book is a link to go back to the table of contents where you can choose a different book to open. I'm probably making it sound confusing, but the navigation is really smooth and easy. Better than any other KJV eBible I've seen!I knocked off one star because I noticed one place where a word was different in this eBible from what the actual KJV text has written. It's in Daniel 8:11. This eBible says "THE sanctuary" and the actual KJV text says "HIS sanctuary". This change isn't a big deal at all and it's hardly worth mentioning, but since I found one place where a word was changed I'm just wondering if there are other places where words have been switched as well.Anyway, this eBible is definitely worth buying simply because the navigation is better than most, if not all, the other options out there!
5	1333497600	I was very satisfied with the kindle version of the King James Bible.  It is very readable because it is arranged in paragraphs.  It is amazingly easy to search for a verse by searching either the book,chapter and verse or a phrase.  I have used my kindle to read my Bible.  It would have been worth the price at 10x what I payed for it.
5	1333065600	Awesome.  Best book ever written.  There are answers for every possible question and circumstance.  Even though it was written a long time ago it is still relevant today.
5	1332460800	I love having the bible on my kindle, this way I never lose my place.With this kindle version I can also go directly to a specific chapter or verse.
5	1332288000	This is a wonderful KJV bible I have it one my Kindle Fire and that is what I take to church with me every Sunday. How many of you have a regular bible? And when the pastor is telling you to go to "Matthew 5:8" you are flipping thur the pages but by the time you find it, your pastor has read it and gave you another verse to look up. Well with my e-bible I just click and I am there. And this is a FREE APP so go download it.
5	1330905600	I use this Bible for study and also during church.  It is easy to find scriptures with the table of contents.  I also like that each verse has thefirst few letters of scripture along with the verse number.
5	1330560000	You certainly can't say anything against the author. I know a lot of people try, but I wouldn't want to be in their shoes in the end times.I like being able to search out each and every verse of all 66 books in the bible. I have a very bad memory, so I have to rely on that to look up something.I can no longer quote John 3:16 from memory.Have a good lifeBill
4	1328572800	This isn't extremely easy to navigate, but gets easier as you learn how. I cannot complain as it is free, and I use it regularly.
5	1328486400	I just purchased the Kindle Touch yesterday and I was quite excited to be able to purchase low cost and even free books.  I definitely wanted to have a KJV Bible with quick navigation.  Initially, I just read a few reviews and decided to make the purchase.  However, I found out rather quickly that most of the reviews had navigation tips for "keyboard" Kindles.  It was a bit confusing trying to sort out the navigation on the Kindle Touch because there are no "ALT" keys on the virtual keyboard. With a lot of trial and error (and searching the reviews from customers who were using the Touch version of the Kindle,) I figured out the chapter/verse navigation.  I hope this will save everyone with a Kindle Touch a lot of time with navigation.  The following is a listing on how to navigate to chapters/verses of various types of books in the KJV bible as I have tried it on the Kindle Touch:****To bring up the search bar, just tap the top of the screen once, tap to search and the virtual keyboard appears.  The books you type will NOT need to be case sensitive (Hooray! A great time saver!)so just type away. Hit the enter key on the virtual keyboard. A highlighted portion of the verse will appear. Tap on highlighted area and it takes you to the chapter and/or verse.************1. For these books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiatses, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Galations, Ephesians, Colossians, Titus, Hebrews, James, Jude, Revelationuse the format:  first threee letters of the book, chapter number, ".", verse numberfor example:  Song of Solomon 2:8  would be typed in as  son3.8*** you can also get to just the chapter of any book listed above using this format :first three letters of the book, chapter numberfor example:  Zechariah 3 would be typed in as  zec3Romans 9  would be typed is as  rom92. For the books of the Bible having MULTIPLE books: I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, I Peter, II Peter, I John, II John, III Johnuse the format: parentheses, book number, first TWO letters of the book, chapter number, ".", verse number, parenthesesfor example: II Peter 2:14 would be typed in as  (2pe2.14)I Kings 5:6  would be typed in as  (1ki5.6)*** you can also get to just the chapter of any book listed above using this format :parentheses, book number, first TWO letters of the book, chapter number, parenthsesfor example:  II Thessalonians 3  would be typed in as  (2th3)I Samuel 6  would be typed in as  (1sa6)3. Exceptions:  for the books of Phillipians and Philemon, use the following  format:Phillipians:  phi, chapter number, "." , verse numberfor example: Phillipians 3:18 would be typed as  phi3.18Philemon:  phe, chapter number, ".", verse numberfor example: Philemon 1:22 would be typed as  phe1.22I hope this is helpful!
2	1326672000	totally worthless. cant find nothing. Got this to use at church and it would take me too long to find anything. Got another one that is somewhat usable at church but still looking for a better one.
5	1323820800	After searching around for a decent KJV e-version, I finally decided to try this one out.  A $1.69 price was pretty easy to handle.  Here's my long-winded and detailed analysis.It's very easy to navigate to any book, chapter, and verse by simply starting to type where you want to go to.  You don't even have to have to push the large space bar to bring up the search box at the bottom of the screen.  Just start typing.  Use the first three letters, or number/letter combination of the book, followed by the chapter number, a period, and then the verse number.  Then push the enter button twice.  Why?  See the next paragraph.For example, to go to James 3:3, you just type jam3.3 and push the enter button twice.  Pushing it once takes you to that location page that just highlights the book/chapter/verse number.  You push it the second time to actually go to it.  To go to 1 Kings 2:5, you would type in 1ki2.5 and push enter twice.  Bam, done!  It's that fast.  You can be in a NT book and instantly jump to an OT book in mere seconds, right down to the exact verse.Remember, to short cut to use numbers, just hold down the ALT key while you use the top row of letters to get your numbers.  So Q is 1, W is 2, etc., and P is 0 (zero).Now of course, there is a TOC if you want to use that.  It's very nice because it gives you all the chapters and well as the book names.  Nice.  If you click on the book name, you will be taken to the first page of that book where you'll once again see all of the chapter selections, so you can decide which chapter of the book you want there as well as the TOC.I hope this next paragraph is not confusing.  If I want to see the above-mentioned chapter selection list on the first page of a book, I can get there by skipping the TOC and directly typing in, say, Psalms 1 (psa1 + enter twice).  I end up at the first verse of that chapter.  At the top of the page is only some of the chapter numbers to choose from.  You click the page-back button on the Kindle's side to get to the full chapter selection list.  It's just the way the formatting is set up.  The Kindle shows verse 1 close to the top of the page, so of course not all of the chapter numbers will show up at the top.  So by clicking the page-back button on the Kindle's side, then the page favors the chapter selection list followed by verse 1. Perhaps most people will just go to the TOC directly to select a chapter, but I find it nice to have that same chapter selection list right there at the very beginning of every book just in case you need it.  I think it would have been better if the formatting would have allowed us to simply enter in the first three number/letters of the book title that would then jump directly to the full chapter selection list on the first page of the book. Sorry for the long paragraph.  I hope it wasn't confusing.  In practice, it is very simple.The only exceptions to the three-letter or three-number/letter combination include Philemon, for which you use phe instead of phi, which is used for Philippians.  Also, Jude is jud.  For the little books with only one chapter, you just use the number 1 anyway for chapter.  So Jude 7 is jud1.7 and phe1.9 is used for Philemon 9.  3jo1.3 is used for 3rd John 3.  Easy enough.This e-Bible is not case-sensitive when searching.  For example, you can get to Luke by typing luk, LUK, LuK, lUk, LUk, or lUK.  It doesn't make any difference.This e-Bible is laid out in a sort of paragraph format.  Each verse is NOT separately listed line-by-line.  By paragraphing, many thoughts and subjects in the text are simply kept together for clarity.  In printed Bibles, you may see paragraphing done by indenting or by bolded verse numbers indicating a paragraph beginning, even though all the verses are in a line-by-line setup.  In this version, every verse is identified, but not always on the left of the column.  It's really very pleasing visually.  Just check out the sample.Negatives?  Well, it's not a study Bible, so if you want book intros or other information about the Bible, pictures, concordance, etc., you'll have to find another version to download.  This e-Bible is just the straight Bible text with very complete and easy-to-use navigation.I hope you find this a very nice King James e-Bible.  Thanks for reading my review.  PTL, and enjoy.
1	1323561600	This Bible is defective, in repeated instances the Table of Contents does not work.  For example, 1 Chronicles Chapter 17, Psalms Chapter 10, and these are just the ones from my first day of using this.  I am not very happy, as the description said that this was the best for navigation.  Defective.
4	1322697600	Originally I thought this wasn't going to work with the Kindle Touch. However, you just need to search differently than you do with a Kindle with keyboards. You must type it with parentheses around it. Examples (1Co2.10) (Jam1.3) etc. Seems like this will be a great Bible to use and can look up verses quickly if I wanted to use it in church!
5	1320451200	This Bible is specifically designed for Kindle. It is so quick and easy to look up Bible verses! This sure beats leafing through pages! This is well worth the money! I love it!
5	1320364800	I use this if I need a quick reference in my Bible. At home, work, etc. The Kindle will let you skip to books and chapter on the home page. KJV all the way!
3	1318809600	I wish I had paid more attention to the sample; but this version does not italicize the words that KJ added to the original transcript- so the added words appear like the rest of the text.Otherwise the search engine for this Kindle version is very user friendly.
5	1307923200	The King James translation is a classic one, and despite using old English, it is still very accessible today. I also believe the KJV to be the most poetical of all the translations and is a must read for everyone.As for the Kindle formatting. I can't complain here. The biggest problem with most Kindle bibles is the bad navigation, but this one works very well because it has a very comprehensive and compact table of contents. The smart chapter headings make it a breeze to switch chapters by searching and I can do it faster on the Kindle than I can with a normal Bible.For less than cost of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, I think this easily worth the purchase.
